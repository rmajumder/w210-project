  "<p>It was a soil bacteria course in New Zealand that convinced Reggie Davis to change his farming methods.</p> <p>The fourth-generation Victorian dairy farmer had become increasingly concerned by the costs, chemicals and time involved in the use of nitrate fertilisers to maintain \u2013 what was considered to be \u2013 high-quality pasture for his dairy herd.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always regarded myself as a progressive farmer, open to new ideas,\u201d he says.</p> <p>So when his dairy herd nutritionist mentioned that the US biological farming advocate <a href=\"http://www.farmingsecrets.com/experts/arden-andersen/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr Arden Andersen</a> was running a soil management course in New Zealand, Davis decided to go. He asked around to see if any neighbours might be interested. Within weeks, 40 other dairy farmers from Victoria\u2019s south-west had signed up for Andersen\u2019s course. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/apr/19/crowdfunding-internet-raising-money-farm-finance\">Herdfunding: how the internet is raising money for farms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That collegiate interest in investigating new farming methods is reflected in figures published by the Australian Dairy Industry Council in its <a href=\"http://www.dairyaustralia.com.au/Industry-information/Sustainability/Industry-sustainability.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">annual sustainability performance review</a>.</p> <p>According to the 2015 report, 75% of Australia\u2019s dairy farmers recycle water, 60% have sustainable farm management plans and 45% have invested in biodiversity management and conservation planning.</p> <p>Dairy farmers have also set a national target to reduce industry greenhouse emissions by 30% by 2020, and have already cut emissions by 15% \u2013 largely through energy audits of dairy machinery and farm equipment.</p> <p>The report says dairy farmers want to create \u201ca carbon-confident industry\u201d and various software has been created to help to calculate and reduce farm emissions. These include the <a href=\"http://www.dairyclimatetoolkit.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">dairy climate toolkit</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.piccc.org.au/resource/360\" rel=\"nofollow\">dairy greenhouse abatement strategies calculator</a>.</p> <p>There are some industry leaders. Bega Cheese, one of Australia\u2019s biggest dairy product manufacturers, launched a sustainability program in 2014, which led to a $50m investment in environmental initiatives. The company offers climate change adaptation advice for farmers, supporting programs to plant trees for shade and shelter. </p> <p>Similarly Burra Foods, a dairy processor and exporter in Victoria\u2019s south Gippsland region, has recovered 60m litres of water a year from the evaporating process used to produce powdered milk. It has also cut its town water consumption by 20% and expects to make a further 25% reduction by 2017.</p> <p>There are dozens of similar stories across Australia\u2019s dairy industry, which is the country\u2019s third biggest rural industry after beef and wheat. It\u2019s a $13.8bn industry that employs more than 39,000 people on farms and in manufacturing, and an additional 100,000 in related occupations such as dairy research and veterinary services. So if dairy takes a hard hit, regional economies will certainly feel it.</p> <p>The current dairy crisis is taking its toll. In April the processing giants Murray Goulburn and Fonterra announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/25/barnaby-joyce-announces-dairy-assistance-package-after-cuts-to-milk-price\">cuts to farmgate prices paid to dairy farmers for milk</a>. Murray Goulburn announced the cuts would be retrospective, which meant famers will be forced to pay back about $200m over the next three years. For most farmers, that will average $300,000.</p> <p>Both the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission are investigating Murray Goulburn but many farmers face financial ruin or the possibility of years of debt. It seems a particularly cruel blow for an industry in which the majority of farmers have been prepared to commit to sustainable farming practices.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/apr/15/uk-farmers-to-test-hi-tech-beans-that-could-prevent-food-waste\">UK farmers to test hi-tech beans that could prevent food waste</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Reggie Davis is a good example. One of the reasons he decided to take a closer look at biological farming methods was to avoid using chemical sprays to control pasture pests. He\u2019d noticed the lush growth produced by nitrate fertilisers attracted insects such as red-legged earth mite.</p> <p>These are a devastating pest, and controlling an infestation is costly. As well as the price of sprays, and possibly hiring a professional spray crew, farmers may have to buy supplementary fodder for their cows while the affected pasture is treated. The CSIRO estimates the mites, which were introduced from South Africa in the early 1900s, cost Australia\u2019s farmers more than $500m a year in lost production.</p> <p>The Davis family run 600 Friesian cows on their 570-hectare property near Camperdown in south-west Victoria. They\u2019re one of five farming families in the region who have formed a group called the Green Pastures Movement to practice and promote sustainable farming.</p> <p>The famers worked with a local company, Camperdown Compost, to set up a system of compost rows to turn straw, sawdust and cow manure into natural farm fertiliser. It\u2019s a big operation that requires a heavy-duty mechanical compost turner, towed by a tractor, to periodically turn the compost windrows.</p> <p>The Davis farm produces about 2,000 tonnes of compost each year, and this is applied to pasture in autumn at a rate of about one tonne to the acre (or half a hectare). \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of positive changes with our soil health and our cows,\u201d Davis says. \u201cAnd people tell us that our milk tastes better.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/04/transforming-the-bush-robots-drones-and-cows-that-milk-themselves\">Transforming the bush: robots, drones and cows that milk themselves | Paul Daley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In November 2013, the group of farmers launched their own milk brand, Green Pastures, and negotiated a deal with Coles supermarkets to stock it.</p> <p>The group produces 22m litres of milk annually for the commercial market, and only 1.5m is used for its premium price brand.</p> <p> \u201cIf we could get more sales, that figure would go up, but it\u2019s a hard slog getting the milk on to the shelves,\u201d says Davis.</p> <p>He says the impact of farmgate milk price cuts has been \u201cdevastating, just terrible\u201d for farmers across his region, and has resulted in \u201chundreds of cows being killed as people are forced to destock\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSo the choice that people make when they are buying milk really does matter,\u201d he says.</p>",

Naffa attributed the shift partly to the replacement of the controversial \u201cone-person, one-vote\u201d system with proportional representation, as a result of which women have become \u201can asset\u201d, she said. <br></p> <p>Under the <a href=\"http://iec.jo/sites/default/files/2ParliamentaryElectionLawMay2016EN.docx%20%281%29_0.pdf\">new electoral law</a>, passed last year, Jordan has been divided into 23 districts. Citizens select from competing lists in their constituency and vote for individual candidates from the same ticket. There is a minimum quota of 15 female members of parliament, at least one from each governorate.<br></p> <p>The changes, designed to strengthen political parties and discourage a tradition of voting based on tribal allegiance rather than policy platforms, benefited female candidates on several levels, said Dr Amer Bani Amer, director of Al-Hayat Center, a civil society group that monitors elections through its <a href=\"http://www.hayatcenter.org/programs/accountability-governance-and-participation-%E2%80%93-rased-the-observer/\">RASED programme</a>. </p> <p>\u201cFor the first time, we had a large number of female candidates, [with] men and women running together in partnership,\u201d said Amer. </p> <p>Women appeared in all but six of the 226 party lists, including those of Islamist groups. The increased number of female candidates was accompanied by a vital shift in the perception of women. In the buildup to the election, coalitions anxious to tap into the female vote scrambled to incorporate a woman on their lists. Several all-male groups, slower to recognise the increased advantage of aligning with women, returned after the first day of registration to add a female face.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sign of growing acceptance among the public,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.whoisshe-women.jo/expert-profile/asma-khader\">Asma Khader</a>, a former minister in Jordan\u2019s government and chairwoman of the <a href=\"https://sigi.org/\">Sisterhood is Global Institute</a> (Sigi), which monitored the election from a gender perspective. \u201cPeople are now ready to see women\u2019s names and photographs on political campaign posters around the country.\u201d<br></p> <p>There were still six lists on which the image of the female candidate was conspicuously absent \u2013 replaced by a picture of flowers or animals in deference to conservative sensitivities.<br></p> <p>Elsewhere, a more progressive stance was epitomised by two national lists composed solely of women. \u201cI wanted to make the point that women can match men in politics; that we have a vital role to play in determining this country\u2019s future,\u201d said Dr Noor Zaza, who formed a three-woman list in the country\u2019s capital, Amman. </p> <p>The strong performance of high-profile female MPs in the previous parliament has contributed to a belief in \u201cwomen\u2019s ability to do good\u201d and effect change, said Naffa. While some female MPs have simply been \u201cmouthpieces\u201d for the tribes they represent, a few, such as <a href=\"http://www.jordanpolitics.org/en/lower-house-member/146/wafa-saed-bani-mustafa/2\">Wafa Bani Mustafa</a>, have taken up pressing causes, including the campaign to overturn the notorious Article 308 of the Penal Code, which grants rapists clemency if they marry their victims.<br></p> <p>\u201cMen are not going to raise these issues,\u201d added Naffa, who emphasised the need for more women in the political arena to confront the inequalities women face in Jordan\u2019s justice system.<br></p> <p>A campaign to increase the female quota to 23 seats, in line with the re-division of districts under the new law, failed earlier this year. Across Jordan, the <a href=\"http://www.entikhabat.jo/en/content/2016\">allocation</a> for quota seats remains disproportionate, with competition significantly stiffer in certain governorates.</p> <p>In Amman, Rula al-Hroub, a prominent former MP, lost her seat. A strong voice against corruption and widely known as a fearless critic of the government, al-Hroub made three thwarted attempts to form lists before securing running mates just 24 hours before registration closed.</p> <p>\u201cNone of the men wanted to run with me \u2013 they saw me as a threat to their chances of winning the seat,\u201d she said, claiming that strong female candidates are at a disadvantage under the new system.<br></p> <p>While the new law is \u201ca good step\u201d, the system needs \u201cfurther editing\u201d to place women on an equal footing with men, said Dr Amer, citing the <a href=\"http://www.quotaproject.org/country/tunisia\">example of Tunisia</a>, where lists are required to be gender-equal.<br></p> <p>In terms of female representation in parliament, Jordan still lags behind other countries in the region, ranking 13th in the Arab world and 141st globally, according to research conducted by Sigi.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis is not something that one election can solve,\u201d said Asma Khader, prescribing a \u201clong process of activism\u201d and greater \u201cinvolvement of women in public and political life.\u201d</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>The role of microorganisms in childhood diarrhoea has been greatly underestimated, with pathogens including bacteria, viruses and parasites responsible for almost twice as many cases as previously thought, research shows. </p> <p>A <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)31529-X/fulltext\">study published in the Lancet</a> journal, which involved the analysis of stool samples from more than 10,000 children in countries across Africa and south Asia, found that nearly 78% of cases of diarrhoea were caused by six bugs, an insight that could help tackle the problem, scientists believe.</p> <p>Eric Houpt of the University of Virginia, who co-authored the study, said: \u201cIt really comes down to just a handful of pathogens that are most important. So it is not a hopelessly long list of infections that we can\u2019t do anything about.\u201d</p> <p>Diarrhoea is the second most common cause of death in children under five, after pneumonia, and has been linked to stunted growth. It is believed to be caused by infections that spread between people from contaminated food and water, but it has been difficult to pinpoint the cause of each case.</p> <p>\u201cDiarrhoea in children under five remains an enormous public health problem, with half a million deaths each year or more, mostly in Africa and south Asia,\u201d Houpt said.</p> <p>The research will galvanise scientists to develop new ways to tackle the pathogens responsible for diarrhoea, he said. \u201cMy feeling is that vaccine developments and proper use of antibiotics can lead to a large decrease in childhood diarrhoea over the next 10 to 20 years, if we target these six pathogens, while hopefully economic development trickles along,\u201d Houpt said. </p> <p>Writing in the Lancet, an international team of researchers describe how they reanalysed stool samples collected as part of an earlier multi-year project called the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://medschool.umaryland.edu/GEMS/\">Global Enteric Multicenter Study</a>, which looked at cases of moderate to severe diarrhoea in children under five in seven countries across Africa and south Asia. </p> <p>The initial results, published three years ago, suggested that 51.5% of cases were down to pathogens, with the findings based on a suite of analytical methods, including culturing bacteria. But researchers decided to reanalyse the samples in the light of the recent development of highly sensitive genetic analysis techniques.</p> <p>The latest study analysed samples from 10,608 children, half of whom had diarrhoea and half were unaffected \u201ccontrols\u201d, in an attempt to unpick the proportion of cases caused by bacteria, viruses and other pathogens, focusing on 32 known to be linked to diarrhoea. </p> <p>\u201cThese [techniques] get down to lower amounts. We can tell not only what is there for the 32, but how much is there, so they give a quantitative result as well,\u201d Houpt said.</p> <p>The results show that the influence of pathogens has been underestimated, with 89.3% of childhood diarrhoea cases caused by pathogens. Six pathogens, including rotavirus and Cryptosporidium parasites, were responsible for almost 78% of cases.</p> <p>Nearly 40% of diarrhoeal cases showed evidence of two or more pathogens, suggesting that multiple infections are at play, while even among the apparently healthy children, many were found to have low levels of infection. \u201cWhat happens is if certain infections multiply and replicate in a child\u2019s [gastrointestinal] tract, and you get to a certain threshold, then the child gets diarrhoea,\u201d Houpt said.</p> <p>\u201cBy looking at not just which infections are present, but the quantities that are present, we are able with very high resolution to understand and document the cause of diarrhoea.\u201d</p> <p>Of the six key pathogens identified, only one, rotavirus, currently has a vaccine available, although vaccines for two of the other pathogens, bacteria known as Shigella and ETEC (a type of <em tabindex=\"-1\">E coli</em>), are in the pipeline.</p> <p>Prof Val Curtis, the director of the environmental health group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, welcomed the findings, saying the research has demystified the causes of the condition. \u201cIt is exciting because we are no longer in the dark ages about diarrhoea,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are moving into a new era where we can actually use molecular methods to detect with much more sensitivity the pathogens in stools.</p> <p>\u201cDiarrhoeal disease is not sexy. It sounds unpleasant. It has never been the area that people have really, really wanted to put their effort into. \u2018We need to talk about shit\u2019 is my campaign slogan.\u201d</p>",

The line is that US or western security interests are not at stake in an intractable, far-flung civil war that can more easily be contained than solved. The other is the moral imperative line that Power has repeatedly advocated within the administration.

As Syria turned into hell on earth, the president repeatedly made the case that any intervention would be either futile or dangerous.</p> <p>In tune with the American public\u2019s aversion to military involvement after&#xa0;the disastrous Bush years, his policies have ranged from attempts to negotiate Assad\u2019s physical departure from Syria (a plan dubbed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/30/syria-horror-western-inaction-obama-priority\" title=\"\">Yemeni scenario</a> in 2012) to creating a \u201chub\u201d in Turkey where rebels would be armed and trained (but without anti-tank or anti-aircraft weaponry), and \u2013 once Russia\u2019s military intervention was launched in 2015 \u2013 more intense diplomacy with Moscow.</p> <p>Results have been scant.

Putin has constructed his whole domestic political narrative around the notion that, however much he may be criticised by the west, he has restored Russia\u2019s strength. Nor is Putin much bothered by the crimes of the Assad regime \u2013 his own army carried out similar massacres in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/23/putins-closest-ally-and-his-biggest-liability\" title=\"\">Chechnya</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible Power\u2019s statement was aimed at western public opinion rather than at the autocrats who, time and again, have demonstrated their capacity to order or tolerate untold levels of violence against civilians.</p> <p>As his presidency comes to a close, the fact is that Obama has little to show&#xa0;the world on Syria. With an estimated half a million deaths, the Middle East in flames and European allies destabilised by the impact of refugee flows, he will pass on a festering crisis to his successor.</p> <p>Russia was always going to be a stumbling block, not least because Putin long ago identified Obama\u2019s reluctance to do more \u2013 such as arming the rebels decisively, upholding his self-proclaimed \u201cred line\u201d or setting up a no-fly zone (before Russian intervention made that impossible). There is a long list of missed opportunities that might have forced Assad to the negotiating table.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/22/overnight-airstrikes-rebel-held-aleppo-kill-syrians\">Syria conflict: overnight airstrikes on rebel-held Aleppo kill dozens</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Earlier this year the Atlantic magazine &#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/03/obama-doctrine-quotes-foreign-policy/424281/\" title=\"\">quoted Obama</a> saying of Putin: \u201cThe notion that somehow Russia&#xa0;is in a stronger position now than&#xa0;before he had to deploy military forces to Syria is to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of power in foreign affairs.\u201d Yet today Putin does appear stronger, if only because the US finds itself scrambling to salvage the ceasefire deal without any leverage. Trying to blame and shame Russia over the UN convoy bombing is unlikely to achieve much on its own.</p> <p>A key problem with the ceasefire deal was the plan to set up a US-Russia \u201cjoint implementation centre\u201d to coordinate strikes against Islamic State. This was meant as an incentive, as Putin had long sought&#xa0;to be accepted as a coalition partner alongside the United States. But if implemented, such a coalition could make the US complicit in Russian airstrikes, which have been designed to strengthen Assad. The US would endorse a Russian intervention premised on the notion that there are only two actors in Syria: Assad and the jihadis.</p> <p>Yet as Power pointed out, \u201cthe Syrian government, which bills itself as a fighter against terrorists, allows Isis to grow and grow and grow \u2026 Assad\u2019s antics \u2013 his tactics, his strategy \u2013 have been a gift to terrorists in Syria and well beyond\u201d.</p> <p>By siding with Russia, the US would risk offering another gift to terrorists. Of course, American policymakers were well aware of this, which is why they set&#xa0;preconditions: a partial freezing of the civil war, and safe passage for humanitarian aid deliveries to Aleppo, the armed opposition\u2019s last stronghold. But appealing to Putin\u2019s sense of decency to get Assad to curtail his bombing was always going to be a gamble. Why would Putin seek to please the US once he had become an equal player alongside the sole global power?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/22/overnight-airstrikes-rebel-held-aleppo-kill-syrians\">UN seeks to resume aid convoys to Syria after airstrikes on Aleppo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Obama has been in a hurry to reach a breakthrough on Syria these past few months, because he\u2019s leaving office. Putin certainly isn\u2019t.

With Isis-connected terrorism spreading in many parts of the world and illiberalism growing in Europe on the back of the refugee crisis, Syria has become a security threat well beyond the Middle&#xa0;East. Against that backdrop, geopolitical realism and moral imperatives look less like opposites.</p> <p>Assad is capitalising on the balance of forces Russia has helped create. This in turn \u2013 as Power has said \u2013 will fuel Isis, whose twisted claim is to be the champion of Sunni Muslims. This means more problems lie ahead for the west, and more suffering for the Syrians.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Putin is celebrated by populists around the world for having outmanoeuvred the US by pulling himself up to the ranks of a leader whose cooperation is almost begged for. Russia may be in recession, and its economy the size of Australia\u2019s, but in Syria it has been given a free hand. Whatever one may think of American power and its limits, and however one may choose to gauge Syria\u2019s importance to narrowly defined US national security interests, history will remember that this all happened under Obama\u2019s watch.</p> <p>A former adviser to Bill Clinton once reflected on how the US had failed to prevent massacres in Bosnia: he said that by 1995, \u201cthe issue had become a cancer on our foreign policy and on his administration\u2019s leadership\u201d. For this reason, Clinton in the end ordered targeted strikes on Serbian forces, which forced Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 to the negotiating table. Power, who covered that crisis as a journalist, eloquently told&#xa0;the story in her book.</p> <p>No doubt Syria is a complex, multifaceted war, on a different scale to Bosnia. But the lesson that should still be drawn is that war diplomacy can only succeed if leverage is decisively built up, not just hoped for. If talking to Russia is the only gateway to a peace process in Syria, more than simple persuasion must be brought to bear on it.</p>",

No one knows what effect leaving the EU will have. Britain is the second most popular destination for overseas students: each year more than 70,000 students come from other EU countries, a bit more than 5% of the total undergraduates. Now, they pay the same fees as UK students; after Brexit they will have to pay double, the full international student rate, and they will not be eligible for loans. Universities tell this year\u2019s applicants their funding is guaranteed, but there is no similar guarantee for next year\u2019s intake. That is likely to hit recruitment, just as the fall in 18-year-olds reaches its lowest level. And it is not just numbers: along with undergraduates, postgraduates and postdoc researchers who may be deterred in future, 14% of universities\u2019 research funding comes from EU&#xa0;programmes \u2013 much more in some faculties \u2013 often forming the basis for important research partnerships.

To make sure it steals a march on its competitors, FrankfurtRheinMain GmbH is even setting up an office in London to extoll the virtues of the \u201cfinancial centre of the Eurozone\u201d and home city of the European Central Bank.</p> <p>That\u2019s a measure of the fact that in some ways, Frankfurt was better prepared for Brexit than the UK was. \u201cWe visited London many times in the lead-up to it. The closer it came, the more we said we needed to prepare for this,\u201d Menges recalls.</p> <p>The early-bird attitude, so often the stereotype about Germans, is already yielding results. Nobody has yet pressed the button on a move to Frankfurt, says Menges, but they are certainly casing the joint.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have to prepare their strategy so we get a lot of calls gathering information. We get calls from law firms saying, \u2018We have a client who requires information.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, the upside for Frankfurt will depend on which version of Brexit the UK eventually opts for, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/22/switzerland-votes-for-compromise-to-preserve-relations-with-eu\">freedom of movement</a> for EU workers and the single market the key issues. \u201cOne would assume that the harder the exit, the bigger the opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>Dublin and Paris haven\u2019t hit the ground at quite the same sprinting pace as Frankfurt, but are also keen to show off their credentials to London bankers.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a realisation we can\u2019t win all the business, no city can,\u201d said a spokesperson for the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. \u201cBut Dublin has some fantastic attributes that will help it pick up some business from Brexit.

Arnaud Bresson, managing director of Paris-Europlace, said: \u201cThe big advantage of Paris compared to Frankfurt is that it is much more a business centre for the international banks and Paris is much more capital market-minded, closer to London.\u201d</p> <p>He points out that Paris is also taking concrete measures, setting up a \u201cwelcome office\u201d in the city to help new arrivals fit in and tweaking the rules of \u201cinpatriate status\u201d \u2013 France\u2019s answer to non-dom status \u2013 by extending tax advantages for high-earners from five years to eight years.</p> <p>France\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Valls, also insists that Paris can be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/06/france-strong-bid-banking-business-poised-to-leave-london-paris-brexit-manuel-valls\">\u201cfinancial capital of the future\u201d</a>.<br></p> <p>Perhaps.

The briefing states:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cAttempts to achieve sustainability in this difficult environment are also being undermined by the restrictive practices imposed by the most powerful online platforms and by the rise of adblocking outfits, who in their own way are part of the scramble to generate ad revenues from content to which they have made no contribution.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>And the publishers also raise a wider concern about \u201cthe impact on media plurality and the functioning of democracy.\u201d Every day, it says, \u201cthe UK\u2019s newspapers \u2013 digital and print - can be counted on to provide the subject matter of the country\u2019s democratic conversation. </p> <p>\u201cHowever, they can only survive if the relationship between rewards for producing journalism is commensurate with costs.\u201d</p> <p>The document states: \u201cThe value chain of digital news has become wildly out of step with the contribution that each player makes and that this is not sustainable.\u201d</p> <p>The briefing was sent to Baroness Neville-Rolfe, the minister for energy and intellectual property, who had requested a summary of issues facing the industry.

  "<p>The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has thrown his weight behind the fledgling market in green investments to help cut carbon emissions and boost global economic growth. Carney<a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2016/923.aspx\"> used a speech in Berlin </a>on Thursday to highlight green finance as an opportunity to boost financial stability while also tackling climate change. </p> <p>He said more of the $100 tn (\u00a376tn) held by big global investment firms could be channelled into green bonds to help finance initiatives such as water or renewable power projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions. Last year, $42bn of green bonds were sold worldwide. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/15/bank-of-england-leaves-interest-rates-unchanged\">Carney made no reference to the Bank\u2019s stance on UK interest rates</a>, which were cut to a record low last month to shore up the post-referendum economy. He did, however, discuss the global picture of low interest rates and how more investment in green technologies and projects to cut emissions could help raise them.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe Bank of England has long stressed that central bank policies are not the cause of low rates, but responses to them. We are actors in a play written by others,\u201d Carney said.</p> <p>That was because the level at which interest rates must ultimately settle to ensure steady inflation \u2013 the \u201cequilibrium\u201d interest rate \u2013 was determined by fundamental factors driving savings and investment in the global economy, he said. Those factors included technology, demographics and inequality. </p> <p>Reprising his recent comments and those of other central bankers, Carney stressed that monetary policy alone could not address the world\u2019s economic problems.</p> <p>\u201cLong-run prosperity was never in the gift of monetary policymakers. As the 10th anniversary of the start of the crisis approaches, a consensus is growing that escaping this low-growth low-inflation trap will require a rebalancing between monetary, fiscal and structural policies,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>Carney voiced his support for structural reforms that encourage more private investment. He welcomed the Paris agreement on cutting carbon emissions and limiting the rise in global average temperatures, and called for a comprehensive climate policy framework within which companies would have enough information and certainty to make green investments. </p> <p>He conceded that to make green finance more mainstream would require \u201ca sweeping reallocation of resources and a technological revolution\u201d, but also saw potential benefits for global interest rates.</p> <p>\u201cThe International Energy Agency estimates that globally as much as \u20ac45tn [\u00a339tn] of investment in total could be needed in power supply and end-use efficiency to meet the two-degree target agreed in Paris.</p> <p>\u201cChina alone is likely to require around \u20ac500bn a year from 2016 to 2020 to finance its national environmental goals. A substantial proportion of this is likely to be raised offshore, absorbing excess global savings, helping to push up global equilibrium interest rates and ultimately increasing global growth.\u201d</p> <p>He called on the German government to take action when it assumes the presidency of the G20 group of countries next year.</p> <p>\u201cThe upcoming German presidency of the G20 now has a historic chance to mainstream climate finance and turn risk into opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe G20 \u2013 whose members account for around 85% of global emissions \u2013 has a unique responsibility. The German presidency could be decisive.\u201d </p>",
  "<p></p> <p>Hopes that large amounts of planet-warming carbon dioxide could be buried in soils appear to be grossly misplaced, with new research finding that the ground will soak up far less carbon over the coming century than previously thought.</p> <p>Radiocarbon dating of soils, when combined with previous models of carbon uptake, has shown the widely assumed potential for carbon sequestration to combat climate change has been overestimated by as much as 40%. </p> <p>Scientists from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) found that models used by the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assume a much faster cycling of carbon through soils than is actually the case. Data taken from 157 soil samples taken from around the world show the average age of soil carbon is more than six times older than previously thought.</p> <p>This means it will take hundreds or even thousands of years for soils to soak up large amounts of the extra CO2 pumped into the atmosphere by human activity \u2013 far too long to be relied upon as a way to help the world avoid dangerous global warming this century. </p> <p>\u201cA substantial amount of the greenhouse gas that we thought was being taken up and stored in the soil is actually going to stay in the atmosphere,\u201d said study co-author Steven Allison, UCI associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and Earth system science. </p> <p>Soil is the largest land-based reservoir of carbon on Earth, absorbing it from trees and vegetation as they die and decay. The IPCC calculated that should the mass deforestation of recent centuries be completely reversed, around <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/100.htm#box32\">40 parts per million (ppm) of CO2</a>, from the current 400ppm levels, could be removed from the atmosphere. Other studies have shown large amounts of carbon <a href=\"https://ccafs.cgiar.org/blog/new-study-estimates-mitigation-potential-soil-carbon-sequestration#.V-K-bZMrLBI\">could be soaked up</a> with changes in agricultural practices.</p> <p>But the University of California work, <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aad4273\">published in the journal Science</a>, went beyond the models to explicitly date radiocarbons, one of the two carbon isotopes. </p> <p>\u201cIt will take a very long time for soil to soak up the carbon, there is a timescale mismatch in terms of climate change,\u201d said Yujie He, a UCI postdoctoral scholar and lead author of the study. \u201cThe soil will eventually be a large carbon sink, but it won\u2019t be present in the next century.\u201d</p> <p>Nations have agreed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/21/paris-climate-agreement-poised-to-come-into-force\">limit global temperature increase to 2C</a> compared to pre-industrial times, in order to prevent a dangerous shift in the climate that will lead to more heatwaves, extreme weather and ruinous sea level rise as glaciers melt and seawater expands. </p> <p>An international aspiration to cap the rise to 1.5C, seen as crucial to the viability of low-lying nations, <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-only-five-years-left-before-one-point-five-c-budget-is-blown \">already appears to be slipping out of reach</a>. As-yet undeveloped technology, such as geo-engineering of landscapes, carbon capture from power plants or direct removal of CO2 from the atmosphere, may be required even if emissions are radically cut.</p> <p>But the prospect of adapting soils so they suck up more carbon is \u201cunlikely\u201d, especially in the short-term, according to He. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can increase that absorption ability, so we may want to make more proactive action to mitigate climate change, such as cuts to fossil fuel emissions, for example,\u201d she said.</p>",

Its banking sector holds too many nonperforming loans and public debt remains high. </p> </blockquote> <p>On the state finances the IMF said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With low growth and low investment but high sovereign debt, what Portugal needs at this point is a cumulative fiscal consolidation of 1 percent of GDP over two years. This would offset the fiscal loosening of 2015 and what the IMF staff projects for this year.</p> </blockquote> <p>As for structural reforms, the IMF said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The economy had favorable tailwinds for a while, with low interest rates, a weak euro, and low oil prices, but the effect of that has washed out fairly quickly. </p> <p>Now some of the structural bottlenecks need to be removed to raise potential growth.</p> </blockquote> <p>It said the country\u2019s energy costs and unemployment level, especially among the young, were both too high:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Portugal has to rejig its labor market, which is currently characterized by a combination of onerous and rigid permanent contracts and flexible but precarious temporary contracts. The way to do so is to make permanent contracts more flexible while improving the benefits available for those on temporary contracts, so that the two kinds of contracts converge. The goal is to bridge the gap, ensuring that there is a fair labor market for all, which boosts incentives for employment creation.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c138f2ec1d553e07c4c6bc03d3b5ecbde59c179\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c138f2ec1d553e07c4c6bc03d3b5ecbde59c179/0_173_5381_3229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portugal\u2019s energy costs too high\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portugal\u2019s energy costs too high</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-22T14:31:10.136Z\">at 3.31pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e3e6f0e4b041e3124fb9b1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-22T14:17:27.107Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone consumer confidence edges higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over to the eurozone, and consumer sentiment edged higher in September despite the continuing concerns over Brexit.</p> <p>The European Commission said the initial estimate of its consumer confidence indicator came in at -8.2 points from -8.5 points in August, in line with expectations.

It\u2019s holding up a funhouse mirror to society.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2c929b766ec60a5169052dd47b7df1ba92d9e29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2c929b766ec60a5169052dd47b7df1ba92d9e29/0_0_926_509/500.jpg\" alt=\"Seven tombs of gloom: a screengrab from Doomocracy\u2019s Kickstarter campaign.\" width=\"500\" height=\"275\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seven tombs of gloom: a screengrab from Doomocracy\u2019s Kickstarter campaign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reyes and Nato hope to offer about 400-500 people a night a ghastly, dramatic interactive trip that takes in gun nuts, genetically modified crops, climate change, deadly fast-food chains and, looming over Doomocracy\u2019s entrance, a chimeric effigy that\u2019s part Statue of Liberty, part Trojan Horse, and, in Reyes\u2019 view, entirely the embodiment of American foreign policy. \u201cThe USA doesn\u2019t have true representation,\u201d he argues, \u201cand yet they say they\u2019re exporting democracy around the world.\u201d</p> <p>That may all sound as satirical as it is scary. Nevertheless the artist \u2013 who has previously staged a fine-art version of <a href=\"http://camstl.org/about-pedro-reyes-and-sanatorium/\">a psychiatric sanatorium at different galleries around the world</a> and overseen <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/01/25/265794611/artist-transforms-guns-to-make-music-literally\">a programme to repurpose firearms as musical instruments</a> \u2013 is deeply serious in his examination of fear within today\u2019s political landscape.</p> <p>\u201cThese days, politicians are trying to create fear in order to take power,\u201d Reyes says, \u201cso it\u2019s quite an experiment to be dealing with the production of fear and its political uses.\u201d</p> <p>He is also highly respectful of the funhouse trope, partly because it is so familiar to people who might not necessarily be avid gallery goers.</p> <p>\u201cPretty much everyone can picture a horror house,\u201d he says. \u201cIt will, if you forgive the paradox, deal with political issues in a very democratic way. Everyone can engage with the form.\u201d</p> <p>Reyes and Thompson are keen to ensure Doomocracy keeps pace with events and have been writing and rewriting the dramatic scenarios to reflect the changing nature of the electoral race.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been workshopping the scripts today,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cIt\u2019s a fluid process. The ground is moving fast this election, it\u2019s hard to keep up.\u201d</p> <p>Reyes, who visited both commercial haunted houses and guerrilla theatre groups in preparation for the show, also says Doomocracy reflects a general hopelessness within contemporary politics, both in the US and elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do people vote against their own interests?\u201d Reyes says. \u201cIs it that we have brainwashed people to make the wrong decisions? There\u2019s a feeling in the US that it\u2019s a downer to have to choose between the [presidential] options. But it\u2019s elsewhere too; it can be said of Mexico and many other places around the world. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> was almost like a democratic, rightwing coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\u201d</p> <p>Despite this gloomy view, Doomocracy is still able to engage with some of the norms of campaign fundraising. Its <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2026016011/doomocracy-a-haunted-house-with-pedro-reyes-and-cr\">Kickstarter page</a> looks set to reach its goal of $80,000 by its deadline of 29 September, offering suitably doom-laden swag for its pledgers, including Doomocracy pennants and buttons, and \u201cYes We Can\u2019t\u201d bumper stickers.</p> <p>With all this left-leaning pessimism, Reyes\u2019 haunted house looks unlikely to attract many Trump voters. However, Creative Time\u2019s executive director, Katie Hollander, argues that the work doesn\u2019t favour either side. \u201cIt\u2019s not a commentary on the candidates, more a commentary on the issues,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Indeed, Reyes hopes to take in wider political issues unlikely to be addressed by either party this election year. \u201cIt will deal with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/27/-sp-americas-mental-health-care-system-crisis\">mental health</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/feb/03/us-war-on-drugs-impact-in-latin-american\">excessive criminalisation of drug use</a>, and the increasing role of the medical industry as a kind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jun/20/healthcare-drugspolicy\">white-collar drug dealer</a>,\u201d the artist says. \u201cThere\u2019ll be stuff on the food industry too, and equity or the lack of social mobility \u2013 those universal issues, that are experienced in every part of the world.\u201d</p> <p>While this all may sound nihilistic, Reyes hopes Doomocracy could be liberating too. \u201cUsually my art is more about hope, but on this occasion it is a dark project, and offers more of a space for catharsis,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter all, Halloween is a moment to go crazy. That is the role of carnival.\u201d</p> <p>Yet, does he genuinely expect Doomocracy to actually change any visitors\u2019 minds about the issues examined? Won\u2019t most already agree with his position on, say, pharmaceuticals and gun crime?</p> <p>\u201cThere will be people who love it, people who hate it, people who feel empowered, and people who feel offended,\u201d says Reyes. \u201cMaking art is one way to elaborate and engage with reality.\u201d</p> <p>And this autumn, at a time when truth seems if not stranger, then at least as spooky as fiction, one route for meaningful political engagement appears to lie through Doomocracy\u2019s funhouse doors.</p>",
  "<p>When a cable or streaming show is widely lauded for innovation, it\u2019s a fair bet that broadcast network imitators won\u2019t be far behind: for every Mad Men, the TV development process will produce three derivative Pan Ams. Fall 2016 has taken that trend to its natural conclusion, revivifying the corpses of old film and TV franchises and turning them into the least-wanted zombies since Fear the Walking Dead. </p> <p>TV is no stranger to adaptation, of course, from Syfy\u2019s The Magicians to FX\u2019s Fargo but the biggest shock of the fall is that these shows aren\u2019t half bad. Take Fox\u2019s The Exorcist, a pilot that takes the viewer\u2019s uneasy feelings about an Exorcist TV show and incorporates them into its generally effective mood of discomfort and creeping horror. Like the little-watched, uninspired Omen series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/mar/08/lucifer-damien-a-and-e-tv-devil\">Damien</a>, The Exorcist takes its cues from the idea of legacy, rather than a straight-up reboot, The Exorcist is a sequel of sorts. (Series protagonist Father Tomas, ably played by Sense8\u2019s Alfonso Herrera, encounters news clippings describing the events of the film.) But where Damien is almost entirely about its relationship to The Omen and suffers accordingly, The Exorcist uses its forebear to establish the ground rules of its world without too much fanfare: there are demons here, and it will cost something to send them away.</p> <p>The notion of cost is anathema to Fox\u2019s other surprisingly successful adaptation of a beloved film: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/21/lethal-weapon-remake-loud-ludicrous-loveable\">Lethal Weapon</a>. Against all odds, this show is incredibly endearing, and even if it\u2019s not going to make many hardcore fans, it still seems likely to prove consistently entertaining. Lethal Weapon, for all its obvious stupidity (and it\u2019s pretty obvious \u2013 in the pilot alone, Murtaugh and Riggs foil a bank robbery with pizza, blow up a car, and practically skip chasing mobsters around a shady warehouse), is very fun, like something that would have been on USA before the gloominess of Mr Robot. Beyond the fun, easy chemistry between Clayne Crawford\u2019s demented Riggs and Damon Wayans\u2019 not-yet-too-old-for-this-shit Murtaugh, Lethal Weapon is good because it\u2019s a loving self parody: these characters don\u2019t have the fate of the world in their hands, they just want to goof around and solve some crimes.</p> <p>CBS\u2019s reboot of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jul/07/macgyver-all-american-hero-assassin\">MacGyver</a> is, in some places, shooting for the same vibe as Lethal Weapon, particularly in the helpful pieces of text that show up to label things like \u201celectronics\u201d that Angus needs to use to construct gadgets. Sadly, MacGyver is atrociously bad, a disaster that is all the more tragic for how uninteresting it is. There are several moments of attempted updates to the premise (including extremely poor attempts to integrate a disjointed group of operatives into the global security apparatus), but MacGyver remains steadfastly traditional in its revolting attitude toward women, first appearing to fridge a character before turning her into the demonic embodiment of womanly charms.</p> <p>MacGyver\u2019s casual male chauvinism is worth noting primarily because it\u2019s basically the only thing about the show that raises an interesting question about the current crop of TV remakes. What does it mean to repurpose an older property that was designed to exist in a cultural moment that was far less aware of the ghosts of sexism, racism and all other forms of systemic injustice haunting writers\u2019 rooms \u2013 especially now, when a TV show\u2019s expression of values comes, almost inevitably, under <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/19/unbreakable-kimmy-schmidt-pc-culture-tina-fey-south-park\">intense scrutiny</a>?</p> <p>The Exorcist and Lethal Weapon succeed, in large part, by actively ignoring these questions \u2013 or, more specifically, explicitly creating a space where they don\u2019t need to be asked. The pleasures of each show are visceral and generic, almost by design. Herrera is charmingly naive as Father Tomas, and though Ben Daniels doesn\u2019t get a ton to do as the tortured older priest Father Marcus, the two have enough chemistry to suggest that watching them fight demons will, in fact, be fun. Likewise, Lethal Weapon\u2019s new Murtaugh and Riggs exist purely to please an audience, bouncing off their captain, played by Kevin Rahm (Mad Men\u2019s Ted Chaough). </p> <p>The falsest notes in these series are, unsurprisingly, the ones that feel the most like network notes on an \u201cupdated\u201d version of a beloved property: Murtaugh has an Apple watch that tracks his heart rate, and he and Riggs deploy goofy detective methods that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in the \u201czoom and enhance\u201d lab on CSI. But they exist as purely cosmetic changes, allowing The Exorcist and Lethal Weapon to understand what made their originals successful (disturbing horror and a strong buddy cop dynamic, respectively). The important thing for this kind of remake, then, is \u2013 surprise! \u2013 basic storytelling, and a good storyteller knows how to avoid distracting the audience with, say, bland characters and unnecessary sexism. Even in 2016, narrative competence is the ultimate Lethal Weapon.</p>",
  "<p>Eight of the world\u2019s top industrialised nations lowered their corporation tax rates last year or announced plans to do so, according to a leading thinktank.</p> <p>In the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/tax-policy-reform-in-the-oecd-2016_9789264260399-en\">annual report on tax changes around the world</a>, published on Thursday, the thinktank said Japan, Spain, Israel, Norway and Estonia had all lowered their tax rates for corporate profits in 2015.

He has repeatedly boasted of giving the UK the most competitive corporation tax rate of any G20 nation.</p> <p>Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, OECD tax experts insisted world leaders were increasingly aware of concerns that aggressive tax competition was leading to wider income and wealth inequality. </p> <p>\u201cIn the past, a very big focus of tax policy has been on achieving revenue collection \u2026 supporting [GDP] growth,\u201d said David Bradbury, the thinktank\u2019s head of tax policy and statistics. <br></p> <p>\u201cPeople have often left the question of income inequality \u2013 redistribution \u2013 to other levers of policy, particularly government spending. But tax policy has a critical role to play also in addressing those important questions of inequality.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this month, leaders attending the G20 summit in Hangzhou asked the OECD and the International Monetary Fund to explore ways of using tax reforms to better foster GDP growth while at the same time curbing income and wealth inequalities.</p> <p>While progressive taxes rates for personal and corporate income are in decline in many countries, OECD experts said there were other options for governments to explore. These include wealth taxes and measures to closing tax breaks on mortgage expenditure and pension contributions \u2013 incentives that largely benefit better-off individuals.<br></p> <p>More broadly, the OECD said that industrialised nations wishing to increase tax revenue could do much more to tax property and carbon-heavy fuels such as coal. \u201cThe potential to raise revenues in an efficient way through property taxes, especially through recurrent taxes on residential property, is not being fully exploited,\u201d the report concluded, although it found the highest property taxes were in the UK.</p> <p>Meanwhile, OECD figures showed that countries were failing to align those taxes that have an impact on the environment with international ambitions to move to a low-carbon economy. In particular, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/20/switch-to-low-carbon-transport-could-save-uk-billions\">road transport was heavily taxed despite the fact that other sectors make up 85% of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThe potential for harnessing the power of taxes as environmental policy instruments is large,\u201d the report said, noting that there were currently \u201cparticularly low taxes on some of the most environmentally harmful fuels, notably coal\u201d.</p>",

Those who stay with their parents still face family separation, in that they are held with their mother and have limited visits during the day with their father. </p> <p>The figures in the report probably underestimate the scale of the issue, said Muscati, as the data mostly reflects children who are formally detained. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have an accurate number or idea of how many children are informally detained.\u201d</p> <p>Those detained hail from around the world with children from sub-Saharan Africa making up the largest group, at 23% of the children detained.

For those who are held informally with their parents, the average length of the detention stretches to nearly 30 days. \u201cBecause under the law they\u2019re invisible, their interests aren\u2019t identified and represented,\u201d said Muscati. \u201cSo they actually languish in these facilities for longer periods of time than formally detained children.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb82298697c714a08d2c9ef6e287a29557a7dfc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb82298697c714a08d2c9ef6e287a29557a7dfc4/0_98_2843_1705/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Across the country, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) has the power to detain non-citizens deemed to be a flight risk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most children are held in medium-security immigration holding centres. But a small number have wound up in correctional facilities or police stations across the country. </p> <p>The report also flagged what Muscati called \u201ca whole other, really horrible scenario\u201d, referring to findings on the use of solitary confinement for two, unaccompanied 16-year-old boys. One of them \u2013 a Syrian boy who had attempted to claim refugee status after entering Canada from the US \u2013 was left in isolation for three weeks. Loath to put the young males in the women\u2019s section and worried that they may be at risk in the men\u2019s section, authorities chose to place them in solitary confinement. </p> <p>Even just a few days in detention can cause serious and long-lasting psychological harm to children. Studies have shown children who are detained experience increased symptoms of post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression, and are more likely to contemplate suicide. These symptoms often persist long after the children are released. </p> <p>As less than 2% of those detained are considered a threat to public safety, the report highlights alternatives, such as those used in Sweden and Hong Kong, which allow children to reside with their families in the community through the use of reporting obligations, financial deposits and guarantees, or electronic monitoring. </p> <p>Responding to the report, the CBSA said it was aware of the issue and said \u201ctangible steps\u201d are in the works to address the situation. The agency said it has been working to \u201creset the immigration detention program\u201d to increase the use of alternatives and eliminate the detention of minors, except in the most limited and exceptional circumstances.</p> <p>The agency falls under the portfolio of Canada\u2019s public safety ministry. In a statement to the Guardian, the office of Ralph Goodale, Canada\u2019s public safety minister, noted that the minister has been clear about wanting to try to avoid housing children in detention facilities, \u201cas much as humanly possible.\u201d</p> <p>The agency plans to expand alternatives to detention and will begin publishing statistics on immigration detention in the near future. \u201cAs well, additional mental health training for staff at Immigration Holding Centres has already begun.\u201d <br></p> <p>Their efforts were noted by those behind the report, who said that recent months have seen a decline in the number of children taken into custody. </p> <p>\u201cAfter years of silence and inaction, the Canadian government and CBSA are taking serious steps that will hopefully bring us closer to ending child detention and family separation,\u201d said Hanna Gros, one of the report\u2019s co-authors. \u201cBut Ottawa needs to move quickly and deliberately to end the needless suffering of children and their parents.\u201d</p>",

This enigmatic image inspired the Beatles to create Apple Corps (in a pun that would have pleased Magritte, it\u2019s pronounced \u201capple core\u201d) and <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/craigsilver/2013/12/05/how-a-magritte-painting-lead-to-apple-computer/#439fa1e6d7f3\">indirectly gave Apple computers their name</a> when Steve Jobs copied the Beatles.</p> <p>While Ono\u2019s art \u2013 or Martin Creed\u2019s, or Ai Weiwei\u2019s \u2013 is provocative and good fun, this kind of art (let\u2019s call it conceptual as a shorthand) often stops at questions about art itself. \u201cIs it art?\u201d is not that deep a question \u2013 yet it\u2019s the one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/sep/03/martin-creed-lights-on-off\">Creed\u2019s room, with the lights going on and off</a> keeps us asking. Magritte does not make anyone ask that question. We accept his paintings are art. They are paintings, aren\u2019t they? They even have nice frames. Yup, that looks like art alright.</p> <p>They are also nicely painted, in an almost pedantic way. Not for him the radical prising apart of appearances pioneered by cubism before the first world war or the strange techniques with which his fellow surrealist <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/ernst-dadaville-t03707\">Max Ernst</a> attempted to tap into the unconscious roots of art. Magritte paints with a sincere amateur\u2019s pedantry and a belief in the perspective tradition that would please the most conservative connoisseur.</p> <p>Except it all goes wrong, somehow. His 1928 painting <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/magritte-man-with-a-newspaper-t00680\">Man with a Newspaper</a>, which hangs in Tate Modern, depicts exactly what it says in the title. A man in a starched collar and businesslike clothes sits reading his paper next to an iron stove in a neat room looking out on a blue sky over green fields. It is all very normal \u2013 even banal. But this scene only fills the top left section of a picture divided into four. In the other three panels everything is identical \u2013 except for one absence: the man is not there. His chair is exactly where it was. The stove is the same, the table, the picture on the wall, the view out of the window \u2013 all utterly identical. But there is no man.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bdbb3192ccc982bc5fdb0960c2d88d4493adb654\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdbb3192ccc982bc5fdb0960c2d88d4493adb654/0_0_5976_3992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Pompidou museum\u2019s Magritte exhibition, The Treason of Images.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Pompidou museum\u2019s Magritte exhibition, The Treason of Images.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Bureau/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What does it mean?

Nor are the sentimental values we often bring to art of any use. A contemporary installation in which someone vanished might well be interpreted as a work of \u201cmourning\u201d, an image of loss and death: but we instinctively know this painting is not mournful or sad.

More could be at risk as a result of the Brexit vote, Beale said \u2013 nearly \u00a33bn, or 11% of Lloyd\u2019s premiums, comes from continental Europe.</p> <p>She described the fallout from the Brexit vote as a \u201cmajor issue for us to deal with\u201d, one of the biggest challenges faced by Lloyd\u2019s in its history. But the group will keep its London base. \u201cThis has been our home for 328 years and it will remain our headquarters.\u201d</p> <p>Lloyd\u2019s is lobbying the government to maintain passporting rights for the organisation and its 97 syndicates. </p> <p>It is a market where insurers do business via brokers.

  "<p>Richard Sherman, the Seattle Seahawks cornerback, says \u201cpeople are missing the point\u201d of Colin Kaepernick\u2019s national anthem protest, as NFL players continue to wrestle with the debate that has made headlines around the league over the past few weeks.</p> <p>Sherman, who declined to take questions at a news conference on Wednesday, said the protest\u2019s aim was to bring people together to forge a better America, and that critics were mistaken if they thought Kaepernick and others were being unpatriotic. \u201cThe reason these guys are kneeling, the reason we\u2019re locking arms, is to bring people together to make people aware that this is not right. It\u2019s not right for people to get killed in the street,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhen a guy takes a knee, you can ignore it, you can say he\u2019s not being patriotic, he\u2019s not honoring the flag. I\u2019m doing none of those things. I\u2019m saying it straight up: this is wrong, and we need to do something.\u201d</p> <p>More NFL players spoke about the protests on Wednesday. Miami Dolphins safety Michael Thomas and linebacker Jelani Jenkins said they had received death threats on social media following their protest, but that they were committed to push for better race relations.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s great a lot of people in our community, including our law enforcement, have the mindset of yes, there is something wrong,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cSomething needs to change, and we\u2019re just looking for solutions and working together to find them.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas, Jenkins, Arian Foster and Kenny Stills knelt together during the anthem at the Dolphins\u2019 opener.

More than a dozen police officers were injured during the protest. There also was vandalism.</p> <p>Newton said that while he doesn\u2019t see things through a \u201cblack-white lens,\u201d he does realize that people view him as a spokesman for black people because of his stature in the NFL.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m an African American and I\u2019m not happy how the justice has been dealt with over the years, and the state of oppression in our community, but we also as black people have to do right by ourselves,\u201d Newton said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be hypocrites.\u201d</p> <p>Newton went on to say: \u201cFrom being a black person, there is a lot of black people that don\u2019t do right by black people, so you can\u2019t be a hypocrite and just say \u2018Oh a white man or a white police officer killed a black man.\u2019 Now that\u2019s still messed up and I\u2019m not sitting up here and saying that\u2019s OK.</p> <p>\u201cI am saying we have to have a clear eye vision on both sides and starts with everyone holding each other accountable and policing yourselves.\u201d</p> <p>Newton is unsure if his teammates plan to join Kaepernick in a silent protest before Carolina\u2019s home Sunday against Minnesota. He did praise Kaepernick\u2019s stance, which includes calling for responsible parties to be held accountable.</p> <p>\u201cI salute Colin Kaepernick for what he stands for, but at the end of day I can make a stand in my own right,\u201d Newton said. \u201cThat is why I have a foundation and I have been trying to do anything and everything to bring the city of Charlotte, or wherever I am around, and impact it in a positive way.

  "<p>The commissioner of the Metropolitan police has said that the force should have been more sensitive about the introduction of spit hoods, after plans to use them in London were met with an outcry. </p> <p>However, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe told the London assembly\u2019s police and crime committee that he did not think that the use of the hoods, already in place across 18 British police forces and approved by the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, was particularly contentious. </p> <p>Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, earlier this month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/06/met-police-pause-plan-to-introduce-spit-hoods\">ordered a pause in the plan to introduce the use of spit hoods</a> in the capital\u2019s custody suites, which had been approved by the Met without his knowledge.<br></p> <p>Responding to questions as to whether there ought to have been more engagement with the public, Hogan-Howe said: \u201cProbably we should have been more sensitive to what you\u2019ve described and we take that on the chin and accept it. </p> <p>\u201cThe dilemma that we have is we have significant number of officers bitten or spit at each year.

  "<p>Claudia Rankine, whose award-winning poetry collection Citizen explores the stories of black Americans encountering everyday racism, has been awarded a MacArthur \u201cgenius grant\u201d worth $625,000 (\u00a3475,000).</p> <p>Praised as \u201ca critical voice in current conversations about racial violence\u201d, Rankine is one of 23 people chosen by the MacArthur Foundation as a 2016 fellow. The fellowships come with a stipend of $625,000, paid out over the next five years, and are intended to allow the recipients to \u201cexercise their own creative instincts for the benefit of human society\u201d.</p> <p>In an interview with the MacArthur foundation, Rankine said that Citizen \u201cbegan as a response to events happening in American culture\u201d, with the first piece written immediately after Hurricane Katrina. \u201cI recorded all of the CNN coverage and was fascinated by how racism coloured the reporting. After that, I began to respond to events that caught the public imagination \u2013 mostly things like police shooting of unarmed black men and other pieces of blatant injustice that clearly were tied to racism,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Rankine told <a href=\"http://time.com/4503473/claudia-rankine-MacArthur-fellow\">Time magazine</a> that she intended to use the grant to set up a \u201cRacial Imaginary Institute\u201d, which would enable creative thinkers \u201cto come together in a kind of laboratory environment to talk about the making of art and culture and \u2026 the dismantling of white dominance\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat seemed, before the MacArthur, like this thing that we wanted to do but which seemed more abstract, suddenly has come more into focus,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we know is that for many white people, black people are coupled with criminality in their imagination. That\u2019s an equation for the white imagination. And they can\u2019t get beyond it. And part of the reason I believe they can\u2019t get beyond it is because they don\u2019t see the construction of it. I think we are in need of an institute that does the work of investigating and bringing forward those things that have been made absent or erased inside the culture around white dominance.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/29/poet-claudia-rankine-invisibility-black-women-everyday-racism-citizen\">Poet Claudia Rankine: \u2018The invisibility of black women is astounding\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alongside a sculptor and a human rights lawyer, a microbiologist and a jewellery maker, the MacArthur Foundation also chose the writer Maggie Nelson to be a recipient of its grant this year.

At just 31, the Princeton-educated Jacobs-Jenkins has made a name for himself as an inventive, fresh theatre writer. Two of his works tied for Obie Awards for Best American Play and his play An Octoroon was a finalist for The Edward M Kennedy Prize for Drama Inspired by American History. His works include Neighbors, in which a family of minstrels in blackface moves in next to a contemporary mixed-race family, Appropriate, where a white family discovers its racist past, and Gloria, about a group of catty editorial assistants at a Manhattan magazine whose lives change completely one random day.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/03/branden-jacobs-jenkins-an-octoroon-interview\">Branden Jacobs-Jenkins: 'theatre is about controversial ideas'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>MacArthur president Julia Stasch said the 23 \u201cextraordinary individuals\u201d chosen by the foundation \u201cgive us ample reason for hope \u2026 while our communities, our nation and our world face both historic and emerging challenges\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey are breaking new ground in areas of public concern, in the arts, and in the sciences, often in unexpected ways.

There have been 89 since the May elections and 31 seats have changed hands. Here are the figures.</p> <p><strong>Conservatives:</strong> Net loss of 5 (Gained 5, lost 10)<br></p> <p><strong>Labour: </strong>Net loss of 6 (Gained 4, lost 10)</p> <p><strong>Lib Dems: </strong>Net gain of 14</p> <p><strong>Ukip: </strong>Net loss of 2</p> <p><strong>Greens:</strong> Net gain of 1</p> <p><strong>SNP: </strong>Net loss of 1</p> <p><strong>Prof Tony Travers,</strong> the LSE local government expert, told the programme that the results were \u201cabysmal\u201d for Labour.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The results for Labour are frankly abysmal for the main opposition party at this point of a parliament. The Conservatives, in one way or another, have now been in power for six years. Their results are not that bad. The Lib Dems are making some progress, and in a number of byelections significant progress. But for the main opposition party in England to be losing seats net is pretty bad.</p> </blockquote> <p>Travers also said the Lib Dems were doing very well in some seats.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They are not doing that well in the opinion polls, but they are doing surprisingly well, or certainly surprisingly, compared to the 2015 general election debacle at the local level. Not in every seat, but in a number of seats, and particularly against Labour, it must be said. They are getting swings of 10, 20 even 30% from one party to the other. So I think they can realistically say, although these are straws in the wind, that there are some straws.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if the Lib Dem local council byelection performance provided the basis for a fightback, Travers said it was \u201cthe basis for a basis\u201d. In the past the Lib Dems had won parliamentary seats by building up their strength at council level, he said.

Corbyn has filled the leader\u2019s office with people strongly committed to his brand of politics, but most staff at Labour HQ are not seen as committed Corbynistas.</p> <p>Staff working for the party are represented by GMB and Unite and their convenors, Jim Harvey and Tim Waters, wrote to Corbyn on Monday this week asking him to \u201cpledge your support for unionised Labour Party workers\u201d.

Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Mann accuses Owen Smith of running a terrible campaign against Jeremy Corbyn.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Wrong man, wrong time, wrong policies. Owen Smith\u2019s leadership campaigned boiled down to one key message: I am not him. Never has a Labour leadership candidate hit so many bum notes in one campaign. Yet it was so predictable.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mann also claims that Smith was plotting a leadership challenge at the start of the year. \u201cI was approached at the beginning of 2016 by a senior figure promoting his candidature,\u201d Mann writes. This appears to contradict Smith\u2019s claim that he only decided to run against Corbyn when Angela Eagle launched a leadership challenge, although it is possible that Smith was planning a leadership challenge at the start of the year expecting it to happen much later. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/19/corbyn-labour-leadership-says-huge-turnout-at-his-rallies-shows-he-can-win-an-election-politics-live?page=with:block-57dfd77be4b09322c33b7c4a#block-57dfd77be4b09322c33b7c4a\">He told the Guardian recently that Corbyn should have been given longer before being challenged.</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>He describes Corbyn as \u201cthe ultimate Westminster insider\u201d and says his real weakness is his \u201cstatism\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The real weakness of Jeremy\u2019s politics is its statism. Jeremy is for the state, preferably run by people like him, doing good things for people. The antidote to this is for a party that embraces the enabling state, where people are empowered to take responsibility themselves and markets are free and open. The mirror opposite of Venezuela in other words.</p> <p>Those whose experience of life is that of the special advisor have never, in their own bubble, succeeded in comprehending this and it lends further credence to Jeremy who can pose as the outsider. However, it\u2019s also Jeremy\u2019s big dilemma, for he knows that he is the ultimate Westminster insider and has been as uncomfortable embracing a real diversity of views and experiences as his opponents have been.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Mann says Labour is out of touch with the working class.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Labour loves staying inside its comfort zone, battling for irrelevant positions, talking to itself, sympathising with those living in poverty, articulating outrage. But it is terrified of the working class because it might say things they don\u2019t want to hear.</p> </blockquote> <p>A leave supporter, Mann also says he does not accept the claim that most Labour voters backed remain in the EU referendum.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When Jeremy, citing one poll by Lord Ashcroft, wrongly claims that two thirds of Labour voters supported Remain, his supporters and opponents gleefully nod in harmony. Nothing unites Labour more than false comfort about the electorate.</p> <p>Any mathematician can quickly work out that in fact Labour areas were the strongest to vote Leave and any well organised party, sampling ballot boxes, will know that in Labour areas it was the Tory voters who tended to vote Remain and it was large blocks of Labour trade unionists who voted Leave.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He tips Chuka Umunna, Dan Jarvis and Lisa Nandy as potential future leaders.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The next contest will probably be after the next election. Whatever he says now, Jeremy will not stay on if he loses. Only three current MPs have the potential to embrace this wider world. Chuka Umunna, if he can tame his Euro fanaticism; Dan Jarvis, if he can stop acting as a traditional politician; and Lisa Nandy, if she can stay in touch with her constituents.

It then fashions an explanation: that the compromise is based on bad motives. It then develops a theory: that the trajectory of our country has been unchanged by Labour government since the Thatcher years. It then creates a new version of history: there is no difference between Labour and Tory governments.

The Commons is in recess, and the main political parties are getting ready for their party conferences. Labour\u2019s starts at the weekend and, to mark it, the New Statesman has published a special edition, leading with <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/09/new-times-david-miliband-why-left-needs-move-forward-not-back\">an article by <strong>David Miliband,</strong> the former Labour foreign secretary,</a> despairing at what has happened to his party. Like the Ode to Autumn (which an academic on Today said was partially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/jan/11/isnttoautumnaboutautumn\">influenced by the aftermath of the Peterloo massacre)</a>, Miliband\u2019s article laments loss. But, unlike the Ode, it\u2019s not great poetry, and it\u2019s much more specific.</p> <p>Miliband makes the routine claim (for people from his wing of the party) that Jeremy Corbyn is \u201cunelectable\u201d, but he gives the argument a new twist. Rather than claiming that Corbyn\u2019s policy objectives are fine, but that Corbyn is just the wrong person to be able to implement them (which broadly was Owen Smith\u2019s argument in the leadership contest, with some exceptions), Miliband says that Corbyn has the wrong policies.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The party has ended up pre-New Labour in policy and culture, when we need to be post-New Labour. This year\u2019s leadership election has spent a lot of time debating how to \u201cbring back\u201d various lost icons, such as nationalised railways, rather than focusing on new ideas for the future. </p> <p>The main charge against Jeremy Corbyn is not just that his strategy is undesirable because it makes the party unelectable. That is only half the story. The real issue is that his strategy makes the party unelectable because it is in many aspects undesirable.</p> <p>This is true most egregiously with regard to foreign policy. The half-hearted message about Europe is a betrayal of millions of working people. The equivocation on Nato in the face of Russia\u2019s intimidation of nations in her former sphere of influence is dangerous and throws away progressive values.</p> <p>But the electorate can see through the domestic policy, too. Nationalisation cannot be the answer to everything; anti-austerity speeches cannot explain everything; corporate taxation cannot pay for everything. It doesn\u2019t add up. It wouldn\u2019t work.

  "<p>Food, clothing, electrical goods, energy \u2013 everything we consume has a hidden water footprint. So how can businesses cut water consumption and reduce the footprints of their products?</p> <p>We brought together six experts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/live/2016/aug/18/companies-cut-water-footprint-supply-chain-drought-live-chat\">debate the question</a>. Here\u2019s what we learned.</p> <h2>1 Recognise the value of water</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[There] is a lack of appreciation of the value of water \u2013 or it is taken for granted \u2013 and the scarce resource is then being wasted.</p> </blockquote> <p>When this happens, says Andr\u00e9 Fourie, head of water security and environmental value at SABMiller, it leads to an underinvestment in water infrastructure and services, especially those dealing with wastewater and pollution.</p> <h2>2 Measure it</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you don\u2019t measure, you can\u2019t manage.</p> </blockquote> <p>This point was made by Dexter Galvin, head of the supply chain programme at CDP. Galvin admits it may sound obvious, but the basics of water accounting \u2013 from withdrawals, to usage, to discharge \u2013 are key for companies. </p> <p>While water auditing and monitoring are essential first steps when identifying water use, it\u2019s vital to distinguish between direct and indirect water use. Direct water use can be simply and efficiently measured in-house. Indirect water usage is harder since it extends beyond the company fences.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/13/water-global-shortages-gdp-agriculture-factories-textiles-investors\">How can we better value water as global shortages start to threaten economies?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The experts recommend using existing tools to help with this, such as <a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/rippleffect\" rel=\"nofollow\">the WRAP Rippleffect programme</a>. In addition, Galvin says the very process of gathering data from suppliers, through a global standard like CDP, leads to better management.</p> <h2>3 Engage suppliers on water management</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Getting farmers engaged was key for our Spanish strawberry project. Without their involvement we had nothing \u2013 no access to data and no farms to trial new practices. </p> </blockquote> <p>These are the words of Jessica Sansom, head of sustainability at Innocent Drinks. The company\u2019s app helped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/27/innocent-drinks-app-helps-spain-strawberry-farmers-slash-water-use\">Spain\u2019s strawberry farmers slash their water</a> use by up to 40%. </p> <p>Sansom says they started with a small group of farmers before scaling up the project once they had more conclusive evidence that it worked. It was crucial that Innocent addressed the wider impact of water reduction on the strawberry farmers\u2019 livelihoods, which meant they had to consider how to reduce water consumption in a way that was low cost, and that also retained the same yields and quality. </p> <p>The panel also discussed financial incentives and educational support as other ways to help engage suppliers. </p> <h2>4 Use new technology</h2> <p>Aaron Burton, the director of projects and programmes at Waterwise, predicts that adopting new technologies will be key to helping companies reduce water consumption: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>smart metering and big data can help organisations from SMEs to large corporations better understand and manage water use.</p> </blockquote> <p>Water companies can play a role in trialling and demonstrating innovative technologies, says Burton. For example, a Thames Water <a href=\"http://http//www.watefnetwork.co.uk/files/default/resources/Conference2016/Session_Four/48-TUCKER.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">trial</a> (pdf) at its offices in Reading saw the company replace its duel-flush toilets, taps and urinals with water efficient equivalents, enabling an 83% reduction in water use. The company calculated that were all the bathrooms in the office block refurbished in the same way, it could save 4.8m litres of water and \u00a39,950 in water costs per year. </p> <h2>5 Ensure internal buy-in</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unless the top level management in any business sees the business case to act, it is not going to happen.</p> </blockquote> <p>Understanding water related risk is key to ensuring internal buy-in, says Ashok Chapagain, science director of the Water Footprint Network. </p> <p>There are three kinds: the physical risk of not getting the quality or quantity of water required for current operations or for future expansion; the regulatory risk arising from changes in legislation in the region; and the reputational risk arising from not managing water use responsibly.</p> <h2>6 Collaborate</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A collaborative approach is key.</p> </blockquote> <p>A company can take steps to reduce its water use in a specific watershed, says Eliza Roberts, manager of the water programme of Ceres, but if it doesn\u2019t work collaboratively with other companies and stakeholders then it may not succeed in mitigating the risks it is exposed to in that watershed</p> <p>Sansom agrees: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Partnership is absolutely key.

It simply tightens controls on the documentation of ivory for sale, however no mechanisms could ever ensure that such controls were met and enforced for every single piece of ivory sold in the UK. As long as a legal ivory trade is allowed to continue, illegal ivory will find its way on to the market \u2013 and the scourge of poaching will continue.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe are dismayed that the government has chosen this route rather than announcing a complete ban and demonstrating the kind of leadership so urgently needed for a global ban on ivory,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, who announced the ban on UK sales of post-1947 ivory items, said on Wednesday: \u201cElephants are some of our world\u2019s most iconic animals and it will take truly global action to stop the insidious criminals who selfishly prosper from the ivory trade. This [UK] ban will send the message that the ivory trade is a thing of the past.\u201d It was already illegal in the UK to trade in raw tusks or unworked ivory of any age.</p> <p>A coalition of conservation groups, including the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), Tusk, Environmental Investigation Agency, Wildlife Conservation Society and WildAid, have also criticised the new restrictions on the UK ivory trade as inadequate.</p> <p>\u201cThe announcement is welcome but falls short of what is needed,\u201d said the groups in a joint statement. \u201cBy focusing on \u2018modern day ivory\u2019, the government has overlooked the huge problem of worked ivory dated prior to 1947, which makes up the vast majority of the market. The government must recognise that a near-total ban would be the most effective step the UK can take to protect the future of elephants. Failure to do so will mean the UK neither meets its international commitments nor represents public opinion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaintaining domestic ivory markets helps fuel the illegal killing of thousands of elephants,\u201d said Prof Jonathan Baillie, director of conservation programmes at the ZSL. The US implemented a ban on ivory sales in July, following France\u2019s in April, while China, the major market for ivory, has imposed a three-year ban on ivory imports.</p> <p>In a statement to be read at Saturday\u2019s marches, the foreign secretary Boris Johnson, said: \u201cThe elephant is perhaps the single greatest glory of the animal kingdom.

Half a million square metres was added, the equivalent of building almost five new universities. </p> <p>There is no sign that this trend is slowing down: universities in London are eyeing up prime building plots across the capital, and centres of learning in northern England, the south-west and the east are developing and expanding.</p> <p>Swansea University formally opened the first part of its <a href=\"http://www.swansea.ac.uk/campus-development/baycampus/\">Bay campus</a> this summer, built on an old petrol storage site. The area needed extensive decontamination, but its attractions will include direct access to a beach and a seafront promenade.</p> <p>Over in west Wales, Aberystwyth University\u2019s \u00a3100m <a href=\"https://www.aber.ac.uk/edocker/?pub=21\">building programme</a> includes redeveloping an old college on the seafront, to which there are plans to add exhibition spaces and artists\u2019 studios. </p> <p>The Welsh developments, however, are dwarfed by the estimated \u00a31bn being spent by Cambridge University to finance the construction of what is in effect a <a href=\"http://www.nwcambridge.co.uk/\">new suburb</a> two miles north-west of the city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1946cb404cae0578f6eebcbfbd2a0eb46f6b26a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1946cb404cae0578f6eebcbfbd2a0eb46f6b26a/49_190_3390_2034/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An aerial view of Cambridge University\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Extensive building work is under way at Cambridge University, in effect creating a new suburb just outside the city.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Ansell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Encompassing 1,500 new homes for university staff and a further 1,500 houses for private sale, as well as accommodation for 2,000 postgraduates, the development includes a state primary school, run by the university\u2019s education faculty.

Part of the reason for having the extra funds is simply because many universities have got bigger, and have more students.</p> <p>Bath University, which is also undertaking extensive building work, insists that universities are not splashing the cash because they have huge amounts of extra funds due to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jul/20/english-universities-to-raise-tuition-fees-for-first-time-since-they-trebled\">tuition fee rises</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-22T14:06:55/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-22T14:06:55/embed.html\">Graphic</a> </figure>  <p>In a Q&amp;A on its website, the <a href=\"http:// http://www.bath.ac.uk/students/finance/tuition-fees/how-we-spend/index.html\">university argues</a>: \u201cThe way universities are funded has changed. Under the old system, the university received much more of its money from the taxpayer, via grants from the Higher Education Funding Council. </p> <p>\u201cThe university would receive grants for teaching and buildings. Prior to the introduction of the higher tuition fee, this grant has been reduced each year, so the university has swapped one source of income for another.\u201d</p> <p>While it is true that direct grants have been cut as tuition fees increased, the combined income from both sources for universities was nearly \u00a33bn more in 2014-15 than in 2010-11. And there are many more students on campus requiring accommodation and facilities: nearly 100,000 more fulltime undergraduates last year than four years earlier.<br> </p> <p>What it means is that universities such as Birmingham feel the need to compete more than ever. </p> <p>Trevor Payne, the director of estates at Birmingham University, said: \u201cWe need to invest in the staff and student experience if we\u2019re going to attract the best of the best.</p> <p>\u201cPeople make choices based on many things. One of the things people say about our university is that they love the campus. The fact that it\u2019s self-contained, has green space and is seven minutes from the centre of Birmingham, with our own railway station, are all draws. They can envisage what experience they\u2019ll get on on top of the academic one.\u201d </p> <p>As well as the sports centre and library, the university has recently opened a 21-storey <a href=\"http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/university/building/residences.aspx\">hall of residence</a>, which includes self-contained studios as well as study bedrooms, and a Tex-Mex restaurant. The campus is already leafy, but work on a <a href=\"http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/university/building/green-heart.aspx\">\u201cgreen heart\u201d</a>, with al fresco space for performances, socialising, meeting and working, is beginning.</p> <p>Payne was talking in the foyer of another new building, the \u00a316m <a href=\"http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/bramall/index.aspx\">Bramall Music Building</a>, while the City of Birmingham <a href=\"https://cbso.co.uk/\">Symphony Orchestra</a> rehearsed upstairs. \u201cIt\u2019s only right to expect that if people are paying that sort of money [tuition fees], they are getting value,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to see investment. We can demonstrate here we are investing in our infrastructure, facilities.\u201d </p> <h2>Are students getting a good deal? </h2> <p>Gabriella Marcucci, a third-year English language student, said: \u201cSometimes I do think that \u00a39,000 from lots of students is probably going on the building work. I think there could be more money spent on helping us with the everyday costs that we have to incur.</p> <p>\u201cBut I guess the building work in turn is benefiting me. I\u2019d probably be more annoyed if I hadn\u2019t got to experience the library opening or got to see any of the new facilities at all.\u201d</p>",

Between 2005 and 2015, no fewer than 3,604 women were killed in the state of Mexico, where Ecatepec is located. It\u2019s an alarming trend \u2013 yet each individual murder is just another statistic that barely gets mentioned in the capital\u2019s biggest newspapers.</p> <p>Not formally part of Mexico City, Ecatepec is a residential area that has grown in fits and bursts. A generation of people from the countryside came to settle here in the 1980s and 90s, trying to carve a niche for themselves on the fringe of Mexico\u2019s rapidly transforming, globalised economy.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66360feec6dda01418fd07722231d41d5fcdc263\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66360feec6dda01418fd07722231d41d5fcdc263/123_80_3137_1883/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man hangs up a banner showing photographs of missing and dead women in Ecatepec.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man hangs a banner showing photographs of missing and dead women in Ecatepec.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Romero/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The streets surrounding the venue hosting Luz and her friends tonight are a shabby agglomeration of dull-grey cinderblock buildings, most of which were improvised one storey at a time. In contrast, the rappers look like fireworks of fluorescent pink and purple, their gold watches and neon attire shimmering over the sea of cement. </p> <p>With the bass beat thumping, Luz psyches herself up for her performance. She eyes a cadre of teenagers in t-shirts holding plastic cups of beer and Buchanan\u2019s whisky (the local favourite), who form a semi-circle in front of the small, second-storey stage. The crowd is young and riled up. In the back corner, a few scruffy men cut up lines of cocaine on a cell-phone. Inside the cement-block walls, the thumping music creates a warm refuge from the world outside.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was proud of Ecatepec.

As she steps out to join her three rapper friends in the centre of the second-floor stage, Alix Toxik (Luz\u2019s skinny, ebullient group-mate) grabs the microphone and shouts: \u201cLadies In Tha Hood in the <em>casa</em>!\u201d<br></p> <p>Alix\u2019s beet-red hair and gold chains dance as if they are pulsating with an electric current. Then Luz steps out towards the edge of the stage and shouts: \u201cIn Mexico there are a lot of <em>femicidios</em> so this song is called For My Girls.\u201d</p> <p>As a manic, minimalist beat streams out of the DJ\u2019s speakers, Maya La Insana, Luz\u2019s heavyset partner in rhyme, bobs her head and unleashes a rapid-fire volley of lyrics: \u201cI don\u2019t deal with fiction, just the truth. We listen and we stay quiet. It\u2019s better to run your mouth \u2026 Where are the people who want to criticise me? [The people] who want to finish me off?\u201d <br></p> <p>In the crowd, a menacing, broad-shouldered man in black clothes and sun-glasses holds up his smart phone to take video, while a group of teenage boys rises from their refuge along the cement wall to watch the performance.<br></p> <p>To the side of the stage, Luz and Alix dance frenetically to the energetic beat, jumping up to rap in unison for the song\u2019s chorus: \u201cI still help my girls in the street; I still help my girls on the stage!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8ea03b50d3ef4131f98b766acda6ab9c526ab5f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ea03b50d3ef4131f98b766acda6ab9c526ab5f1/0_0_3100_1860/1000.jpg\" alt=\"High heel shoes are seen in front of a cross outside the Municipal Palace of Ecatepec during a protest against femicides.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">High heel shoes are seen in front of a cross outside the Municipal Palace of Ecatepec during a protest against the murders of women.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even with a few technical difficulties, the show is a welcome respite from what has been a difficult period in Ecatepec. A few weeks earlier, an entire family was dismembered and stuffed into bags in the railyard that runs through the neighbourhood. In another incident, two policemen were killed during their lunch break.</p> <p>For 20 years, though, rap has helped Luz process the world around her. She first heard about it as a teen in the early 1990s. Her friends\u2019 families came from different parts of Mexico, so hip-hop became the common chord that tied them together.</p> <p>****</p> <p>Ecatepec exploded as a byproduct of Mexico\u2019s shift from a corrupt, state-led development strategy based on protectionism and nepotism to the current paradigm of neoliberal economic policy and export promotion. Subsidies that had supported small-time agriculture were dismantled, so poor, rural residents flooded down from the mountains into the valley in Mexico City.</p> <p>As Mexico\u2019s economy dipped into crisis and nearly collapsed, the newcomers found themselves in a precarious position. Families built small shacks using found materials and the neighbourhood expanded up into the hills. In 1995 Mexico\u2019s economy imploded, leaving hundreds of thousands of workers competing for jobs in the informal economy \u2013 hawking sodas at stoplights, selling tacos from carts or working as foot soldiers in Mexico City\u2019s expanding criminal enterprises. As kidnappings surged to unprecedented levels and every day was marked by multiple homicides, it became known as the world\u2019s most dangerous city.</p> <p>In this environment, Luz and her friends learned to navigate the streets, shopping for hip-hop cassettes at open-air markets called <em>tianguis</em> and finding solace in the bravado of early-90s gangster rap. Cypress Hill were Luz\u2019s favourite group; the lyrics helped her take ownership over a difficult environment.</p> <p><em>Where I\u2019m from, the [guns] be smoking / I\u2019ll be damned if you think I\u2019m jokin\u2019 / Know that I\u2019ll come with the static, erratic, .45 automatic</em>. It\u2019s is a Cypress Hill verse that was written about LA, but also reflected the mentality in Ecatepec. Luz was inspired; she started penning her own raps to Cypress Hill beats, but tried to find a way to forge her own version. \u201cWe\u2019re not <em>chicanas</em> [Mexican-Americans],\u201d she explains.</p> <p>As the decades passed, families have replaced cardboard and sheet metal with sturdy cement bricks and added multiple storeys to their homes. In a parallel trend, Mexico City has seen a boom of real-estate investment and a new wave of renovation. Now the city centre is filled with the hulking skeletons of new skyscrapers, and upper-middle class neighbourhoods are enjoying a surge of new construction and rehabilitation.</p> <p>As infrastructure and security have improved, Mexico City has become recognised as a major hub of cultural activity. The New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/07/travel/places-to-visit.html?_r=0\">named the capital</a> as the top place to visit in 2016. </p> <p>The situation on the periphery of the city, however, is less stable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de1087b6eb6d9d35656f26f2dd10525a60d4b4b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de1087b6eb6d9d35656f26f2dd10525a60d4b4b5/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luz Reality stands next to graffiti on the outskirts of Mexico City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luz Reality stands next to graffiti on the outskirts of Mexico City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathaniel Parish Flannery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNow in the parks there are drug addicts, robberies,\u201d Luz explains. \u201cMost people go to Mexico City to work; they don\u2019t work here.\u201d</p> <p> The US Chamber of Commerce in Mexico ranks Ecatepec as the second most challenging security environment for businesses in the country. According to this analysis, the suburb trails only Reynosa, Tamaulipas \u2013 the border city that serves as a base for the notorious Zeta cartel \u2013 in terms of security problems.</p> <p>Ecatepec has evolved since the early 90s, but in many ways it hasn\u2019t improved. \u201cEven though there are malls now, they don\u2019t help. It\u2019s ugly and violent, and is no place to raise kids,\u201d Luz says. <br></p> <p>\u201cI was proud of Ecatepec. [But now,] if I had the chance to leave, I would. I don\u2019t see a future here,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>After 7pm you don\u2019t go out.

To work you have to go to Mexico City or find self-employment selling things at the markets,\u201d she says.<br></p> <p>After she saw a female colleague get kidnapped, Luz left a job teaching kindergarten for a post at a small stationery store near the main plaza. While she has friends who have found jobs in IT and marketing departments in the steel and glass skyscrapers downtown, Luz herself \u2013 like nearly 60% of the women in Ecaptepec \u2013 works in the sprawling, informal economy, in a job that doesn\u2019t include benefits.</p> <p>Ecatepec is now home to 1.6 million people, more than half of whom live below the poverty line. Too many aspects of life here still feel improvised and incomplete. There may police patrols on the wide throughways, but on the side streets security is scarce.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f025b4494b85af32953c53c0d830bcc00cd06584\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f025b4494b85af32953c53c0d830bcc00cd06584/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luz pulls on a pair of headphones while recording a rap video in the main plaza in Ecatepec.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luz pulls on a pair of headphones while recording a rap video in the main plaza in Ecatepec.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathaniel Parish Flannery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few weeks after the concert, Luz meets up with bandmates Alix and Maya at a pizza place. The women have broken their self-imposed curfew to have a celebratory dinner to mark the end of a successful day recording a video.</p> <p>In the afternoon, they revel in the activity in the bustling square, rapping to the camera in the golden afternoon light. The plaza brings together old men who have spent decades working in the fields with young parents taking their toddlers to watch the clowns, with teens on BMX bikes and skateboards. As is the case in small towns in the mountains, Ecatepec\u2019s main plaza is the centre of community life: \u201cIt\u2019s representative of Ecaptec\u2019s culture. You\u2019ve got the skaters, the rappers, the B-boys,\u201d Luz explains.</p> <p>As night sets in, Luz and her band-mates bounce in front of big graffiti murals down the street from Luz\u2019s house, using a friend\u2019s car headlights to illuminate the last few shots of the day. With the camera off, the swagger subsides quickly.<br></p> <p>The pizza restaurant\u2019s windows and doors are made of heavy steel bars that look strong enough to stop a truck from crashing through. Although a few people gather at a nearby taco restaurant and a food truck still stands down the road, mostly the streets are empty.</p> <p></p> <p>Luz ties Ecatepec\u2019s hip-hop culture to the <em>cholo</em> culture popularised by Mexican-Americans in early-90s California, Cypress Hill among them. She and the rest of her generation are still wedded to these traditions of DJing, rapping, graffiti art, and breakdancing. </p> <p>But she fears the neighbourhood\u2019s younger generation is more tuned in rapping as a form of aggression \u2013 notably in rap battles \u2013 and, worse, as an ancillary activity to drug dealing. The younger rappers are less interested in painting murals or organising dance competitions and far keener to embrace criminal culture. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ed905213a4b0bcab81c02fe390b17f5bad0ccac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ed905213a4b0bcab81c02fe390b17f5bad0ccac/0_346_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A grey graffiti mural in the Ecatepec naighbourhood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A grey graffiti mural in the Ecatepec neighbourhood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathaniel Parish Flannery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Waiting for her pizza to arrive, Luz explains: \u201cWhat I want is young people to know me. I think there are fewer rappers, fewer graffiti artists now.\u201d She sees her neighbourhood\u2019s <em>cholo</em> culture fading away. \u201cIt\u2019s dying,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The hard-edged bravado of the new generation may be more in tune with the current reality of Ecatepec, where drug gangs recruit teens and local mob bosses have turned the neighbourhood into a depot for the retail narco trade. The crime wave has overrun the local police and created a new environment of violence and impunity.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s changed a lot. Before it was safe, now it\u2019s the most dangerous municipality in Mexico state. It\u2019s the worst place in Mexico for <em>femicidios</em>,\u201d Luz explains. On 7 August, the body of a young woman was found near a canal in the nearby town of Zumpango. The victim had been raped and tortured. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of gender-based violence. I think it\u2019s getting worse,\u201d Luz says.<br></p> <p>****</p> <p>The pizza parlour is empty and playing loud <em>banda</em> music, but Alix, usually so exuberant, lowers her voice: \u201cAs a woman, when I have to go to the R\u00edo de los Remedios neighbourhood, I\u2019m scared. I have <em>amigas</em> who live there. They say that girls coming out of the subway there get kidnapped and taken away in cars. They disappear.\u201d</p> <p>The subway stop is next to a highway and few tarp-covered stands selling bootleg CDs. From the stairs that lead down from the train tracks, visitors can see a long expanse of cement buildings and only a few patches of green in the distance.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt takes a lot of risk to go on the road,\u201d says Luz softly. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken a lot of women.\u201d </p> <p>The attacks on women have been well documented by the local tabloids. In December 2015, police discovered the body of a 20-year-old, raped, and beaten to death in an empty lot in Ecatepec. In March, 2016 one of Ecatepec\u2019s own police officers fled town after torturing and killing his own girlfriend.<br></p> <p>Taking a moment to cut and serve slices of pizza, Luz says: \u201cI think it\u2019s worse than ever.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6fa087b3f1a1c8b3aad1cd03b6cd5c5bb7c3cf9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fa087b3f1a1c8b3aad1cd03b6cd5c5bb7c3cf9b/0_43_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An activist wearing rubbish bags and rope, to replicate the way many female murder victims are found, takes part in a protest on the banks of the Remedios River, where corpses regularly wash up.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An activist wearing rubbish bags and rope, to replicate the way female murder victims are found, takes part in a protest on the banks of the Remedios River, where corpses often wash up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathaniel Parish Flannery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She lives in a gated community with a guard who watches through a heavy metal gate. Inside, residents have built fences to separate their houses from the street, some girded with razor wire. Outside of her neighbourhood, Luz feels unsafe: \u201cAfter 7pm you don\u2019t go out. Not in car, walking, or in taxi,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can go to the supermarket and the taxi driver will rob you.\u201d</p> <p>Her brother was carjacked right in front of the security post at the entrance to her neighbourhood. \u201cThey put a gun on him and took everything he had, even his gum,\u201d Luz explains.<br></p> <p>But she continues to grind, penning lyrics and recording videos. One of her new songs, I\u2019m Still On My Feet, sums up her attitude. Over a bouncing, bass-driven beat she raps: \u201cAfter everything I\u2019ve been through, I\u2019m still on my feet. I don\u2019t let myself get beaten.\u201d</p> <p>She tries to stay positive but the situation in Ecatepec is heart-breaking: \u201c[Now] it\u2019s worse. There are more<em> femicidios</em> than Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, more kidnappings.\u201d.</p> <p>In some cases, the violence is meted out by partners and ex-partners. In others it\u2019s organised crime, kidnapping women to force them to work in the sex trade.

It\u2019s like hearing Delta Airlines say, on a day when four separate airplanes crash, that all the rest of their planes landed safely. </p> <p>When asked whether the bank had reported the events to the SEC and to investors, Stumpf noted that the $2.6m in refunds paid to holders of the fake accounts wasn\u2019t a material sum. Investors might join senators in disagreeing. Since the news of the fake accounts broke, more than $25bn has been wiped off the value of Wells Fargo\u2019s stock; shareholders have taken a 10% haircut. </p> <h2>Obliviousness</h2> <p>Senator David Vitter of Louisiana nailed the magnitude of this deadly sin when he asked Stumpf whether it was normal \u201cfor 1% of a business unit to be fired over fraud\u201d and for this never to be \u201cmentioned to you\u201d. Stumpf should have been chasing down just what was amiss at the retail banking operations as soon as headlines popped up in the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-wells-fargo-sale-pressure-20131222-story.html\">Los Angeles Times in 2013,</a> or as soon as the bank had to lay off employees for fraud, whichever grabbed his wavering attention first. But he appears to have been oblivious to what was happening. He mentioned talking at Wells Fargo \u201ctown hall meetings\u201d, but he clearly wasn\u2019t doing much listening. If he had, perhaps employees wouldn\u2019t have felt the need to become whistleblowers.</p> <h2>Hubris</h2> <p>Oh, my, Stumpf is proud of the Wells Fargo culture and its history. And how he despises those evil people who despoiled it. \u201cThey broke our code of ethics. They were dishonest.\u201d And he says he doesn\u2019t understand what motivated them. Repeatedly, senators from both sides of the aisle tried to get Stumpf to grasp the fact that there\u2019s something more significant afoot here than a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of the company\u2019s culture, and that is the fact that the culture may have been designed in such a way as to betray the company\u2019s customers. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the work of 5,300 bad apples. This is the work of sowing seeds that rotted the entire orchard,\u201d said Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey. \u201cYou and your senior executives created an environment in which this culture of deception and deceit thrived.\u201d Do you get it now, Mr Stumpf?</p> <h2>Scapegoating</h2> <p>How many bad apples were there, and how many employees felt pushed into committing fraud by their bosses and office culture? Is Stumpf treating those who were laid off as scapegoats? That\u2019s a point that many senators returned to repeatedly. \u201cThis is a combination of low wages, punishing sales quotas and a grossly misaligned compensation incentive,\u201d argued Menendez. Reminding Stumpf of his testimony that the average Wells Fargo banker earns \u201cgood money\u201d, between $30,000 and $60,000 a year, the senator asked what Mr Stumpf made in 2015. \u201c$19.5 million.\u201d \u201cNow, that\u2019s good money,\u201d Menendez replied. When asked to put himself in the shoes of someone earning only $30,000 a year, and threatened with losing their job, all that Stumpf could say, weakly, was that \u201cthe vast majority loved Wells Fargo\u201d. When asked whether he\u2019d seek out those who resigned or were fired for not meeting quotas because they behaved ethically, and compensate them, Stumpf had no reply.</p> <h2>Greed</h2> <p>The grand prize for stomping on Stumpf goes to Warren. Not only did she stop him in his tracks when he tried launching into his talking points, but she went straight to the heart of the matter: greed. She displayed the transcripts of quarterly earnings calls in which Stumpf had trumpeted the bank\u2019s success in boosting the number of new products and services sold to existing customers and explained why this made Wells Fargo a great investment. She demonstrated that she knew better than he did how many shares of Wells Fargo he owned \u2013 and told him, to the penny, the impact the stock\u2019s gain (in part because of its retail banking successes) had had on his wealth. \u201cYou squeezed your employees to the breaking point so they would cheat customers and you could drive up the value of your stock and put hundreds of millions in your own pocket,\u201d she said. Had he returned a penny of his bonus, out of shame, in spite of taking responsibility? That would be a \u201cno\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/20/wells-fargo-ceo-apology-john-stumpf-congressional-hearing\">Elizabeth Warren to Wells Fargo CEO: resign, give back earnings, submit to inquiry</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Doublespeak</h2> <p>Wall Street doublespeak has reached the level of an art form, thanks to Wells Fargo and Stumpf. Warren asked, more or less rhetorically, \u201ccross-selling is shorthand for pumping up profits, isn\u2019t it?\u201d No one expected Stumpf to agree with the senator, but for him to answer, with a straight face, that \u201ccross-selling is shorthand for deepening relationships\u201d was bizarre. The hearing was littered with such moments. Perhaps Stumpf\u2019s struggles to answer the senators\u2019 questions directly and clearly were due to the fact that he\u2019s really trapped in an Orwellian banking sub-universe?</p> <h2>Cowardice</h2> <p>Ultimately, it\u2019s all about cowardice. For all his protestations to the contrary, Stumpf doesn\u2019t really want to take responsibility. Throughout the hearings, he answered many questions by deferring to the bank\u2019s board \u2013 even though he\u2019s not only a director but the chairman. He doesn\u2019t want to step up and take responsibility, whether because he is personally fearful, or because he dreads what that would mean for the bank. (Would it ignite a firestorm of shareholder lawsuits?) If he hadn\u2019t been fearful of taking responsibility, he would have gone to the board in late 2013 or early 2014, acknowledged that this had happened on his watch, and fallen on his sword. He didn\u2019t. Instead, he let others muddle through, didn\u2019t demand answers or solutions, and waited while it got worse. He abdicated his responsibility to shareholders and to customers, out of cowardice. <br></p> <p>So what\u2019s the punishment for these sins? Warren has a clear idea.<br></p> <p> \u201cYou should resign. You should give back the money that you took while this scam was going on and you should be criminally investigated by both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission,\u201d she said. Will he? That\u2019s one question to which we\u2019re all still awaiting an answer.</p>",

  "<p>Happy anniversary then, Ars\u00e8ne. You were the future once. Like most ageing pop culture icons Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has by now pretty much completed the full circuit from youthful innovator, new broom and all-round king of the wild frontier to something that looks a bit like the opposite: stick in the mud, barnacle, emissary from the distant past.</p> <p>For those who remember Wenger\u2019s unveiling in English football \u2013 the brilliant surprise of our own thin white duke, so ludicrously tall and rangy, a man nailed together out of deckchair slats \u2013 there is something startling about the tone of his late days at Arsenal. The idea of Wenger as an obstacle to progress, Arsenal\u2019s own dinosaur general is a perfect example of sport\u2019s restlessness, the need constantly to move on and reinvent. These are necessary corrections. The truth as ever lies somewhere in between.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/21/arsene-wenger-20-years-arsenal-incredible-journey\">Ars\u00e8ne Wenger: 20 years at Arsenal \u2013 an incredible journey of joy and frustration | Amy Lawrence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This Thursday marks the 20th anniversary of Wenger\u2019s first day as Arsenal manager. It has been a glorious, transformational, by the end oddly repetitive managerial reign. In the court of public opinion Wenger\u2019s Hunky Dory, Ziggy Stardust and Heroes are very much behind him. He stands before us now stuck in his extended Tin Machine phase. Albeit in this case the dominant career notes are not constant revolution, but a maddening kind of constancy.</p> <p>\u201cA tall slim, Frenchman walks in and steps up on to the dais. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is, we quickly realise, a completely different animal.\u201d The opening passage in Myles Palmer\u2019s excellent, utterly besotted book The Professor, published in the hazy glory days of 2001, captures the shock of first contact.</p> <p>Hindsight is a useful thing here. In many ways the Premier League\u2019s double-take at Wenger\u2019s early impact says as much about its own backward mid-1990s sensibilities as it does Wenger\u2019s modernisms: the grilled broccoli, produced with a swish from his magician\u2019s hat; the revelation that drinking nine pints of lager and jumping up and down in a circle might not be ideal post-match warm down.</p> <p>It turns out Wenger\u2019s real triumph in those early years wasn\u2019t so much his methods as the same qualities that have come to define his late period. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/sep/26/arsenal.paolobandini\">Arsenal have moved house</a>. Mini-eras have come and gone. Regular title challenges have congealed into an established backseat role among Europe\u2019s elite. Throughout which Wenger has been defined by the base notes that allowed him to challenge so insistently the orthodoxies in English football when he first arrived. Stubbornness. Persuasive charm. An insistence, above all, on remaining completely himself. <em>Plus \u00e7a change</em>, as they say in Islington.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afb51fb771b15503e5bf64a0ccc1a5ff6361eef7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afb51fb771b15503e5bf64a0ccc1a5ff6361eef7/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wenger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Managers from Alex Ferguson to Sam Allardyce have acknowledged their own debt to Wenger\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty Images &amp; Colorsport/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It might have all been very different. Arsenal initially wanted Bobby Robson as a long-term manager. Robson even agreed to join only to be cajoled into staying at Porto. Wenger was on a list of more expansive alternatives. He\u2019d first met David Dein at a dinner party in 1989 where Wenger\u2019s charm, ability at charades (he acted out A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream) and his \u2013 yes really \u2013 exceptional dancing skills marked him out as a rare bird.</p> <p>Seven years later Wenger\u2019s unveiling at Highbury on a late September Sunday drew the famous \u201cArs\u00e8ne Who?\u201d headline in the Evening Standard.

The top tier of English football was swollen with new money, ready to engage, and captivated from the start by the revolutionary driving, passing football of a man the British press would refer to as \u201cThe Professor\u201d 703 times over the next 12 years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/21/arsene-wenger-arsenal-1966-premier-league-rivals-where-are-they-now\">Twenty years of Wenger: where are the Arsenal manager\u2019s rivals from 1996 now?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wenger was also lucky. There was plenty of low hanging fruit to be hoovered up in the early years, a seam of wonky nutrition and booze-soaked sinews to be mined. As Arsenal began to win English football was genuinely awed by the sheer future-shock of pasta, yoga, the gimmickry with dentistry and team bus thermostats and \u201cperiods of silence\u201d at half-time. See the Frenchman, with his iron horse, his monkey glands. Really though Wenger was simply steadfast, decisive and brilliantly sure of himself in those early years, a \u201cfootball alcoholic\u201d in Mark Hateley\u2019s phrase, better on the details every time.</p> <p>His legacy in England will be defined in three stages. First Wenger was simply the first. The first successful overseas manager, first to challenge openly the stodgy parts of the culture, a hugely assertive midwife at what might have been a difficult rebirth. In his wake levels were raised everywhere. Managers from Alex Ferguson to Sam Allardyce have acknowledged their own debt, the necessary tightening of standards. A mark had been set, a new orthodoxy ingrained.</p> <p>Secondly there is simply the sublime football of Wenger\u2019s best teams, a style of soft-shoed pass and move that will stand as some of the finest seen in England. Never mind trophies, Wenger\u2019s legacy is the spectacle of an unfettered Thierry Henry in full flow, the synergy between his best midfields, even some of those forgotten midweek nights where Alexander Hleb or Andrei Arshavin plus a group of slick young won\u2019t-ever-bes pumped four past some team of grimacing mid-table unfortunates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53c589b09d66eea811296b03c5d316fe837a3e6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53c589b09d66eea811296b03c5d316fe837a3e6a/20_33_2234_1340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thierry Henry and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ars\u00e8ne Wenger transformed Thierry Henry from an uncelebrated winger into one of the most prolific strikers of the Premier League era.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins for The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thirdly Wenger can claim a major hand in the Premier League\u2019s own period of historic dominance between 2005 and 2011 when technical players allied to an ingrained physicality created a new tempo in European football. Wenger made this possible, showed how the \u201ctraditional\u201d British running style could be married with refined technique and quick, accurate passing; creating a refined power game that Real Madrid, among others, have risen to in recent years.</p> <p>Even in the shrinking back of the last few seasons, a period when Arsenal have lacked teeth not talent, there has been something beautiful about Wenger\u2019s own thinning out, the brittle asceticism of Arsenal\u2019s football, with a manager who has become more minimal, more dilute, more self-defeatingly himself. At times watching Wenger trying to ramp this team up into champion mode again the thought has occurred that he enjoyed the challenge of austerity much more, those skin-of-the-teeth years where he kept the club breathing Champions League air, shrinking the debt, and all the while enacting his vision of frictionless global Wengerball beneath the lights of the new enormodrome.</p> <p>Wenger should have won more league titles. In the post-\u00d6zil era last season looks the most obvious missed opportunity. Arsenal might have also won a Champions League in the Henry years when nothing was beyond them. Wenger has also probably outstayed his most effective period by two seasons, although this is always an untested line of reasoning. Either way it has been a genuinely fascinating 20 years during which Arsenal FC and English football itself have been transformed, both for the better under Wenger\u2019s tenacious, wilful reforming influence.</p>",
  "<p>China is the future \u2013 in cinema terms at least. As Hollywood expansionist strategy makes clear, most film-industry insiders believe that China is where the money is, and will be. Despite a recent dip in takings, the Chinese box office is expected to outgross the US\u2019s in 2017 for the first time: projections suggest that Chinese cinemas will earn $10.4bn, as opposed to $10.2bn in the US. In February, the huge totals for the Stephen Chow film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/22/global-box-office-the-mermaid-china-record-zootopia-how-to-be-single\">The Mermaid</a> helped China\u2019s monthly gross \u2013 $1.05bn \u2013 surpass that of all of North America (including Canada), which was $790m for the same period.<br></p> <p>China is moving towards Hollywood, too. In an effort spearheaded by billionaire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/15/chairman-wang-jianlin-process-of-pursuing-wealth\">Wang Jianlin</a>, the Dalian Wanda Group has been investing in anything that is for sale in Tinseltown, including Batman producers Legendary Entertainment and the cinema chain AMC, and is currently angling to acquire Paramount. Meanwhile, Hollywood increasingly has to comply with China\u2019s written and unwritten regulations, and make countless compromises, to produce audience-pleasing blockbusters that satisfy the censors. And in order to bypass the quota that China sets for foreign movies (34 a year), US studios have started to make co-productions with Chinese ones \u2013 adapting further to China\u2019s requests, censorship and regulations in order to do so. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvMk7Z0Sp7E\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UvMk7Z0Sp7E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Trailer for the box office record-breaking Stephen Chow film The Mermaid.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It is an exercise fraught with unexpected consequences, as the Hong Kong film industry \u2013 until recently one of the most productive and vibrant in the world \u2013 knows only too well.

Whole studios emigrated from Shanghai (formerly China\u2019s film-making centre) and settled in what was then a British colony. Hong Kong produced Mandarin- and Cantonese-language movies until the 1960s; gradually thereafter, Cantonese began to dominate. But language seemed almost irrelevant: Hong Kong cinema had entered its golden era, and, as Shu Kei, film critic and professor at the Academy of Performing Arts in Hong Kong, recalls, \u201cactors would be busy on nearly 10 sets in a single day\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThe golden era had an output of up to 250 films a year, and the slowdown only started in the 90s,\u201d says Kei. \u201cQuality was problematic, but the craze was such that cinemas were screening movies at a slightly faster pace, in order to squeeze in one extra show, while film directors and actors just improvised with no script.\u201d Profits were so high that organised crime became an active part of the industry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9de903f4604016bf7f18afd0e8a921ff942c9464\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9de903f4604016bf7f18afd0e8a921ff942c9464/48_0_1576_1968/801.jpg\" alt=\"Brigitte Lin in Chungking Express (1994)\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brigitte Lin in Chungking Express (1994)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But in the late 90s, just at the point at which audiences became more discriminating and DVDs started to eat into profits, China began opening up, changing the game entirely. Hong Kong\u2019s movie stars were highly attractive and recognisable, but to remain relevant, Hong Kong cinema had to shift its attention to mainland audiences, and cut back on some of its more eccentric traits. \u201cWhen Wong Kar Wai shot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1995/sep/14/1\">Chungking Express</a> in 1994, Brigitte Lin was dressed up in a wig, sunglasses and a raincoat because she was busy on a period movie set, and had no time to go through makeup and costume again. But it worked!\u201d says Shu Kei with a giggle. That era was soon over. </p> <p>\u201cThe first movie I shot in China was in the 80s, and I required no permits to film there. I didn\u2019t need to submit my script either,\u201d recalls Mabel Cheung, another of Hong Kong\u2019s most important auteur film makers. \u201cI needed to shoot in China for my trilogy on illegal migrants, and the only issue was people crowding the set as they were so excited to see Hong Kong film stars. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zja-rkeXUxk\">Sammo Hung</a> was the male lead, and that meant we were followed around all the way into the hotel, and filming was a challenge.\u201d </p> <p>Some years later, Cheung was back in China filming a major historical drama, The Soong Sisters (1997), based on the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19910975\">real-life story</a> of three sisters married to three of the most important men in modern Chinese history \u2013 the Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, China\u2019s first president Sun Yat-sen, and HH Kung, China\u2019s first finance minister. It was a co-production with the Beijing Film Studio. \u201cI had to submit the script and get permission, but the Chinese film industry at the time was not strong: money had to be entirely provided by us, and they supplied the crew and the film studio. But when we submitted the film to the censorship bureau, we were told we had to go to the Important Affairs Commission, since it was a historical movie.\u201d</p> <p>It ended up with Cheung losing the last 18 minutes of her movie, in spite of her long pleadings with the censors\u2019 office: \u201cI never got my ending back. I had to reconstruct an ending I could live with from leftover material they agreed to return. They said it was not possible for Soong Mei-ling and Soong Ai-ling to hug, because one was married to a nationalist and the other to the father of the nation; so we had an argument about history. But I managed to get my film, and [Chinese] mainland distribution.\u201d While waiting however, Cheung filmed Beijing Rocks (2001), about the Chinese capital\u2019s booming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/mar/11/popandrock.chinaarts2008\">underground music scene</a>. \u201cThat got banned,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I could take it to Hong Kong, and after that I could go back to China.

Then, while the former colony was recovering from the devastating economic effects of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sars\">Sars epidemic</a> in 2003, Beijing announced the establishment of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement, or CEPA, a free-trade agreement which granted preferential access for Hong Kong films to the Chinese market.

In 2002, Hong Kong\u2019s filmgoers were queuing up to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/feb/27/dvdreviews.shopping1\">Infernal Affairs</a>, co-directed by Andrew Lau and Alan Mak \u2013 the beginning of a double-agent cop trilogy in the greatest tradition, with an exhilarating succession of twists. To break into the mainland market, it had three different endings for the censors to choose from. \u201cIn a mainland China movie, you cannot have a bad guy who gets away with his crimes,\u201d explains film-maker Jevons Au. \u201cMultiple endings to suit the mainland market used to be OK. No more. Now, if you want to distribute in China, you must have only one approved ending worldwide. You can step on the line. But you cannot cross it.\u201d</p> <p>Au knows all about being banned: he is one of the five co-directors of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/ten-years-the-terrifying-vision-of-hong-kong-that-beijing-wants-obscured\">Ten Years</a>, a politically uncompromising dystopian tale which imagines Hong Kong under an ever-more repressive regime. All five have been banned from China, despite Ten Years winning best film at the Hong Kong film awards and being feted in critics\u2019 circles as the harbinger of a local renaissance in small-budget productions that talk to local audiences, and are not geared to grossing millions in China. </p> <p>\u201cFor us, it is complicated,\u201d says Au. \u201cThe uniqueness of Hong Kong is our freedom of speech, of creativity, of expression. You can do and say anything you want. To make a co-production with China, you have to follow ever stricter rules: half of the cast and crew has to be Chinese. The censors have the last word. Crime stories cannot have too many details. Stories of corruption must end with the bad guy behind bars. No ghosts. No gay love stories. No religion. No nudity. No politics\u2026\u201d He counts on his fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a trap. The moment you fall into it, you change. You hurt your creativity.\u201d </p> <p>Other films suggest, however, that obstacles can stimulate creativity, and not necessarily crush it. Director Stephen Chow shifted his operation to China, and had enormous box office success. The Mermaid became the highest-grossing Chinese film of all time. And it got around the prohibition of films about the supernatural by reclassifying itself as a science-fiction movie. Likewise, Barbara Wong Chun-Chun, who started her career as an independent film-maker with thought-provoking movies such as Women\u2019s Private Parts (2000), a documentary discussion of female sexuality, has now abandoned small-budget productions to make some of the most successful Chinese movies. Her film The Secret (2016) is a love story among what seem to be ghosts, but could get into theatres thanks to its final line: when one of the characters wakes up from a coma, she asks if she dreamed it all.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVxwLy8t21s\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rVxwLy8t21s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Was it all just a dream? \u2026 The Secret (2016), directed by Barbara Wong Chun-Chun.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cYou have to try to understand China\u2019s censorship,\u201d says Wong. \u201cIn Hong Kong you have category I, II and III movies. In China, there is no such system. So you must make movies that a five year old can watch without feeling scared. Can you make a movie with a bad cop in it in China? Of course. But then he has to end up in jail. Can you have much blood? No. A kid is going to see it. Foreigners who want to make movies in China need to understand the country first.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSay you want to make a film about corruption,\u201d Wong continues. \u201cIt\u2019s a sensitive theme. But the regulations are blurry, you can tackle things in a different way: shoot a film where the corruption is in America, not in China. Then it\u2019s OK. As an artist, you must find ways of getting around it.\u201d</p> <p>Another limitation is established by Chinese moviegoers\u2019 own tastes. Roger Garcia, executive director of the Hong Kong film festival, says: \u201cIn China, you are making either a romance or a big special-effects movie. If you want to do horror, or other genres, you cannot be in China. You can make a budget sci-fi movie in Hollywood, but Chinese audiences will not like that. They like huge, costly productions. So I think that China should not be the total sum of everything, it is a mistake. It is limiting. For Hong Kong, it was a mistake to obsess about China. And things are changing now that Hollywood is doing the same.\u201d</p> <p>Johnnie To agrees that film-makers are presented with a difficult choice: \u201cYou have to recognise that China is way more open now. The first film I shot there was in 1978 \u2013 the change is obvious, very big.\u201d Milkyway Image, his production company in Kwun Tong, the movie district of Hong Kong, has produced films that have been allowed into the mainland, as well as others that were banned \u2013 like the recent Trivisa (2016), co-directed by Ten Years\u2019 Jevons Au. </p> <p>\u201cFirst of all,\u201d says To, \u201cyou must ask yourself: can China accept this movie? We are different in Hong Kong, we are free, we can do and say what we want. Not them. So, you must be prepared to accept their point of view. But you cannot escape this fact: today, if you want to make a big budget movie, you can no longer make it only for Hong Kong.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqChehmFdqs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CqChehmFdqs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Trivisia (2016), directed by Johnny To and Jevons Au, has been banned in China. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cDoes it mean compromises? Yes, very many. But the alternative is no movie in China. There are many political issues that China is still stuck with, because it has an old-fashioned system of government, and even if there is more freedom than there used to be, the Communist party is unable to relax. Yet you see it very clearly \u2013 everybody is ready to shut up to make money.\u201d </p> <p>Despite To\u2019s high profile, some of his films were denied a release in China. Neither Election (2005) nor Election 2 (2006), which deal with power struggles in a triad gang, made it. \u201cI am going to wait until I am 65 to make Election 3,\u201d says To, now 61, \u201cas I already know that, after that, I will be banned from China. But it will be OK: I\u2019ll be able to really describe the rot in our government through that film.\u201d</p> <p>While film industries from Hollywood and Italy to the UK and India continue to court this booming source of revenue, To is not optimistic about cinema. \u201cTo make it really big, a film has to be one the Chinese censors can approve,\u201d he says. \u201cThe range of films that the world will get to see will be restricted.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The Afghan government has pardoned one of the country\u2019s most notorious warlords for past offences including terrorist attacks and alleged war crimes as part of a peace deal with his militant group, Hezb-i-Islami. </p> <p>The agreement, signed on Thursday after months of negotiations, paves the way for a return to public and possibly political life for Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who holds an almost unparalleled record of human rights abuses.</p> <p>These include indiscriminate shelling of civilians, targeted assassinations of intellectuals and disappearances of political opponents. Hekmatyar\u2019s followers are accused of throwing acid at women and of running an underground torture prison in Pakistan.<br></p> <p>In a central, upper-class Kabul neighbourhood, a group of young activists organised a protest against the pardoning of the man known as the Butcher of Kabul, coinciding with the signing ceremony less than a mile away. Placards picturing Hekmatyar with blood spilling from his mouth and a rocket through his nose read: \u201cWe will never forgive the executioner of Kabul.\u201d<br></p> <p>The accord also allows for the release of Hezb-i-Islami prisoners, and obligates the Afghan government to pay for security in two or three locations inside Afghanistan where the group can choose to settle its leadership.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch called the deal \u201can affront to victims of grave abuses\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201c[Hekmatyar\u2019s] return will compound the culture of impunity that the Afghan government and its foreign donors have fostered by not pursuing accountability for the many victims of forces commanded by Hekmatyar and other warlords that laid waste to much of the country in the 1990s,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/09/21/afghanistan-war-crimes-suspect-comes-home\">the organisation said in a statement</a>.<br></p> <p>Others see the inclusion of the armed opposition as a necessary step towards peace. In a working-class Kabul neighbourhood, where residents during the civil war were allied with Tajik commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, one of Hekmatyar\u2019s foes, opinions were split.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt is not a solution to keep fighting,\u201d said Abdul Samad, a middle-aged worker at a flour wholesale shop who lived through the civil war shelling. \u201cEverybody wants peace. Not just humans. Even the animals want peace.\u201d </p> <p>His 25-year-old colleague, Mohammad Zarif, was of a different view. He was too young to remember the civil war, but said his uncle was killed by a Hezb-i-Islami rocket.</p> <p> \u201cI don\u2019t want Hekmatyar to come to Kabul,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is not honest. He will train suicide attackers, and if his supporters become parliamentarians, they will release suicide attackers from the prisons.\u201d</p> <p>Not only will Zarif face the return of Hekmatyar. He and other taxpayers will also help fund the insurgent leader\u2019s security. The bill for residences, vehicles and guards for Hezb-i-Islami leadership <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/world/asia/afghanistan-gulbuddin-hekmatyar.html?_r=0\">have been reported</a> to be as high as $4m (\u00a33m). </p> <p>Hekmatyar, who has been in hiding since 1997, has not yet returned to the capital. Neither he nor the country\u2019s president, Ashraf Ghani, were present at the signing ceremony. Instead, the deal was inked by national security adviser Hanif Atmar, head of the High Peace Council Pir Sayed Ahmad Gailani and a Hezb-i-Islami delegation led by senior member Mohammad Amin Karim.</p> <p>Reading the peace accord aloud, the only female representative in the negotiation process, Habiba Sarobi, said Ghani and Hekmatyar will ratify the deal later.</p> <p>Hezb-i-Islami\u2019s military significance has waned in recent years. In 2013, the group conducted a suicide bombing that killed 10 Afghans and six American troops, but by then, that was a rare occurrence. Politically, however, loyalists of the movement have grown increasingly influential, and the peace accord permits them to run for office.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/14/afghanistan-ready-to-sign-truce-with-insurgent-group-hezb-i-islami\">Afghanistan ready to sign truce with notorious insurgent</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The agreement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/14/afghanistan-ready-to-sign-truce-with-insurgent-group-hezb-i-islami\">had been discussed</a> for months. The main sticking point, according to a western security official, was an article concerning the withdrawal of foreign forces. Hekmatyar has long refused to sign a deal as long as foreign troops are present in Afghanistan. The accord now stipulates that the two parties disagree on the matter, but that Hekmatyar commits to not supporting terrorism.</p> <p>The deal also obliges the Afghan authorities to work to have Hezb-i-Islami removed from the United Nations\u2019 list of foreign terrorist organisations. Hekmatyar was designated by the US as a \u201cglobal terrorist\u201d in 2003 and blacklisted at Washington\u2019s request by the UN the same year.</p> <p>Ibrahim Sadruddin, a young soldier in Kabul on leave, said inviting Hezb-i-Islami over to the government side would strengthen the security forces, weaken the morale of the Taliban and Islamic State, and show insurgents that entering the peace process could pay off. </p> <p>In that sense, Thursday\u2019s peace accord can perhaps provide a blueprint for future negotiations with the country\u2019s main insurgent group, the Taliban. Despite concerted efforts from the government, peace talks with the Taliban are dormant, and the militants show no sign of appeasement.</p> <p>After being embroiled in more than three decades of armed conflict, many residents believe continued fighting is futile.</p> <p>\u201cDuring the civil war, no side was innocent,\u201d said Karima, 39. \u201cHazaras, Uzbeks, Tajiks, Pashtuns \u2013 everybody committed crimes.\u201d She said the only solution was for long-time enemies to sit down and negotiate.</p> <p> \u201cOf course it is difficult, but we have to accept them.

  "<h2>Today\u2019s best bets, by Chris Cook </h2> <p>Forgive me, Flat purists, for beginning with faraway Perth (faraway if you live in England, anyway) when there\u2019s quality action on the Rowley Mile. But there\u2019s an unexpectedly good novice hurdle in prospect up there, with both Moon Racer and Ballyandy making their debuts over timber. </p> <p>These are the two most recent winners of the Cheltenham Festival Bumper. I would think this must be the first time consecutive winners of that race have made their hurdles debut in the same race (Moon Racer having missed nearly all of last season with injury), though I shall leave it to even geekier types to actually check that. <br></p> <p>Moon Racer has the better bumper form, which explains why the market gives him the edge. Being a perverse sort, however, I shall be opposing them both. It\u2019s always seemed to me that the correlation between flashy bumper horse and quality hurdler is a lot weaker than most punters imagine. </p> <p>Ballyandy has a full brother (Megastar) who won the Aintree bumper before compiling a 1/10 record over hurdles. Moon Racer\u2019s only sibling is 1/12 over hurdles (though he also failed to win a bumper, so it\u2019s not like they\u2019re the same animal). </p> <p>Predictably, the market has almost no interest in anything else in the race but <strong>Wakea (3.20)</strong> looks a live runner to me at 9-1. He was good enough to win off 95 on the Flat for Jeremy Noseda and ran fourth in the Sagaro last year before winning two of his three hurdles starts so far for Irish-based trainer Karl Thornton. </p> <p>He lost one of those wins to a positive test for an anti-inflammatory and still looked a work in progress when scoring at Clonmel a fortnight ago, though his jumping was improved on what he showed in May. \u201cHe was in no way wound-up and will come on a tonne for it,\u201d Thornton said. </p> <p>At Newmarket, Escobar looks a false favourite in the Tattersalls Stakes, for all that he was still green when landing the Washington Singer last time and will doubtless be straighter. I\u2019m not convinced the form of that race adds up to a great deal and there might be more potential in Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s <strong>Whitecliffsofdover (3.40)</strong> at 5-1. </p> <p>It\u2019s just over a year since this son of War Front fetched $1m at auction in Kentucky. He was given a gentle introduction in June in a race won by a more fancied stablemate, Intelligence Cross, a subsequent Group Three winner. Whitecliffsofdover might have been called the paddock pick that day according to the Post. </p> <p>He duly hosed up in a Naas maiden next time when stepped up to this distance. Again, the form is weak but he\u2019s on a strong upward curve. O\u2019Brien is on a 33% strike-rate with his juveniles in Britain this year. </p> <p>At 11-2, <strong>William Hunter (4.50)</strong> is the nap in the 12-furlong handicap, having really come to himself since midsummer. A strong-travelling sort, he may actually be helped by the step up in class and I think there\u2019s plenty more to come. He\u2019s only up 5lb for quite a convincing Ascot success and may be on his way to the November Handicap. <br></p> <p><em>We are no longer able to continue with competitions every week, but they will still run in the biggest weeks (Cheltenham, Aintree, Royal Ascot, Glorious Goodwood and maybe one or two others, as well as the Christmas quiz). <br></em></p> <p><em>We\u2019ll still have a Talking Horses each day for tips, analysis and news, so we very much hope you\u2019ll join us to chew over whatever racing happens to be going on and post your tips or racing-related comments below. </em><br></p>",
  "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/02/instagram-snapchat-stories-facebook\">Instagram Stories</a>, the new function that lets users upload and write over unfiltered pictures and videos that disappear after 24 hours, launched last month, big brands were quick to jump on board. </p> <p><a href=\"http://blog.business.instagram.com/post/149374242776/businesses-using-instagram-stories\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nike, Starbucks and J Crew</a> all ran behind-the-scenes content, with beauty giant L\u2019Or\u00e9al using it to provide a tutorial on its YSL Touche \u00c9clat products to the brand\u2019s 1.5m followers. Mercedes-Benz says it had 5m more impressions than usual when it first posted a story showing how a shot for its main Instagram feed was put together.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/aug/26/social-media-sites-protect-users-twitter-facebook\">Are Facebook and Twitter doing enough to protect users?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Others including Ted Baker, Ikea and Church &amp; Dwight, owner of brands such as Nair and Pearl Drops, are also using the Facebook-owned platform, often tying content to events such as London Fashion Week and letting viewers see their \u201craw\u201d side, with images shot from the hip rather than being beautifully polished. </p> <p>The new function is similar to Snapchat Stories but Instagram has the advantage, pulling in a larger audience of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/21/instagram-hits-half-billion-users\">300m daily active users</a> versus Snapchat\u2019s 100m. Added to this, Instagram attracts a broader age range.</p> <p>Hugh Pile, L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s western Europe chief marketing officer, says its appeal is in the contrast of Instagram\u2019s two functions. </p> <p>\u201cWithin the same platform now we\u2019ve got this lovely juxtaposition that allows you to tell a richer story, but maybe [providing] a more authentic, or more earthy experience alongside the more polished core visuals.\u201d A number of its brands are using Instagram Stories, including L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris, Essie nail varnish and skincare range Kiehl\u2019s to launch products, provide tutorials or show the range of colours on offer. </p> <p>For Ted Baker brand communication director Craig Smith, Stories is a \u201cwelcome break from the carefully curated content\u201d of the main platform. The fashion brand\u2019s posts include behind-the-scenes footage from its Mission Impeccable campaign shoot, as well as store images from the launch of its new collection at its Regent Street shop. </p> <p>Marketers are also finding that Stories lets them convey more in-depth information about a brand. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.lvcva.com/includes/content/images/media/docs/FY-2016-Budget-in-Brief.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">which spends more than $130m (\u00a3100m) a year on marketing and advertising</a> (pdf) \u2013 is using the new form of social media to help change perceptions of Vegas as solely a gaming paradise. </p> <p>This month it\u2019s using Stories to give an insider\u2019s view of the Life is Beautiful music and arts festival, and longer term will also be showcasing the city\u2019s surrounding national parks, restaurants and shows. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Net-a-Porter used Stories during the Olympic Games, working with Brazilian fashion blogger Camila Coutinho to post content on her favourite Rio hotspots on the retailer\u2019s Instagram account. Global head of social Nicole Barclay says this helped the business to reach a different audience. </p> <p>\u201cWe not only saw an incredible response from our existing audience but a rise in new, local followers. This is special for a global brand as it is a great example of how the right content draws in targeted, local audiences.\u201d </p> <p>So do these unpolished photos and videos on Stories help bolster engagement with viewers, or are they just a bit of fun because posts disappear within 24 hours, and there\u2019s no \u201clike\u201d or \u201cshare\u201d button? <br></p> <p>Pile says Stories does increase engagement with Instagrammers, giving the example of Kiehl\u2019s: 8% of its followers click on its Stories posts versus 2% who like its traditional Instagram updates. </p> <p>But he\u2019s careful not to overhype the potential impact of the new tool. \u201cIt will be very important for us but we will not rush and over-invest until we really understand what it is doing. Early indications are that it is exciting.\u201d The beauty company is working on an econometric model to understand the return on investment of Stories, as it does with all media channels. But with good creative, Pile is confident sales will follow. </p> <p>\u201cSometimes [social media] platforms can feel a bit distanced at first glance to core sales. But when you look at what you can use them for, as long as you have strong creative, they can absolutely be wonderful to drive sales. </p> <p>\u201cWhat we haven\u2019t proven yet, because it\u2019s still new, is exactly what the return on investment is on that spend yet. Econometric modelling will offer us clarity on what it delivers.\u201d </p> <p>Meanwhile Church &amp; Dwight has plans to up investment for its beauty brands on Instagram by 30% in the UK this year. While it hasn\u2019t yet tied Stories directly to sales, UK marketing director Michael Benson is confident it will. \u201cExposure to a brand in social media improves propensity to purchase and we\u2019re keen to understand what exactly can be achieved with Instagram Stories.\u201d </p> <p>For Mercedes-Benz, Stories is more about brand awareness than hard sales. Organic (or non-paid) posts don\u2019t allow external links, so sales are \u201cnot a primary aim of the platform strategy at present,\u201d says marketing communications director Natanael Sijanta. </p> <p>However, not everyone is convinced by Stories so far. Ben Lunt, executive digital director at advertising agency BMB London, calls Stories an MVP \u2013 or minimum viable product \u2013 version. \u201cThe thing that disappoints me is how relatively unintegrated it is with the rest of the Instagram user experience \u2013 it feels so much like a bolt-on. I imagine as time goes on, it will start to feel a bit more integrated.\u201d </p> <p>Some brands welcome the fact that Stories appear at the top of the Instagram feed. Fitness First\u2019s UK social media manager Bulent Bingol believes it is a great way to beat the new Instagram algorithm, which orders posts \u201cto show the moments <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/07/new-algorithm-driven-instagram-feed-rolled-out-to-the-dismay-of-users\">we believe you will care about the most</a>,\u201d rather than chronologically. </p> <p>Companies need to be quite organised to create posts for Stories, which isn\u2019t always easy for large businesses, points out Chad Warner, integrated creative director at agency McCann London. \u201cYou need to be set up to produce something of interest quickly, while not losing what your brand\u2019s star quality is.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/oct/20/twitter-moments-distraction-journalism-free-speech\">Moments is a distraction from the bigger issues Twitter must tackle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But, he adds, brands should take the opportunity to get seen without having to buy media \u2013 for the moment. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to speak to all of your followers without paying for any media.

Instagram has not yet detailed how it plans to make money from its version, but <a href=\"http://blog.business.instagram.com/post/149374242776/businesses-using-instagram-stories\" rel=\"nofollow\">said in a blog post</a>: \u201cOver time we look forward to introducing new advertising and other business opportunities.\u201d Brands should watch this space. </p> <p><strong><em>To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, </em></strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\"><strong><em>sign up free for Media &amp; Tech Network membership</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong><br></p> <p><em>All Guardian Media &amp; Tech Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled \u201cPaid for by\u201d \u2013 find out more </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sponsored-content\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>",

September verdict</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fears that Britain will slide into a post-referendum recession have been allayed after a Guardian analysis showed the latest news on the economy has confounded analysts\u2019 gloomy expectations, with consumer spending strong, unemployment low and the housing market holding steady.</p> <p>The finding comes as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/21/oecd-does-a-u-turn-over-brexit-warning-as-it-revises-growth-forecast-for-britain\">a leading thinktank toned down its earlier dire warnings</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/01/brexit-could-spread-shockwaves-trough-global-economy-says-oecd\">economic turmoil for the UK and its neighbours in the event of a leave vote</a>. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said prompt action by the Bank of England to cut interest rates had cushioned the blow from June\u2019s Brexit vote but it still believes the UK will suffer a sharp slowdown next year amid heightened uncertainty.</p> <p> Official figures on the state of the public finances, released on Wednesday, also showed little impact from the vote to leave the EU. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/21/government-borrowing-higher-than-expected-at-105bn-figures-show-brexit\">Government borrowing was a touch higher than economists had expected in August</a>, but was lower than a year ago in a boost to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/philip-hammond-announces-autumn-budget-statement-for-23-november\">chancellor, Philip Hammond, as he prepares to give his maiden autumn statement in November</a>.</p> <p>Following the historic 23 June vote to leave the EU, analysts were quick to predict the UK economy would grind to a halt or even shrink. They warned businesses and households would stop spending because of job cuts, political uncertainty and a squeeze on living standards as the weak pound stoked inflation.<br></p> <p>But since the Bank stepped in with a package of measures to shore up the economy, much of the economic news has defied expectations and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/city-banks-revise-brexit-doom-and-gloom-forecasts\">many analysts have toned down their post-referendum gloom</a>. </p> <p>Now the picture of early resilience is bolstered in the first snapshot of post-referendum Britain in a new Guardian project that will track the economy as the Brexit talks begin and progress, and as more data on the economy becomes available. </p> <p>The Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, as well as the value of the pound against the dollar and euro, to illustrate the state of the economy.</p> <p>While there are warning signs of possible problems ahead, the dashboard shows a better than expected performance in four of the eight categories analysed. Two were as expected and inflation came in below forecasts, defying expectations for a post-referendum pick-up in price rises.

Such levels can sometimes be found in fields but concentrations are usually below 10ppb.</p> <p>However, scientists said all such research should be made public. \u201cGiven all the debate about this subject, it is hard to see why the companies don\u2019t make these kinds of studies available,\u201d said Prof Dave Goulson, at the University of Sussex. \u201cIt does seem a little shady to do this kind of field study - the very studies the companies say are the most important ones - and then not tell people what they find.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Christian Krupke, at Purdue University in Indiana, said: \u201cBayer and Syngenta\u2019s commitment to pollinator health should include publishing these data. This work presents a rich dataset that could greatly benefit the many publicly funded scientists examining the issue worldwide, including avoiding costly and unnecessary duplication of research.\u201d</p> <p>Ben Stewart, at Greenpeace, said: \u201cIf Bayer and Syngenta cared about the future of our pollinators, they would have made the findings public. Instead, they kept quiet about them for months and carried on downplaying nearly every study that questioned the safety of their products. It\u2019s time for these companies to come clean about what they really know.\u201d</p> <p>Syngenta had told Greenpeace in August that \u201cnone of the studies Syngenta has undertaken or commissioned for use by regulatory agencies have shown damages to the health of bee colonies\u201d. Goulson said: \u201cThat clearly contradicts their own study.\u201d </p> <p>Scientists also noted that the companies have been previously been critical of the research methods they themselves used in the new studies, in which bees live in fields but are fed sucrose dosed with neonicotinoids.</p> <p>In April 2016, in response to an independent study, Syngenta said: \u201cIt is important to note that the colony studies were conducted by directly feeding colonies with spiked sucrose, which is not representative of normal field conditions.\u201d </p> <p>In 2014, commenting on another independent study, Bayer told the Guardian the bees \u201care essentially force-fed relatively high levels of the pesticide in sugar solutions, rather than allowing them to forage on plants treated with\u201d pesticide. </p> <p>\u201cIf someone had done this type of study and found harm at more realistic levels, the industry would have immediately dismissed it as a rubbish study because it was not what happens naturally to bees,\u201d said Goulson. \u201cSo it is interesting that they are doing those kinds of studies themselves and then keeping them quiet.\u201d</p> <p>Utz Klages, a spokesman for Bayer, said: \u201cThe study [Bayer] conducted is an artificial feeding study that intentionally exaggerates the exposure potential because it is designed to calculate a \u2018no-effect\u2019 concentration for clothianidin. Although the colony was artificially provided with a spiked sugar solution, the bees were allowed to forage freely in the environment, so there is less stress - which can be a contributing variable - than if they were completely confined to cages. Based on these results, we believe the data support the establishment of a no-effect concentration of 20ppb for clothianidin.\u201d</p> <p>He said a public presentation would be made at the International Congress of Entomology next week in which the new results would be discussed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/28/two-worlds-top-three-leading-insecticides-harm-bees-study-shows\">Two of the world's top three insecticides harm bumblebees \u2013 study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A spokesman for Syngenta said: \u201cA sucrose-based mechanism was used on the basis that it was required to expose bees artificially to thiamethoxam to determine what actual level of residue would exert a toxic effect.\u201d </p> <p>Given the lower concentration usually found in fields, he said: \u201cThe reported \u2018no adverse effect level\u2019 of 50ppb indicates that honey bee colonies are at low risk from exposure to thiamethoxam in pollen and nectar of seed treated crops. This research is already in the process of being published in a forthcoming journal and is clearly already publicly available through the FOI process in the US.\u201d</p> <p>Matt Shardlow, chief executive of conservation charity Buglife, said: \u201cThese studies may not show an impact on honeybee health [at low levels], but then the studies are not realistic. The bees were not exposed to the neonics that we know are in planting dust, water drunk by bees and wildflowers, wherever neonics are used as seed treatments. This secret evidence highlights the profound weakness of regulatory tests.\u201d </p> <p>Researchers also note that pollinators in real environments are continually exposed to cocktails of many pesticides, rather than single chemicals for relatively short periods as in regulatory tests. </p>",

It is important to say that unhappiness and depression are not the same thing, though their determinants do overlap.\u201d</p> <p>Patel argues that Indians often suffer from depression for longer than in other countries, because of failures in the healthcare system and social stigmas around treating mental health. \u201cDepression is a universal human medical condition, and there\u2019s nothing terribly unique about the Indian context.\u201d <br></p> <p>For Patnaik though, the happiness centre represents a step forward. \u201cWe have a clear focus, we will explore and test various causes and indicators of happiness in a scientific way.

  "<p>Waste crime is the \u201cnew narcotics\u201d according to the head of the Environment Agency (EA), offering huge profits as the authorities race to catch up with the damage caused to society. </p> <p>Illegal waste activity costs England \u00a31bn a year and more than 1,000 illegal waste sites were discovered last year, more than in the previous two years combined, with 662 still active as of the end of March.</p> <p>The offences, sometimes involving organised crime gangs, ranged from illegal dumping of household and industrial waste to massive frauds involving recycling fees and landfill tax.

They take our waste away and turn it into something better and if we didn\u2019t have them, we\u2019d be in a bad place.\u201d</p> <p>Bevan spoke to the Guardian on a visit to Orion Support Services, a company in east London that handles 50,000 tonnes of construction waste from the city each year. Its permit was suspended in 2015 after serious dust problems.</p> <p>However, the company has now built a \u00a32.4m enclosed facility for sorting the waste, with a system that collects and bags 50 litres of dust an hour. \u201cIt was either that or shut up shop and go home,\u201d said John Stride, managing director of Orion Services. \u201cBut the turnaround has been amazing and it will pay back.\u201d</p> <p>Just a small percentage of the waste sorted by Orion goes to landfill, with most being recycled or burned for energy. \u201cIt just feels better now, when you are reusing it,\u201d Stride said, adding that a neighbour who had raised a 1,000-strong petition against Orion\u2019s operations was now \u201cvery friendly\u201d.</p> <p>Overall, England is much dealing better with waste than in the past, said Bevan. Rubbish sent to landfill has halved since 2000 and household recycling reached a new high in 2015 of 45%. However, the rising recycling rate has flattened out in recent years, and the proportion sent to landfill increased slightly in 2015.</p> <p>\u201cEngland is getting a better place to live - greener, cleaner and more prosperous,\u201d said Bevan. \u201cThere is more to do, absolutely, but the glass is half full.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is in part an example of regulation working,\u201d said Bevan, a former high commissioner to India. \u201cI have seen an example of what happens if you don\u2019t regulate - the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhopal_disaster\">Bhopal disaster</a>.

Congress has so far failed to do so; activists blamed Republican leaders for inaction.</p> <p>Clarke noted that Wednesday\u2019s panel discussion was taking part in the Lyndon Johnson room, named after the president who signed voting rights into law. She warned: \u201cWhat I can tell you is this: the world has changed in the absence of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Officials at the state and the local level have exploited every opportunity they can to institute or maintain discriminatory voting practices in the absence of section 5. <br></p> <p>\u201cEach day that Congress fails to act, we not only subject African Americans and other minority voters to the recurring indignity of voter discrimination but taxpayers suffer too. North Carolina has spent nearly $5m defending its discriminatory voter suppression law; Texas has spent more than $3.5m defending its discriminatory voter ID law. And the price tag increases each day.<br><br>\u201cVoter discrimination, if left unchecked, will stand as a stain on our democracy. It is bad for taxpayers, it is bad for Americans. It is time for Congress to stop turning a blind eye to the resurgence of voter discrimination in our country.\u201d</p> <p>Recent restrictions passed by 14 states include new photo ID requirements, a reduction in early voting days and the abolition of same-day registration. Voter fraud is often cited as a reason but experts said the problem is \u201cminuscule\u201d.</p> <p>Civil rights stalwart John Lewis, a Democratic Representative from Georgia, was in the room when Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act. But he said during this year\u2019s primaries he came across a couple who had been married for 40 but were told to vote at separate polling stations.<br></p> <p>\u201cIn the past few months and years I\u2019ve traveled across the country and I know that there is a deliberate persistent systematic effort to make it harder and more difficult for the disabled, student, senior, minority, the poor and rural voters to participate in the democratic process. That\u2019s not right, not fair, and it\u2019s not just.\u201d<br></p> <p>He said it was a \u201cdisgrace\u201d that Congress has not acted and call on Clarke\u2019s organisation to \u201cfile suits all over the place to make it real, make it plain\u201d.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e2f99fe4b011f2eb711e58\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-21T21:20:57.659Z\">10.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ted Cruz appears pleased with Donald Trump\u2019s embrace of a discredited conspiracy theory that the United States is turning over \u201ccontrol\u201d of the Internet to the United Nations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/778704296791543810\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Appreciate <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@realDonaldTrump</a>\u2019s support of our efforts to keep the internet free: <a href=\"https://t.co/gc4aRustpx\">https://t.co/gc4aRustpx</a></p>&mdash; Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/778704296791543810\">September 21, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e2f525e4b05d653ca5f63b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-21T21:06:19.092Z\">10.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">New national poll: Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by 7 points in two-way race</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>According to the latest national poll released by NBC/the Wall Street Journal, former secretary of state and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton leads Republican nominee Donald Trump by 7 points nationally, 48% to 41%, a,d leads by 6 points in a four-way race, 43% to Trump\u2019s 37%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99b0944794e9d8e85c2d9396d2e8e67d9ca8c468\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99b0944794e9d8e85c2d9396d2e8e67d9ca8c468/0_0_2000_1333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Rourke/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson has broken the double digits with 10% support, while Green nominee Jill Stein holds at 3%.</p> <p>Clinton heads into the first presidential debate this coming Monday with only slightly weakened margins since the last time the poll was conducted, and with an increase in her (still dismal) favorability ratings.

  "<p>Centrelink could face a wave of legal action from Australian jobseekers over what employment groups say is a \u201cgrowing crisis\u201d arising from penalties or abrupt suspensions of welfare payments imposed by private employment companies.</p> <p>The legal action is being canvassed by the Australian Unemployed Workers\u2019 Union and seeks to examine the behaviour of the private companies to which the government has given the task of managing employment programs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/sep/20/sure-unemployment-is-down-but-plenty-of-people-would-like-to-work-more\">Sure, unemployment is down but plenty of people would like to work more | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The potential legal action could challenge Australia\u2019s heavily privatised employment scheme, which relies on companies effectively making decisions on behalf of the welfare provider, Centrelink, about the conduct of participants in the \u201cwork-for-the-dole\u201d scheme.</p> <p>The president of the AUWU, Owen Bennett, said jobseekers were increasingly contacting the union with stories of abrupt suspensions or penalties to their unemployment or disability allowances. He said some of these decisions were made unfairly, without natural justice and without the companies providing a reasonable opportunity to allow those affected to respond.</p> <p>\u201cThis is pushing these people to a point where they\u2019ve really got nothing to turn to, and it pushes them over the edge in many cases,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThey\u2019re putting people in very vulnerable positions to the point where their health and generally their wellbeing is being placed under threat.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of Employment acknowledged that private contractors played a role in assessing the behaviour of income support payment recipients, but said it provided clear requirements and training on how to appropriately monitor them.</p> <p>Leigh Markovic approached the AUWU after her experiences with her employment provider left her willing to give up her Centrelink payments and become homeless, simply to avoid the stress.</p> <p>The 21-year-old was part of an employment scheme run by Max Employment. The company is one of the largest private contractors involved in the administration of jobseeker programs.</p> <p>But she said she found dealing with the company to be difficult, and said some caseworkers had been unsympathetic and had treated her with contempt. She wanted to find a hospitality job but found the work-for-the-dole program to be increasingly stressful.</p> <p>\u201cI would just start crying at every appointment,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise how much worse my mental state was when I was dealing with them. I went in with all these high hopes and goals and just left there feeling stupid, like nobody was going to help me.\u201d</p> <p>Markovic suffers from depression and anxiety, and underwent surgery in August. But she had an appointment scheduled with Max Employment three days after the surgery, which she didn\u2019t believe she would be well enough to attend, so contacted the company repeatedly to ask it for another date.</p> <p>The company sent her a text message, seen by Guardian Australia, advising her that the appointment would be pushed back several weeks. But later on the same day she received another text that said her Centrelink payments had been suspended.</p> <p>\u201cHi LEIGH. Pls call us ASAP \u2026 as you have missed an appt and your Centrelink payment has been suspended under the law. MAX Employment,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Markovic said she had not been given an opportunity to respond. Bennett said the decision was part of a broader problem: private companies were being delegated the power to make decisions on Centrelink\u2019s behalf.</p> <p>\u201cIt puts an extraordinary amount of power in the hands of private companies,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The suspension was revoked a day later by Max Employment, but Markovic said it caused her considerable distress. She finally lodged a complaint with the Department of Education, which oversees complaints relating to the jobseeker contract. Guardian Australia has contacted the department to determine the outcome of the complaint, but it said it could not respond due to privacy reasons.</p> <p>Max Employment\u2019s chief operating officer, Darren Hooper, acknowledged the text message had been sent in error to Markovic due to a different staff member logging the appointment change, and that there had been no impact on her payment because the suspension was revoked a day later.</p> <p>Hooper said he had apologised to Markovic about the suspension notice. But he said his staff strove to support Markovic and all their clients, and that Max Employment\u2019s \u201cwhole office service is about creating a positive environment\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOur staff do act professionally. We provide training, education and we have regular audit checking,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that on some occasions there aren\u2019t errors in judgment and mistakes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would say that we could have serviced her better and that there were actions we took we shouldn\u2019t have taken around the appointment.\u201d</p> <p>He also said Max Employment was not contacted by the Department of Employment in relation to Markovic\u2019s complaint.</p> <p>Bennett said while the private companies bore some responsibility, it was ultimately the government that should be overseeing employment schemes more effectively, and that it was \u201cthe role of government\u201d to ensure the job scheme was working appropriately.<strong tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\"></strong></p> <p>\u201cAll they [the companies] do is just press a button and 10% of their unemployment entitlement can be taken away, and it will take them three months to get it back.\u201d</p> <p>For a person to successfully appeal a decision to cancel their Centrelink payments they must challenge the decision in the administrative appeals tribunal, which can take months. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Legal advice provided to the AUWU said there may be a number of types of \u201cpotential unlawfulness\u201d that the government is engaged in, and recommended that they begin to collect documentation from affected jobseekers.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>When asked about the AUWU\u2019s potential action, a spokesman for the Department of Employment said: \u201cThe Department of Human Services has responsibility and delegation to investigate and determine if compliance failures have occurred under social security law.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Department of Employment contracts employment services providers to deliver the jobactive programme. When job seekers are required to participate in work for the dole, jobactive providers are required to monitor participation and where non-attendance occurs, follow up with the job seeker and seek to re-engage the job seeker in the activity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf jobactive providers are unable to contact the job seeker to discuss the reason for non-attendance, or do not believe the reason given for the non-attendance is satisfactory, they are able to report the non-attendance to DHS. Job seekers then need to make contact with DHS to discuss the reported non-attendance prior to receiving their next fortnightly instalment. DHS will not make a decision until they make contact with the job seeker and investigate the report.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/19/world-without-work-utopia-hell-human-labour-obsolete\">A world without work is coming \u2013 it could be utopia or it could be hell | Ryan Avent</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The union and a coalition of other organisations and individuals <a href=\"http://unemployedworkersunion.com/joint-press-release-poor-criminalised-social-security-system/\">have signed a joint statement</a> decrying a \u201cpunitive social security and growing employment crisis\u201d.</p> <p>The signatories include the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Council of Social Services, the Anti-Poverty Network South Australia, the Fair Go for Pensioners Coalition and the Guardian Australia columnist Van Badham.</p> <p>\u201cIt is imperative that all parties in the federal parliament take responsibility for Australia\u2019s worsening employment crisis and work together to support Australians without work,\u201d they wrote.</p> <p>Although Centrelink is responsible for the direct administration of payments, the examination of complaints about job service providers rests with the Department of Employment.
