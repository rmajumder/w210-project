  "<p>It\u2019s a disruptive world. Back when the current ruling class were at school, disruptive behaviour was punished. Today disruption is cool and SMAC (the acronym for the technologies driving business innovation, social, mobile and cloud) is the new normal. Businesses able to ride the tidal wave of disruptive change are steadily wiping out those that don\u2019t and CEOs are left wondering if they\u2019ll be the next to be Ubered or Amazoned.</p> <p>The world has changed. The first industrial revolution mechanised the means of production using water and steam power; the second created mass production with electric power; the third used electronics and information technology to automate production. The fourth and current industrial revolution combines the physical, digital and biological worlds, bringing together previously unconnected areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, 3D printing, nanotechnology, genetics and biology. It\u2019s the Internet of Everything, changing how people and things connect, how we collect and harness data, and how they all work together to facilitate intelligent processes. </p> <p>Digital technologies are now changing the way education is delivered, accessed, assessed and perceived. And, across the world, new jobs are being created while others are ruthlessly eliminated at a pace humanity has never seen before. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/26/with-robots-is-a-life-without-work-one-wed-want-to-live\">With robots, is a life without work one we'd want to live?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A <a href=\"https://www.data61.csiro.au/Our-expertise/Expertise-Strategic-insight/Tomorrows-Digitally-Enabled-Workforce\" rel=\"nofollow\">CSIRO report</a> earlier this year estimated that nearly half of Australian jobs are at risk of computerisation. Early computerisation waves only affected jobs in labour-intensive, readily coded repetitive tasks but the evolution of cognitive computing has shifted into areas previously believed to be uniquely human. Driverless cars, wearable computing and DNA nanobots have quickly moved from science fiction to science fact and are desirable. </p> <p>It is <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/dol/aboutdol/history/herman/reports/futurework/report.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">estimated</a> that 65% of children entering primary school today will work in jobs that don\u2019t yet exist. Consider that less than a decade ago very few of us knew what an app was but today graduates have been educated as app developers, data analysts and social media managers. And tomorrow? Machine algorithmic designers or robotics lifestyle integration consultants? </p> <p>A small number of companies \u2013 Facebook, Apple, Netflix and Google, or Fang \u2013 have changed the world in less than a decade. This is the age of Fang and, while many might hope this era is shortlived, educators must educate the next generation for a future that is unclear. </p> <p>Universities are preparing graduates for 21st-century lives and careers in complex and unpredictable future. One certainty, in an age when vast quantities of information are available instantaneously and outdated almost immediately, will be the ability to deal nimbly with complex and often ambiguous knowledge rather than simply accumulate facts for detailed reports. </p> <p>The skills with an enduring shelf life will be the uniquely human skills \u2013 emergent leadership, entrepreneurship, emotional intelligence, creativity and complex problem-solving. In our digitally enabled and hyperconnected world, graduates will also need cultural empathy, cross-cultural communication skills and global contacts. The connection between work and learning will also become closer and work-based learning opportunities will have a critical place in preparing for the jobs and skills of the future.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/07/its-up-to-organised-people-to-ensure-the-new-economy-serves-the-greater-good\">It's up to organised people to ensure the new economy serves the greater good</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The career of a lifetime will certainly no longer last a lifetime and workers will probably need to upskill multiple times throughout their working lives. Even jobs less directly affected by technological change will require very different skill sets as the ecosystems in which they operate are affected by the changes such as more flexible working conditions, teleworking and increased casualisation. </p> <p>Certainly Stem will be important \u2013 science, technology, engineering and mathematics \u2013 but we must also invest in the arts and humanities. Consider the Fang companies that have made a fortune by creatively marrying technology and culture. It shouldn\u2019t surprise us \u2013 creativity and innovation have always been the source of the very best ideas. </p> <p>Until recently it would be fair to say that the buildings blocks of universities, their governance, their business model and their instructional design, had changed little since the first university was established in 1088. In the blink of one year, online education went from poor relation to leading-edge cool. Massive open online courses or MOOCs represent the first wave of disruptive change for universities and how they transmit knowledge. MOOCs have freed universities from fixed concepts of meritocratic selection and from preconceived notions of who should go to university and when. Just as iTunes unbundled songs from a CD, the digital revolution enables a university degree to be disaggregated into its component parts \u2013 vocational knowledge, generic professional skills, deep discipline knowledge, practical training, evidence of achievement, networking opportunities and student lifestyle.</p> <p>The billion-dollar question for Australia of course is how will we keep pace with technological infrastructure and remain competitive in an increasingly complex global market? We must worry less about what the actual jobs are and more about equipping our people to be thoughtful, entrepreneurial and forward-looking. Whatever path eventuates over the decade, there are some things we can be fairly sure of: the pace of change will continue to be breathtaking and education will continue to be both a compelling indicator and a powerful instrument of human progress. </p>",
  "<p>Parents who are driven to distraction by their toddler\u2019s picky eating can take comfort in the fact that it\u2019s just as likely to be down to nature as nurture.</p> <p>According to research into the behaviour of 16-month old children, fussy eating and a refusal to try new foods are both heavily influenced by the child\u2019s genetic makeup, and are not just a result of upbringing.</p> <p>\u201cThat these traits were so significantly influenced by genes so early on really indicates how innate the tendency is, and that it is not because of the parents that are kind of moulding [children] into fussy eaters - it is already there when they are 16 months old,\u201d said Andrea Smith, PhD student and lead author of the research from University College, London.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/03/picky-eaters-depression-anxiety-adhd-study\">Picky eaters may grow into depressed and anxious kids, research suggests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But, she adds, shared environmental factors such as the home setting also play an important role, and parents should be reassured that fussy eating behaviour can be modified. </p> <p>Writing in the <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/%28ISSN%291469-7610\">Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry</a>, researchers from the UK and Norway describe how they sought to probe the impact of genetics on the eating behaviour of toddlers by harnessing data from twins registered with a large UK project known as <a href=\"http://www.geministudy.co.uk/default.asp\">Gemini</a>. </p> <p>More than 1,900 families with twins aged 16 months took part in the study. Parents completed a questionnaire which investigated the eating habits of their toddlers, including whether the children enjoyed eating a variety of foods and whether they refused new foods. </p> <p>By looking at how similar the results were from identical twins (who share all their genes) compared with how similar they were from fraternal twins (who share on average 50% of the genes that make people different), the researchers were able to tease apart the influence of genetic factors on the eating behaviour of the children.</p> <p>The findings showed that fussy eaters were also likely to reject unfamiliar foods, with many of the environmental and genetic factors common to both traits. What\u2019s more, the results suggest that genes play a key role in the eating behaviour of the children. \u201cAt 16 months we found that overall 46% of the variation in food fussiness was explained by genes, and we found that 58% of food neophobia (rejection of new foods) was explained by genes,\u201d said Smith.</p> <p>Shared environment factors, such as home life, affected both traits, exerting an equal effect to genes on variations in food fussiness, but a smaller effect on food neophobia. That suggests that despite the genetic tendencies, parental actions can still influence toddler behaviour, the authors say.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that genes are not our destiny,\u201d said Smith. \u201cParents can positively influence their child\u2019s eating behaviours.\u201d<br></p> <p>Smith says that parents should not force or bribe their child to eat a \u201cproblem\u201d food but instead repeatedly offer it to the child outside of mealtimes and praise any attempt by the child to touch or smell it. </p> <p>It is not know exactly which genes are involved in influencing picky eating and the refusal of unfamiliar food, but Smith says that many genes are likely to play a role. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2015/sep/11/feeding-fussy-kids-top-five-ways-to-get-them-eating-better-food\">Feeding fussy kids: top five ways to get them eating better food</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere will never been one gene which is the food fussiness genes - they are a lot of different ones,\u201d she said. \u201cThese genetic effects might be working through slight differences in personality in eating behaviours, in how sensitive individuals are to texture and flavours, to how extroverted and how open they are to new situations.\u201d</p> <p>While previous studies have highlighted the influence of genes on such eating behaviours in older children and adults, the new study, says Smith, shows that such genes exert a heavy influence from an early age.</p> <p>Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King\u2019s College London, who was not involved in the study, agrees that the study offers parents an optimistic outlook. <br></p> <p>\u201cEvery kid is different,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a genetic tendency to be more or less fussy.\u201d But, he adds, parents should take heart that such behaviour isn\u2019t immutable. \u201cYou can modify it by changing the family\u2019s habits, the way you present food to the child and the whole concept of the mealtime,\u201d he said. </p>",

The whole thing\u2019s great, but here\u2019s a sample paragraph:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s no getting around the fact that, say, Irish poet Seamus Heaney\u2019s Field Work works differently than Blonde on Blonde. An ear for assonance and meter as fine as the one that belonged to <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1995/\">the 1995 Nobel winner</a> serves a linguistic pleasure that requires the spatial limits of a blank, white, demanding page. So much of the pleasure I get from Dylan, on the other hand, derives from the voice singing those lyrics. He was never more moving than the decade when his larynx turned into a rusted carburetor; he sang like a carping vulture, and I loved it. <br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ffd450e4b047a4eaafc33f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T18:58:47.595Z\">7.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There are plenty of music writers on Facebook debating Dylan\u2019s win. One of them is our Chicago-based country music writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/mark-guarino\">Mark Guarino</a>, who has given me permission to quote from his post in defence of Dylan\u2019s win, which is being shared a lot. He writes:</p> <ol> <li>Lyrics are not meant to outlast the music. Dylan\u2019s do. His work fundamentally changed the art form. Today the marketing people would call him a \u201cdisrupter\u201d and a \u201cchange agent.\u201d His use of language is profound, playful and instinctual. Somehow he developed pop music that works well in the back of a bar, but at the same time you can disappear inside the songs and let them work their magic. As great poetry does.</li> <li>He has a body of work that stretches more than 50 years, which is much longer than most contemporary novelists, poets, painters. Even his so-called \u201cbad\u201d period in the 80s contained some of his most evocative writing (Oh Mercy). Joni Mitchell, Smokey Robinson and many others created great work but within very specific time periods. Dylan never stopped. Some of his late career work stands firmly up against Blonde on Blonde. More incredibly, despite great fame he was able to sit down again and again and write with a true eye, which isn\u2019t easy to do. Ask any number of your classic rockers who stopped decades ago.</li> <li>Dylan\u2019s songs live as both highbrow and lowbrow. His fans span truck drivers to Ivy League academics. His songs have meaning to people who heard them in the Woodstock era and to those who heard them during the first Iraq war. There are people who attend his concerts to pump their fists in the air and there are others who quietly count the syllables. For a body of work to be so pliable is the very definition of great literature.</li> <li>Shakespeare wrote plays that have been turned into music, movies, and are performed in garages to great halls. Are not songs simply internal monologues that are sung? Are some novels poetry and some chapbooks novels? Literature is ultimately about the language, not the genre.</li> <li>This prize is affirmation that pop culture can aspire to, and achieve, high art. People thought pop music was for children before Dylan and the Beatles showed up. He fused the folk revival with pop to steer things in a new direction. Now songwriters can aspire to greatness far outside the commercial realm. Indeed into one where so-called \u201cserious\u201d literature exists. \u201cHits\u201d have little to do with what he left behind.</li> <li>Dylan is a humanist. Like Tennessee Williams, he sees our folly. Dylan\u2019s lyrics reflect both deep nihilism about the human state of affairs and sometimes idealism about human encounters, one-on-one. Ever since the advent of the nuclear bomb, he has summed us up pretty well. He isn\u2019t just a writer \u2014 he has a perspective.</li> </ol>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1fd195302f6a808534200a3a7bc1d812741f3d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1fd195302f6a808534200a3a7bc1d812741f3d1/0_0_3000_2279/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Dylan in Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid (for which he also did the soundtrack) which was released in May 1973 and filmed in Durango, Mexico.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"760\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bob Dylan in Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid (for which he also did the soundtrack) which was released in May 1973 and filmed in Durango, Mexico.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ffd6dbe4b01ffb8ffcb673\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T18:48:40.138Z\">7.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Rob Delaney\u2019s tweet has also provoked some US arts desk lols:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/robdelaney/status/786563452269654017\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Bob Dylan wins the Nobel Prize for Literature?

He is a great poet. He is a great poet in the English-speaking tradition and he is a wonderful sampler, a very original sampler, he embodies the tradition and for 55, 54 years now he\u2019s been at it and re-inventing himself constantly. Re-inventing himself creating a new identity.<strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>Have you talked to him today?<br><strong>Danius: </strong>No, I haven\u2019t. I will afterwards.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> He\u2019s not a person who is nice and smiley when he gets awards. That doesn\u2019t worry you?<br><strong>Danius: </strong>No, I think I have a good message.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>Do you have personal favourites among his songs?<br><strong>Danius: </strong>I think if you want to start listening, or reading, you may start with Blonde on Blonde, the album from 1966. You\u2019ve got many classics and it\u2019s an extraordinary example of his brilliant way of rhyming and putting together refrains and his pictorial thinking.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> He\u2019s not written novels, not poetry in the usual sense, you have widened the horizon.<br><strong>Danius: </strong>It may look that way but really we haven\u2019t in a way if you look back, far back, 2500 years or so, you discover Homer and Sappho and they wrote poetic texts that were meant to be listened to. They were meant to be performed, often together with instruments, and it\u2019s the same way with Bob Dylan. But we still read Homer and Sappho and we enjoyed it [sic], we enjoy it and the same thing with Bob Dylan he can be read and should be read and he is a great poet in the English tradition, in the grand English poetic tradition.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you think there will be criticism against this prize?<br><strong>Danius: </strong>I hope not [smiles]. </p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>When you were young and into pop rock music, which I guess you were, did you listen a lot to Bob Dylan?<br><strong>Danius: </strong>Not really, but he was always around, so I know the music. I\u2019ve started to appreciate him much more now than I did. I was a big David Bowie fan. Perhaps it is a question of generation, I don\u2019t know.

Half a week\u2019s wages for a round of gaseous French lager? Had the referendum literature mentioned the possibility of teetotal rugby weekends there might have been a different outcome.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/13/european-champions-cup-2016-17-pool-by-pool-guide\">European Champions Cup 2016-17: pool-by-pool guide | Paul Rees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is just another reason why the tournament organisers are praying more than ever for a gripping start to their competitions this weekend. Last season, with the World Cup squeezing the fixture list, no Irish teams in the last eight for the first time since 1997-98 and the semi-finals attracting a combined attendance of only 38,968 spectators, a gripping sense of theatre was not always discernible. European club rugby knows it cannot afford its supposed flagship event to be anything less than vibrant.</p> <p>Small wonder, therefore, that Simon Halliday, the chairman of European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR), has been visiting the Irish and Italian contingent, among others, to offer support. He found the Irish provinces in quietly determined mood, keen to use last year\u2019s underachievement as a motivational springboard.</p> <p>\u201cThey have a clear view of where they want to go,\u201d said Halliday. \u201cYes they can see strength in the English and French club games but money does not buy you everything. Bath wouldn\u2019t be in the Challenge Cup otherwise. You\u2019ve got to be really careful about saying the monied clubs are the ones that always win.\u201d</p> <p>He also argues the calibre of the clubs in the Challenge Cup \u2013 Bath, Stade Fran\u00e7ais, Harlequins, Ospreys, Cardiff \u2013 is proof the more meritocratic qualifying process for the Champions Cup is driving up standards generally. Maybe, but the presence of just one Welsh team in the premier tournament for the first time is unsettling, particularly given Italy are still guaranteed an entrant. Zebre remain rooted to the foot of the Pro12 table and, for all the collective desire to see Italian rugby thrive, it remains a weakness that two sides will almost inevitably emerge from Pool 2.</p> <p>Halliday stresses it would require unanimous board agreement to make any \u201cserious structural changes\u201d to the current tournament agreement, which still has another six seasons to run. This effectively means Italian representation is safe unless their teams were to become dangerously weak. \u201cIf there were reasons to change anything it would start to become obvious and self-fulfilling,\u201d said Halliday. \u201cAs I said in my best Italian: \u2018We want you to be strong, we\u2019ll do anything to help you.\u2019 There are rumblings of a better situation developing there.\u201d</p> <p>What might change, though not this season, is a return to automatic Champions Cup qualification for the Challenge Cup champions. Montpellier benefited from that route last season because the World Cup rendered end-of-season play-offs impractical and <a href=\"http://www.epcrugby.com/europeanrugbychampionscup/qualification/index.php\" title=\"\">this season\u2019s shootout</a> between the seventh-placed sides in the Premiership and Top 14 and the eighth and ninth-placed sides in the Pro12 may be the last amid continuing discussions about the shape of the global fixture calendar.</p> <p>There is also a continuing desire for the Champions Cup winners and their Super Rugby counterparts to face each other \u2013 previous efforts have not been endorsed by EPCR \u2013 and to take the final to new locations, with Italy and Spain both candidates. This season\u2019s finale, though, will be on familiar turf, with Murrayfield due to host for the third time. Toulouse and Leinster triumphed on the previous two occasions but this year\u2019s pretenders will first have to escape the recent stranglehold of Saracens and Toulon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/12/owen-farrell-return-saracens-toulon-european-rugby-champions-cup\">Owen Farrell likely to return for Saracens against Toulon after injury</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With the two heavyweights meeting in the opening round of pool games on Saturday, the pressure on the defending champions Saracens is immediate on a ground where Toulon have never lost in this competition. \u201cWhat happened last year doesn\u2019t come into it,\u201d said Mark McCall, Sarries\u2019 director of rugby. \u201cBut we have a group who love these occasions and it brings the best out of them. They won\u2019t be intimidated by it, they will thrive on it.\u201d</p> <p>McCall, even so, thinks it may be tougher for the English clubs than last season when five Premiership sides made the quarter-finals. \u201cLast year was&#xa0;different because of the World Cup \u2026 this time it might not be like that.\u201d He&#xa0;is not wrong, with Leicester braced for an instant test of character in Glasgow on Friday. Saracens and Wasps could be the only Premiership sides to make the last eight, alongside four French sides \u2013 Racing 92, Toulon, Montpellier, Clermont \u2013 and, possibly, two Irish provinces in Leinster and Connacht. \u201cIf you talk to [the owner] Jacky Lorenzetti he\u2019s got a view about where Racing are going and it\u2019s not sideways or down,\u201d said Halliday.</p> <p>Saracens remain my tip to retain the trophy but the high road to Scotland will require careful navigation.</p>",

The system is aimed at maximising business success \u2013 for example, making sure that only three lightbulbs in one million are faulty or that your call times to a customer service line are only a few minutes long.

Or he could have argued that the company was trying to milk the great British shopper to fund expansion in the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America.</p> <p>Now will we be denied such entertainment. Mutual self-interest was always likely to prevail but Lewis\u2019s determination to fight to the point where stocks of Marmite and other Unilever goods ran low is admirable. After sterling\u2019s fall, there will many companies trying to force through unmerited price increases under the cover of Brexit.</p> <p>It\u2019s impossible to know how guilty Unilever was on that score. It would be silly to deny the company\u2019s right to try to pass on some of the higher costs from commodities and dollar- and euro-denominated packaging, but an alleged 10% across-the-board price hike did indeed look too much, too soon. Lewis worked at Unilever for 27 years and will have a keen sense of when his former colleagues have overplayed their hand.</p> <p>From a tactical point of view, he played a blinder in positioning Tesco as stout defender of UK consumers\u2019 interests. It makes a welcome change after his predecessors at the grocer spent a decade bleeding UK shoppers to fund their wasteful foreign adventures in the US, China and eastern Europe.</p> <p>Who won the Marmite scrap? We\u2019ll never be told the details of the settlement, but one suspects Tesco had the better of the skirmish because Unilever, a company that can come across as holier-than-thou at times, was ill-prepared for a dirty public fight. In the long run, though, Unilever\u2019s profit margins will remain considerably plumper than Tesco\u2019s.</p> <h2>Yet more blue-sky thinking over Murdoch revolt</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"047bcf1074f4529f34e9f29c096d38f5aedbfa69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/047bcf1074f4529f34e9f29c096d38f5aedbfa69/0_149_2358_1415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Murdoch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Murdoch, Sky chairman.

Yet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/13/sky-shareholders-revolt-against-james-murdoch-appointment-chairman-agm\">50.6% of outside shareholders want him out</a>, a result more embarrassing than the satellite broadcaster (and Murdoch Jr) would have expected.</p> <p> Naturally, the company\u2019s reaction was to blame the dissenters for being box-ticking ignoramuses. Sky, taking a well-trodden path, thinks US investors rely too heavily on proxy advisory agencies like ISS, which is wedded to the idea that a chairman should be independent, which Murdoch obviously isn\u2019t. It promises to \u201cengage\u201d with the shareholders directly \u2013 shorthand for telling them why they are wrong.</p> <p>Such a bull-headed reaction was predictable; and, yes, it would be a good thing if shareholders did not outsource their thinking to third parties. But Sky should look in the mirror. When contemplating a new chairman in January, the company didn\u2019t bother to consult outside shareholders and instead presented the return of Murdoch as a done deal.</p> <p>Given the history \u2013 the failed bid by News Corp (now 21st Century Fox) in 2011 and the phone-hacking scandal at News International that contributed to Murdoch\u2019s resignation from Sky \u2013 the lack of consultation was arrogant.</p> <p>It is nice to know Sky is now in a mood to talk. But the right moment to do so was before the appointment was signed off. If Sky had done so, it might have converted a majority of independent shareholders to its way of thinking. The board brought the embarrassment on itself.</p> <h2>Two reasons to pause over Sir Philip Green de-gonging</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b0c5737e17a944dfb187816a59f69adc0d0fdb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b0c5737e17a944dfb187816a59f69adc0d0fdb3/0_33_1443_866/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Philip Green gives evidence to the Commons business select committee on the collapse of BHS in June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Philip Green gives evidence to the Commons business select committee on the collapse of BHS in June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sir Philip Green was warned often enough that his knighthood would be at risk if he did not make good on his promise to \u201csort\u201d the deficit in the BHS pension fund. Six months have passed since the chain collapsed so he can hardly be surprised that MPs have decided to vote on his de-gonging.</p> <p>The honours forfeiture committee has the final say, but a recommendation by MPs would carry weight. It would also be popular. And, yes, if Green intends to shirk responsibilities to BHS pensioners that he has acknowledged, an honour for \u201cservices to retail\u201d would be a nonsense.</p> <p>But there are two reasons to hesitate at this time. First, are MPs sure the foot-dragging is all down to Green? The Pensions Regulator, with whom negotiations continue about a settlement, is not famed for being speedy. Second, if Green is de-gonged, he might descend into an even bigger sulk and persuade himself he has been wronged. Better to tell him how much he owes, and set a deadline for payment \u2013 then decide on the knighthood.</p>",

He claims the people of east Aleppo are being held as \u201chuman shields\u201d; but the only evidence he offers is a question: \u201cWhy, for example, have most people not left already, given the intensity of Russian bombing?\u201d If Steele wants to know the answer, why does he not talk to people living in the city \u2013 not difficult to do in the age of social media, or to the Aleppo municipal council (protecting the authority of that body is one of the conditions Staffan de Mistura has made for cooperating with the evacuation of armed militants).</p> <p>There are probably two main reasons why civilians remain in east Aleppo: some are deeply attached to their homes and unprepared to abandon them for a future as displaced persons; and many simply do not trust the assurances of the regime that they would be allowed to evacuate safely (a concern acknowledged by UN special envoy Steffan de Mistura with his declaration that he would personally accompany those leaving the city). Steele further says: \u201cHundreds of civilians recently left the besieged Damascus suburb of Daraya \u2026 with no reprisals from Assad forces.\u201d In fact 3,000 citizens of Daraya were expelled from the city. And how does Steele know that they faced \u201cno reprisals\u201d \u2013 as if forced relocation was not a reprisal? There has been almost no news of them since their expulsion.<br><strong>Brian Slocock</strong><br><em>Chester</em></p> <p>\u2022 The drumbeat towards a military confrontation with Russia is both dangerous and hypocritical (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/11/russia-should-be-investigated-for-syrian-war-crimes-says-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">Johnson calls for inquiry into Russia war crimes</a>, 12 October). Russia is accused of war crimes in its support of the legitimate government of Syria in defence of that country\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty. But without the decisive intervention of Russia, at the invitation of the Syrian government, recognised as such in international law, there would be no Syria. At best, some sort of semi-feudal caliphate would be ruling over its captive population, cleansing it of all religious minorities. Or, at worst, the integrity of the Syrian state would be torn apart in a remake of Libya, with warring factions marauding the country and tearing it apart. The west has been more concerned with fuelling the fight to illegally overthrow the Assad regime, no matter the cost. <br><strong>Russell Caplan</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The reality is that the Putin-Assad coalition cannot be defeated in Syria and will destroy and take Aleppo in weeks. The debate in parliament showed that the UK has no useful contribution to offer toward solving the political and military situation. John Kerry on behalf of the US has given up and walked away. In effect, the people of Aleppo have been abandoned (aside from UN aid). In particular, the children of Aleppo have been abandoned and we witness their slaughter night after night on our TV screens.</p> <p>If we give first priority to saving the children and innocent people of Aleppo, then we should admit our powerlessness. The UK and the US should say to the Russians: let us stop this slaughter. We will give up Aleppo. We ask that you give those who want to leave Aleppo safe passage, as has been done elsewhere. What happens next we cannot say. But at least we will have saved the children. I suggest that is the best we can hope for.<br><strong>John Hall</strong><br><em>Landulph, Cornwall</em></p> <p>\u2022 Like countless others I am appalled at events in Syria. I am also aware of the complexity of the situation and the difficulties facing mediators. Even so, governments have failed the people of Syria from the start. It is time for a radically different approach to resolving this conflict, by bringing pressure on all governments to genuinely seek an end to the war, regardless of their vested interests.</p> <p>Perhaps only grassroots pressure by large numbers of ordinary people will convince governments that the war must be ended. That seems unlikely without some catalyst. My thoughts turn to the impact that Band Aid had in the 1980s. Ordinary people can organise petitions and write letters, but it takes global celebrities to really get people going. Is it not time for such a campaign? The men, women and children of&#xa0;Syria are surely a just cause.<br><strong>Michael Cooley</strong><br><em>Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 You report Boris Johnson \u201ccalling for demonstrations by anti-war protesters outside the Russian embassy in London\u201d. We have reached a state in international affairs when Her Majesty\u2019s secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs can stand in parliament and declare to its members and the world that mobs should surround a diplomatic mission in central London whose members are officially accredited to the United Kingdom. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Convention_on_Diplomatic_Relations\" title=\"\">Article 22 of the Vienna convention</a> says: \u201cThe premises of [a diplomatic] mission shall be inviolable \u2026 The receiving state is under a special duty to take all appropriate steps to protect the premises of the mission against any intrusion or damage and to prevent any disturbance of the peace of the mission or impairment of its dignity.\u201d <br><strong>Brian Cloughley</strong><br><em>Voutenay sur Cure, France</em></p> <p>\u2022 Boris Johnson is right to condemn the actions of Russian forces in Syria. He is completely wrong, however, to suggest that \u201canti-war protest groups\u201d are not campaigning against Vladimir Putin\u2019s aggression. The <a href=\"http://www.ppu.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Peace Pledge Union</a>, along with several other peace groups, has for years opposed all warfare and militarism, whether generated by governments in Britain, Russia or anywhere else. We support the thousands of Russian peace activists resisting Putin\u2019s militarism and we liaise with peace groups around the world through networks such as <a href=\"http://www.wri-irg.org/en/network/about_wri\" title=\"\">War Resisters\u2019 International</a>. Many of our members have protested outside embassies far more often than Boris Johnson is likely to do.</p> <p>While calling for protests against Russia, the foreign secretary is happy for the UK government to sell weapons to Saudi Arabia, whose forces are committing atrocities against the civilian population of Yemen. UK forces are themselves complicit in the killing of civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is not peace campaigners who are inconsistent, but politicians such as Johnson who condemn the atrocities carried out by their enemies, but excuse those committed by their friends. <br><strong>Symon Hill</strong><br><em>Co-ordinator, Peace Pledge Union</em></p> <p>\u2022 This may be a small suggestion, but governments around the world must tell their football associations to declare now that they will not be going to Russia for the 2018 World Cup and Fifa should look at staging it elsewhere. <br><strong>Jim Cosgrove</strong> <br><em>Glasgow</em></p> <p>\u2022 Britain could exercise some leverage over Russia if it banned Russian nationals from owning British football teams, property and newspapers.<br><strong>Terry Ward</strong> <br><em>Wickford, Essex</em></p> <p>\u2022 I am extremely grateful to Boris Johnson for endorsing the principle of direct action by encouraging demonstrations in reaction to the death and destruction caused by foreign military involvement in the Middle East. If only previous foreign secretaries had been so supportive when thousands marched in protest at the Iraq and Afghanistan interventions, and more recently the Israeli bombing of Gaza. If anyone feels inclined to take to the streets of London to show their disapproval of the current Russian action in Syria, they might consider making a day of it by also visiting the Saudi Arabian embassy to express their displeasure at the civilian deaths in Yemen and, if possible, our own Ministry of Defence, which provides the enabling technical support and expertise, and facilitates the arms supplies which keep the conflict going. Next stop on the route might be 10 Downing Street, in protest at the government\u2019s reluctance to co-operate in any attempt to investigate alleged war crimes by any states with whom we share a \u201cspecial\u201d relationship.<br><strong>Karen Barratt</strong><br><em>Winchester </em></p> <p>\u2022 Your report refers to the Labour party\u2019s, briefing paper which alluded to the possibility \u201cthat Russians had committed war crimes but only if the targeting of civilians was deliberate\u201d. This interpretation of international law is far too restrictive, intentional or otherwise. If we examine the relevant article in the Rome statute, article 30, the word \u201cdeliberate\u201d is not actually used, only the key phrase \u201cintent and knowledge\u201d.</p> <p>Hence, article 30 at the International Criminal Court states that \u201cFor the purposes of this article, a person has intent where: (a) In relation to conduct, that person means to engage in the conduct; (b) In relation to a consequence, that person means to cause that consequence or is aware that it will occur in the ordinary course of events\u201d.</p> <p>And furthermore, to be absolutely sure of the meaning of the phraseology, article 30 emphasises that \u201cknowledge\u201d means awareness that a circumstance exists or a consequence will occur in the ordinary course of events. \u201cKnow\u201d and \u201cknowingly\u201d shall be construed accordingly.</p> <p>Though, of course, each bombing outrage needs to be examined with due diligence, arguably, given the chaotic situation on the ground in Syria and particularly Aleppo, any bombing campaign would clearly fall within the remit of article 30 (b) as defined at the ICC. Boris Johnson tells us that the \u201cmills of justice grind slowly but they grind small\u201d.

Tesco was down 2.5% at the start of play.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons were also lower, reflecting nerves about cost pressures at the big retailers as the slump in sterling hits home. A weaker pound can only mean higher prices for consumers or lower margins for suppliers and retailers, or a combination of all of these.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ff3712e4b05d915e424711\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T07:31:35.707Z\">8.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Unilever and Tesco shares slide</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Shares in <strong>Unilever</strong> and <strong>Tesco</strong> have both fallen this morning.</p> <p>Tesco has dropped by 2.5%, as traders ponder the financial implications of losing a swath of popular brands from its shelves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ITVJoel/status/786463915664412672\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Remarkable bust-up between <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tesco\">@Tesco</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Unilever\">@Unilever</a>.

  "<p>Nigerian defence officials say they believe more schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram will be released in the coming weeks, raising the prospect of a swift end to one of the most high-profile kidnappings perpetrated by a terrorist group in recent years.</p> <p>Twenty-one of the 276 schoolgirls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/15/chibok-nigeria-200-kidnapped-schoolgirls-boko-haram\">taken from their hostel in a government boarding school in the town of Chibok</a> by the Islamic militant group in April 2014, were freed early on Thursday morning in a deal brokered by international mediators.</p> <p>The kidnapping of the girls led to the global campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2014/may/09/bringbackourgirls-power-of-social-media\">#BringBackOurGirls</a>, with public figures including the US first lady, Michelle Obama, taking part.</p> <p>Few details have emerged of the ordeal of the abducted girls, many of whom are believed to have been taken as wives by extremists and systematically raped. Others have reportedly been forced to carry out demanding physical tasks.</p> <p>About 190 girls from Chibok are still held by the militants. Fifty-seven fled within hours of being captured, and in May this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/19/nigerian-president-meet-chibok-schoolgirl-escaped-boko-haram\">one girl was found and rescued</a> in an area close to Boko Haram strongholds.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not authorised to release the details of how the girls were retrieved yet, but the operation to retrieve the girls is ongoing. We are optimistic we will retrieve more of the Chibok girls from Boko Haram very soon, in the coming weeks,\u201d Gen Rabe Abubakar, a defence ministry spokesman, said.</p> <p>The freed girls were being transported from the north-east of the country, where Boko Haram has its remaining strongholds, to Abuja, the capital, on Thursday afternoon. A team of social workers, doctors and counsellors were awaiting their arrival. Many were reported to have babies with them, born in captivity. </p> <p>Earlier in the day, a spokesman for Muhammadu Buhari, the Nigerian president, confirmed that 21 of the missing girls were in the custody of the department of state services.</p> <p>\u201cThe release of the girls, in a limited number, is the outcome of negotiations between the administration and Boko Haram brokered by the International Red Cross and the Swiss government. The negotiations will continue,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe president welcomes the release of the girls but cautioned Nigerians to be mindful of the fact that more than 30,000 fellow citizens were killed via terrorism.\u201d</p> <p>The information minister, Lai Mohammed, denied reports that four Boko Haram prisoners were exchanged for the girls. \u201cThis is not a swap, but a release,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.thecable.ng/breaking-fg-not-swap-boko-haram-prisoners-chibok-girls\">Mohammed said</a>.</p> <p>The release will be a boost to Buhari, who vowed to crush Boko Haram within a year when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/31/opposition-candidate-muhammadu-buhari-wins-nigerian-election\">took power in May 2015</a>. While government forces have taken back large amounts of territory from the group, it has remained active, killing hundreds of people in suicide bombings.</p> <p>The #BringBackOurGirls campaign group said Thursday\u2019s release was a \u201cwonderful development\u201d that confirmed \u201cwhat we have always known about the capacity of our government to rescue our #ChibokGirls\u201d.</p> <p>Prof Emma Shehu, a leader of the group, said she was relieved by the news.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been castigated by the past government, by the military and by the hardliners in the current administration for continuing with our advocacy and protests for the kidnapped girls. They\u2019ve treated us as though we were mad but we\u2019re happy that this is partly a vindication of our insanity. For the parents it\u2019s raised their hopes,\u201d Shehu said.</p> <p>The Chibok girls are among thousands of adults and children who have been abducted by Boko Haram during its seven-year insurgency. The group is short of manpower and has turned to abductions as recruitment has slowed.</p> <p>Negotiations with Nigerian government representatives for the release of the schoolgirls have been complicated by splits within Boko Haram. The movement has fractured into two, possibly three factions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/06/isis-al-qaida-turf-wars-africa-may-push-fragile-states-to-breaking-point\">over the issue of links with Islamic State</a>.</p> <p>Isis, of which the Nigerian group is still theoretically an affiliate, announced last month that Abu Musab al-Barnawi was the new leader of Boko Haram, replacing the erratic Abubakar Shekau. The decision may have been prompted by Shekau\u2019s use of female suicide bombers and targeting of Muslims.</p> <p>Shekau has continued to claim to be in control of the group. A video released of the Chibok girls in August seemed to have come from his camp somewhere in the sprawling Sambisa forest, in Borno. It showed about 50 of the girls and included a demand for the release of imprisoned militants in exchange for them.</p> <p>A suicide bomber in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State and birthplace of Boko Haram, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-security-idUSKCN12C0XM\">killed eight people on Wednesday</a>.</p> <p>British and US special forces have been assisting the Nigerian military in their campaign against Boko Haram. Support by soldiers from the neighbouring countries of Niger, Cameroon and Chad \u2013 was critical in pushing back the extremists, experts said.</p> <p>The previous Nigerian government, under Goodluck Jonathan, conducted high-level negotiations before realising it was talking to impostors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/28/muhammadu-buhari-nigeria-problems-boko-haram-corruption\">Muhammadu Buhari talked tough on Nigeria\u2019s problems.

They can only bomb locations now because they hold no territory and we are defeating them at each stage. The government is negotiating with Boko Haram, including prisoner swaps, but at the same time we the military are degrading them where we can. That is proving an effective way of defeating this group.\u201d</p> <p>Elizabeth Donnelly, an expert at London\u2019s Chatham House, said the release suggested \u201ca potential opening with the insurgents\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere is still a question of why only this number [of girls has been released] but it shows that negotiations are possible and that is really important in trying to shift the nature of the conflict,\u201d Donnelly said.</p> <p>In the past year, the Nigerian army has retaken towns and villages in the north-east controlled by Boko Haram, and has freed hundreds of women and children held captive. However, many survivors face rejection or are stigmatised when they return to their families or are settled in refugee camps.</p> <p>In many areas of northern Nigeria, millions of victims of malnutrition, neglect and in some cases famine are surfacing, threatening a vast humanitarian crisis. Aid workers say hundreds of thousands of children are chronically malnourished.</p>",

  "<p>Hundreds of people have been wrongly refused bank accounts or had their driving licences revoked under the former home secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/10/immigration-bill-theresa-may-hostile-environment\">Theresa May\u2019s measures to \u201ccreate a hostile environment for illegal immigrants\u201d</a>, the immigration watchdog has revealed.</p> <p>David Bolt, the chief inspector of borders and immigration, said the Home Office had failed to appreciate the potential impact of such wrong decisions on those affected. </p> <p>His <a href=\"http://icinspector.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Hostile-environment-driving-licences-and-bank-accounts-January-to-July-2016.pdf\">report, published on Thursday</a>, shows that more than 250 people who had their driving licences revoked last year had been wrongfully identified as being in the UK illegally, as had 10% of those denied a bank or building society account.</p> <p>The chief inspector\u2019s first assessment of the initial 2014 phase of May\u2019s \u201chostile environment measures\u201d to deny public and private services to people with no legal right to be in the UK raises questions about whether ministers were justified in pressing ahead with phase two, due to come into effect next year. </p> <p>The second phase will create a new offence of driving unlawfully in Britain, and banks and building societies will be empowered to close the accounts of immigrants who are in the country illegally and freeze their assets.</p> <p>Bolt said there was insufficient hard evidence to determine whether the measures were achieving what the government intended, such as an increase in those voluntarily returning home. A proper evaluation was needed, he said, not least because of concerns about the potential damage of the measures to individuals and communities.</p> <p>In a separate report commissioned by May in January when she was home secretary, the chief inspector revealed that almost 200,000 foreign nationals had been arrested in 2014-15 in England and Wales. But the police asked the Home Office to carry out immigration status checks on only 30% of the foreign nationals arrested outside London. When the Metropolitan police force was included, the proportion whose immigration status was checked rose to just over 50%.</p> <p>The \u201chostile measures\u201d report reveals that 9,732 people had their driving licences revoked in 2015 after Home Office checks on their immigration status \u2013 close to the 10,000 a year target set by ministers. In total, 20,000 people have had their driving licences revoked since the measure was introduced in July 2014. </p> <p>Bolt said, however, that human error and poor quality Home Office data led to 259 people who were not in the country illegally having their driving licences revoked in 2015, and the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency had to reinstate them.</p> <p>\u201cWhile these cases amounted to a small percentage of the total numbers of revocations, the Home Office did not appear to appreciate the seriousness of such errors for the individuals affected,\u201d said the chief inspector.</p> <p>\u201cThis was particularly true where a licence had been revoked when the individual had departed the UK before their leave had expired.\u201d In such cases, if the person returned without knowing their licence had been revoked they faced being disqualified if they drove on British roads.</p> <p>He said only 583 of the 9,732 people who had their licences revoked in 2015 subsequently left the country. On top of that, only 475 revoked licences were actually returned to the DVLA in 2014-15.</p> <p>Bolt said it was not possible to say how many people were refused a bank or building society account on the grounds of being in the country illegally because the 2014 law does not require them to report customer refusals from immigration status checks.<br></p> <p>But, he said, a sample of 169 case files of those refused accounts showed that 17 (10%) should not have been listed as \u201cdisqualified persons\u201d on immigration grounds, despite the list being updated weekly.</p> <p> A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cAs the home secretary announced earlier this month, we will be introducing measures that will mean that banks will have to do regular checks to ensure that they are not providing banking services to illegal migrants. Furthermore, we are introducing a new power to search for and seize UK driving licences held by those living in the UK unlawfully. </p> <p> \u201cThe measures discussed in the independent chief inspector\u2019s report should not be seen in isolation, but as part of the wider action we are taking that has made it harder than ever before for illegal migrants to live in this country.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Have you ever wondered what it would sound like if Drake\u2019s barked barbs or sad-face mumbling were woven around the delicate strums of Sufjan Stevens\u2019 glacial tinkering? Really? You have? OK, weird, but good news for you because Tumblr has created Six Swans, a mashup album that does exactly that, so named because of Stevens\u2019 Seven Swans album and Drake\u2019s name for his hometown of Toronto. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/11/drake-vs-michael-jackson-american-music-awards-records\">Last name Ever, first name Greatest: why Drake's better than Michael Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Compiled by Riveyonce Cuoknowles (\u201cyour number one source for rivers cuomo and beyonc\u00e9 knowles\u201d, apparently) \u2013 <a href=\"https://riveyoncecuoknowles.tumblr.com\">a Tumblr account</a> that\u2019s also prone to the odd Sufjan/Drake fan fiction \u2013 the 11-track album pulls together various mash-ups from around the internet and is currently <a href=\"https://riveyoncecuoknowles.bandcamp.com/album/six-swans\">still available for free on Bandcamp</a>. Surprisingly, the whole thing works quite well \u2013 especially opener Death Over Dignity, which blends Stevens\u2019 delicate Carrie And Lowell opener with Drake\u2019s Over \u2013 with the pair\u2019s different musical approaches simultaneously coalescing and jarring to create a sort of sad aggression. As with most mashups, Six Swans relies on the initial thrill of an odd juxtaposition, its success or otherwise down to how long that feeling can last before the novelty wears off.</p> <p>Mashups (or blends or bootlegs or bastard pop songs) aren\u2019t new of course \u2013 your friends and mine Bill Buchanan and Dickie Goodman actually made the first one in 1956 \u2013 but since the invention of the internet, and the rise of the bedroom producer, they\u2019ve become more and more prevalent, either as standalone songs (who can forget <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShPPbT3svAw\">A Stroke of Genie-us</a>, ie Genie In A Bottle mashed with Hard To Explain), compilation albums (2ManyDJs\u2019 hugely influential 2003 album As Heard on Radio Soulwax Pt. 2) or albums that focus solely on blending two previously released bodies of work.</p> <p>Perhaps the most famous of the latter category is producer Danger Mouse\u2019s The Grey Album, released in 2004. A mashup of the vocal a cappellas from Jay Z\u2019s The Black Album and the Beatles\u2019 self-titled record, AKA The White Album, it went from intriguing art project meant for a few friends to a global success that inspired a slew of less inspired copycat albums. Again, the album works because it feels like more than just the sum of its parts, with Danger Mouse, AKA Brian Burton, recontextualising both sets of songs to create an exciting hybrid. Rather than aim to piss anyone off, The Grey Album is more a celebration of both artists, which, for better or worse, offers up fewer knowing winks than Six Swans.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3VVykEt37c\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O3VVykEt37c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>What The Grey Album achieved was a breakthrough into the mainstream media, as opposed to just being an odd novelty created by a lonely student after too many jazz cigarettes, which the internet goes mad for for a day or two (Entertainment Weekly named it the best album of 2004, Jay Z said it was \u201ca genius idea\u201d and Paul McCartney called it a \u201ctribute\u201d). In its wake, however, came the similarly straight-faced The Purple Album (Jay Z mixed with Prince), The Double Black Album (Jay Z mixed with Metallica) and The Black And Blue Album (Jay Z mixed with Weezer). Exhausting, right? But worse was to come, with the sheer availability of hip-hop a cappellas seen by some as an excuse to knock up any old nonsense. </p> <p>While acts such as Girl Talk and 3LAU looked to bring something fresh and fun to the table \u2013 or in the case of the latter\u2019s Dance Floor Filth, capitalize on the EDM explosion \u2013 others were keen to jump on the authentic mashup bandwagon. 2009\u2019s Jaydiohead, for example, seemed to get attention purely because Radiohead feel like a band most lonely wannabe musicians have tried to mashup using Cubase or whatever it is. 2011\u2019s The Juicy XX, meanwhile, aimed to combine Notorious BIG and The xx, but as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ5vnNIa3Xg\">Islands Is The Limit</a> shows, sometimes songs just aren\u2019t meant to be spliced together and no amount of lo-fi \u201ctexture\u201d can change that.</p> <p>What Six Swans and the new crop of mashups such as <a href=\"https://gibberishmass.bandcamp.com/album/good-boy-d-e-e-p-web\">Good Boy, d.E.E.p Web</a> (Kendrick Lamar and Childish Gambino) and Yeezer (Weezer songs mashed with Kanye West\u2019s oeuvre) show is a move back towards the off the cuff, more light-hearted experimentation following the post-Grey Album critical canonization. As the creator of Yeezer Alex Hodowanec told <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://radio.com/2015/10/05/yeezer-kanye-west-weezer-mashup-album-free-download/\">Radio.com</a>, his mashup album was the result of him listening to Weezer a lot with his mates one lost summer. \u201cThe first song I started working on was the first song on the album \u2013 which is Kanye\u2019s song Through The Wire mixed with Beverly Hills,\u201d he explained. \u201cI just kinda figured Beverly Hills was the most iconic Weezer song. It was really just a matter of finding songs that had similar feels and tempos from that point on.\u201d Sometimes it\u2019s as easy as that, with the thrill of a good mashup being as disposable as one play and then \u2013 as Jay Z once said \u2013 it\u2019s on to the next one.</p>",

  "<h2>BRUCE GLEE</h2> <p>When The Fiver first heard that Bernard Cribbins had been appointed Aston Villa manager we have to admit that we thought it was a wind-up. You see, the dusty blonde-haired, jolly, svelte-looking man waving a Villa scarf around like a fanboy and wearing a blinding white Hollywood smile for the snappers was not the Cribbins we know and occasionally make passing reference to in Bits and Bobs. No, that one left Hull City two-and-a-half months ago looking as tired and old as his Fiver nickname. This new one was something different altogether, as unidentifiable to The Fiver\u2019s eye as the Cribbins he purports to be\u2019s style of football. Or the DNA of Aston Villa, even. </p> <p>But if, indeed, it is the Cribbins we know and occasionally make passing reference to in Bits and Bobs, it is an appointment that surely suits both parties. Cribbins MkII can continue his incredible health-kick by teaming up with an owner who makes his millions in the wellbeing industry, while Dr Tony gets a manager who is the embodiment of the kind of makeover he would like to give Villa. The shrewd doc also benefits from appointing a man who has won promotion to the Premier League four times and, despite being known to Villa fans only as \u201cpotato head\u201d due to his affinity with Birmingham City, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/13/steve-bruce-aston-villa-championship-sunderland-hull-birmingham\">has actually been received well</a>. Could it be that someone at Villa has finally made a good decision?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/13/steve-bruce-aston-villa-championship-sunderland-hull-birmingham\">Steve Bruce shapes up to rewrite history with Aston Villa makeover | Louise Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt is one of the big clubs of this country.

I am absolutely delighted to have been given the chance. I hope I can do my stuff.\u201d The Fiver\u2019s not sure what that stuff is but perhaps the lack of any discernible traits in his tactical back catalogue, despite his promotion successes, is Cribbins\u2019 greatest strength. <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/guardianfootballweekly/sweeper-by-steve-bruce-as-read-by-iain-macintosh\">That, and his poetic prose.</a> Another off-the-radar flight into play-off contention would be a feat indeed after the dire start made by a collection of players with so little direction their recent performances could have been sold as a Michael Bay movie. In any case, Cribbins starts that flight against Wolves this weekend in a tasty derby.</p> <p>And while we\u2019re still on the subject of dusty blonde-haired managerial appointments in the Midlands that made The Fiver do a double-take, welcome back Steve McClaren. \u201cI am delighted at the prospect of finishing what we started,\u201d honked the new Derby manager, 17 months after being shoved through the Derby door marked Do One. Given that Derby currently sit only a couple of places above the drop zone, their new manager has recent experience of relegation, and he also managed to Thelma and Louise their form off a cliff the last time he was there, Derby better be clear about what it is that Steve wants to finish. </p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cChelsea is a world-class club with a rich tradition\u201d \u2013 Nike suit Trevor Edwards on deciding to shell out \u00a360m a season \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/13/chelsea-new-kit-deal-nike-60m\">until 2032!</a> \u2013 on a kit deal with the west London loanee farm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37013203e7c88e298cfb12d105ecf81773d1d74d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37013203e7c88e298cfb12d105ecf81773d1d74d/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Just need 179,999,999 more of these beauties.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Just need 179,999,999 more of these beauties.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2> <p>\u201cI\u2019d just got back from holiday when England lost to Iceland in the Euros, and I drifted off on the sofa just before kick-off and slept through the whole match.

(See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/13/boris-johnson-brexit-foreign-affairs-committee-quizzed-by-mps-over-brexit-as-pound-falls-again-politics-live?page=with:block-57ff6255e4b01ffb8ffcb3da#block-57ff6255e4b01ffb8ffcb3da\"> 11.33am.) </a>In some respects, this sounded more like a negotiating gambit than a statement of intent. As my colleague <strong>Severin Carrell </strong>points out (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/13/boris-johnson-brexit-foreign-affairs-committee-quizzed-by-mps-over-brexit-as-pound-falls-again-politics-live?page=with:block-57ff6ae1e4b047a4eaafc0e3#block-57ff6ae1e4b047a4eaafc0e3\">12.12pm), </a>there are still considerable obstacles to winning a second independence referendum. Sturgeon does not have the power to call a legally-binding independence referendum, and Theresa May has hinted that, unlike David Cameron in 2014,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/02/conservative-conference-may-to-explain-brexit-great-repeal-bill-in-marr-interview-politics-live?page=with:block-57f11d1ce4b015be63833667#block-57f11d1ce4b015be63833667\"> she would not facilitate such a poll. </a>Sturgeon also seems to be ignoring the promise she made last year, which was that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/oct/15/snp-conference-politics-live?page=with:block-561f77d9e4b0a565784b9ab1#block-561f77d9e4b0a565784b9ab1\">she would not call a second independence referendum unless there was \u201cstrong evidence that a significant number of those who voted No have changed their minds\u201d. </a>At the moment that evidence does not exist.</p> <ul> <li><strong>She made remaining in the single market Scotland\u2019s key priority.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister may have a mandate to take England and Wales out of the EU but she has no mandate whatsoever to remove any part of the UK from the single market.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she wanted Scotland to acquire extensive new powers.</strong> She explained that she would be developing a Brexit plan for Scotland and that, if Scotland were not to become independent, it needed to acquire new powers to ensure that it did not lose out from Brexit.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Scottish government will set out a plan for Scotland.</p> <p>We will seek to make this plan a key element of the UK\u2019s Article 50 negotiation.</p> <p>It will require substantial additional powers for the Scottish Parliament.</p> <p>All the powers in our areas of responsibility that currently lie with the EU - and significant new powers too.</p> <p>Powers to strike international deals.</p> <p>And greater powers over immigration. Powers not just to protect our economy, but also our values.</p> <p>UK ministers might believe it acceptable to order businesses to create lists of foreign workers.</p> <p>We do not.</p> </blockquote> <p>This passage suggests that, as an alternative to a second independence referendum, Sturgeon is demanding a new version of independence-lite.</p> <ul> <li><strong>She said a second independence referendum would not be a re-run of the last one.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is one final point I want to make. And it\u2019s an important one.</p> <p>When Scotland does come to take this decision again - whenever that might be - we must not take for granted how anyone will vote.<br></p> <p>It will be a new debate - not a rerun of 2014.</p> <p>We must not assume that people\u2019s views - yes or no - are the same today as they were two years ago.</p> <p>Instead we must engage the arguments with a fresh eye and an open mind.</p> <p>The case for independence will have to be made and won.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said the SNP would vote against the proposed \u201cgreat repeal bill\u201d - the bill planned for the next session of parliament to repeal the European Communities Act 1972.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can confirm today that SNP MPs will vote against the Brexit bill when it come before the House of Commons next year.</p> <p>That Bill will repeal the legislation that enacted our EU membership. Scotland didn\u2019t vote for that and so neither will our MPs.</p> <p>But we will also work to persuade others - Labour, Liberals and moderate Tories - to join us in a coalition against a hard Brexit: not just for Scotland, but for the whole UK.</p> <p>In practice this is unlikely to make much difference because Labour is unlikely to vote against the bill at second reading. Many Labour MPs are opposed to a \u201chard\u201d Brexit, but most of them do not intend to right against the principle of the UK leaving the EU.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said the Conservatives were pushing for a hard Brexit for which they had no mandate.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They are using the [referendum] result as cover for a hard Brexit for which they have no mandate - but which they are determined to impose, regardless of the ruinous consequences.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She accused the Conservatives of embracing Ukip-style xenophobia and said their views had \u201cno place in a civilised society\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Last week, in Birmingham, we heard an intolerance towards those from other countries that has no place in a modern, multicultural, civilised society.</p> <p>You know, on the day of the prime minister\u2019s speech to the Tory conference, the new leader of UKIP resigned.</p> <p>Perhaps she realized that her job and her party are now redundant.</p> <p>Last week, we saw the Tories adopt UKIP policy and Farage-style rhetoric - lock, stock and beer-barrel.</p> <p>It was a disgrace. It shames the Tory party and all who speak for it.</p> <p>But make no mistake - the right wing of the Tory party is now in the ascendancy and it is seeking to hijack the referendum result.</p> <p>Brexit has become Tory Brexit.</p> <p>The rampant right wing of the party are using it as license for the xenophobia that has long lain under the surface - but which is now in full, unlovely view.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She compared Theresa May to Margaret Thatcher. </strong>This was noteworthy because of Thatcher\u2019s continuing unpopularity in Scotland.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Sturgeon said that even though 1m Scots voted for Brexit, they did not vote for the hard Brexit now on offer from the Tories.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of course, I know that one million of our fellow citizens voted to Leave. They did so for a range of legitimate reasons and as first minister, I have a duty to listen to, to understand and to respond to these reasons.</p> <p>But I suspect that many of those who voted to Leave, look now at the actions and rhetoric of the Tories and think \u2018that\u2019s not what I voted for\u2019.</p> <p>They may have voted to take back control.</p> <p>But I can\u2019t imagine many of them voted to hand control to the unholy trinity of Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox ...</p> <p>They didn\u2019t vote to throw economic rationality out of the window.</p> <p>They didn\u2019t vote to lower their own living standards or to sacrifice jobs and investment.</p> <p>They didn\u2019t vote for our businesses to face tariffs or for holiday-makers to need visas.</p> <p>They didn\u2019t vote for the scapegoating of foreigners.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sturgeon\u2019s language at this point in the speech is similar to what has been said by Philip Hammond, the chancellor, who has also been arguing that the referendum vote was not a vote for \u201chard\u201d Brexit. (The problem for Hammond and Sturgeon is that there is ample evidence that people were voting for this, because the UK government warned very clearly about the economic consequences of Brexit, and Ukip\u2019s Nigel Farage even said explicitly that lower living standards would be a price worth paying for independence from Brussels.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39d5eb2b85593ab4fceb4117a9e7caf3fa36e8ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39d5eb2b85593ab4fceb4117a9e7caf3fa36e8ee/0_341_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Sturgeon addressing her conference today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicola Sturgeon addressing her conference today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ff6ae1e4b047a4eaafc0e3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/severincarrell\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T11:12:57.306Z\">12.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Speeding up the referendum bill process opens up a deepening and increasingly significant political divide between the Scottish and UK governments, signalling Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s increasing confidence that the Tories shift to a harder line stance on Brexit has strengthened her hand.</p> <p>But she made clear that was to protect her government\u2019s longer term position.

Here is an extract from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6a4e6bd4-84ae-11e6-8897-2359a58ac7a5\">a withering column about him that <strong>Philip Stephens </strong>published in the Financial Times (subscription) recently.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Word in Westminster has it that Boris Johnson would like to apologise personally to Barack Obama for raising his \u201cpart-Kenyan\u201d ancestry when the US president backed the pro-Europeans during the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/themes/Brexit\">EU referendum</a>. Word in Washington is that the UK foreign secretary would do as well not to bother. Such slights are not easily forgotten by the first African-American president.</p> <p>Mr Johnson seems to have something of a problem with, well, foreigners. Fellow Europeans have not forgiven the mendacity of the EU \u201cout\u201d campaign. Some in Africa may recall his allusions, albeit some while ago, to \u201cpiccaninnies\u201d and \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d. He says such remarks have been taken out of context. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2e356f76-84bd-11e6-a29c-6e7d9515ad15\">Visiting Ankara this week</a> he presumably told his hosts something similar about the Leave campaign\u2019s scaremongering about Turkish migrants.</p> <p>Foreign policy is a serious business, the more so in an age of global upheaval and rising disorder. Mr Johnson looks more comfortable in the role of court jester than thoughtful policymaker. He prefers the broad brush to irksome detail. His Italian opposite number Paolo Gentiloni was left baffled when Mr Johnson proposed a post-Brexit grand bargain: Italy would back open access to the EU for London\u2019s financial industry and Britain would continue to drink lots of Italian prosecco.</p> <p>Word in Berlin is that Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the intensely serious German foreign minister, can scarcely abide being in the same room as Mr Johnson. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b1a3c3e-81b7-11e6-8e50-8ec15fb462f4\">Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble</a>, Germany\u2019s finance minister, has mocked the foreign secretary\u2019s shallow grasp of the way the union works by offering to send him the Lisbon treaty. Finance ministers, he remarked waspishly, were \u201caccustomed to having a high degree of respect for foreign ministers\u201d. It might be added that Theresa May, the prime minister, is banking on Berlin\u2019s support to secure a good deal in the Brexit negotiations.</p> <p>Allies say that Mr Johnson is \u201ca quick read\u201d \u2014 when paying attention, he absorbs information easily. Whitehall no doubt has laid on crash seminars on the workings of the world.

  "<p>In my 20 or so years working with the development sector I\u2019ve long been extremely uncomfortable with the idea that we in the \u201cnorth\u201d know better than those in the \u201csouth\u201d. We certainly have more material resources, and so more power and opportunities than many, but development as something rich people do to poor people doesn\u2019t gel well with me. Nowadays, many people working in development would agree with this view.</p> <p>And yet we still send our workers to developing countries to \u201cbuild capacity\u201d; we send young volunteers there to help out in their gap year; and we constantly lecture poorer countries about the vagaries of everything from corruption to inequality.

The sustainable development goals (SDGs) were lauded, in part, because they were universal: yes, Sierra Leone or Vietnam has to adopt them but so, too, does the UK. We may be able to offer financial resources to the south, but the south has a considerable store of knowledge to offer us, too. \u201cReverse development\u201d is what we need, and we should set up a northern based agency staffed by southerners to help build our own capacity to meet the SDGs. Some examples come to mind. </p> <h2><strong>Gender equality (goal five)</strong> </h2> <p>Nicaragua, Rwanda and Ecuador all rank higher than the UK in the <a href=\"http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2014/rankings/\" rel=\"nofollow\">World Economic Forum\u2019s global gender gap</a>. Fewer than a third of our MPs are women, ranking us 49th in the world in terms of the number of women in national parliaments. Many developing countries are doing far better. What can we learn from them? How did they achieve it? What systems do we need to put in place? </p> <h2><strong>Affordable and clean energy (goal seven)<br></strong></h2> <p>Micro grid and off grid, affordable solar energy is taking off in the developing world. Rather than waiting for mega projects many, such as <a href=\"http://meragaopower.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mera Gao Power</a> in Uttar Pradesh, India, or <a href=\"http://www.karibusolar.com/about-us/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Karibu</a> solar in Tanzania, are showing how it\u2019s done. Where are our energy social entrepreneurs? We have a swath of community energy projects, but large Hinkley-style money pits still dominate our energy landscape. Can we learn from the southern social entrepreneurs and just get on with it? Can they build our capacity to innovate? <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/sep/02/philanthropists-revolution-libraries-grassroots\">The trouble with philanthropy is that money can't buy equality</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Sustainable consumption (goal 12)</strong> </h2> <p>Several development economists, from Amartya Sen to Manfred Max Neef, have looked at the role of wellbeing and poverty, and considered wellbeing to be the ultimate aim, rather than macro-level economic growth, jobs, or even income. People in developing countries can help us gain a much better understanding of how to live the good life, while consuming less. Clearly, the poor don\u2019t have enough material needs or security to have high levels of wellbeing. But having a higher income and consuming more isn\u2019t necessarily a recipe to success either. Rather than exporting our overladen consumer culture to the south, we should be learning from and listening to those whose lives are reported as having high levels of satisfaction, yet who consume fewer material resources. </p> <h2><strong>Peace, justice and strong institutions (goal 16)</strong></h2> <p>Western criminal justice systems are almost entirely based on punishment for bad behaviour. <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/pdf/criminal_justice/06-56290_Ebook.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">In many African countries</a>, and indigenous communities through the world, customary law focuses more on reconciliation and social responsibility.

Why aren\u2019t we doing more of this in the developed world? </p> <p>Other examples come to mind \u2013 the digital economy is adapting far more rapidly in some parts of the south, such as India, than in the north. Care of older people, meanwhile, also has elements we need to adopt more of in the north, such as how to look after extended families in the home. </p> <p>Development is no longer a one-way street. \u201cReverse development\u201d may be as important for the next 60 years, as north-south development has been for the past 60. <br></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

Trust your guts. Seriously \u2013 I know a lot of big pop stars have been made, I am aware of that, but I\u2019m not that kind of type. I mean I wouldn\u2019t have been the one they chose in an audition because I don\u2019t sing perfectly and I don\u2019t look particularly great.\u201d</p> <p>On stage, M\u00f8 is a tornado. Her dancing is uninhibited and wild, as if she were in the audience rather than centre-stage. She is fiercely present, never vacant or going through the motions. She almost always ends up crowdsurfing or in the pit.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s that urge to let something out. It is your place to express yourself and share it in the moment \u2013 and in a way it\u2019s the most nerve-racking thing in the world. But it can also be the most relieving thing because you\u2019re always [led by] control and schedule \u2013 which is great because I mean it\u2019s the dream life I\u2019m living, I\u2019m so happy \u2013 but there are a lot of things where you\u2019ve got to be controlled all the time.</p> <p>\u201cOnce I go on stage I can just fuck up. And I love that. I love to be free and don\u2019t think about if I look good or sing perfectly. It\u2019s just \u2018blaaaaagh!\u2019 It\u2019s so nice. Just watching that punk show \u2013 that was where I have it from. Just screaming and shouting and rolling on the floor. It\u2019s the most fucking great thing to do. To just let go.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37qvCrbilUk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/37qvCrbilUk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Drum</figcaption> </figure>   <p>That freedom translates less well when you\u2019ve got three minutes to promote a single on prime time American TV, however. Before her big Major Lazer hit, M\u00f8 was a guest vocal on rapper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/iggy-azalea\" title=\"\">Iggy Azalea</a>\u2019s track Beg for It. In October 2014, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh9cbInp_Og\" title=\"\">they appeared on Saturday Night Live</a> to perform the track, but things didn\u2019t go to plan. M\u00f8 was awkward and, because of technical difficulties, out of time. She was a strange gothic ghost weaving in between a pristine pop machine. In its aftermath, the tabloids declared it \u201ca performance flub\u201d. She cried for three days and felt down for a week.</p> <p>\u201cMy attitude towards playing those big shows at the time? I was thinking: \u2018Yeah, I don\u2019t need to warm up for an hour.\u2019 I\u2019d always been like: \u2018I don\u2019t want to do a choreography. I\u2019m going to go in and be myself and it really doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019 But it didn\u2019t fit with their format and I was tapping into their thing,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cIt was such a different world for me to suddenly stand there. I was sad that I didn\u2019t know how to be myself in that and make it work. But you make it work for yourself. There have been a couple of things during my career where I\u2019ve been looking back where I\u2019ve thought: I shouldn\u2019t have done that. But again, you learn from it and that\u2019s a blessing in a way. A big blessing. Because I\u2019m someone who needs to burn my hands to know.\u201d</p> <p>Her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZyc6wIUOb4\" title=\"\">recent appearance on Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s show</a> suggests she has learned. The next challenge is finishing her upcoming album; an album that is surely weighted with the pressure to surpass the success of a Bieber-boosted hit and Lean On.</p> <p>\u201cI always dreamed about having a hit but I never thought it would happen so when it happened I was like: \u2018Huh? Can I really be a part of this? How the fuck is this even possible?\u2019 For the album, I want to have success but let\u2019s say my next album\u2019s going to fail. That will bring me something great again. It won\u2019t be putting water on the fire, it will just put gasoline on it. Because I\u2019ll be, like, fuck! I want to show them! Arrrrrgh! Which is a good thing. Of course I\u2019m scared \u2013 don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 but it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s good fear,\u201d she says, reconsidering, renegotiating. \u201cI think it\u2019s good actually.

  "<p>After a new analysis found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/austin-texas-police-use-force-race-black-hispanic\">clear racial disparities</a> in the Austin police department\u2019s use of force across different neighborhoods, the police chief in the Texas city is pledging to continue the department\u2019s training programs on implicit and explicit racial bias.<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"http://policingequity.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Austin_PDI_Report_2016_Release.pdf\">analysis</a>, which looks at racial disparities after controlling for crime rates and income and education levels, is designed to be easily adaptable to other cities. Guardian US spoke to police chief Art Acevedo about the new findings, why he\u2019s making them public, and why he hopes other cities will follow Austin\u2019s example. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/austin-texas-police-use-force-race-black-hispanic\">Austin police use force more often in black and Hispanic areas, study finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Guardian US: </strong><strong>What made you feel willing and interested in having this data analyzed and looked at \u2013 knowing it would open the department up to criticism? </strong></p> <p><strong>Acevedo: </strong>First and foremost, as an organization, we\u2019re committed to the concept of procedural justice. We\u2019re also sophisticated enough to realize that as much as we are always pursuing excellence, that we\u2019re an imperfect organization, as is the human condition. We\u2019re committed to transparency and we\u2019re committed to any process that will help us identify areas where we can do better. </p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve seen the report. What do you make of it? </strong><strong> </strong></p> <p>My reaction is, we are doing a lot of things really well, including demonstrating to our community our commitment to transparency and our commitment to always trying to do better. </p> <p>In terms of how we\u2019re policing and who we\u2019re searching, we\u2019re doing a heck of a job of identifying folks involved with criminal behavior and criminal conduct, and our methodology in terms of the way we search people, when we search people, are probably looking pretty good. When you look at our hit ratio, it\u2019s one of the highest in the nation. We have one of the most restrictive consent search policies in the nation. What that does is it makes police officers actually do police work, and rely on probable cause. </p> <p>We don\u2019t subscribe to the notion that just because somebody lives in an area that is disproportionately affected by violent crime or any type of crime that people should be treated any differently. When a person gets stopped for the 10th time in these communities where they subscribe to the notion of stop and frisk \u2013 stop anything that moves, and frisk everybody in that drag net \u2013 by the 10th time that you\u2019re stopped, you end up creating a lot of problems in terms of legitimacy. </p> <p>The part that obviously we read in there in terms of some disproportionality in use of force, is something that we are somewhat aware of. </p> <p>We\u2019re a department also that takes use of force, response to resistance, very seriously. I think what it tells me is that we still have more work to do. We have to continue to work in terms of our training on implicit and explicit bias for our department. Dr Lorie Fridell is here this month from Florida, to be providing more training in that area. </p> <p><strong>How will you explain to your officers what this report found, and why you decided to go public with it, and what you\u2019re going to do about it? </strong></p> <p>My cops will not be surprised by the fact that we\u2019re participating in this. They know that this is a journey. We will talk to them about the fact that there is a use of force disparity and our next step for us is that we continue to evaluate our training in terms of de-escalation. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Part of the problem of bias is that too often we don\u2019t create a safe space for people to talk about their feelings</p> <footer> <cite>Art Acevedo</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Part of the problem of bias is that too often we don\u2019t create a safe space for people to be able to talk about their feelings. By having these trainings that we\u2019re having, we\u2019re hoping to create some safe spaces for people to be able to openly talk about their perceptions and their feelings and their experiences. Self-awareness goes a long way, so they can maybe have that second thought in their mind to evaluate: \u201cAm I acting because I have to, or am I acting because of a bias?\u201d </p> <p>Everybody needs to do their own self-assessment and make sure they\u2019re using force not because they can, but because they completely, absolutely need to. Making sure they\u2019re treating people through the prism of a suspect\u2019s action and not through the prism of race or the prism of ethnicity or what part of the city I\u2019m patrolling in. </p> <p>We are going to talk to our officers that our belief and the community\u2019s belief that the very vast majority of them continue to do the right thing for the right reasons. </p> <p>We\u2019ll also talk to them about our commitment to continue to work with the community in terms of building relationships of trust. One of the causes of response to resistance issues is when there\u2019s a challenge with trust, and right now there\u2019s a challenge with trust nationwide. </p> <p><strong>Do you think other departments will follow your lead here? How would you talk to chiefs or mayors in other cities about the risks and benefits of doing this? </strong></p> <p>Listen, you can be an ostrich as a leader, and bury your head in the sand, or you can be forward-thinking and be scanning the environment constantly for threats or for opportunities to do better. </p> <p>I would rather always be transparent. I really think that people are smart. I think that most Austinites that you talk to, including our communities of color, know that although we\u2019re not a perfect organization, they know that on balance we\u2019re a pretty damn good organization. They know and they trust that we\u2019re always trying to do the right thing. We are looking forward to setting the tone for the rest of the nation. </p> <p>The problem being the only department that does it, there\u2019s no other points of reference. How do we stack up? </p> <p>With 18,000 police departments, I really believe that we\u2019re only as good as the weakest department in the nation. We\u2019re all a reflection of one another. When things go sideways, it impacts police departments and relationships, it has an impact nationwide. </p> <p>It seems that almost weekly we have a use of force incident captured on camera that goes viral. People don\u2019t know where one jurisdiction ends and another begins. And I think the standing of the profession is probably being challenged more than ever in the history of our policing in this nation, and the professionalism of this noble profession and the commitment to legitimacy is being questioned like it\u2019s never been questioned. </p> <p>I\u2019m starting to hear folks say: \u201cWell, even when we do everything that\u2019s required of us, we might end up getting killed by the police,\u201d and that\u2019s a challenge because when people have that mindset, I think it creates more potential for people not to submit to the lawful authority of law enforcement officers. </p> <p>We don\u2019t just need to be data-driven, we also need to be relationship-driven. </p> <p>The more departments that do these things \u2013 the more departments that collect data, that actually are committed to transparency \u2013 when communities see the profession willing to be committed to transparency, the community knows that\u2019s the first step to building legitimacy. </p> <p>When you look at what\u2019s going on with government, mistrust of government in our nation\u2019s history is a historic high. The most visible cog of the wheel we call government is law enforcement. It\u2019s police departments. We\u2019re paying the cost of not just our own actions, but we\u2019re paying the cost, as a profession, of the mistrust of government in general. </p> <p><strong>What kind of response do you expect from community groups in Austin? </strong></p> <p>We make all our data publicly available every year. They know there\u2019s some disparities there in terms of use of force. What we continue to work on as a community is, how do we manage that? </p> <p>We\u2019ve had, over the years, a couple of really challenging use of deadly force encounters. What\u2019s happened around the country hasn\u2019t happened here in terms of some of the violence in response to these use of force encounters. We spend a lot of time building emotional capital with the community that we serve, working with Black Lives Matter, working with the Austin Justice Coalition, working with Measure Austin \u2013 these are all young activists here in our city. </p> <p>All of those things that we do help us overcome issues when we\u2019re not quite to where we want to be, or when we have an incident where we fall short.</p>",

The government has now agreed to conduct one but the results will not be known until at least 2019. But a survey in Gujarat, one of the richest Indian states, established a far higher prevalence of TB than had been thought and together with other evidence, it has been possible to come up with a better estimate than in previous years.</p> <p>Work has been going on to encourage doctors in the private sector to report TB cases, which they are not obliged to do and have not done in the past. In the slums of Mumbai, Ayurvedic doctors and healers who see most of the patients have been encouraged to give out the free antibiotics to treat TB alongside traditional remedies, and to report the numbers of patients they see. A digital reporting system has been introduced with some success.</p> <p>India wins praise from WHO but its actions have served to highlight the scale of the problem. Of the 10.4m cases worldwide, only 6.1m were detected and treated in 2015. Those undetected risk passing the bacteria that causes TB to their families. Countries do not have the rapid testing equipment they need.</p> <p>There is particular concern over drug-resistant TB, which affects 580,000 people. Only half of those who get a strain resistant to the standard antibiotic combination of drugs survive.

Sure, it played an important role in the Arab spring and other popular movements (though that role has often been exaggerated), but it surprises me the extent to which the mainstream media still dominates political discourse. What will it take to change this? As Chris Bogle, below, points out, we are so busy and so wrapped up in the immediate daily demands of our lives that it is hard to put in the kind of time and resources that the professional media is able to deploy. So is the dream of political change through technology a false one?

It redefines citizens as consumers, whose democratic choices are best exercised by buying and selling, a process that rewards merit and punishes inefficiency. It maintains that \u201cthe market\u201d delivers benefits that could never be achieved by planning.<br />Sign up to our Bookmarks newsletter<br />Read more</p> <p>Attempts to limit competition are treated as inimical to liberty. Tax and regulation should be minimised, public services should be privatised. The organisation of labour and collective bargaining by trade unions are portrayed as market distortions that impede the formation of a natural hierarchy of winners and losers. Inequality is recast as virtuous: a reward for utility and a generator of wealth, which trickles down to enrich everyone. Efforts to create a more equal society are both counterproductive and morally corrosive. The market ensures that everyone gets what they deserve.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ff81ede4b01ffb8ffcb49b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/guardian-readers\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T12:46:30.364Z\">1.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Is the answer to  reject consumerism?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One reader offers an interesting solution to all of this.

By which I mean, we seem to have a deep rooted and ugly mentality in our (western industrial) society, where people on lower incomes are ostracised because of their financial modesty. I believe this is a direct result of the competitive, money motivated basis of the neoliberal/capitalist society, and has resulted in the marginalisation of those without means. </p> <p>It is a fact that wherever you go/whatever you do, in the UK especially, it costs you money. Even a walk in the park will often incur parking fees. Whereas conversely (and somewhat perversely), a shopping centre will often offer free parking, making it an ideal place to while away the hours, where you are then bombarded with imagery/advertising reminding you how terrible your life is, and how much better it would be if you bought more stuff.</p> <p>So I think my question is, if our toxic money/consumer mad culture is directly responsible for the loneliness/isolation epidemic, can we start by rejecting consumerism and its rudimentary pigeonholing of the haves and have not's. Can we start looking at ways to value people outside of what they own/earn, as a way to re-connect people?</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ff7e0fe4b016012389560e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T12:30:04.099Z\">1.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Can we link neoliberalism to Brexit?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One question from one of our readers raises interesting questions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/live/2016/oct/13/is-neoliberalism-creating-loneliness-in-our-society-ask-george-monbiot#comment-85327685\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4135628\" title=\"View carbonfiend\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/4135628\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for carbonfiend\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4135628\" title=\"View carbonfiend\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">carbonfiend</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/85327685\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">13 October 2016 12:27pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Can we link neoliberalism to why whole communites voted for Brexit ?

Our society has developed a vocabulary and style of language use quite different to previous cultures. This style of language use appears to have developed after powerful rulers took over our societies with the first civilizations, and this vocabulary and language style was developed to facilitate their control of our societies. I've since found that this is not a new idea, and if you see this video by Marshall Rosenberg who founded the concept of Non-violent Communication NVC, you will see he makes similar points.<br /><a href=\"https://youtu.be/-dpk5Z7GIFs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/-dpk5Z7GIFs</a></p> <p>I believe the reason for the failur of social progress, and the transition to a sustainable economy has failed is because our language style and use is actually designed to perpetuate the status quo. The most fundamental task of the early powerful rulers of our society, and all hierarchical societies ever since, has been to stop people overthrowing them. To do this it was necessary to detach people from the natural environment and their fellow people, to stop them caring so much about what was happening.</p> <p>Without going into great detail, I believe our language style and use creates deliberate detachment. Detachment from our own feelings and emotions, detachment from other people and detachment from the natural world. In our culture's language style the most important referent is an idea, a definition of the word, not the thing, the actual phenomenon refers to. By having abstract ideas as the primary referent of words and terms, it leads to detachment and a \u201cblindness of abstraction\u201d. We feel detached when thinking about an abstract idea, and what the words or terms refer to are not immediate and deeply felt. In particular it leads to a major logical error, where the person \u201cmistakes the map for the territory\u201d i.e. the word and idea becomes more real to them, than the actual phenomena the words, terms or ideas refers to.<br /><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation</a></p> <p>What I am saying is that to solve the problem, we need to understand how the language use and style our culture has developed, detaches from other people, and the natural world, and makes us highly completive, and allows us to ignore the consequences. What do you think of this? I realise it is a bit complex for a Q&amp;A, and this is something for you to consider.</p> <p>Just to clarify this I am saying that this vocabulary and language use developed over time after the rise of the first civilizations, essentially controls how people perceive the world around them, and how they think about it. It need not be like this if the map-territory relationship was far more widely understood, and everyone was to understand why the map is never the territory.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ff78ace4b01ffb8ffcb462\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T12:07:23.580Z\">1.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Loneliness and consumerism</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>George has started responding below the line, with this question triggering some interesting debate:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/live/2016/oct/13/is-neoliberalism-creating-loneliness-in-our-society-ask-george-monbiot#comment-85323882\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12782799\" title=\"View LionelKent\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/12782799\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for LionelKent\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12782799\" title=\"View LionelKent\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">LionelKent</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/85323882\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">13 October 2016 11:55am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>George, I believe that with few exceptions, if any, a neoliberal politician will endorse consumerism and the force behind it, i.e. the constant, ubiquitous, and frenetic generation of artificial demand.

I do believe that consumerism plays an important role, as it is one of the factors that drives competition and a sense of social threat.

Hence the term retail therapy.</p> <p>But it extends far beyond the purchase of staff, significant as this is. I believe that the ethic of consumerism now infects away we view ourselves and present our self-image to the world.

The group is short of manpower and has turned to abductions as recruitment has slowed.<br></p> <p>Negotiations with Nigerian government representatives for the release of the schoolgirls have been complicated by splits within Boko Haram. The movement has fractured into two, possibly three factions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/06/isis-al-qaida-turf-wars-africa-may-push-fragile-states-to-breaking-point\">over the issue of links with Islamic State</a>.</p> <p>Isis, of which the Nigerian group is still theoretically an affiliate, announced last month that Abu Musab al-Barnawi was Boko Haram\u2019s new leader, replacing the erratic Abubakar Shekau.

A video released of the Chibok girls in August seemed to have come from his camp somewhere in the sprawling Sambisa forest, in Borno. It showed about 50 of the girls and included a demand for the release of imprisoned militants in exchange for them.</p> <p>The previous government, under Goodluck Jonathan, conducted high-level negotiations before realising it was talking to impostors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/18/chibok-abducted-girls-women-north-east-nigeria-boko-haram-video\">The Chibok girls are just one part of the ordeal of women in north-east Nigeria | Chitra Nagarajan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Buhari\u2019s government was previously thought to be attempting to rescue the girls.

And the UK has not maximised its opportunities for multilateral cooperation on the many challenges and crises facing the international community. Despite these challenges, however, British influence on the global stage has been multiplied by the EU, as was clear with the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/14/iran-nuclear-deal-key-points\" title=\"\">Iranian nuclear deal</a>.

There is little to suggest that Theresa May\u2019s government will address foreign policy shortcomings as it grapples with political and economic problems at home. Brexit will not only hurt our capacity to address international challenges but we also lack a proactive foreign policy to take its place.</p> <p>It could be the despots, the Russians and rising powers such as China who will have the last laugh: isolation and division enables them to enhance their own influence and presence in volatile regions such as the Middle East, while also enabling them to challenge the international order.</p>",
  "<p>I\u2019ll never forget the first time Jessica Ennis-Hill blew me away. It was 2009 and we were following her progress at the world championships in Berlin. Her buildup to the event had been horrible \u2013 missing the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games with a broken ankle and having to retrain for the long jump using a different leg for take off. We knew she was in brilliant form, despite the setbacks, but in the shot put she stuttered. Two weak throws and her points tally suddenly looked shaky. Then, on her final attempt, she gathered herself together and pulled out a personal best.</p> <p>That\u2019s Jess all over. Queen of the bounceback. Determination off the scale. Winner of five golds, three silvers and one bronze. Some people celebrate that kind of moment by punching the air, or leering in the face of their opponents.

It was what I call real athletics, old-school, grassroots stuff \u2013 families wrapped up in anoraks, sheltering from the wind, flasks of tea, kids running about, results written up in pencil and taped to the wall.

The authors found that the scheme, which was not always solicited by the countries where it was introduced, resulted in wealthy donor countries engaging in the tax systems of countries where they had clear business interests.

The issue has a disproportionate effect on developing countries, where <a href=\"http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/wir2015_en.pdf\">about 10% of government revenues</a> are generated by tax on multinational corporations, so boosting tax income would build self-reliance and lessen reliance on foreign aid.</p> <p>Tax Inspectors Without Borders works on the premise that tax audit experts from OECD countries transfer their knowledge and skills to auditors in developing countries, using guidelines laid down in a dedicated guide \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-global/tax-inspectors-without-borders-toolkit.pdf\">or \u201ctoolkit\u201d</a> (pdf) \u2013 to provide a framework on auditing issues including confidentiality, conflict of interest and indemnity. </p> <p>Crucially, according to <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/ctp/tax-global/tax-inspectors-without-borders-summary.pdf\">official OECD guidelines</a>, the host country must request the intervention. However, Tove Maria Ryding, tax coordinator at Eurodad and co-author of the report, said research suggested that was not the case.</p> <p>\u201cThere is little publicly available information about Tax Inspectors Without Borders, but the little information that we have found \u2013 particularly within internal OECD documents that have not been published before \u2013 is very worrying,\u201d Ryding said.</p> <p>Those documents indicated that developing countries failed to either understand or engage with the pilot projects, Ryding added. </p> <p>The Eurodad report focused on three pilot schemes involving the UK and Rwanda, France and Senegal, and the Netherlands and Ghana. </p> <p>\u201cIn all three cases, the developing country was not leading the project,\u201d said Ryding. \u201cThere was a certain scepticism towards the idea and a low-level understanding about what was happening. </p> <p>\u201cIn all three cases, we also saw that the donor country, which was sending the expert, had very substantial corporate interests in the developing country. In other words, many of the multinational corporations that were being taxed by the developing country\u2019s tax administration, were from the [same] countries that were funding these projects and sending these experts.\u201d</p> <p>The report found that in the case of the 2014 UK-Rwanda pilot, led by the Department for International Development (DfID), PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) played a \u201ccentral management role\u201d despite the global accountancy firm\u2019s commitment to <a href=\"http://www.pwc.com/rw/en/services/tax-services.html\">\u201clobbying for tax changes with governments and revenue authorities on behalf of our clients\u201d</a>. </p> <p>The UK government\u2019s \u201cbusiness guide\u201d to Rwanda clearly states that about 150 British companies are registered in the African nation, with bilateral trade worth \u00a321m in 2014.

The TIWB toolkit contains extensive advice and provides host administrations with detailed guidance on how conflicts of interest can arise, as well as how they should be avoided.\u201d</p> <p>With a worldwide deployment of at least 100 tax experts expected by 2019 Christensen said the international community must shift its thinking on tax and sustainable development.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to move away from the idea that poorer countries need tax breaks \u2013 the sweetheart deals, the lower tax rates \u2013 to attract investment. Investments attract because of the market, a good labour force, good infrastructure, and all of that takes tax dollars,\u201d said Christensen.</p> <p>\u201cIf we want to look beyond aid dependency \u2013 because no one wants to have aid be such an important part of government revenue \u2013 then tax has got to be that support.

  "<p>In the 1990s, a simple survey in Vienna led urban planners to rethink<em> </em>their whole approach to infrastructure development. The questionnaire asked residents why and how they used public transportation, and the results were striking because men and women had very different responses. Men\u2019s typical route was short and simple: often to and from work. Women\u2019s responses, however, were complex and varied, usually including multiple trips a day on the metro as well as on foot: dropping off children at school, going to the doctor, getting groceries, visiting an older family member, back to school for pick up. </p> <p>This prompted a moment of realisation for Vienna\u2019s city planners: infrastructure has a gendered aspect to it; women and men have different needs and uses for public structures and systems. As a result, the planners adapted transportation projects to women\u2019s needs, adding street lights so women were safer walking at night and widening sidewalks to make it easier to move around with walkers, strollers or wheelchairs. <br></p> <p>Similarly, cities in Bangladesh recently sought to serve women more equitably in infrastructure improvements. They recognised that this begins with understanding what women need. The programme made sure women had representation in local governments and a voice in urban planning \u2013 down to the very construction of buildings. <a href=\"https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/28743/gender-case-study-ban.pdf\">The project</a> [pdf] built separate toilet facilities for women at markets and transportation hubs across the country \u2013 identified as a key need. In addition, it increased women working in construction projects by 50%. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/sep/28/four-myths-about-slums-dont-assume-people-want-to-leave\">Four myths about slums: 'Don't assume people want to leave'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s not just transportation systems; women and men use public spaces, buildings, and even access basic services differently. In areas where resources of all kinds are more limited, these disparities become especially acute, affecting women\u2019s safety, movement and income. This is particularly true in parts of the global south, where urban planning struggles to even keep up with basic use \u2013 much less encourage gender equality.</p> <p>There are a few target areas where infrastructure improvements make a big difference in women\u2019s lives \u2013 and livelihoods. </p> <h2><strong>Safety in public places</strong></h2> <p>Basic safety is a top concern for women in public spaces across the world. The statistics are sobering, more than 83% of Egyptian women have been sexually harassed on Cairo\u2019s streets; a rape is reported every 29 minutes in New Delhi and only 12% of women in Lima feel safe in the city, <a href=\"http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2011/6/un-launches-initiative-to-make-cities-safer-for-women-and-children\">according to the UN</a>.

The multiple trips a day to and from water sources eat up women\u2019s time, drawing them away from other activities like education and employment. </p> <h2><strong>Incorporating women\u2019s needs starts with better data</strong></h2> <p>The good news is cities around the world have <a href=\"http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTSOCIALDEVELOPMENT/Resources/244362-1265299949041/6766328-1270752196897/Gender_Infrastructure2.pdf\">made progress</a> [pdf] incorporating the needs of both genders in infrastructure planning, but this has not yet been <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dpr.12128/epdf?r3_referer=wol&amp;tracking_action=preview_click&amp;show_checkout=1&amp;purchase_referrer=www.google.com&amp;purchase_site_license=LICENSE_DENIED_NO_CUSTOMER\">institutionalised everywhere</a>. </p> <p>As a first step, we need a better understanding of how women and men experience and use public spaces. Sometimes the implications are counter-intuitive to typical planning. For example, urban investments that focused on \u201ccleaning up\u201d and beautifying cities in India drove off roadside hawkers and street vendors. But it was these <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/of-safety-and-inclusivity/article5135071.ece\">extra eyes</a> and people on the street that helped women feel and stay safe. <br></p> <p>Currently, the limited amount of urban datasets that track and trend data on gender make it hard to develop infrastructure programmes that factor in women\u2019s needs. According to the <a href=\"http://hungerreport.org/missingdata/\">Hunger Report</a>, 92% of gender specific economic data and 76.9% of gender health data is missing from sub-Saharan Africa. Cities and municipal authorities should mandate that existing surveys or other forms of input from residents mirror the demographics of the area \u2013 proportional to the gender balance and also by age. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/sep/28/architecture-and-prisons-why-design-matters\">Architecture and prisons: why design matters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Empowering women as leaders of urban research and local governance via community social audits, like a recent audit by the Social Justice Coalition on <a href=\"http://www.internationalbudget.org/publications/social-justice-coalition-report-of-the-khayelitsha-mshengu-toilet-social-audit\">access to sanitation in Khayelitsha,</a> South Africa, have shown to be powerful tools.

As the world prepares for the forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.habitat3.org/\">Habitat III</a> conference in Ecuador next week, we need to encourage government officials, development organisations, and private sector partners to prioritise gender-inclusive infrastructure planning across the world\u2019s cities.</p> <p>Additionally, local governments and planning departments need support in educating and recruiting more female planners in ways that mirror the demographic and social make up of local environments.

  "<p>Nicola Sturgeon warned that she was prepared to stage a second Scottish independence referendum before the UK quits the European Union as she attacked the Tories for their \u201cxenophobic\u201d rhetoric on the EU.</p> <p>In a clear challenge to Theresa May\u2019s government in London, the first minister told the Scottish National party conference in Glasgow she would unveil draft legislation next week to prepare for a rerun of the 2014 referendum within the next two years.</p> <p>Sturgeon said the UK government\u2019s recent rhetoric on capping immigration and on quitting the EU single market made it clear that the Tory party had been taken over by its \u201crampant and xenophobic\u201d right wing. To applause from delegates, Sturgeon singled out the prime minister and declared: \u201cHear this: if you think for one single second that I\u2019m not serious about doing what it takes to protect Scotland\u2019s interests, then think again.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/13/boris-johnson-brexit-foreign-affairs-committee-quizzed-by-mps-over-brexit-as-pound-falls-again-politics-live\">Nicola Sturgeon to publish new independence referendum bill for Scotland - Politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her official spokesman cautioned that this was designed to give the Scottish government the full range of options. Sturgeon had a dual-track strategy and her immediate goal was to get the strongest powers possible for Holyrood in the Brexit deal.</p> <p>Sturgeon said a decision on triggering a second referendum was dependent on the strength of the new powers that would pass to Holyrood after Brexit, including powers that the Tories are unlikely to offer, on allowing separate policies on immigration and foreign affairs.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear that beyond hardline rhetoric, the UK government has no detailed plan. So the Scottish government will set out a plan for Scotland,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will require substantial additional powers for the Scottish parliament.\u201d</p> <p>But Sturgeon simultaneously stepped up her anti-Brexit rhetoric by confirming that the SNP at Westminster would work with other opposition parties and pro-EU Tory MPs to vote against the government bill to enable Brexit to take place, regardless of how significant Holyrood\u2019s new powers became.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/snp-old-politics-ideaspace-independence-vote\">The SNP has gone back to old politics. IdeaSpace is the antidote | Robin McAlpine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A UK government source said that strategy was \u201cbizarre\u201d because the Brexit bill was designed to protect Holyrood\u2019s existing powers by embedding all existing EU legislation into UK law. It may also weaken Sturgeon\u2019s hand in future Brexit talks: negotiations are due to start in late October, when the prime minister meets Sturgeon and the leaders of the Welsh and Northern Irish governments to agree on joint plans to prepare for Brexit.</p> <p>\u201cThere are serious contradictions\u201d in Sturgeon\u2019s two-pronged strategy, the Cabinet source said. It was also premature to threaten a second vote: the UK would be seeking a unique deal with the EU which could meet many of Sturgeon\u2019s conditions, he said. <br></p> <p>But Sturgeon\u2019s advisers say that speeding up the referendum bill process highlights an increasingly significant political divide between the Scottish and UK governments, showing Sturgeon\u2019s increasing confidence that the Tory shift to a harder line on Brexit has strengthened her hand.</p> <p>Sturgeon faces substantial obstacles to staging a second independence vote before the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. Scottish voters are still not convinced of the case for a fast second referendum, and Holyrood requires Westminster\u2019s legal authority to stage one.</p> <p>The latest poll, by BMG, published on Thursday by the Herald, found that there is no popular majority in favour of a second referendum. It found that only 12% of those voters who do not want independence would switch to support leaving the UK if there were a hard Brexit. It found 47% were against a new independence vote, 38% in favour and 12% undecided.</p> <p>The economics of Scottish independence are still extremely difficult: the latest GDP data showed Scotland\u2019s economy still growing at a third of the pace of the UK\u2019s as a whole, and government data showed a \u00a315bn Scottish spending deficit last year \u2013 21% of all government spending in Scotland.</p> <p>Opposition leaders said Sturgeon could have offered a far more constructive vision for reform of Scottish domestic policies but instead had increased the divisions and conflicts with the rest of the UK.</p> <p>Sturgeon made clear that she planned to set out new policies in her main conference address on Saturday, but Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, responded: \u201cHer comments show she has given up on speaking for Scotland and is now solely playing to the SNP gallery. This isn\u2019t the action of a first minister of Scotland, but an SNP fundamentalist who puts independence first, last and always.\u201d</p> <p>While the SNP does not have an overall majority in Holyrood, with 62 of 129 MSPs, the six Scottish Green MSPs could be expected to back a second referendum, giving Sturgeon a narrow majority.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/04/scotland-gain-greater-independence-brexit-holyrood-told\">Scotland could gain greater independence via Brexit, Holyrood told</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ian Murray, Scottish Labour\u2019s only MP, said Labour in Westminster would not oppose measures to allow Holyrood to stage a new referendum if it was carried by a majority of MSPs because that would fuel Scottish resentment. However, Murray said it was extremely risky for Sturgeon to discuss staging a second referendum before the UK\u2019s Brexit deal was agreed.</p> <p>\u201cNobody quite knows what Brexit means, and to have a discussion on a second independence referendum is a dereliction of duty,\u201d Murray said. \u201cThe country is completely divided [by Brexit]. We don\u2019t need to see any more division layered on top of that.\u201d </p> <p>Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, said: \u201cNicola Sturgeon\u2019s top priority is to divide our nation once again. But our country is already divided following the Tories\u2019 reckless Brexit gamble and we should not be seeking further divisions. Our economy is in trouble, and the last thing we need is the uncertainty of another independence referendum.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to Sturgeon\u2019s speech, Downing Street said the government would continue to engage with Sturgeon and the people of Scotland but would not support another referendum. \u201cWe believe this issue was addressed in 2014. We want to engage different stakeholders around the UK, but we will be delivering on the will of the British people, and that is to leave the EU,\u201d a spokesperson for Theresa May said. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe prime minister is approaching both the relationship between the four constituent parts of the United Kingdom and our relationship with the European Union as we leave in a constructive and engaged spirit that is focused on getting the best interests for the people of the UK. <br></p> <p>\u201cYou only need to look at what she said when she took office on the steps of Downing Street about the importance of the union \u2013 the fact that her first visit she made out of Westminster was to see the first minister to let her know that we want to engage Scotland in this process and involve them in these consultations.\u201d she added. <br></p>",

  "<p>Conservationists have turned to military strategy to ensure a new wild colony of red squirrels is protected from grey squirrels in Wales. A site at Ogwen valley, five miles from Bangor, has been selected because it is ringed by mountains and cut off from grey squirrels.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier to defend an area if there are geographical pinch points,\u201d said Craig Shuttleworth, a biologist based at Bangor Univserity and a specialist in squirrels. He added that he had adopted the approach of a \u201ctactical military strategist\u201d when planning where the colony should go.</p> <p>But red squirrels are staging a comeback in the areas. A project to rid the island of Anglesey of grey squirrels has seen an initial colony of 40 red squirrels grow to 700 since 1998.</p> <p>So successful has the project been that vanguard units of red squirrels have been crossing bridges to the mainland, where they have set up camp near Bangor. </p> <p>Conservationists are now transporting red squirrels from around the country to boost the colony and provide genetic reinforcements. \u201cWe want to bring in the extra genetic diversity,\u201d said Shuttleworth. </p> <p>Ten squirrels bred by the East Anglian Red Squirrel Group in Norfolk are among those destined for Wales in special squirrel boxes. </p> <p>Chrissie Kelley, head of species management at Pensthorpe Conservation Trust in north Norfolk, is overseeing the resettlement. \u201cOur colleagues in Wales know we breed good squirrels and ours will be joined by breeding stock from other places around the country to ensure the widest genetic mix possible,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The trust has previously sent squirrels to Anglesey, including several offspring of one red squirrel known as Tortoiseshell, who gave birth to 50 kittens before she died aged nine this year. Five of her great-grand-kittens, including a pair called Fire and Flame, will be among those travelling to the Ogwen valley.</p> <p> </p> <p>Native red squirrels have declined in Britain due to earlier persecution by people, habitat loss including deforestation and hence displacement by greys, and disease. Grey squirrels, which arrived from America in the 19th century, now outnumber reds by 20 to one and some conservationists fear the red species, <em>Sciurus vulgaris,</em> could disappear in a generation. </p> <p>Shuttleworth said red squirrels were very rare in Wales and non-native grey squirrels caused significant damage to the environment, and it was legitimate to control grey squirrel populations. </p> <p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t take action to conserve a cute, cuddly animal like the red squirrel what hope do we have for the less charismatic species [that are at risk]?\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be an easy win.\u201d</p>",

Two further campaigns are scheduled for November and December in Nigeria and neighbouring countries.</p> <p>Global efforts to eradicate polio suffered a setback in August when, after two years free of transmission, <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2016/nigeria-polio/en/\">two cases of polio were detected in Borno state</a>, followed by another in September. Nigeria is the last country in Africa and one of only three in the world where polio remains.

Earlier this year, the World Health Organisation said it believed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/apr/11/polio-cases-wiped-out-12-months-world-health-organisation-pakistan\">transmission of the virus could be stopped within 12 months</a>.</p> <p>Doune Porter, Unicef Nigeria\u2019s chief of communication, said: \u201cWe have to respond, and we are indeed responding, with a massive show of force to make sure that it does not get out of control. We can\u2019t afford to have polio come back to the area, to Nigeria or Africa.\u201d</p> <p>Although the polio vaccine is relatively simple to administer, large parts of Borno state have, for some years, been inaccessible to humanitarian organisations due to the Boko Haram insurgency. This has meant large numbers of children have never been immunised against life-threatening diseases.</p> <p>This drive, which will involve door-to-door visits from health workers, will include 750,000 people in territory taken back by Nigerian government forces earlier this year. However, large areas of north-east Nigeria still cannot be reached with any kind of humanitarian assistance.</p> <p>Porter said immunisations were crucial in keeping the re-emergence of polio in Nigeria under control, saying the new cases earlier this year were a \u201chuge disappointment\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to start the clock again and of course there is the question of accessing more children with immunisation.

  "<p>Last March, my 71-year-old grandmother, Betty, waited in line for three hours to caucus for Bernie Sanders. The wait to be able to cast her first-ever vote in a primary election was punishing, but nothing could have deterred her. Betty \u2013 a white woman who left school after ninth grade, had her first child at age 16 and spent much of her life in severe poverty \u2013 wanted to vote.</p> <p>So she waited with busted knees that once stood on factory lines. She waited with smoking-induced emphysema and the false teeth she\u2019s had since her late 20s \u2013 both markers of our class. She waited with a womb that in the 1960s, before Roe v Wade, she paid a stranger to thrust a wire hanger inside after she discovered she was pregnant by a man she\u2019d fled after he broke her jaw.</p> <p>Betty worked for many years as a probation officer for the state judicial system in Wichita, Kansas, keeping tabs on men who had murdered and raped. As a result, it\u2019s hard to faze her, but she has pronounced Republican candidate Donald Trump a sociopath \u201cwhose mouth overloads his ass\u201d.</p> <p>No one loathes Trump \u2013 who suggested women should be <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/31/us/politics/donald-trump-abortion.html\">punished</a> for having abortions, who said hateful things about groups of people she has loved and worked alongside since childhood, whose pomp and indecency offends her modest, midwestern sensibility \u2013 more than she.</p> <p>Yet, it is white working-class people like Betty who have become a particular fixation among the chattering class during this election: what is this angry beast, and why does it support Trump?<br></p> <h2>Not so poor: Trump voters are middle class</h2> <p>Hard numbers complicate, if not roundly dismiss, the oft-regurgitated theory that income or education levels predict Trump support, or that working-class whites support him disproportionately. Last month, <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2822059\">results of 87,000 interviews </a>conducted by Gallup showed that those who liked Trump were under no more economic distress or immigration-related anxiety than those who opposed him.</p> <p>According to the study, his supporters didn\u2019t have lower incomes or higher unemployment levels than other Americans. Income data misses a lot; those with healthy earnings might also have negative wealth or downward mobility. But respondents overall weren\u2019t clinging to jobs perceived to be endangered. \u201cSurprisingly\u201d, a Gallup researcher wrote, \u201cthere appears to be no link whatsoever between exposure to trade competition and support for nationalist policies in America, as embodied by the Trump campaign.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year, primary exit polls revealed that Trump voters were, in fact, more affluent than most Americans, with a <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mythology-of-trumps-working-class-support/\">median household income of $72,000</a> \u2013 higher than that of Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders supporters. Forty-four percent of them had college degrees, well above the national average of 33% among whites or 29% overall. In January, political scientist Matthew MacWilliams <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/01/donald-trump-2016-authoritarian-213533\">reported</a> findings that a penchant for authoritarianism \u2013 not income, education, gender, age or race \u2013predicted Trump support.</p> <p>These facts haven\u2019t stopped pundits and journalists from pushing story after story about the white working class\u2019s giddy embrace of a bloviating demagogue.</p> <p>In seeking to explain Trump\u2019s appeal, proportionate media coverage would require more stories about the racism and misogyny among white Trump supporters in tony suburbs. Or, if we\u2019re examining economically driven bitterness among the working class, stories about the Democratic lawmakers who in recent decades ended welfare as we knew it, hopped in the sack with Wall Street and forgot American labor in their global trade agreements.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don\u2019t need their analysis, and we sure don\u2019t need their tears. What we need is to have our stories told</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But, for national media outlets comprised largely of middle- and upper-class liberals, that would mean looking their own class in the face.</p> <p>The faces journalists do train the cameras on \u2013 hateful ones screaming sexist vitriol next to Confederate flags \u2013 must receive coverage but do not speak for the communities I know well. That the media industry ignored my home for so long left a vacuum of understanding in which the first glimpse of an economically downtrodden white is presumed to represent the whole.</p> <p>Part of the current glimpse is JD Vance, author of the bestselling new memoir <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-lives-of-poor-white-people\">Hillbilly Elegy</a>. A successful attorney who had a precariously middle-class upbringing in an Ohio steel town, Vance wrote of the chaos that can haunt a family with generational memory of deep poverty. A conservative who says he won\u2019t vote for Trump, Vance speculates about why working-class whites will: cultural anxiety that arises when opioid overdose kills your friends and the political establishment has proven it will throw you under the bus. While his theories may hold up in some corners, in interviews coastal media members have repeatedly asked Vance to speak for the entire white working class.</p> <p>His interviewers and reviewers often seem relieved to find someone with ownership on the topic whose ideas in large part confirm their own. The New York Times election podcast <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/19/podcasts/understanding-the-trump-voter.html?_r=0\">The Run-Up</a> said Vance\u2019s memoir \u201cdoubles as a cultural anthropology of the white underclass that has flocked to the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s candidacy\u201d. (The Times teased its review of the book with the tweet: \u201cWant to know more about the people who fueled the rise of Donald Trump?\u201d)</p> <p>While Vance happens to have roots in Kentucky mining country, most downtrodden whites are not conservative male Protestants from Appalachia. That sometimes seems the only concept of them that the American consciousness can contain: tucked away in a remote mountain shanty like a coal-dust-covered ghost, as though white poverty isn\u2019t always right in front of us, swiping our credit cards at a Target in Denver or asking for cash on a Los Angeles sidewalk.</p> <p>One-dimensional stereotypes fester where journalism fails to tread. The last time I saw my native class receive substantial focus, before now, was over 20 years ago \u2013 not in the news but on the television show <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseanne\">Roseanne</a>, the fictional storylines of which remain more accurate than the musings of comfortable commentators in New York studios.</p> <p>Countless images of working-class progressives, including women such as Betty, are thus rendered invisible by a ratings-fixated media that covers elections as horse races and seeks sensational b-roll. </p> <p>This media paradigm created the tale of a divided America \u2013 \u201cred\u201d v \u201cblue\u201d\u2013 in which the 42% of Kansans who voted for Barack Obama in 2008 are meaningless. </p> <p>This year, more Kansans <a href=\"http://usuncut.com/politics/bernie-sanders-wins-kansas/\">caucused for Bernie Sanders</a> than for Donald Trump \u2013 a newsworthy point I never saw noted in national press, who perhaps couldn\u2019t fathom that \u201cflyover country\u201d might contain millions of Americans more progressive than their Clinton strongholds. </p> <p>In lieu of such coverage, media makers cast the white working class as a monolith and imply an old, treacherous story convenient to capitalism: that the poor are dangerous idiots.</p> <h2>Poor whiteness and poor character</h2> <p>The two-fold myth about the white working class \u2013 that they are to blame for Trump\u2019s rise, and that those among them who support him for the worst reasons exemplify the rest \u2013 takes flight on the wings of moral superiority affluent Americans often pin upon themselves.</p> <p>I have never seen them flap so insistently as in today\u2019s election commentary, where notions of poor whiteness and poor character are routinely conflated. </p> <p>In an election piece last March in the National Review, writer Kevin Williamson\u2019s assessment of poor white voters \u2013 among whom mortality rates have sharply risen in recent decades \u2013 expressed what many conservatives and liberals alike may well believe when he observed that communities ravaged by oxycodone use \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/nrd/articles/432569/father-f-hrer\">deserve to die</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe white American underclass is in thrall to a vicious, selfish culture whose main products are misery and used heroin needles,\u201d Williamson wrote. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s speeches make them feel good. So does OxyContin.\u201d</p> <p>For confirmation that this point is lost on most reporters, not just conservative provocateurs, look no further than a recent Washington Post <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2016/08/31/opiods-and-anti-anxiety-medication-are-killing-white-american-women/\">series</a> that explored spiking <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/white-death/\">death rates</a> among rural white women by fixating on their smoking habits and graphically detailing the \u201chaggard face\u201d and embalming processes of their <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/life-lessons-from-a-small-town-undertaker-as-white-women-die-younger-in-america/2016/08/20/a1e64d76-60b6-11e6-af8e-54aa2e849447_story.html\">corpses</a>. Imagine wealthy white woman examined thusly after their deaths. The outrage among family and friends with the education, time, and agency to write letters to the editor would have been deafening.</p> <p>A sentiment that I care for even less than contempt or degradation is their tender cousin: pity.</p> <p>In a recent op-ed headlined <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/20/opinion/dignity-and-sadness-in-the-working-class.html\">Dignity and Sadness in the Working Class</a>, David Brooks told of a laid-off Kentucky metal worker he met. On his last day, the man left to rows of cheering coworkers \u2013 a moment I read as triumphant, but that Brooks declared pitiable. How hard the man worked for so little, how great his skills and how dwindling their value, Brooks pointed out, for people he said radiate \u201cthe residual sadness of the lonely heart\u201d.</p> <p>I\u2019m hard-pressed to think of a worse slight than the media figures who have disregarded the embattled white working class for decades now beseeching the country to have sympathy for them. We don\u2019t need their analysis, and we sure don\u2019t need their tears. What we need is to have our stories told, preferably by someone who can walk into a factory without his own guilt fogging his glasses.</p> <p>One such journalist, Alexander Zaitchik, spent several months on the road in six states getting to know white working-class people who do support Trump. His goal for the resulting new book, <a href=\"http://www.alternet.org/books/gilded-rage-conversation-trump-supporter-will-surprise-you\">The Gilded Rage</a>, was to convey the human complexity that daily news misses. Zaitchik wrote that his mission arose from frustration with \u201c\u2018hot takes\u2019 written by people living several time zones and income brackets away from their subjects\u201d.</p> <p>Zaitchik wisely described those he met as a \u201cblue-collar middle class\u201d\u2013 mostly white people who have worked hard and lost a lot, whether in the market crash of 2008 or the manufacturing layoffs of recent decades. He found that their motivations overwhelmingly \u201cstarted with economics and ended with economics\u201d. The anger he observed was \u201cpointed up, not down\u201d at those who forgot them when global trade deals were negotiated, not at minority groups.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the racism and nationalism that surely exist among them also exist among Democrats and higher socioeconomic strata. A poll conducted last spring by Reuters <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-trump-idUSKBN0TQ2QT20151208\">found</a> that a third of questioned Democrats supported a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. In another, by YouGov, <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/news/2015/12/09/most-americans-dislike-islam/\">45%</a> of polled Democrats reported holding an unfavorable view of Islam, with almost no fluctuation based on household income. Those who won\u2019t vote for Trump are not necessarily paragons of virtue, while the rest are easily scapegoated as the country\u2019s moral scourge.</p> <p>When Hillary Clinton recently declared half of Trump supporters a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d, Zaitchik told another reporter, the language \u201ccould be read as another way of saying \u2018white-trash bin\u2019.\u201d Clinton quickly apologized for the comment, the context of which contained compassion for many Trump voters. But making such generalizations at a $6m fundraiser in downtown New York City, at which some attendees paid $50,000 for a seat, recalled for me scenes from the television political satire Veep in which powerful Washington figures discuss \u201cnormals\u201d with distaste behind closed doors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"debc21966234342f2a0bad89ca20f9386628f7bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/debc21966234342f2a0bad89ca20f9386628f7bd/0_0_2000_1488/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The DeBruce Grain elevator.

Federal safety inspectors had not visited it for 16 years when an explosion ripped through the half-mile long structure, killing seven workers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cliff Schiappa/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When we talked, Zaitchik mentioned HBO talk-show host Bill Maher, who he pointed out \u201cbasically makes eugenics-level arguments about anyone who votes for Donald Trump having congenital defects. You would never get away with talking that way about any other group of people and still have a TV show.\u201d</p> <p>Maher is, perhaps, the pinnacle of classist smugness. In the summer of 1998, when I was 17 and just out of high school, I worked at a grain elevator during the wheat harvest. An elevator 50 miles east in Haysville, Kansas, exploded (grain dust is highly combustible), <a href=\"http://www.kansas.com/news/article986253.html\">killing seven workers</a>. The accident rattled my community and reminded us about the physical dangers my family and I often faced as farmers.</p> <p>I kept going to work like everyone else and, after a long day weighing wheat trucks and hauling heavy sacks of feed in and out of the mill, liked to watch Politically Incorrect, the ABC show Maher hosted then. With the search for one of the killed workers\u2019 bodies still under way, Maher joked, as I recall, that the people should check their loaves of Wonder Bread.</p> <p>That moment was perhaps my first reckoning with the hard truth that, throughout my life, I would politically identify with the same people who often insult the place I am from.</p> <p>Such derision is so pervasive that it\u2019s often imperceptible to the economically privileged. Those who write, discuss, and publish newspapers, books, and magazines with best intentions sometimes offend with obliviousness.</p> <p>Many people recommended to me the bestselling new history book <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/22/books/review-white-trash-ruminates-on-an-american-underclass.html\">White Trash</a>, for instance, without registering that its title is a slur that refers to me and the people I love as garbage. My happy relief that someone set out to tell this ignored thread of our shared past was squashed by my wincing every time I saw it on my shelf, so much so that I finally took the book jacket off. Incredibly, promotional copy for the book commits precisely the elitist shaming Isenberg is out to expose: \u201c(the book) takes on our comforting myths about equality, uncovering the crucial legacy of the ever-present, always embarrassing \u2013 if occasionally entertaining \u2013poor white trash.\u201d </p> <p>The book itself is more sensitively wrought and imparts facts that one hopes would dismantle popular use of its titular term. But even Isenberg can\u2019t escape our classist frameworks.</p> <p>When <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/americas-long-unaddressed-history-class/\">On the Media</a> host Brooke Gladstone asked Isenberg, earlier this year, to address long-held perceptions of poor whites as bigots, the author described a conundrum:\u201cThey do subscribe to certain views that are undoubtedly racist, and you can\u2019t mask it and pretend that it\u2019s not there. It is very much a part of their thinking.\u201d</p> <p>Entertain a parallel broad statement about any other disenfranchised group, and you might begin to see how rudimentary class discussion is for this relatively young country that long believed itself to be free of castes. Isenberg has sniffed out the hypocrisy in play, though.</p> <p>\u201cThe other problem is when people want to blame poor whites for being the only racist in the room,\u201d she told Gladstone. \u201c\u2026 as if they\u2019re more racist than everyone else.\u201d</p> <p>That problem is rooted in the notion that higher class means higher integrity. As journalist Lorraine Berry wrote last month, \u201cThe story remains that only the ignorant would be racist. Racism disappears with education we\u2019re told.\u201d As the first from my family to hold degrees, I assure you that none of us had to go to college to learn basic human decency.</p> <p>Berry points out that Ivy-League-minted Republicans shepherded the rise of the alt-right. Indeed, it was not poor whites \u2013 not even white Republicans \u2013 who passed legislation bent on preserving segregation, or who watched the Confederate flag raised outside state capitols for decades to come.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t poor whites who criminalized blackness by way of marijuana laws and the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d.</p> <p>Nor was it poor whites who conjured the specter of the black \u201cwelfare queen\u201d.</p> <p>These points should not minimize the horrors of racism at the lowest economic rungs of society, but remind us that those horrors reside at the top in different forms and with more terrible power.</p> <p>Among reporters and commentators this election cycle, then, a steady finger ought be pointed at whites with economic leverage: social conservatives who donate to Trump\u2019s campaign while being too civilized to attend a political rally and yell what they really believe.</p> <h2>Mainstream media is set up to fail the ordinary American</h2> <p>Based on Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric and available data, it appears that most of his voters this November will be people who are getting by well enough but who think of themselves as victims.</p> <p>One thing the media misses is that a great portion of the white working class would align with any sense before victimhood. Right now they are clocking in and out of work, sorting their grocery coupons, raising their children to respect others, and avoiding political news coverage.</p> <p>Barack Obama, a black man formed by the black experience, often cites his maternal lineage in the white working class. \u201cA lot of what\u2019s shaped me came from my grandparents who grew up on the prairie in Kansas,\u201d he <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/obama-thank-god-im-a-country-boy/article/2603608\">wrote</a> this month to mark a White House forum on rural issues. </p> <p>Last year, talking with author Marilynne Robinson for the New York Review of Books, Obama lamented common misconceptions of small-town middle America, for which he has a sort of reverence. \u201cThere\u2019s this huge gap between how folks go about their daily lives and how we talk about our common life and our political life,\u201d he said, naming one cause as \u201cthe filters that stand between ordinary people\u201d who are busy getting by and complicated policy debates. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very encouraged when I meet people in their environments,\u201d Obama told Robinson. \u201cSomehow it gets distilled at the national political level in ways that aren\u2019t always as encouraging.\u201d</p> <p>To be sure, one discouraging distillation \u2013 the caricature of the hate-spewing white male Trump voter with grease on his jeans \u2013 is a real person of sorts. There were one or two in my town: the good ol\u2019 boy who menaces those with less power than himself \u2013 running people of color out of town with the threat of violence, denigrating women, shooting BB guns at stray cats for fun. They are who Trump would be if he\u2019d been born where I was.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don\u2019t need their analysis, and we sure don\u2019t need their tears. What we need is to have our stories told</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Media fascination with the hateful white Trump voter fuels the theory, now in fashion, that bigotry is the only explanation for supporting him. Certainly, financial struggle does not predict a soft spot for Trump, as cash-strapped people of color \u2013 who face the threat of his racism and xenophobia, and who resoundingly reject him, by all available measures \u2013 can attest. However, one imagines that elite white liberals who maintain an air of ethical grandness this election season would have a harder time thinking globally about trade and immigration if it were their factory job that was lost and their community that was decimated. </p> <p>Affluent analysts who oppose Trump, though, have a way of taking a systemic view when examining social woes but viewing their place on the political continuum as a triumph of individual character. Most of them presumably inherited their political bent, just like most of those in \u201cred\u201d America did. If you were handed liberalism, give yourself no pats on the back for your vote against Trump.</p> <p>Spare, too, the condescending argument that disaffected Democrats who joined Republican ranks in recent decades are \u201cvoting against their own best interests,\u201d undemocratic in its implication that a large swath of America isn\u2019t mentally fit to cast a ballot. </p> <p>Whoever remains on Trump\u2019s side as stories concerning his treatment of women, racism and other dangers continue to unfurl gets no pass from me for any reason. They are capable of voting, and they own their decisions. Let\u2019s be aware of our class biases, though, as we discern who \u201cthey\u201d are.</p> <h2>Journalist? Then the chances are you\u2019re not blue collar</h2> <p>A recent print-edition New York Times cutline <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/opinion/sunday/we-need-somebody-spectacular-views-from-trump-country.html\">described</a> a Kentucky man:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cMitch Hedges, who farms cattle and welds coal-mining equipment. He expects to lose his job in six months, but does not support Mr Trump, who he says is \u2018an idiot.\u2019\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>This made me cheer for the rare spotlight on a member of the white working class who doesn\u2019t support Trump. It also made me laugh \u2013 one can\u2019t \u201cfarm cattle\u201d. One farms crops, and one raises livestock. It\u2019s sometimes hard for a journalist who has done both to take the New York Times seriously.</p> <p>The main reason that national media outlets have a blind spot in matters of class is the lack of socioeconomic diversity within their ranks. Few people born to deprivation end up working in newsrooms or publishing books. So few, in fact, that this former laborer has found cause to shift her entire writing career to talk specifically about class in a wealth-privileged industry, much as journalists of color find themselves talking about race in a whiteness-privileged one.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t to say that one must reside among a given group or place to do it justice, of course, as good muckrakers and commentators have shown for the past century and beyond. See On the Media\u2019s fine new series on poverty, the second episode of which includes Gladstone\u2019s reflection that \u201cthe poor are no more monolithic than the rest of us.\u201d</p> <p>I know journalists to be hard-working people who want to get the story right, and I\u2019m resistant to rote condemnations of \u201cthe media\u201d. The classism of cable-news hosts merely reflects the classism of privileged America in general. It\u2019s everywhere, from tweets describing Trump voters as inbred hillbillies to a Democratic campaign platform that didn\u2019t bother with a specific anti-poverty platform until a month out from the general election.</p> <p>The economic trench between reporter and reported on has never been more hazardous than at this moment of historic wealth disparity, though, when stories focus more often on the stock market than on people who own no stocks. American journalism has been willfully obtuse about the grievances on Main Streets for decades \u2013 surely a factor in digging the hole of resentment that Trump\u2019s venom now fills. That the term \u201cpopulism\u201d has become a pejorative among prominent liberal commentators should give us great pause. A journalism that embodies the plutocracy it\u2019s supposed to critique has failed its watchdog duty and lost the respect of people who call bullshit when they see it. </p> <p>One such person was my late grandfather, Arnie. Men like Trump sometimes drove expensive vehicles up the gravel driveway of our Kansas farmhouse looking to do some sort of business. Grandpa would recognize them as liars and thieves, treat them kindly, and send them packing. If you shook their hands, after they left Grandpa would laugh and say, \u201cBetter count your fingers.\u201d</p> <p>In a world in which the Bettys and Arnies of the world have little voice, those who enjoy a platform from which to speak might examine their hearts and minds before stepping onto the soap box.</p> <p>If you would stereotype a group of people by presuming to guess their politics or deeming them inferior to yourself \u2013 say, the ones who worked third shift on a Boeing floor while others flew to Mexico during spring break; the ones who mopped a McDonald\u2019s bathroom while others argued about the minimum wage on Twitter; the ones who cleaned out their lockers at a defunct Pabst factory while others drank craft beer at trendy bars; the ones who came back from the Middle East in caskets while others wrote op-eds about foreign policy \u2013 then consider that you might have more in common with Trump than you would like to admit.</p>",

increases to offset rising costs were a normal part of doing business. \u201cWe are taking price increases in the UK. That is a normal devaluation-led cycle,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He said he was confident the dispute would be \u201cresolved pretty quickly\u201d.</p> \n<p>The UK accounts for less than 5% of Unilever\u2019s business, Pitkethly said, as the company announced better than expected quarterly results after pushing through price increases around the world. The company posted underlying sales growth of 3.2% for the past three months, ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations.</p> \n<p>UK consumers, however, have been told to brace themselves for price rises. Pinar Hosafci, a senior food analyst at Euromonitor International, said: \u201cBrexit has been a trigger that started this and it is likely that other companies, which are reporting in euros, including the likes of Nestl\u00e9 and Ferrero, will follow suit. This move could be more detrimental to Tesco than Unilever, which owns a number of power brands that are either leading or at best ranking in the second place.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/feb/15/why-the-spanish-love-tea-marmite-and-cathedral-city-cheddar\">Why the Spanish love tea, Marmite and Cathedral City cheddar</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://brc.org.uk/\">British Retail Consortium</a> said shops would be doing their best to hold down prices for customers, but that the impact of the falling pound would eventually work its way through to shelf prices. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said: \u201cRetailers are firmly on the side of consumers in negotiating with suppliers and improving efficiencies in the supply chain to control the inflationary pressure that is building through the devaluation of the pound.</p> \n<p>\u201cHowever, years of falling shop prices and higher costs have left limited scope for retailers to continue absorbing this pressure, and everyone in the supply chain will need to play their part in maintaining low prices for consumers.\u201d</p> \n<p>The big supermarkets are likely to fight particularly hard to prevent price rises as they are all battling to stop consumers taking their trade to discounters Aldi and Lidl, which sell more own-brand goods.</p> \n<p>Downing Street refused to comment on how retailers and suppliers should respond to the fall in sterling. A spokesman for Theresa May said: \u201cIt is a decision for companies how they market and sell their products \u2026 It is a commercial decision.\u201d </p> \n<p>Nick Lee, professor of marketing at Warwick Business School, said both Unilever and Tesco were gambling on their customers being loyal: \u201cThey need each other but are jockeying for best position in a new uncertain environment. I expect we\u2019ll see a lot of this in the coming months as players in this space look to renegotiate deals, and try to play on public sympathy to pressure their negotiation partners.\u201d </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/great-marmite-war-reality-brexit-bite\">With the great Marmite war, the reality of Brexit has started to bite | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Roy Williams, the managing director of the supply chain consultants Vendigital, also said the Tesco row would be the first of many: \u201cMore disputes over prices are likely in the coming months, as many of the currency hedges that suppliers put in place to protect them from exchange-rate changes start to run out. Ultimately, the effect of these cost increases will be felt by consumers.\u201d</p> \n<p>Shares in Unilever and Tesco opened lower on Thursday, with Unilever down by 2% and Tesco falling by 2.5%. </p> \n<p>Neil Wilson, a market analyst at ETX Capital, said: \u201cAgainst the backdrop of its spat with Tesco, the statement \u2026 highlights how cost pressures are creeping into UK retail, potentially knocking dividends and share prices for a number of well-known stocks.\u201d</p> \n<p>Unilever has also tried to charge other retailers more, including Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons.

  "<p>Until a few months ago, Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez was a government health promoter in central El Salvador. His job was to visit poor families and ensure their children attended school and received health checks, in exchange for modest cash benefits.<br></p> <p>One day in March, on his way to visit a family in a neighbourhood controlled by the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) gang, Hern\u00e1ndez witnessed a beating by gang members. Too scared to intervene, he hurried past, completed his visit and started his long walk home. </p> <p>The four assailants were waiting for him. </p> <p>\u201cI pleaded with them to let me live. I said I had children, that I\u2019d say nothing,\u201d said Hern\u00e1ndez, 31. \u201cThey agreed to spare my life but told me never to return.\u201d</p> <p>The victim was found dead three days later \u2013 one of 611 homicides in the tiny Central American nation that month.</p> <p>Hern\u00e1ndez was scared, but couldn\u2019t find another job. So when he returned to visit the same family a month later, he took a different route and left his uniform at home in hope of going unnoticed. </p> <p>But he was spotted by gang informants, and the same four youngsters confronted Hern\u00e1ndez with baseball bats, accusing him of spying for a rival group. </p> <p>\u201cThey took down my address from my identity card, and threatened to kill my whole family if they ever saw me again. We left El Salvador five days later,\u201d said Hern\u00e1ndez, now living with his wife and two children in a sparsely furnished room in Tapachula, in southern Mexico, where they are seeking asylum. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/10/central-america-map/\" data-alt=\"central america map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/10/central-america-map/\">central america map</a> </figure>  <p>The Hern\u00e1ndez family are part of an alarming exodus of entire families forced to flee widespread violence in Central America\u2019s northern triangle, the world\u2019s most dangerous region outside an official war zone. </p> <p>As huge numbers of Syrian and African refugees risk their lives crossing the Mediterranean Sea to escape war-torn states, advocates say a parallel refugee crisis has unfolded on America\u2019s doorstep amid an undeclared but increasingly brutal war between criminal groups and security forces. </p> <p>An estimated 80,000 people from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, mostly families and unaccompanied children, are expected to apply for asylum overseas this year \u2013 a 658% increase since 2011, according to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR). Tens of thousands more will be forcibly displaced, but not seek international help.<br></p> <p>During the 1980s, the three countries known as the northern triangle were blighted by vicious civil wars between US-backed military dictatorships and leftist guerrilla groups.

In comparison, 170,323 Central Americans were detained by Mexican immigrations agents, and most were immediately deported home. </p> <p>In addition, more than 100,000 families and unaccompanied children from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala were detained at the US southern border in the past year.</p> <p>Nevertheless, neither the US, Mexico nor the northern triangle countries have acknowledged the escalating refugee crisis despite warnings from the UN and rights groups. </p> <p>Meanwhile, many people are too scared to apply for asylum or are simply unaware of their rights, said Fermina Rodr\u00edguez, from the Fray Mat\u00edas Human Rights Centre in Tapachula.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are fleeing Central America to save their own lives, to save their children\u2019s lives, in need of help.

We are Liberty students who are disappointed with President Falwell\u2019s endorsement and are tired of being associated with one of the worst presidential candidates in American history. Donald Trump does not represent our values and we want nothing to do with him.</p> <p>A majority of Liberty students, faculty, and staff feel as we do. Donald Trump received a pitiful 90 votes from Liberty students in Virginia\u2019s primary election, a colossal rejection of his campaign. Nevertheless, President Falwell eagerly uses his national platform to advocate for Donald Trump. While he occasionally clarifies that supporting Trump is not the official position of Liberty University, he knows it is his title of president of the largest Christian university in the world that gives him political credentials.</p> <p>Associating any politician with Christianity is damaging to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. But Donald Trump is not just any politician. He has made his name by maligning others and bragging about his sins. Not only is Donald Trump a bad candidate for president, he is actively promoting the very things that we as Christians ought to oppose.</p> <p>A recently uncovered tape revealed his comments bragging about sexually assaulting women. Any faculty or staff member at Liberty would be terminated for such comments, and yet when Donald Trump makes them, President Falwell rushes eagerly to his defense \u2013 taking the name \u201cLiberty University\u201d with him. \u201cWe\u2019re all sinners,\u201d Falwell told the media, as if sexual assault is a shoulder-shrugging issue rather than an atrocity which plagues college campuses across America, including our own.</p> <p>It is not enough to criticize these kinds of comments. We must make clear to the world that while everyone is a sinner and everyone can be forgiven, a man who constantly and proudly speaks evil does not deserve our support for the nation\u2019s highest office.</p> <p>Jesus tells a story in the Bible about a man who tries to remove a speck of dust from his brother\u2019s eye, while he has a log stuck in his own. \u201cYou hypocrite,\u201d Jesus says, \u201cfirst take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother\u2019s eye.\u201d</p> <p>We Liberty students are often told to support Donald Trump because the other leading candidate is a bad option. Perhaps this is true. But the only candidate who is directly associated with Liberty University is Donald Trump.</p> <p>Because our president has led the world to believe that Liberty University supports Donald Trump, we students must take it upon ourselves to make clear that Donald Trump is absolutely opposed to what we believe, and does not have our support.</p> <p>We are not proclaiming our opposition to Donald Trump out of bitterness, but out of a desire to regain the integrity of our school. While our president Jerry Falwell Jr. tours the country championing the log in his eye, we want the world to know how many students oppose him. We don\u2019t want to champion Donald Trump; we want only to be champions for Christ.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57feda24e4b03b22b4fb2c62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T00:50:44.194Z\">1.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Clinton campaign has responded to Trump campaign advisor Roger Stone\u2019s statements that he has had \u201cback-channel communications\u201d with Wikileaks, the organization that has released hacked documents and emails from the DNC and Clinton campaign.</p> <p>\u201cIt is disturbing that Roger Stone, a longtime Donald Trump confidante, has confirmed the fact that has \u2018back-channel communications\u2019 with Wikileaks, an organization that is working with the Russian government to affect the American presidential election,\u201d said Glen Caplin.</p> <p>\u201cIt is also now clear that the illegal hack of John Podesta\u2019s email is the work of the Russian government, according to the FBI.

You cherrypick what he says and you want to talk about it for days on end with a breaking news tag on it.

He sought to explain: \u201cSo I\u2019m standing at my podium by my chair. She walks across the room, she\u2019s standing in front of me right next to me ...

If we had a little help from our weak leadership, called our Republican leadership, we\u2019d be sailing like you\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d</p> <p>He also criticised the media for giving too little coverage to revelations from WikiLeaks. Pointing to journalists at the rally, he said: \u201cThese guys are so crooked \u2013 they\u2019re worse than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a>.

I think if we got along with the Russians, that would be good, and frankly, if we got along with the Russians and knocked the hell out of Isis, that would be good. That would be smart \u2013 but we don\u2019t run government smart.\u201d</p> <p>In a bizarre aside, Trump even took on the NFL over its new regulations to limit concussions. \u201cA little ding in the head you can\u2019t play the rest of the season,\u201d he said mockingly.</p> <p>But the Democratic candidate remained his primary target. \u201cIt\u2019s a choice between the pessimism of Hillary Clinton and the optimism of a movement powered by millions of people all over the country... She shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run for president. Based on her crimes, she should not be allowed to run for president ...

If Clinton wins, meaning Vice-President Tim Kaine would hold the casting vote in the Senate, meaning the Democrats would only need to pick up four seats to control the upper chamber. The Republicans currently have 54 Senate seats, and the Democrats 44, along with two independents who caucus with them.</p> <p>In two tight Senate contests, Nevada and New Hampshire, GOP candidates on Saturday announced they could no longer stomach Trump, and called on him to withdraw. On Monday, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, fired another salvo at Trump by saying he would no longer campaign for him or defend him, and told members they should feel free to focus on their own survival.</p> <p>\u201cI think Republicans were feeling pretty good about the Congress a couple weeks ago, but this morning they\u2019re very worried,\u201d former representative Vin Weber told the Guardian on Monday. Weber has helped raise funds for a politically-active non-profit, the American Action Network, and an allied Super Pac, the Congressional Leadership Fund, that are trying to keep the GOP majority.

  "<p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust anyone who\u2019s not a nerd,\u201d says Jamie Lidell. \u201cIf you\u2019re not really a nerd then you\u2019re not really into something.\u201d Anyone who saw Lidell\u2019s live show a decade ago wouldn\u2019t confuse him for a man who wasn\u2019t <em>into</em> what he was doing. Back in 2005 Lidell toured the UK in a jacket made out of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/mar/16/classicalmusicandopera.popandrock\">VHS tape and a helmet with a camera strapped to his head, alongside an audio visual sidekick by the name of Pablo Fiasco</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/13/jamie-lidell-building-a-beginning-album-review\">Jamie Lidell: Building a Beginning review \u2013 swoonworthy soul-pop</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was a ramshackle yet captivating live show that stood out on a bill he shared with the London Sinfonietta and fellow Warp records signee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/squarepusher\">Squarepusher </a>and felt more <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkuiWgPzQwg\">like a cyberpunk circus act than a conventional gig</a>. \u201cIt was a cool chance for me and my visual guy to cause a ruckus because everyone was very formal and we were super messy,\u201d says Lidell. The organised chaos, partly enabled by a loop programme he developed himself, gave Lidell a new audience and brought his vision of nerd Nirvana to venues like London\u2019s Royal Festival Hall.<br></p> <p>But for all the gear and talk of nerding out, Lidell is most well-known for his more soulful work, where he puts the wires and gadgets to one side and places his vocals at the forefront. His new record Building A Beginning is a mix of upbeat soul and reflective ballads that recall the more somber work of Teddy Pendergrass and Al Green. It\u2019s been called <a href=\"http://www.thefader.com/2016/07/12/jamie-lidell-walk-right-back-building-beginning-interview\">a career best by some</a>, and will be released on his own label. </p> <p>Originally from Cambridgeshire in the UK, Lidell now lives in Nashville with his wife and young son, after being encouraged to relocate from New York by director Harmony Korine, who Lidell met through their respective work on Warp, the revered electronica label which introduced the Aphex Twin to the world. Lidell collaborates with his wife \u2013 the photographer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lindseyrome/?hl=en\">Lindsey Rome</a> \u2013 on lyrics, and has put together a band (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEc-TKLU2Yk\">the Royal Pharaohs</a>) who\u2019ve worked with everyone from Beck and Elton John to Prince and Chaka Khan. It\u2019s a dream set up for someone who grew up being the only kid in his school listening to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/14/prince-playing-show-guardian\">the purple one</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0Mj5oriWI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wd0Mj5oriWI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Jamie Lidell \u2013 Believe In Me</figcaption> </figure>   <p>But for a while Lidell was looking like he might become a British soul singer of a different sort. Less smalltown happiness and self-published albums, more massive billboards with your name on and major label deals.</p> <p>Around the time of his album Multiply in 2005, Lidell had tapped into renewed interest in British soul, led by Amy Winehouse. Not everyone was convinced by him though. The Guardian\u2019s Caroline Sullivan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/apr/17/stilldontgetjamielidell\">didn\u2019t see what all the fuss was about</a> \u2013 \u201cHe looks authentically intense (spectacles, beard); well, so does Rolf Harris. So what am I not getting? Is it me, or does the emperor have no clothes?\u201d Neither, initially, was his label Warp, who after a three-year wait for the album might have expected something similar to his more abrasive debut album, <a href=\"http://jamielidellmusic.com/muddlin-gear/\">Muddlin Gear</a>.<br></p> <p>\u201cI handed it in to Steve [Beckett, boss of Warp] and he didn\u2019t say anything. He called me and said is it not going to be a bit more fucked up? And I said \u2018No, I\u2019m trying to make it more concise\u2019 and it was a bit too pop for what they were used to on Warp, I guess,\u201d he remembers. \u201cIt turned out to be a really big seller for Warp. I don\u2019t think they knew that was going to happen. They put the brakes on it in terms of promotion, they didn\u2019t really go that hard on it.</p> <p>\u201cBut it sort of just went on its own. I was doing that and then the Amy Winehouse thing [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/nov/25/amy-winehouse-back-to-black\">Back to Black</a>] came out the next year. The time was perfect for that kind of sound. It\u2019s really about luck.\u201d</p> <p>After the release of Multiply, Lidell followed the album up with his most mainstream record to date, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11467-jim/\">Jim</a>. It was his brazen bid for the big time and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/20/popandrock22\">earned him comparisons</a> to the blue-eyed soul of David Bowie\u2019s Young Americans. \u201cI was blatantly going for it. First time in my career and probably the last. I thought \u2018let\u2019s have a go\u2019 \u2026 ultimately I don\u2019t regret any of it,\u201d he says. </p> <p>He was getting invited to co-write with people like Lianne La Havas, and his music was popping up on TV shows such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQShuGZIzkg\">Grey\u2019s Anatomy</a>, but for Lidell there was a conflict between operating as an underground artist and knowing that with a few compromises perhaps he could have been much bigger. It\u2019s not a goal he says that interests him now, but around the release of Jim, there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/25/popandrock2\">serious interest from major labels</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"35366a835b7b773d07c9ddc7847774f4c5700a75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35366a835b7b773d07c9ddc7847774f4c5700a75/315_505_5653_3392/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jaime Lidell at Prospect Park with the Royal Pharaohs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jaime Lidell at Prospect Park with the Royal Pharaohs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI got a lot of major label offers in 2008, Columbia and all those biggies started sniffing around. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rick-rubin\">Rick Rubin</a> [got in touch] I went and met him. But Steve wouldn\u2019t let me go,\u201d he says. He adds that Beckett told him any label that wanted him would have to pay a million pounds to release him from his deal with Warp (Beckett didn\u2019t want to comment on the veracity of this claim). </p> <p>\u201cIt made me a little bit like \u2018fuck, I can\u2019t get off this now\u2019. I had a bit of a Prince moment. <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/12-wildest-prince-moments-20160422/prince-writes-slave-on-face-changes-name-to-unpronounceable-symbol-1993-20160422\">A mini slave moment.</a> But at the same time I\u2019ll always like Warp, they did a good job. I\u2019ll never know what it would have been like had I side stepped it on to a major label at the high point of my career. Ultimately, it probably would have gone pretty well actually.\u201d</p> <p>Jim was his most successful release, but it came at a price artistically, and again asked the question of what kind of artist Lidell wanted to be: bedroom noodler with a jacket made out of videotapes, or a bonafide mainstream star? \u201cTo be honest after I\u2019d done Jim I was a little gutted because I felt like I wasn\u2019t really doing music I loved. I felt as if I watered I\u2019d down a little bit to get on the radio.\u201d </p> <p>The radio play and sales led to a grueling tour schedule. That, coupled with a taste for hedonism, led a predictable burnout and period of self-reflection, which culminated in his last two albums, the Beck-produced <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14273-compass/\">Compass</a> and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17628-jamie-lidell-jamie-lidell/\">self-titled 2013 album</a>, where he called out his own behaviour out on tracks like the self-explanatory I\u2019m Selfish.</p> <p>Building a Beginning sees him sing about his relationship with his parents, his wife and his son. It feels like Lidell writing about his own little world rather than trying to reach a bigger one outside. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be honest about where you\u2019re at,\u201d he says of his current approach. \u201cI\u2019m really glad I didn\u2019t lock myself into being this crazy electronic dude, who can only do this and my brand is that. It would have messed with me.</p> <p>\u201cThings worked out great, I\u2019m happy, I\u2019m healthy. I don\u2019t know: is it better to have loads of money? Maybe. But I might not have done stuff I really believe in,\u201d he says. \u201cIt might have been terrible and I might have turned into a real dick, and started making music I hated. The slow and low has paid off for me. I see people pursue it and I see them peaking, and it\u2019s hard to come back from.\u201d</p> <p><em>Building A Beginning is out Friday on Jajulin Records</em></p>",

He won the Andy Kaufman award (given to those who \u201cdo not define themselves by the typical conventions of comedy\u201d) in 2011. \u201cA much more powerful canvas than subject matter about traffic or Starbucks, but still just a canvas. Comedians can be public intellectuals, but trying to be a public intellectual doesn\u2019t make you a comedian \u2026 Just because you\u2019re angry about whatever injustice is happening in society, just the mere fact you\u2019re talking about it doesn\u2019t make it comedy.\u201d<br></p> <p>Right now, he says, \u201cthe weekly cultural/national/global atrocity happens and everyone needs to put their two cents in on it. And you wade through page after page on your Facebook of comics trying to craft that perfect post that truly puts that week\u2019s injustice in perspective.\u201d</p> <p>Which touches on something the comedian <a href=\"http://www.brentweinbach.com/\">Brent Weinbach</a> said: it didn\u2019t matter if the artist was taking an explicitly innovative step or not \u2013 it was also about how they used the form. Larry Wilmore told jokes that had a borscht belt-styled echo to them, but he made The Nightly Show his own. Nina Conti does standup as a ventriloquist, but in a way that\u2019s unique to her. Stephen Colbert went from biting satire on The Colbert Report to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10154836314315329\">defending the form of the late-night monologue to Ben Smith</a>, saying: \u201cThe people who created this form weren\u2019t dummies or lazy. It\u2019s really got a purpose, the form that it\u2019s in.\u201d<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8vC0h7bzQk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/K8vC0h7bzQk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>So if American critics and journalists are going to keeping asking whether Saturday Night Live can take down Donald Trump or whether <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFQFB5YpDZE\">John Kerry or George Bush is better for Jon Stewart</a>, perhaps it would do us well to take the now-defunct Rhinoceros party of Canada and move its work south of the border, and take the tradition of Will Rogers running for office and Stephen Colbert running for president and expand that work exponentially. </p> <p>In 1980, the Rhinoceros party ran 180 candidates across Canada. Over the years, the party has advocated the repeal of gravity, that Canada\u2019s currency be changed to bubble gum so that it could be inflated and deflated \u201cat will\u201d, <a href=\"https://mononcqc.wordpress.com/2007/03/19/rhinoceros-party-of-canada-or-why-canada-used-to-own-politics/\">breeding a mosquito that would only hatch in January so that \u201cthe little buggers will freeze to death</a>\u201d, and more. <br> </p> <p>And people voted for this. So if people vote for a theoretical American Rhinoceros party, what would critics subsequently say about comedy\u2019s influence on politics? And why do these questions never seem to take into account the demonstrable seriousness of Al Franken, or J\u00f3n Gnarr, who served as the mayor of Reykjav\u00edk for four years?

Not only do our two sub-countries reason differently; they draw upon non-intersecting data sets and access entirely different mythological systems.\u201d</p> <p>This riven America has always been Saunders\u2019s great subject: there is a reason why his first collection is called CivilWarLand in Bad Decline, with its title story set in a war re-enactment theme park; and it is the same reason why, 20 years later, his forthcoming first novel focuses on Abraham Lincoln in the early 1860s. As symbols of American division go, none are greater or more terrible than the civil war. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/13/george-saunders-folio-prize-winner-interview\">George Saunders: 'The things we felt about American culture couldn't be reached by simple realism.

Aside from being one of the funniest writers around, it is difficult to think of anyone better than he is at describing how commercial imperatives deform individual lives. The powerlessness of the individual haunts his stories, the sense of citizens being to multinationals as flies to wanton boys. \u201c\u2018I pour my life\u2019s blood into this place,\u2019\u201d the narrator\u2019s father says in the early story Isabelle (1994), \u201c\u2018and you offer me half what I paid?\u2019 \u2018Market forces at work\u2019,\u201d the estate agent replies, a line that is virtually impossible to argue with, both within the confines of the story and without. Variants of it occur again and again in his work, expressing the idea, as he put it in 2001, \u201cthat our public institutions \u2013 our companies and our government and our media \u2013 absolutely affect our ability to exist gracefully in the world\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMarket forces at work.\u201d The words could be a top-line summary of Saunders\u2019s stories, whether their focus is demeaning wage slavery (stripping at a chain restaurant; inhabiting a lonely cave on the outskirts of a vast theme park), advertising (<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/01/27/jon\">the nightmarish marketing research facility of Jon</a>; the consumerist, Philip K Dickian society of My Flamboyant Grandson), the military (the angry, isolated veteran of Home), or drug testing (on chimps in the bleak lab report of 93990, and convicted felons in the more satirical <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmKKofJOyAE\">Escape from Spiderhead</a>). </p> <p>These stories are rife with euphemism, those phrases Saunders identifies as ways of enabling the unsayable to be spoken, and the unthinkable to be broached. Employers talk of \u201cstaff remixing\u201d, not layoffs, and urge their employees to \u201cTell the truth. Start generating frank and nonbiased assessments of [your] subpar colleague,\u201d while researchers who kill their human test subjects exonerate themselves by announcing they are merely obeying \u201cthe mandates of science\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2013/jul/05/george-saunders-rick-gekoski-podcast\">Guardian Books podcast: George Saunders and summer reading</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Saunders is often called a surrealist, a fabulist or an allegorist, but his work contains a lot of recognisable reality, often in the form of people worrying about how to balance insufficient income and excessive expenditure. This, from <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/10/15/the-semplica-girl-diaries\">The Semplica Girl Diaries</a> (2012), captures the rising panic of a father working every angle to move his family another rung up the social ladder: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Visa full. Also AmEx full and Discover nearly full. Called Discover: $200 avail. If we transfer $200 from checking (once paycheck comes in), would then have $400 avail. on Discover, could get cheetah. Although timing problematic. Currently, checking at zero. Paycheck must come, must put paycheck in checking pronto, hope paycheck clears quickly. And then, when doing bills, pick bills totalling $200 to not pay. To defer paying. </p> </blockquote> <p>The \u201cSGs\u201d themselves are economic migrants, who leave their families to decorate suburban American lawns (the girls are strung from their heads via a microline threaded though their brain that \u201cdoes no damage, causes no pain\u201d). They are a pungent symbol of the way the west exploits third-world poverty. For much of its length, the Semplica Girls inhabit its edges, just as for the narrator, whose diary we are reading, they are marginal presences crowded out by the status anxiety he feels for his children: \u201cLord, give us more. Give us enough. Help us not fall behind peers. Help us not, that is, to fall further behind peers. For kids\u2019 sake. Do not want them scarred by how far behind we are.\u201d</p> <p>This anxious father, barely tolerated by his children, is a stock character in Saunders\u2019s fiction. \u201cI\u2019ve done my best\u201d one screams in Bounty (1995). \u201cPitiful!\u201d his wife screams back. Bounty is the longest story in his first collection, and combines several of Saunders\u2019s key themes: not only the loser dad, but also a theme park patronised by the rich and staffed by the disenfranchised poor, and an apocalyptic US governed more by private companies than elected officials (\u201cour corporations\u201d, he writes in his Trump essay, \u201cthose new and powerful nation-states\u201d). Like the country his contemporary and friend David Foster Wallace created in Infinite Jest, Bounty is a vision of where millennial America might end up after another 25 years of bad decisions:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I sit on the deck of the barge with a semiautomatic. The water\u2019s brown. As prescribed by federal regs, all inflow pipes are clearly labelled. RAW SEWAGE, says one. VERY POSSIBLY THORIUM, says another. </p> </blockquote> <p>Humour is intrinsic to Saunders\u2019s project; it both sharpens and makes palatable his vision of humanity\u2019s tendency towards predation. But as the extract above indicates, it was more antic and farcical in his earlier collections. The jokes in CivilWarLand in Bad Decline (1996) are very funny, but arrive with a relentlessness that can become mechanical, whereas the comedy in Tenth of December (2013) is richer, arising more from character than situation. In his essay on Donald Barthelme, a writer whose style of absurdist humour is deeply imprinted on CivilWarLand (Barry Hannah being another discernible presence), Saunders writes that \u201c[s]ome part of art, certainly of Barthelme\u2019s art, involves the simple pleasure of watching someone be audacious\u201d, and there is a sense that this was enough for the younger Saunders, whose vision Joyce Carol Oates once described as \u201ccruel\u201d. </p> <p>From today\u2019s vantage, it is a strange word to read in relation to Saunders, someone who is often cited as continuing the project of working towards a moral fiction that David Foster Wallace once stated as his goal; a practising Buddhist who is cast as fighting the good fight against capitalism\u2019s cruellest excesses; a sage who, like Wallace before him, has had <a href=\"http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/george-saunderss-advice-to-graduates/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=2&amp;\">a speech to students packaged up as an inspirational tract</a>. But the early stories really do display cruelty, at least in part: much is made of disability, children are killed off at an alarming rate (this tendency, it so happens, has persisted: wherever you find yourself in Saunders\u2019s fiction, you are never many pages from a dead child), and characters are forced out of difficult situations into impossible, agonising ones. This soliloquy, from The 400-Pound CEO (1993), captures the world in which much of the early fiction plays out:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have a sense that God is unfair and preferentially punishes his weak, his dumb, his fat, his lazy. I believe he takes more pleasure in his perfect creatures, and cheers them on like a brainless dad as they run roughshod over the rest of us. He gives us a need for love, and no way to get any. He gives us a desire to be liked, and personal attributes that make us utterly unlikable. Having placed his flawed and needy children in a world of exacting specifications, he deducts the difference between what we have and what we need from our hearts and our self-esteem and our mental health. </p> </blockquote> <p>But if Saunders was more callous towards his characters in the past, he has always positioned them within a moral landscape. The world he describes may seem to be beyond repair, and yet the urge to repair it persists. In his introduction to The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Saunders writes that Twain\u2019s novel \u201clocates itself squarely on our National Dilemma, which is: How can anyone be truly free in a country as violent and stupid as ours?\u201d Saunders returns to the same moral conundrum again and again. \u201cAs soon as I start writing\u201d, he told Ben Marcus in 2004, \u201cthings start to unfold around some central moral vector, and that\u2019s that\u201d. Inevitably, at some point in a Saunders story, an ethical decision has to be made. Like Flannery O\u2019Connor, a writer who had a moral vision of forbidding harshness, Saunders enjoys stripping things down to the basics and setting two characters on a collision course. Think of Morse and Cummings in The Falls, or the drowning boy and the suicidal old man Eber in Tenth of December. Two people with opposing views set on an intersecting path: a fundamentally dramatic situation, and also, often, a moral one. In The Falls, the stressed dad Morse and the poet manqu\u00e9 Cummings walk alongside a river, each absorbed in their own frustrations. When they see, from their alternate vantage points, two girls in a canoe heading for the falls, a clear moral question is being posed. It is Morse who replies, throwing himself to almost certain death in order to try and save the girls, who, we are told, \u201cwere basically dead\u201d already. The story\u2019s final line \u2013 \u201che kicked off his loafers and threw his long ugly body out across the water\u201d \u2013 resonates with a sense of the heroism that resides in the everyday, and the belief that it is what we attempt to do that defines us, rather than what we succeed in doing. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/dec/28/tenth-of-december-by-george-saunders-a-book-to-make-you-love-people-again\">Tenth of December by George Saunders \u2013 a book to make you love people again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Reading Saunders in quantity, you get the sense that if The Falls continued beyond its abrupt end, Morse might not be pointed to as a hero but derided as a fool. An aspect of morality that Saunders is particularly interested in is the pressure that one person doing the right thing exerts on the vast majority of regular people who prefer to bump along with the blinkers on, making immoral or at least amoral choices and not appreciating being made to think about it. Brad Carrigan, American, from Saunders\u2019s most overtly political collection, In Persuasion Nation (2006), is an ingenious study of the way morality breeds resentment. The story is a fantasy in which the main characters appear to be living inside a surreal sitcom. They hear music announcing commercial breaks, or to signify that the contents of their suburban back garden have \u201cmorphed again\u201d, and \u201cthe familiar Carrigan backyard is now a vast field of charred human remains\u201d. </p> <p>It so happens that these slaughtered tribespeople can still communicate (ghosts are another Saunders trope). Brad befriends them, and is saddened by the story they relate. He tries to help them, but only succeeds in alienating his wife and her lover, Chief Wayne. She tells him:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Oh, you break my heart. Why does everything have to be so sad to you? Why do you have so many negative opinions about things you don\u2019t know about, like foreign countries and diseases and everything? Why can\u2019t you be more like Chief Wayne? He has zero opinions. He\u2019s just upbeat.</p> </blockquote> <p>Unable to simultaneously maintain his ethical standpoint and function in his domestic environment, Brad is consigned to a grey space where misfits get \u201cWritten Out\u201d. Fittingly for someone whose compassion has made his existence untenable, his final utterance as he dissipates into nothingness is the repeated phrase: \u201cPoor things.\u201d The story is a masterpiece of Saundersian juxtaposition: satirical and absurd but heartfelt, and bleak but intensely funny. What better form for a critique of a divided country to take than a radical split between registers? </p> <p>To return to Twain (who also wrote about two Americas, and chose a fitting name to do it under), the things Saunders identifies most clearly in his predecessor\u2019s writing are also true of his own. Twain \u201cstarted his career being purely funny\u201d, Saunders explains, and \u201cdid not establish an agenda and carry it through, but wrote as the spirit moved him, in as improvisatory manner as ever writer ever did\u201d. Likewise, Saunders has often spoken of attending not to theme, or overall structure, but to the individual sentence: get that right, and the rest, he says, will fall into place. \u201cHuck Finn\u201d, he writes, \u201cis a great book because it tells the truth about the human condition in a way that delights us\u201d. Saunders\u2019s most successful stories work in the same way, leading us along new and surprising pathways to arrive at fundamental truths.</p>",

  "<p>In a recent blog, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog/2016/sep/07/social-workers-gripe-solutions\">social worker argued</a> that we, as a profession, need to discuss solutions rather than just gripe about our problems. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s fair to say we only complain \u2013 and our voices are rarely heard in the media or in government anyway. But since you\u2019re asking, here\u2019s my own list of proposed solutions for better social work:</p> <h2><strong>Reinstate additional support</strong></h2> <p>Workers without a social work qualification could assist with the increasing demands of casework. At the start of my career, it was common to have two social work assistants within any social work team. Now these posts have generally become extinct. But tasks such as completing minutes, driving service users to appointments and labelling envelopes could be completed by individuals without a social work qualification, freeing up time for more meaningful service user contact.</p> <h2><strong>Let senior staff have a hand in daily practice</strong></h2> <p>Senior management (including directors) should be working on at least one case at all times, so they fully understand the system they are accountable for.<br></p> <p>If managers were able to directly experience the IT system, the duplication of work and the admin tasks expected of social workers, I suspect progress could be made immediately. It is likely that this direct experience would challenge, and surprise, those at the top.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/jun/29/whats-the-role-of-social-work-to-help-individuals-or-change-society\">What's the role of social work: to change society or to help individuals?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Allow whistleblowing without fear </strong></h2> <p>Social work reform groups express concerns about the consequences of whistleblowing. There is a real fear that if social workers articulate concerns to management or external sources there will be severe consequences.</p> <p>This concern is intrinsically linked to Ofsted inspections. I have seen the amount of pressure applied by senior managers to toe the line at inspections: there is an excessive amount of communication to staff dictating exactly what should be conveyed and said. Instead, there should be an opportunity for Ofsted to meet frontline social workers as part of a confidential feedback session.</p> <h2><strong>Make an effort to retain experienced staff</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s important to retain experienced staff, rather than allowing them to burn out and constantly replenishing the workforce. </p> <p>But I am concerned by the recommendations to solve this put forward by the chief social worker for children, Isabelle Trowler, in the government\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmeduc/201/201.pdf\">recent social work reform report</a>. She suggests local authorities with good retention rates share their experiences. This is a simplistic resolution and does not address endemic and abusive working practices in the field.</p> <h2><strong>Uphold workers\u2019 rights </strong></h2> <p>In the social work reform report and in previous guidance there are clear expectations identified regarding an employer\u2019s responsibility to social workers. But the compulsion for local authorities to abide by these conditions is flimsy and isn\u2019t explicit in employment law.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But there must be a clear process where employees can report unjust working practices. Any guidance set out by the government is needs to be legally binding and enforceable.</p> <h2><strong>Provide emotional support</strong></h2> <p>Social workers face challenging and bewildering experiences every day and supervision alone is sometimes not enough to cope with the severe emotional and physical events that are part of the job. </p> <p>More creative thinking must be applied to improving the emotional health of the workforce. I suggest that immediate access to counselling or therapy following particularly disturbing events should always be available. There must be no shame in acknowledging the impact of the harrowing work we experience.</p> <h2><strong> Remember</strong><strong> the bigger picture</strong></h2> <p>A culture must be developed in which individual social workers are not blamed for systemic failings. In some disciplinary processes, there is often little regard for the working environment of individual social workers. </p> <p>If social workers don\u2019t adhere to statutory guidelines, of course accountability for that must be brought.However, if a social worker is unable to meet rigid timescales due to their overwhelming workload, senior managers must accept responsibility.</p> <h2><strong>Counter bad press with the truth</strong></h2> <p>When unfair media reports are made of social work, I believe the government has a moral duty to investigate and respond with a more accurate analysis and portrayal of the decisions made.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>While the social work reform report recognises that negative media portrayal must be challenged, it doesn\u2019t say how. Rather than politicians jumping upon the \u201csocial work battering train\u201d perhaps they could present a more objective view of this complicated area of work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog/2016/aug/24/social-worker-paperwork-solution\">Are you a social worker drowning in paperwork? Here's a solution</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Be honest about the workload</strong></h2> <p>Business consultants could be a useful here. Let\u2019s start understanding the actual amount of time it takes to complete specific pieces of work. Arbitrary numbers relating to caseloads are not acceptable and don\u2019t reflect the intensity of some situations.<br></p> <p>Let consultants evaluate social work, speaking to workers to help provide an objective answer about the number of hours required for each piece of work. This could lead to a caseload management system that accurately reflects the modern social work world. </p> <h2><strong>Listen to us</strong></h2> <p> The government and local authority managers must \u201cactively listen\u201d \u2013 seeking views is not enough. Please let\u2019s change the culture of viewing social workers as idealistic moaners and recognise that this academically able and multi-talented group of professionals can help transform and guide future reforms.</p> <p>The government must understand the monumental and emotionally charged role we deliver, start talking to the frontline workers and start to listen to the abundant surveys, research, literature and anecdotal evidence available to shape a more successful future.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Sophie Ayers is a social worker in child protection and court work</em></p> <p><em>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog\">Social Life Blog</a> is written by people who work in or use social care services.

range of goods by about 10%, blaming the falling value of the pound against the euro and the dollar.</p> \n<p>The row will be embarrassing for the supermarket\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis, who previously held a senior role at Unilever. It also comes after Tesco made sweeping changes to the way its buyers deal with suppliers after strong criticism from the industry watchdog, the Grocery Code Adjudicator.</p> \n<p>A Tesco spokesperson said: \u201cWe are experiencing availability issues on a number of Unilever products. We always work to ensure customers get the best possible prices and we hope to have this issue resolved soon.\u201d</p> \n<p>Unilever is one of the UK\u2019s biggest suppliers of branded foods and household goods and the dispute could have serious consequences for both sides. </p> \n<p>In different areas of the country a number of Unilever brands have sold out. They include Persil, Surf, Dove, Comfort, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice cream, Elmlea, Colman\u2019s, Helmann\u2019s, Marmite, Knorr, Bertolli, Flora, Comfort and Pot Noodle. </p> \n<p>It is understood that Unilever has approached a number of the major retailers in an attempt to increase prices. One well-informed source said: \u201cUnilever is using Brexit as an excuse to raise prices, even on products that are made in the UK.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bryan Roberts, a retail analyst at TCC Global, said Unilever\u2019s attempt to increase prices was not surprising and reflected attempts by a large number of supermarket suppliers to offset cost increases. He suggested there were likely to be more disputes between retailers and suppliers.</p> \n<p>\u201cA lot of suppliers are seeking to pass on price increases to retailers but in the current environment retailers are increasingly reluctant to take it. They want to keep prices as low as they can to increase their affordability against the competition.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/great-marmite-war-reality-brexit-bite\">With the great Marmite war, the reality of Brexit has started to bite | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It emerged earlier this week that confidence in the food and drink industry is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/12/food-industry-shaken-by-hard-brexit-prospects-survey-reveals\">increasingly fragile since the upheaval caused by the EU referendum result</a>.</p> \n<p>Ged Futter, a retail consultant at IR Solutions, which advises suppliers on how to negotiate with retailers, said the fall in the value of the pound was having a huge impact on those importing goods. \u201cA lot of suppliers have seen costs go up significantly because of currency. Some are covered until the end of the year but not beyond. Retailers are saying they can\u2019t pass cost increases on to their shoppers but that has to happen, or they are not going to have any suppliers left,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Details of the standoff between Tesco and Unilever emerged just a few hours after Justin King, a former boss of Sainsbury\u2019s, warned that supermarkets could not absorb cost increases caused by the falling pound and that price rises were inevitable.</p> \n<p>Serious disputes over price are not that unusual in the grocery sector. Roberts said it was usually the retailer who ended up backing down because shoppers demanded certain brands.</p> \n<p>In 2011, Tesco refused to stock a number of Premier Foods\u2019 brands, including Oxo and Ambrosia, after the supplier tried to pass on a 14% increase in costs. The two fell out the previous year over Hovis when Premier, citing soaring wheat prices, tried to raise the price of its loaves.</p> \n<p>Unilever declined to comment on the dispute with Tesco.</p>",

At the <a href=\"http://www.palestinecampaign.org/\">Palestine Solidarity Campaign</a> we will <a href=\"https://www.palestinecampaign.org/campaigns/settlements/\">continue to push for action</a>.</p> <p>Put simply, it is time for all bodies to stop talking about Israel\u2019s settlements as illegal and to start treating them as such. Israel has long claimed that the global campaign calling for it to be held to account for its violations of human rights and international law occupation is seeking to hold Israel to a different standard than that expected of other nations \u2013 and in doing so questions the motivations of advocates of the campaign. The opposite is true.</p> <p>The call is for Israel to be treated like other nations, and for it to abide by the same rules. The rules that Fifa applied to clubs in Northern Cyprus and South Ossetia, among others, who are excluded from competition, should now be applied to the IFA. Any other decision would represent a fundamental violation of the principle that makes football so popular: that we are all equal under the law and all play under the same set of rules.</p>",
  "<p>Apples are like winter coats. By February, we\u2019ll be tired of the very sight of them, but right now, after a summer of soft, juicy stone fruit and berries, the crunch of a russet or the warming woolliness of a sour cooker is as thrilling as the smell of a new pencil case. And, while they are still abundant and cheap, and no one can get enough of the things, I\u2019ve added a classic British apple cake to the usual repertoire of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/nov/07/how-to-make-perfect-apple-pie\">pies</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/oct/14/how-to-make-perfect-crumble\">crumbles</a>.</p> <p>I say British specifically, because when my thoughts first turned to apple cake I got excited about custardy French versions and dense, <a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/09/moms-apple-cake/\">cinnamon-spiked American ones</a>, before regretfully realising that pitting an <a href=\"http://www.dutchessroz.com/2015/04/apple-and-olive-oil-cake.html\">Ottolenghi recipe</a> with olive oil and maple icing against one from a farm kitchen in Victorian Dorset was as pointless as comparing a Barbour with a Prada shearling \u2013 both great winterwear in their own way, but they couldn\u2019t be more different.</p> <p>As Dorset has adopted the apple cake as its official culinary symbol, I\u2019ve plumped for the West Country variety, though those from further north may be interested to note that Julie Duff\u2019s truly excellent book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2004/feb/08/foodanddrink.shopping\">Cakes: Regional and Traditional</a> contains recipes from Ireland, Wales and Yorkshire, and Sue Lawrence\u2019s Scottish Baking boasts one from north of the border, too.

Usually I take the stance of the more butter the better, and indeed, Burns-Booth\u2019s cake is rich and delicious, but the plainer versions prove more popular on this occasion \u2013 they just feel more fitting to the spirit of this particular cake.</p> <p>Duff notes that \u201colder recipes used lard\u201d \u2013 she prefers butter, but I can\u2019t resist tracking down some decent pig fat for Vipan\u2019s. Free-range stuff proves oddly difficult to get hold of, but it\u2019s well worth the effort, giving this rock-cake-like creation an addictively crisp texture my testers can\u2019t get enough of. For my fluffier version, however, I\u2019ll be sticking with Berry\u2019s melted butter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"253ba9102f20ffc676764827154d4aa713440580\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/253ba9102f20ffc676764827154d4aa713440580/96_0_2873_2873/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apple cake by Mary Berry, made with melted butter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apple cake by Mary Berry, made with melted butter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Sugar</h2> <p>Most recipes don\u2019t specify what kind of sugar to use, which I generally assume to imply white caster, but Burns-Booth and Duff both go for the soft light brown sort. Having seen <a href=\"http://www.dorsetfoodiefamily.co.uk/dorset-apple-cake/\">a recipe from the West Dorset Foodie </a>that recommends dark muscovado, I decide to give that a whirl in Duff\u2019s cake, but testers declare it too Christmassy for this time of year. The caramel flavour of the light muscovado, however, works as well with the fruit as one might expect, given the popularity of toffee apples. A few people, me included, find Burns-Booth\u2019s recipe a little sweet for their taste, so I decide to cut the sugar slightly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f092ca08ab371ed23006ae3d46bb838e7a82d9e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f092ca08ab371ed23006ae3d46bb838e7a82d9e3/0_0_3648_2736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karen Burns-Booth chooses soft light brown sugar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karen Burns-Booth chooses soft light brown sugar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her crunchy demerara topping proves very popular, however, even more so than Duff\u2019s deliciously sticky honey glaze \u2013 like Berry\u2019s toasted almonds, they supply a pleasing textural contrast to the soft fruit and chewy cake beneath.</p> <h2>The apples</h2> <p>Though this is a cake designed to work with whatever windfall you might have been landed with, only Berry calls for cooking apples. The problem, I find, is that Bramleys in particular break down very quickly when heated, which is what makes them such a delight to stew, encase in pastry and so on \u2013 but which also means that the chunks in Berry\u2019s cake end up marooned in great caverns within the batter. Better to go with a firmer-textured eating variety that keeps its shape during cooking \u2013 Rhodes recommends the Granny Smith for its \u201ctart bite\u201d and Burns-Booth the spicy Cox, but use whatever you like or have in abundance, though I would recommend something fairly tart to contrast with the sweetness of the crumb.</p> <p>More important, in my opinion, is the way you cut the fruit \u2013 grate it, as Rhodes suggests, and it will disappear into the batter. Smallish dice are preferable, and I also like Burns-Booth\u2019s notion of keeping the skin on; not only does it make life easier, but it helps keep the pieces together. Plus, the more fibre the better, surely.</p> <h2>Extras?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b440a05bf753d631eae20655971c48943e8b03ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b440a05bf753d631eae20655971c48943e8b03ce/0_0_3648_2736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Rhodes\u2019 apple cake\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gary Rhodes\u2019 melted cheddar topping is a clever twist</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apples have a natural affinity with dried fruit, like Duff\u2019s sultanas, and sweet spice \u2013 she uses cinnamon, Rhodes nutmeg, and Burns-Booth goes all out with the mixed sort, while Berry bucks the trend with almond extract. As usual, I\u2019m powerless to resist the peppery charms of nutmeg, finding the sweet perfume of cinnamon overpowering, but the taste test is divided \u2013 though most agree that they find the dried fruit to be gilding the lily.</p> <p>Rhodes\u2019 melted cheddar topping is a clever twist on the idea of serving cheese with fruit cake, but not everyone\u2019s sold on the idea, and I reluctantly concede that perhaps it is something better served alongside the cake than baked into the batter. Alternatively, some thick ivory cream, or a dollop of tangy yoghurt would do very nicely \u2013 along with a nice cup of tea, naturally.</p> <h2>Perfect Dorset apple cake</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb3be4c860169571cb7dd423142c1aced3f8d9cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb3be4c860169571cb7dd423142c1aced3f8d9cf/0_0_3648_2736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Perfect Dorset apple cake by Felicity Cloake.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Perfect Dorset apple cake by Felicity Cloake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><strong>(Makes one apple cake)</strong></em><br></p> <p><strong>225g wholemeal flour<br>2 tsp baking powder<br>Pinch of salt<br>Grating of nutmeg or 1 tsp mixed spice<br>175g light muscovado sugar<br>150g butter, melted<br>2 large eggs, beaten<br>4 medium apples, preferably fairly tangy (I like Cox\u2019s), diced<br>Demerara sugar, to top<br>2 tbsp flaked almonds</strong></p> <p>Heat the oven to 160C and grease a 20cm cake tin.

As of close of business, there is now no chance for the plebiscite to go to the senate until the week of November 7 - given next week senate estimates.

In effect, it is a tax increase by stealth. For example, a person earning $79,000 who got a 2% wage rise to $80,580, goes from paying a marginal tax rate of 32.5% to 37%.</p> <p>But we need a bit of context. They would only be paying 37% tax for the $579 they earned above $80,001. The rest would be unchanged.</p> <p>The tax changes mean that now instead of going into a higher tax bracket, this person would remain with a tax rate of 32.5%. It makes a difference of $26 a year less in tax.</p> <p><strong>The biggest tax cut anyone will get is those who earn over $87,001 \u2013 they will get a cut of $315 a year, or $6 a week.</strong></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T01:38:59.266Z\">at 2.38am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fed892e4b03b22b4fb2c5b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T00:46:05.660Z\">1.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p> I told you there has been a storm of legislation.<br></p> <p>*1 <strong>MR PORTER</strong> <strong>:</strong> To present a bill for an act to amend the law relating to social security, and for related purposes.

Let me recap for those who do not follow for the full day. (You are only human.) </p> <p>There was a Labor amendment to an international tax bill moved by <strong>Andrew Leigh</strong>. The financial services minister, <strong>Kelly O\u2019Dwyer</strong>, was in the chair, which means she was in charge on the government side with the usual staffers. The Speaker in the chair called for the vote and the government waved it through. As O\u2019Dwyer left the chamber, Leigh thanked the government for voting for a Labor amendment and only then did it dawn on the Coalition what just happened. </p> <p><strong>The manager of opposition business, Tony Burke</strong>, was up on his feet, making hay while the sun shone.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let\u2019s make clear what it is that was carried unanimously in this room today. Every member of the house earlier resolved the following \u2013 that the house calls on the government to explain why it has failed to close tax loopholes and increase transparency in Australia.</p> </blockquote> <p>The leader of the house, <strong>Christopher Pyne</strong>, acknowledged the win. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The member is allowed to have his moment in the sun gloating about an inadvertent error. <strong>I would make the point that there are several owners of this error</strong> and I am not going to criticise them individually because it is wrong to criticise the people who work for us, the people who were sitting in the chair \u2026 and I am not going to do that.</p> </blockquote> <p>Burke was having none of that this morning. He told <strong>Kieran Gilbert</strong> on Sky:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If it was an ordinary administrative error, it would have happened sometime in the last century. It hasn\u2019t.</p> </blockquote> <p>A point he made on Twitter straight after the vote.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Tony_Burke/status/786103414199574528\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today for the first time in the history of Federation an Opposition second reading amendment was carried.<br>This was not the government&#39;s plan</p>&mdash; Tony Burke (@Tony_Burke) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tony_Burke/status/786103414199574528\">October 12, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>I spoke to Burke straight afterwards to confirm it because not even the live minutes of the house recorded the fact. No one was ready for it.</p> <p>Labor allowed the government to amend the vote after it had made its point and events continued to the adjournment. The truth is Labor is very good at this procedural stuff, having survived the hung parliament.

  "<p>When David Cameron departed Downing Street, he left three white elephants grazing the Whitehall grasslands. They had been awaiting their fate for years, kept going with fodder slipped them by their kindly keeper, George Osborne. Cameron never made up his mind what to do with them and so left them to his successor. Their names were Hinkley, HS2 and Heathrow.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/08/heathrow-third-runway-expansion-boris-johnson-justine-greening-miss-commons-vote\">Top anti-Heathrow Tories will miss vote on third runway</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To Theresa May they have become talismans of her muscular approach to infrastructure. She could have shot them on sight and directed their upkeep to good causes. But white elephants are not without defenders. Each had been portrayed as the embodiment of Britain\u2019s industrial greatness. If May wanted to look good, she should shower them with largesse, not kill them.</p> <p>Last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/29/hinkley-point-ministers-sign-go-ahead-for-nuclear-power-plant\" title=\"\">she gave Hinkley</a>, the sickest of the beasts, a loving hug. Yesterday, it was the same for HS2. Next week, we are told, the trio will be&#xa0;completed with Heathrow. It is said that they will together consume over \u00a3100bn of public money. This is a stupefying sum for a government supposedly short of cash.</p> <p>An old Treasury joke has a project for a bridge to the moon. Advocated as feasible by some boffin, a headline-hungry minister secures \u201cseed money\u201d to \u201cscope options\u201d. Consultants gather like bees to honey, followed by construction lobbyists. Reports are funded to boast that Britain would be in the van of moon-bridging. UK plc would be at the top table. There would be \u201cmassive spin-off\u201d. The steel industry would revive. Thousands of jobs would be created from Scunthorpe to Kent. All opposition to the moon bridge is dismissed as defeatist, as showing a lack of enterprise, of patriotism, of care for jobs-\u2019n\u2019-growth. Doubts of the project\u2019s feasibility are rebutted with reports from PwC and McKinsey proving that, if you spend enough public money, you will indeed get to the moon.</p> <p>Our three white elephants are all bridges to the moon. There is no constituency of expert opinion behind any of them. Hinkley Point C was always a blind alley in the vexed world of nuclear power generation, a giant reactor that has never worked and may never. Such is the financial state of its French builder, EDF, that doubt still consumes its future. When announced by the government last month, the reasons given for proceeding were entirely political. It would help the French, please the Chinese, create jobs. For taxpayers and consumers who must pay for it, it is a dreadful deal. But like all such projects, as economics deflates, politics inflates.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/sep/19/hs2-rail-project-jobs-bonanza-high-speed-rail-industry-leaders\" title=\"\">HS2 is different</a> only in the obscurity of its origins. Back in 2010 it was Cameron\u2019s back-of-an-envelope alternative to a new runway at Heathrow, which he had sworn not to build. A fast train would relieve the airport of pressure from internal flights. The last sane inquiry into HS2, by <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090104005813/http:/www.dft.gov.uk/about/strategy/transportstrategy/eddingtonstudy/\" title=\"\">Rod Eddington</a> in 2006, dismissed such new-fangled networks as costly and time-wasting. Worse, they tended to \u201cacquire a life of their own \u2026 and prove difficult and unpopular to stop, even when the benefit-cost equation does not stack up\u201d. Never a truer word was spoken.</p> <p>HS2 was seized on by Osborne, eager for a symbol of his youthful machismo. It was like Bilbo\u2019s ring. Every Treasury official, Whitehall economist, Commons committee and thinktank have given it thumbs-down for value. It was energy inefficient and low on any priority list for new capacity. Its only serious backers are those with money in it, largely consultants drawing down millions a year in fees from the government. Ministers have been, in effect, paying lobbyists to lobby ministers for a project no one wants except the lobbyists. It is trains on southern, western and north-western routes that are desperate for investment, not commuters into Euston.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In all three cases, May could easily have decided the other way, with no damage to her reputation as investment-friendly</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Osborne\u2019s friend, chief executive of Manchester city council Howard Bernstein, told me early this year he had&#xa0;switched to preferring new transport links in the north \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/oct/27/what-is-hs3-proposed-sub-penning-rail-line-explained\" title=\"\">so-called HS3</a> \u2013 over HS2.

She will approve the only major expansion of an airport over a built-up area in Europe and unleash merry hell on west London.</p> <p>There is no reason for a third runway at Heathrow beyond lobbying by its operator Heathrow Airport Holdings, the former BAA. London airports are not about business but about leisure. It is reasonable (and cheaper) to expand Gatwick and build a high-speed link to London\u2019s \u201cthird airport\u201d at Stansted. In 2008 BAA was itself planning to move its hub from Heathrow to Stansted, until Gordon Brown suddenly gave Stansted to Manchester \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14196639\" title=\"\">to promote competition</a>\u201d. The waste of Stansted is a scandal, British planning at its worst.</p> <p>The last transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, never got a grip on his two white elephants. On HS2 he lacked the guts at least to reverse priorities and build HS3 first. It was hoped his successor, Chris Grayling, might be made of sterner stuff. Clearly not. The lion\u2019s share of transport investment for the next decade is to be blown on an unnecessary luxury train, while Heathrow will become a lawyer\u2019s feast.</p> <p>In all three cases, May could easily have decided the other way, with no damage to her reputation as investment-friendly. The alternatives were perfectly desirable infrastructure: smaller Chinese power stations, HS3 in the north and&#xa0;Gatwick/Stansted. All would have been quicker to build.</p> <p>Instead we have been given a worrying insight into the performance of the prime minister\u2019s policy team. As in decisions on obesity, grammar schools and immigrant registers, there is a sense that May\u2019s staff are out of their depth, unable to scrutinise policies passing across their desks. It is always easier to take the quickest route to a headline. As a result, we are saddled with three of the worst and most extravagant projects inflicted on British taxpayers in a generation.</p>",
  "<p>Love them or hate them, the Sharknado films have been a hugely successful franchise (in fact, the fourth Sharknado film yes that\u2019s right, the fourth, aired on the Syfy channel at the end of July). I couldn\u2019t possibly comment on their value as films, but as a shark scientist I can say that they inspire in me a feeling of regret that I failed to coin the word \u2018sharknado\u2019. Because in fact, a good few years before the first Sharknado hit our screens in 2013, I was investigating how sharks responded to extreme weather events as part of my PhD.</p> <p>It is with some sadness however, that I can confirm that neither my colleagues nor I managed to conjure up such a gem as \u2018sharknado\u2019 in describing our findings. Pop culture regrets aside, how do sharks respond to extreme weather events? Well, it all comes down to pressure and how they sense it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2016/sep/29/sharks-fascinate-us-but-are-we-prepared-to-protect-them-from-extinction\">Sharks fascinate us - but are we prepared to protect them from extinction?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pressure serves as an important cue within the marine environment. Since water is 1,000 times denser than air, every 10m of depth adds approximately one bar of hydrostatic pressure. The ability of animals to sense this pressure provides them with a reliable way of sensing depth, and allows them to respond behaviourally to hydrostatic pressure changes; for example, synchronising their activity to tidal cycles or regulating depth. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5190226910e035153a7a718ab02201ba8419a8be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5190226910e035153a7a718ab02201ba8419a8be/16_0_3551_2131/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A small-spotted catshark.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A small-spotted catshark.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Picasa/Lauren Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My work into shark depth utilisation began in the shark researcher\u2019s paradise that is South Bimini, Bahamas. I was stationed at the world renowned <a href=\"http://www.biminisharklab.com/home\">Bimini Sharklab</a>, founded by Dr Samuel H. Gruber. The shallow coastal waters of the Bimini islands serve as ideal nursery grounds for a number of shark species, most notably the lemon shark (<em>Negaprion brevirostris</em>). Prior to heading out to Bimini I had been discussing juvenile shark responses to changes in barometric pressure with Dr Michelle Heupel. In 2003 Heupel <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236445520_Variable_response_of_coastal_sharks_to_severe_tropical_storms_Environmental_cues_and_changes_in_space_use\">published a paper</a> on juvenile blacktip sharks that were observed to move to deeper water in response to a lowering of barometric pressure associated with the approach of Tropical Storm Gabrielle. </p> <p>Coincidentally, after only about a week of being in Bimini, Tropical Storm Ernesto was set to hit the islands (cue the Sharknado theme tune) and we were forced to evacuate back to Florida, but not before I had excitedly deployed one of my data storage tags (recording time, depth and temperature) on a shark! As it turned out, the storm weakened in its intensity on its approach to South Bimini. This meant changes in barometric pressure were minimal, and no evidence could be found of a change in the shark\u2019s depth usage in relation to the storm, let alone said shark being projected into a nearby city and battling a chainsaw-wielding hero\u2026 (Sharknado theme fades away).</p> <p>After tagging more juvenile sharks and retrieving more data than I could cope with - which ultimately revealed that the sharks spent the majority of their time occupying very shallow water depths of 0-0.1m, showed a <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diel\">diel rhythm</a> when diving to deeper depths and preferred an average water temperature of 30\u00b0C (who doesn\u2019t?!) - I decided to do further research into the behavioural responses of animals to changing weather systems. Previous studies conducted on <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/animal/teleost\">teleost fish</a> (adult white/black crappie, palmetto bass, red snapper and sauger) have shown that they alter their movement patterns and depth utilisation in response to changes in weather patterns, specifically barometric pressure (Markham et al. 1991; Guy et al. 1992; Jones and Rogers 1998; Watterson et al. 1998; Jeffrey and Edds 1999). </p> <p>However, the problem with trying to study an animal\u2019s response to changing pressure alone during a storm, is all of the other potentially confounding factors that make a storm a storm: heavy rainfall and subsequent run-off resulting in salinity changes, storm surges, wind and low frequency sound. And so, upon my return to Aberdeen and following a few discussions and meetings, I was able to eliminate all of these additional factors by being the first person to do the obvious thing and place a shark tank inside a hypobaric chamber.</p> <p>By doing this I was able to observe swimming activity of the small-spotted catshark (<em>Scyliorhinus canicula</em>) in response to specific protocols of changing pressure. The pressure utilised were well within the normal range that this species of shark would experience in the wild, given its habitat usage, with the largest change in pressure being just less than the equivalent of swimming at a depth of 11m. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2016/jan/19/tourism-with-bite-swimming-with-the-great-white-shark\">Tourism with bite: swimming with the great white shark</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Interestingly, most swimming activity was observed in relation to decreasing pressure, as opposed to increasing pressure, with the sharks responding within 10-20 seconds of the pressure change being initiated. Some of the behavioural responses observed were remarkable, with swimming activity seen after a pressure decrease of only 0.005 bar. The results suggested a very sensitive mechanism indeed, so I began to investigate the physiological aspects underpinning the ability to sense pressure. </p> <p>Previous work investigating how marine organisms without swim bladders sense pressure identified the vestibular system as a site for pressure sensing in the crab and shark (Fraser and Macdonald 1994; Fraser and Shelmerdine 2002; Fraser et al. 2003). This work suggested that the hair cell (thread hair cell in crabs) acts as a mechanoreceptor by converting minute displacements into behaviourally relevant receptor potentials, thereby providing the basis for vestibular function.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"890cfacfc3b5901f33db95e55d55895c86aa5f76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/890cfacfc3b5901f33db95e55d55895c86aa5f76/0_235_1707_1024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sharks sporting data storage tags.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharks sporting data storage tags.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lauren Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Physiological recordings have shown that the shark pressure sensor is clearly capable of responding to increasing as well as decreasing pressure (Fraser and Shelmerdine 2002). Yet my behavioural experiments in the hypobaric chamber showed no significant swimming activity occurring during increasing pressure. Heupel et al (2003) speculated that the behaviour shown by the juvenile blacktip sharks in response to the approach of Tropical Storm Gabrielle may have been an innate response based upon the synchronicity of departures and the sharks\u2019 young age (3-4 months). With shark nursery grounds typically thought to provide protection from predation and abundance of food, Heupel suggested that leaving the nursery in response to unusual or irregular changes in hydrostatic pressure may be a mechanism to prevent individuals from being trapped in a shallow area during an extreme storm event. Alternatively, it could be due to a disorientation of the pressure sensing mechanism, driving the animals to seek deeper water, although when considering the relatively small pressure changes involved this seems unlikely. </p> <p>Based upon the evidence I collated for this part of my PhD, it was clear that the pressure sensing mechanism and how it translates into a behavioural response by the animal is complex. It seems reasonable to speculate that the use of the pressure sensor in the wild would provide sharks with continuous depth information and would serve as a primary stimulus for a fast-acting innate safety response: movement of sharks from shallow turbulent water to deeper water during a storm.</p> <p>In other words, I can also conclude that it would take a heck of a storm to result in a Sharknado!</p> <p><strong>References</strong></p> <p>Heupel, M.R., Simpfendorfer, C.A., Hueter, R.E.

There\u2019s even a separate work-chat app, so you can install a shop-talk exclusive messenger to your iPhone or Android. <br></p> <p>Facebook isn\u2019t the only company making a corporate grab for our social space at work. <a href=\"https://workplace.fb.com/\">Workplace</a> has been in the making for almost two years, hoping to rival <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a> and <a href=\"https://www.yammer.com/\">Yammer</a>, chat software which facilitates more casual conversations among colleagues. It seems water cooler chat has become quite a commodity. </p> <p>As we become increasingly reliant on our screens and keyboards to converse, we are beholden to the platform, the limitations of the software we are using. Distinct from email or project management platforms such as <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/\">Basecamp</a>, Slack and Yammer encourage the sort of messages that do not need proofreading, which can be punctuated with an emoji. While an email may be the more appropriate place to enquire about a deadline, Slack is where you might more casually follow it up, and then ask about going for a drink later.<br></p> <p>Slack stands for Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge, though slacking off seems the more obvious genesis. Slack off, Yammer on; do these tools really lend themselves to the collaborative communication they purport to, or are they more suited to salacious office gossip, to cute animal gifs and quotes from The Office? In a previous job, I was part of a Yammer thread dedicated solely to the sharing of pictures of particularly unpleasant-looking spiders, captioned with \u201cI wouldn\u2019t like to find that under my bed!\u201d or equivalent. Strangely, it did bond me to my colleagues.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://uk.lush.com/\">Lush</a>, the cosmetics firm, introduced Slack and immediately saw a more relaxed approach to the software, with the open channels becoming something of a social hub. </p> <p>\u201cSince we introduced Slack, people are sharing memes, gifs and funny links in the open channels. We use it to organise birthdays, nights out, Christmas parties \u2026 and we have seen lots of niche channels created around topics such as \u2018Book Club\u2019, \u2018Comic Chat\u2019 and \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019,\u201d says Adam Goswell, UX and digital design at Lush.</p> <p>Slack has enabled colleagues to communicate with people they ordinarily wouldn\u2019t talk to, even allowing employees to overcome confidence barriers. Goswell adds: \u201cWe\u2019ve noticed people talking in social channels within groups that they probably wouldn\u2019t mix with so much in person, so, for quieter people in particular, we find Slack offers a great and alternative way for making new connections in the workplace.\u201d</p> <p>Emma Lavelle, a <a href=\"http://www.fieldandnest.com/\">freelance travel and lifestyle writer</a>, uses instant messaging to keep in touch with clients in a more casual capacity, allowing for a more chatty and sociable way of communicating freelancers often miss out on. \u201cIt can be hard to keep up. Instant messaging sidesteps the formality of emailing back and forth.\u201d</p> <p>One of the first UK businesses to introduce Slack, <a href=\"http://www.ewanbramley.com/\">Ewan Bramley Dental Care</a>, did so to manage communications between labs, dentists and administrative staff, enabling closer bonds between colleagues.</p> <p>A spokesperson says: \u201cStaff are often on the app organising nights out, celebrating birthdays and even using it to chat after hours. We have a channel that we use specifically to wish each other happy birthday, share holiday snaps and organise nights out for example. Staff that are on maternity leave also share pictures and updates on their new additions and it helps them stay connected.\u201d<br></p> <p>While a cute animal gif via instant messenger can lift the spirits, what are the benefits to the organisations of providing and paying for a social platform that allows employees to essentially goof off? For some, there are many strategic benefits of fostering a social working environment, with companies such as Google, LinkedIn and Facebook <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/01/29/office-banter-time-productivity/\">encouraging colleagues spending some downtime together</a>. Boosting productivity and allowing more taciturn colleagues the chance to come out of their shell a little, it allows for a more united workforce. Interestingly, humour specifically can have a positive impact on your career; with <a href=\"http://realbusiness.co.uk/hr-and-management/2016/02/24/the-benefits-of-having-humour-in-the-workplace/\">91% of executives believing a sense of humour is important for career advancement</a>. Something worth considering when debating whether or not to share that Donald Trump meme.<br></p> <p>So essential have Slack and Yammer become to some organisations and employees, there are guides for <a href=\"http://www.someecards.com/life/workplace/cool-slack-tips/\">appearing cooler on Slack</a>, for <a href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/Flirt-Through-Instant-Messaging\">flirting on Slack</a>, for <a href=\"http://www.etiquettehell.com/smf/index.php?topic=125463.0\">gently letting down colleagues flirting with you on Slack</a>. There is even a trend for <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/users/2015/04/slack_and_the_office_chat_several_people_are_typing_who_s_working.html\">screen grabbing particularly witty instant messaging exchanges</a> and sharing them on your social media.<br></p> <p>While instant messaging can make for a more pleasant working environment, there are of course, negatives to the increased blurring of the lines between our professional and personal lives. We are already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/27/britons-working-longer-hours-with-no-gain-in-productivity-study-finds\">working longer</a>, with no obvious benefit to our overall productiveness, and technology has encouraged an \u201c<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/mobile-phones/9646349/Smartphones-and-tablets-add-two-hours-to-the-working-day.html\">always connected</a>\u201d working ethos, adding an average of two hours to our working days.

  "<p><em><strong>Bill Rammell, author of a new report from the <a href=\"http://www.hepi.ac.uk/\">Higher Education Policy Institute</a>, warns that the social role of universities is being overlooked as the government pushes ahead with its marketisation of the sector.</strong></em></p> <p>Universities make an enormous contribution to civil society, not only through providing education opportunities and extending knowledge through research, but in their engagement with communities, their international networks, and the fostering of open public debate. </p> <p>Universities provide jobs, expertise and a multi-billion pound export industry. And as the UK prepares to start the process of exiting the European Union, universities will be crucial in helping to build a post-Brexit future for the UK.</p> <p>The government is currently pursuing a programme of higher education reform in England, including removal of the cap on student numbers, the creation of a new regulator, the Office for Students, and the introduction of a Teaching Excellence Framework to drive teaching quality.</p> <h2>Value for students</h2> <p>In addition, new providers of higher education will be able to achieve degree-awarding powers and university title much more quickly. The effect of all of this is to stimulate competition between higher education providers, in the belief that they will become more efficient, and deliver the best value for money for students.</p> <p>With students providing the bulk of funding through the tuition fee, it is right that the sector should work to deliver benefits to them. But we cannot afford to lose the historic public benefits of higher education. I am concerned that by relying too heavily on market mechanisms to drive reform, we are in danger of doing just that.</p> <p>Unlike some other critics of marketisation, I do not believe that higher education is a zero-sum game in which the advance of private interests must necessarily reduce the wider public benefits. It is possible to safeguard the public interest as the sector becomes more diverse and more competitive, but it requires a collective will. </p> <p>The bill removes the historic powers of the privy council to scrutinise higher education governance and distribute degree-awarding powers and university title. These powers will be handed to the Office for Students, a body whose proposed duties include promoting competition in the higher education sector and safeguarding value for money for students, but not protecting or promoting the wider public interest. I believe this is a real issue.</p> <p>The Office for Students would not necessarily be empowered to consider, or make an intervention to protect: <br>\u2022 the impact on a region if a large university were to fail, <br>\u2022 the spread of educational provision across geographical areas, <br>\u2022 the capability of the sector to work together to address major challenges such as the impact of digital technology on learning,<br>\u2022 employer demand for skills in specific sectors.</p> <p>The government has made a virtue of its concern for student outcomes of higher education, and it is undeniable that students are interested in economic returns. But they, and we, the public, have an interest in what kinds of people our universities are enabling students to become. </p> <h2>Ethical graduates</h2> <p>The idea of citizenship is rather unfashionable, perhaps, but few could deny that we want our graduates to be ethical, well-informed about the issues of the day and ready and able to do their bit to make a difference, whether by showing up to cast their vote, volunteering or fundraising for charity, or taking part in a political campaign.</p> <p>Higher education should be an environment in which students are encouraged to develop themselves as citizens, and we should do more to recognise the value of those civic outcomes through the Teaching Excellence Framework and in our quality regime.</p> <p>There is nothing wrong with healthy competition, especially if its leads to a better experience for students. But the <a href=\"https://www.ucas.com/corporate/data-and-analysis/ucas-undergraduate-releases/ucas-undergraduate-analysis-reports\">latest UCAS figures </a>show growth in undergraduate entry of only 1% between 2015 and 2016, a flat market in which competition risks becoming unhealthy. </p> <p>Unhealthy competition, fuelled by fast-tracked degree-awarding powers (which the Conservatives when I was in opposition opposed), limited protections for students and a proliferation of new and untested higher education providers risks driving the sector towards the lowest common denominator, spreading resources too thinly to ensure a consistently good student experience and damaging the sector\u2019s hard-won world-class reputation - and that would not serve the public interest well at all.</p> <p><strong>Join the <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/higher-education-network#https://register.theguardian.com/higher-education/?CMP=dis_57\">higher education network</a> for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

  "<p>There is a place in Lagos I go to when I need to clear my head. It\u2019s an old jetty in the city\u2019s Ikoyi neighbourhood that sticks out into the still waters of Five Cowrie Creek, which separates Lagos Island from the Lekki Peninsula at its westernmost tip.</p> <p>At night you can sit and look out at the tall buildings of Victoria Island and the Lagos skyline that, majestic in the dark, belie the fractured sprawl they dominate during the day. Often I lie here with my back on concrete that emanates heat from a day in the sun, staring up at the city lights and dreaming of the paradise that this ever-growing megalopolis will one day become \u2026 if only.</p> <p>This lasts until the private security guards from the mansion behind a large white wall across the street chase me away for \u201ctrespassing\u201d on what is clearly public property. I have stopped trying to argue that I have a right to this public space, because it means nothing. In this city, it\u2019s about what you can appropriate, not what you have a right to. If we don\u2019t act, it will increasingly be this way in Lagos and many other cities.</p> <p>Around the world, our cities are not the idealised open, accessible and cosmopolitan spaces of our dreams. More often than not, they are sectioned and controlled purviews of the radically wealthy, surrounded by clusters of have-nots.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our cities are not the idealised open, accessible and cosmopolitan spaces of our dreams.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lagos is no different. Though often described as such by outsiders, it is neither the frenetic emerging market dream, nor a throbbing third-world nightmare. For most people who live here, poor or wealthy, this city is simply a collection of daily rituals of survival, like any other large metropolis.</p> <p>This, of course, leads to striking juxtapositions of wealth and poverty occupying the same urban space. Such a statement now sounds so cliched as to mean almost nothing \u2013 but it\u2019s still one of the prime drivers<strong> </strong>for the <a href=\"http://habitat3.org/\">massive United Nations</a> conference, dedicated to reinvigorating \u201cthe global commitment to sustainable urbanisation\u201d, which is about to happen in Quito, Ecuador.</p> <p>UN-orchestrated gatherings are typically the death of all spontaneity and innovation.

Who wouldn\u2019t? However, such a proclamation does not lay out a blueprint for housing the homeless child, or for building safe public transport for the 20-something journalist who works at my magazine. </p> <p>Lagos is a fascinatingly infuriating place<strong> </strong>that its residents love, and love to hate. Licence plates on cars here proudly display the state motto \u201cCentre of Excellence\u201d, in what often seems a sarcastic swipe at the place we live in. If excellence is an ageing network of broken roads chock-full of luxury cars and overladen lorries constantly harassed by motorbikes and the unruly drivers of Danfo buses, then I suggest we aspire to something else.

It matters that many overstressed cities, such as our beloved Lagos, were originally constructed to support a very small number of non-local people living very, very well.</p> <p>A catch-all document like the New Urban Agenda feels good in its unifying, cosmopolitan aspirations, but it elides the needs of urban areas in contexts so dissimilar as to almost render its proscriptions purposeless. Among other things, Lagos and many growing African cities face housing, infrastructure and power deficits that people in London, New York and Tokyo cannot imagine.</p> <p>For example, I remember when New York City experienced total chaos from a three-day blackout due to an electrical grid malfunction in 2003; my uncle and I watched from Lagos wondering what special kind of madness would ensue if we actually had electricity for three days straight.<strong> </strong>The contexts are not the same. </p> <p>We must acknowledge there is a fundamental unfairness in suggesting that Addis Ababa, Lagos and Nairobi should not be able to develop the way Amsterdam, London and New York grew, lest we all fall off the climate change cliff. <br></p> <p>When I dream about a sustainable future Lagos, I want to see the large landholdings currently occupied by unnecessary military bases turned into massive public parks.

These are all things that the New Urban Agenda commits to \u2013 just without really saying how. </p> <p>Practically speaking, I know this comes only with greater executive and legislative accountability right here in our \u201cCentre of Excellence\u201d \u2013 an unlikely probability during Nigeria\u2019s current season of anomie. Then again, the sheer amount of political will necessary for radical urban transformation doesn\u2019t really exist anywhere in the world. It\u2019s why the fundamental inequalities and problems in cities transform so slowly<strong>, </strong>and why global conventions are generally ill-suited for the local change-making needed to improve lives.</p> <p>Instead, a utopian future Lagos must start with a few small steps that are largely applicable to cities like ours around the world.</p> <p>First and foremost, it\u2019s about fostering the political will to develop means for granting and honouring property rights in places where informality is both a coping mechanism and an Achilles heel for the poor. It\u2019s hard to invest in the upkeep of a place if your claim to the land you live on is tenuous at best. Without the security of property ownership, other areas of life become that much more difficult, and the city suffers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/feb/26/things-changing-better-lagos-residents-share-stories\">'Beyond the chaos, there's a real human bond': Lagos residents share their stories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Second, it\u2019s about innovating in safe, affordable housing made from low-cost but durable building materials. I\u2019m in love with the idea of recycling the massive amounts of plastic waste we produce in Lagos to create lasting building materials and new techniques. It sounds fantastical, but people are already doing it on a small scale.</p> <p>Finally, it\u2019s about pushing existing financial institutions to develop innovative ways of helping urban dwellers towards property ownership.

  "<p>The number of plug-in electric cars on the world\u2019s roads is set to pass the landmark of 2m vehicles by the end of 2016, with industry observers saying the electric car revolution is finally underway. </p> <p>A surging market in China is leading the way and Chinese-made models have pushed into the top five best-selling models. Europe is the second biggest market, followed by the US, but their traditional car manufacturers face a stern challenge from China and from Tesla, whose much-anticipated Model 3 is expected to go into production in 2017. </p> <p>The electric vehicle market has made a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/01/are-we-on-the-brink-of-an-electric-car-revolution\">number of false starts</a>.

They realised they did not have the brands or expertise in conventional vehicles, so they aim to leapfrog the EU and US to become the main EV provider. It is a huge risk to the European car industry.\u201d</p> <p>Viktor Irle, from <a href=\"http://www.ev-volumes.com/\">EV Volumes</a>, a global sales database, agreed that the EV revolution has begun. \u201cIt is underway,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see all the manufacturers talking about it.\u201d The number of EVs on the world\u2019s roads will be 2.1m by the end of 2016, according to EV Volumes data, which also shows battery costs are falling by 20% every year. </p> <p>Norway is the world leader and has shown how fast the car market can shift to EVs with support. \u201cNorway has for sure reached the tipping point,\u201d Irle said. One in three of all new cars sold in Norway is now an EV, a proportion that is rising every month, spurred by big tax breaks on the cars and major investment in charging infrastructure. <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/norway-to-ban-the-sale-of-all-fossil-fuel-based-cars-by-2025-and-replace-with-electric-vehicles-a7065616.html\">Norway</a> and the <a href=\"http://time.com/4298742/netherlands-petrol-diesel-vehicles-ban-pollution-electric/\">Netherlands</a>, which is also an EV market leader, both aim to phase out all fossil-fuel cars by 2025. </p> <p>The world\u2019s best selling EVs in the first half of 2016, according to EV Volumes, were the Nissan Leaf followed by the expensive Tesla Model S. But the third and fourth spots were taken by models from the Chinese firm, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Auto\">Build Your Dreams</a> (BYD), with the Tang SUV and the Qin model. Chevrolet\u2019s Volt took up fifth place. </p> <p>Irle said BYD could be a serious global competitor in the future: \u201cThe BYD cars look nice \u2013 the Tang has been called the Chinese Porsche Cayenne.\u201d He also said Tesla was set to be a major player. Its more affordable Model 3 is due in 2017 and has attracted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/01/tesla-model-3-pre-orders-stack-up-as-elon-musk-unveils-lower-priced-car\">hundreds of thousands of pre-orders</a>, though no official total has been released. \u201cI would not be surprised if it was over one million,\u201d Irle said.</p> <p>The traditional automakers have been more circumspect in forecasts for the electric car market. Erik Jonnaert, secretary general of the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association (ACEA) <a href=\"http://www.acea.be/news/article/message-from-the-secretary-general-september-2016\">said last month</a>: \u201cFor the time being, ACEA forecasts a rather marginal market share for all EVs of up to 8% by 2025. In the meantime, it remains important that we also continue to further improve traditional technologies, such as the internal combustion engine, as we will need to leverage all options available to further reduce CO2 emissions.\u201d</p> <p>Oil companies have also talked down EVs, with <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-11/bp-sees-oil-demand-growth-swamping-impact-of-electric-cars\">BP arguing this week</a> that carbon emissions could be saved more cheaply by improving the efficiency of combustion engine vehicles. ExxonMobil made the same argument when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/13/electric-cars-could-be-charged-at-shell-service-stations-from-2017\">lobbying the UK government</a> this year.</p> <p>On Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/12/investors-warn-car-industry-over-climate-change\">major investors warned the automotive industry</a> that it needs to accelerate its readiness for a low-carbon world if it is to retain their support and prosper. </p> <p>But Irle said: \u201cI always have my doubts about the traditional vehicle manufacturers. They have huge capital and intellectual property invested in combustion engines and have a hard time making EVs more attractive than their regular models \u2013 it would be an admission that EVs are better.</p> <p>\u201cThey would cannibalise their own sales and shoot themselves in the foot. This is why Tesla will likely be very successful. It also has a three to four year headstart on traditional automakers.\u201d</p>",

This feeling was echoed by all of our panel, who saw a potential divide between high-level, leadership roles and then less highly-specialised jobs that can be automated.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis is either going to be very good or very bad \u2013 and either way there\u2019s not going to be much in the way of work,\u201d says Richard Newton, author of The End of Nice: How to be human in a world run by robots. The defining factor to whether there will be a two-tier society of mass unemployment, or a society of leisure, will be what society places value on. \u201cThe social contract of work has been ripped up, and people will be left with nothing for as long as businesses and corporations value productivity,\u201d adds Newton.<br></p> <p>The cheapest and most productive thing to do will be to automate the workforce, so if productivity is what shareholders place value on, there will be mass unemployment. \u201cBut if you use technology to reduce accidents, produce food for people and save time \u2013 that provides a great societal value,\u201d says Spelman. It doesn\u2019t fit with today\u2019s idea of maximising profits, but these are important things we will need from society. \u201cSo in future we need to put societal and shareholder value together,\u201d adds Spelman. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2015/sep/22/future-job--robot-revolution\">Intelligent steps to future-proof your job against the robot revolution</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The idea of productivity was forged in the industrial revolution, so it\u2019s no surprise that this may soon become an outdated way of viewing work. \u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of work in society \u2013 there\u2019s loads of jobs like caring, looking after children and volunteer work, for which we do not assign a value,\u201d says Magdalena Bak-Maier, founder and managing director of Make Time Count.<br></p> <p>However, we need to move away from this idea of working for a pay packet. \u201cThere also needs to be a shift away from the stereotype of men working and women staying at home,\u201d adds Clare Ludlow, director of Timewise Foundation.</p> <p>Coplin agrees that even if we can automate all the services we need (and thus eliminate most jobs) we will continue to have huge societal problems that need attention. \u201cWe are on a burning platform \u2013 a key issue of the future will be: how will we feed everyone?\u201d So there\u2019s an idea that as we continue to evolve and find new boundaries, work will be confined to working on the next human step. \u201cFirst we need to tackle food and healthcare and transport issues, then we need to make the way we treat the earth more sustainably \u2013 and finally we will even look at reaching other planets,\u201d Coplin says.<br></p> <p>It may seem that some of these conversations are premature, as we are decades away from creating a working artificial intelligence. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge potential for robotics, but you must remember that making a robot is hard,\u201d says Dr Sabine Hauert, lecturer in robotics for the University of Bristol. \u201cFor example, if you wanted to create a robot and ask it to fetch you some water, that is amazingly complex. First, the robot needs to understand the home environment, then see the glass, and then locate you. These challenges are extremely hard to solve one by one, and at the moment they\u2019re almost impossible to solve altogether.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>However, Hauert warns that we will see robots and algorithms programmed to do highly specific tasks. \u201cRobots can be programmed to do specific tasks, rather than doing everything.\u201d</p> <p>One thing we need to remember is that the defining factor for what computers will be designed and created to do, is what humans want. \u201cThe change will come from what we want to happen. People make the planet work, so new advances will respond to how people want technology to change,\u201d explains Mason.<br></p> <p>But we have to be wary of creating things superior to us, warns Mark Eltringham, workplace expert and consultant for Insight Publishing. \u201cThe descent of man under machines is something to be wary and fearful of \u2013 it has the potential to be damaging in ways we haven\u2019t thought of before.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/11/crash-how-computers-are-setting-us-up-disaster\">Crash: how computers are setting us up for disaster  | Tim Harford</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the past we have used technology to replicate old ways of working \u2013 as a way to simply make old practices quicker and cheaper, but now we are about to enter a third computational wave where machines can learn and adapt. \u201cThis will have a huge economic impact \u2013 businesses will think: should I take the saving that automating the workforce will make, and run?

  "<p>When An Innocent Fashion was published in the summer <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2016/07/rj-hernandez-an-innocent-fashion-book-review\">Vanity Fair</a> breathlessly called it The Devil Wears Prada for millennials. Like Lauren Weisberger, 26-year-old author R J Hern\u00e1ndez interned at Vogue and had seemingly written a tell-all about his experiences. \u201cA lot of the book was inspired by my time working at Vogue and then afterwards at Elle and W magazine. I took my experiences and made them something new,\u201d he says on the phone from LA.</p> <p>But, unlike Weisberger\u2019s David v Goliath battle with an Anna Wintour-ish Miranda Priestly figure, An Innocent Fashion is a tussle of identity politics set against a background of fashion. With the rise of transgender models like Hari Nef and the issues of diversity on the catwalk swirling about, the publication of the book is timely. \u201cI think that, at the moment, there\u2019s an attempt to be more accepting of diversity,\u201d says Hern\u00e1ndez. \u201cBut, in reality, I feel like that\u2019s happening because it\u2019s a trend. No one in fashion really cares about a diverse world.\u201d </p> <p>Hern\u00e1ndez, a Cuban-American, who describes himself as \u201ca person of colour and a queer person\u201d, says that when he first entered the doors of US Vogue he felt out of place. \u201cLooking at the people at Vogue passing through the office and the girl who interviewed me, I thought that there\u2019s no way a Latino boy from modest means could fit into this world.\u201d</p> <p>Growing up in Miami, he aspired to escape what he calls his \u201cprovincial\u201d surroundings, but there was a big problem. \u201cI felt like the American Dream was this white thing.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d3f1efd70fa7da953a797fa5cca6a56fca4305b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3f1efd70fa7da953a797fa5cca6a56fca4305b9/0_0_332_500/332.jpg\" alt=\"RJ Hern\u00e1ndez : An Innocent Fashion\" width=\"332\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">RJ Hern\u00e1ndez : An Innocent Fashion</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The protagonist of An Innocent Fashion, Eli\u00e1n San Jamar, reinvents himself as Ethan St James. Similarly, Hern\u00e1ndez renamed himself after the JD Salinger character Seymour Glass. \u201cI thought, \u2018Why not change my name and become the person who belongs at Vogue? In the book, Ethan\u2019s biggest advantage is that he can pass for white.\u2019\u201d For Hern\u00e1ndez this name change bled into his entire external life, giving him permission to exaggerate his wardrobe and his personality. He says that it allowed him to ingratiate himself into Vogue\u2019s inner sanctum but that there was a price. \u201cThe identity that I was embracing was taking over and it could be read as a \u2018rich white person\u2019\u201d. His increasingly eccentric clothing choices \u2013 specifically a pair of shoes with four-inch-high heels \u2013 signalled the end of his time at Vogue. He claims that he was let go for wearing clothes that were deemed not appropriate for an intern. \u201cWorking in a glamorous environment doesn\u2019t afford you the licence to express yourself more than Wall Street,\u201d he says.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Another illusion that was shattered was that of the American Dream. \u201cEthan wants to get power, but he belongs to a group of people who have the biggest disadvantages in the country.\u201d</p> <p>Does the publication of An Innocent Fashion, the TV rights which have been sold under his real name suggests he\u2019s in a better place? \u201cI\u2019ve grown up for such a long time feeling inferior about my background, and now it\u2019s possible to view my background as a strength and not a weakness.\u201d Which sounds very much like a happy ending to us. </p>",
  "<p>The UK government needs to kickstart technologies to suck carbon dioxide from the air if it is to play its part in meeting the goals of the Paris climate change agreement, according to the <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/\">Committee on Climate Change</a> (CCC), the government\u2019s official advisers.</p> <p>The global climate deal, which the prime minister, Theresa May, says the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/20/theresa-may-uk-ratify-paris-climate-change-agreement-this-year\">UK will ratify by the end of 2016</a>, pledges net zero emissions by the second half of the century, in order to avoid the worst impacts of global warming. Given that some emissions, such as those from aviation and agriculture, will be very difficult to reduce to zero, that means removing some carbon from the atmosphere.</p> <p>Planting trees is the simplest solution but is limited by the land available, meaning <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_removal\">more radical technologies</a> need to be developed, such as chemically scrubbing CO2 from <a href=\"http://carbonengineering.com/\">the air and burying it</a>. \u201cA strategy for deployment [of new carbon-removal technologies] at scale by 2050 should start now given the timescales inherent in bringing new technologies to market,\u201d says a new CCC report.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK, in cooperation with other countries around the world, needs to come up with a bigger and more concerted effort around those greenhouse gas removal technologies if the ambition of Paris is to be met,\u201d said Matthew Bell, the CCC\u2019s chief executive. But the CCC report says aviation and agriculture must also be tackled by \u201csubstantial biofuel use in aircraft and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/03/eating-less-meat-curb-climate-change\">reduced red meat consumption</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Another CCC report published on Thursday says the UK must act urgently to cut emissions from the heating of homes and other buildings, which are largely reliant on gas and cause 20% of the nation\u2019s carbon emissions. UK emissions have fallen 38% since 1990, but virtually all of this drop is from greener electricity. </p> <p>Lord Deben, the CCC\u2019s chairman, said a \u201cstep change\u201d was needed in how the UK heats its homes, a problem that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/10/rudd-issues-transport-challenge-to-meet-uk-renewables-target\">threatens the UK\u2019s ability to meet its carbon targets</a>. The CCC said the government must focus on the rollout of heat pumps and low-carbon district heating systems and the testing of hydrogen as a clean-burning replacement for natural gas.</p> <p>Hydrogen has the advantage of using the existing gas network, but is as yet untested. The hydrogen could be produced using spare renewable electricity, from biofuels or from fossil fuels. The latter would only be low carbon if emissions were captured and stored but ministers abruptly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/25/uk-cancels-pioneering-1bn-carbon-capture-and-storage-competition\">cancelled its flagship carbon capture and storage policy</a> in November 2015. The CCC said hydrogen should receive similar research support to the \u00a3250m the government is already giving to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/24/mini-nuclear-reactors-answer-to-climate-change-crisis\">small modular nuclear reactors.</a></p> <p>The CCC also criticised the government\u2019s slowdown in home energy efficiency measures: just half the number of homes made warmer and cheaper to heat in the last parliament are due to be upgraded in this parliament, and ministers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/10/uk-scraps-zero-carbon-home-target\">abandoned a plan to make all new homes zero-carbon</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe still have millions of homes that have not been made efficient as they could be and we are still building homes that we will have to retrofit in a very short period of time,\u201d said Lord Deben. The CCC estimates 7m homes still have inadequate loft and wall insulation, the most basic form of energy efficiency, after the coalition government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/14/green-deal-scheme-did-not-deliver-energy-savings-audit-finds\">green deal policy failed</a>.</p> <p>Deben said the new ministers in May\u2019s government, including energy and business secretary, Greg Clark, and climate minister Nick Hurd, have long track records in backing strong climate action. \u201cI am optimistic but I still want to keep those feet to the fire,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact is, crunch time is here. By law, the government have to provide a programme to reach [the CCC\u2019s] carbon budgets.\u201d The government\u2019s carbon reduction plan has been delayed by the Brexit referendum but is expected by February 2017.</p> <p>A third CCC report addresses the climate policy implications of Brexit for the UK. It notes that the UK\u2019s key climate targets - cutting emissions by 57% by 2030 and by at least 80% by 2050 - are already enshrined in domestic law, under the Climate Change Act. But the CCC said EU efficiency standards for vehicles and appliances would have to be replaced to avoid the risk of manufacturers dumping inefficient products on UK consumers.</p> <p>\u201cEfficiency standards cut costs for consumers, reduce emissions, and create a level playing field for competition.\u201d the CCC report says. \u201cIf the UK has weaker standards than the EU that could lead to a dumping on the UK market of inefficient products with higher running costs and emissions.\u201d</p> <p>The decisions required after Brexit, such as whether agricultural subsidies are more targeted at cutting carbon emissions, could cut both ways, said Deben, who opposed leaving the EU. \u201cWhere there are opportunities, there are also the opposite: people could make things much worse,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Prof Dieter Helm, at the University of Oxford <a href=\"http://www.dieterhelm.co.uk/energy/energy/energy-and-climate-policy-after-brexit/\">said</a>: \u201cThe uncertainties [for energy and climate policy] created by Brexit unsurprisingly leave the future as clear as mud, and the mud is likely to persist for months or even years.\u201d</p>",

In Austria, the far right moves ever closer to power; in France, it grows stronger; in Sweden and other countries too.</p> <p>The cure to such movements is a left that offers an inspiring alternative relevant to the insecurities and ambitions of the post-2008 world. We don\u2019t have that yet. But that\u2019s no excuse for inaction. And we in Britain cannot smugly condemn Hungary, of course: since the Brexit vote, xenophobic nationalism has marched defiantly. Our prime minister condemns her political opponents as having disdain for patriotism; this week, both the Daily&#xa0;Mail and the Daily Express printed&#xa0;chilling front pages calling for \u201cunpatriotic Bremoaners\u201d to be damned for a \u201cplot to subvert the will of the British people\u201d, and demanding \u201cEU exit whingers\u201d be silenced.</p> <p>It is increasingly common in modern Europe for political opponents to be portrayed as unpatriotic fifth columnists.

This gas is so tightly held within the rock strata that it can only be extracted by smashing and fracturing the deep, gas-carrying rocks where they lie sandwiched in the Earth\u2019s crust. With <a href=\"https://www.australianmining.com.au/news/wa-government-gives-fracking-the-green-light/\">unfettered support from the WA government</a>, unconventional gas and fracking companies plan to access the gas by drilling hundreds or even thousands of gas wells through the groundwater aquifer. They will then pump the wells with a cocktail of chemicals at extreme pressure to shatter the layer of shale stone where the gas is tapped.</p> <p>A number of test wells have already been drilled including in the Lake Logue and <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-02/beekeepers-oppose-fracking-in-nature-reserve/6267088\">Beekeepers Nature Reserve</a> and on farmland a stone\u2019s throw from the Leseuer National Park. With each new well gas companies try their luck, and test different methods and chemicals for extracting the gas.

  "<p>If you\u2019ve had Google autocomplete a search query for you, or Netflix suggest your next favourite television show to you, then you\u2019ve already been the beneficiary of AI\u2019s helping hand.</p> <p>But recent huge strides in data processing and AI programming mean the world is on the cusp of an AI boom which promises to transform how we manage almost every part of our lives, as thoroughly as electricity did in the 20th century.</p> <p>Sound overblown? Consider the case of self-driving cars. Literally science fiction a decade ago, Google\u2019s self-driving cars have already driven more than 2.6 million kilometres, the equivalent of the moon and back three times. And anyone who owns a Tesla can already drive vast distances without ever touching the controls.</p> <p>So what\u2019s powering this AI boom, and what does it mean for those in business?</p> <p>Though to many AI might seem like a recent invention, it has in fact been an area of inquiry and investigation for great technical minds since at least the 1950s, as they strived to create computer systems that are able to understand and react to conditions affecting their environment, instead of relying on instructions from humans. </p> <p>But progress in the sector has boomed in recent years, thanks to ever-cheaper sensors supplying more and more data and rapid increases in data-processing power and affordability.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You can hire smart people to write code and gain access to resources. The real challenge is customer empathy.</p> <footer> <cite>Robert Wickham</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In addition, programmers have made breakthroughs in how AI is created in the first place. For many years, much research was focused on analysing how human experts made decisions and endeavouring to program computers to emulate those thought processes.</p> <p>Now, however, much of the buzz is coming from machine learning, which involves creating artificial neural networks that can then learn rules and behaviours through repetition. For instance, Google\u2019s powerful image identification AI has learnt to identify what is in an individual image after being exposed to millions of other images and told what it is looking at, allowing it to now recognise objects using its own \u201cintuition\u201d, rather than a prescribed set of rules from a programmer.</p> <p>A potent example of the power of machine learning came in early 2016, when Google\u2019s AlphaGo system thrashed 18-time world Go champion for the first time. To win at the notoriously complex game, Google\u2019s engineers built a neural network and made it watch countless games of Go between human players, helping it learn to recognise and plan moves intuitively. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0e741aac22756f2dbcb8ad54c2912912f5d67acb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e741aac22756f2dbcb8ad54c2912912f5d67acb/0_0_1080_607/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Match 3 of AlphaGo vs Lee Sedol.

In fact, wherever data streams exist, AI has the potential for impact.</p> <p>Salesforce APAC Vice President Robert Wickham said the rapid spread of mobile devices, along with the first stirrings of the Internet of Things, has meant the creation of a deluge of data. </p> <p>\u201c90% of the world\u2019s total data was created in the past two years, which is a staggering statistic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut less than 1% of that data is harvested, analysed and used.\u201d</p> <p>The reason for this? Big data analysis has traditionally been difficult to integrate into a business\u2019 existing operations, and expensive, relying upon the expertise of data scientists. </p> <p>However, machine learning AI programs are promising to upend this state of affairs, by thriving on enormous datasets and learning how to make the most effective suggestions for a given set of parameters.</p> <p>But although the rapidly increasing accessibility of AI means it is soon to become a lot more commonplace in the business world, using AI effectively won\u2019t be a set-and-forget proposition.</p> <p>\u201cTechnology is not the challenge,\u201d Wickham said. \u201cYou can hire smart people to write code and gain access to resources. The real challenge is customer empathy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you structure your business to be a real customer-oriented enterprise? How do you ensure from day one that you understand as best you can exactly what your customer wants to do? If you can\u2019t do that, you can\u2019t scale.\u201d</p> <p>Wickham said along with customer empathy, another essential for a businesses wanting to thrive in an AI-powered world is the ability to embrace constant change and operate at speed. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/salesforce-the-unfair-advantage/2016/sep/27/how-do-the-most-valued-brands-in-the-world-meet-customer-expectations\">How do the most valued brands in the world meet customer expectations?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThink of it as being able to change the tyres of a race car while it goes around the track,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can run experiments in real time, testing what works and what doesn\u2019t as you go, and then move the most successful elements into the mainstream.\u201d</p> <p>Crucially, well designed AI should make it easier for staff to do their job of attending to customer needs as effectively as possible.</p> <p>This is where even the simplest of AI solutions has potential to affect positive change to how even the smallest business operates. Take, for example, a simple system to integrate a user\u2019s email and calendar, offering prompts to help the user be more productive.

The proportion of people who associate fracking with water contamination has also reached new highs. </p> <p>While most respondents still felt exploiting the gas would bring economic benefits to the UK, those people are declining in number.

The decline in public support for fracking since July 2013 appears to be linked to the protests in August 2013 against shale company Cuadrilla\u2019s plans to drill a well at Balcombe, in West Sussex.</p> <p>The poll\u2019s findings are similar to the government\u2019s own public attitudes tracker, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/541106/Summary_of_key_findings_BEIS_Public_Attitudes_Tracker_-_wave_18.pdf\">last updated in July</a>, which found 31% of people opposed to fracking compared to 21% supporting it.</p> <p>Ken Cronin, chief executive of Ukoog, the trade body that represents the shale industry, said: \u201cWe have long believed that once people get to see how little impact shale gas exploration has on the environment and communities then attitudes will swing strongly in favour.\u201d</p> <p>Josh Fox, an anti-fracking campaigner and film-maker, told the Guardian that despite expert bodies such as <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/review-of-potential-public-health-impacts-from-shale-gas-extraction\">Public Health England saying shale gas could be extracted safely in the UK</a>, he believed fracking would cause a \u201chealth crisis\u201d if it took off in the UK because of water contamination and local air pollution issues.</p> <p>\u201cIf the UK decides to go down the road America has gone down, it will mean we\u2019re starting the fracking wars all over again,\u201d said Fox, speaking from London during a tour of the UK to promote <a href=\"http://www.howtoletgomovie.com/\">his new climate change documentary</a>. </p>",
