Over the last several months, members of the foundation\u2019s senior leadership, Chelsea, and I have evaluated how the foundation should operate if Hillary is elected,\u201d the 70-year-old former president wrote.</p> <p>In the event of a Clinton victory in November, he added, the foundation will accept contributions only from US citizens, permanent residents and US-based independent foundations, whose names will be made public. Many of its international activities will be transferred to other organisations and its official name will change from the Bill, Hillary &amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation to the Clinton Foundation.</p> <p>Bill Clinton, who set up the foundation at the end of his presidency 15 years ago, wrote: \u201cWhile I will continue to support the work of the foundation, I will step down from the board and will no longer raise funds for it.\u201d</p> <p>Next month\u2019s Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting in New York will be the last, he added, irrespective of the election result. But he rejected growing calls, <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2016/08/16/clinton-foundation-should-stop-accepting-funds/W8JsNkBseYo6wIxWosNb5O/story.html\">not only from Trump</a>, that the foundation should close down if his wife prevails. \u201cWhile my role in that work will change, the work itself should continue because so many people are committed to it and so many more are relying on it.\u201d</p> <p>The statement, which was emailed to about half a million supporters, came hours after Trump stepped up his attacks on the foundation. \u201cHillary Clinton is the defender of the corrupt and rigged status quo,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-statement-on-clinton-foundation\">the Republican nominee said</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt is now clear that the Clinton Foundation is the most corrupt enterprise in political history. What they were doing during Crooked Hillary\u2019s time as secretary of state was wrong then and it is wrong now. It must be shut down immediately.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5867ae3a864ba08d14f2e49b7b0afa9f2d01524b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5867ae3a864ba08d14f2e49b7b0afa9f2d01524b/197_292_4760_2854/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Its official name will change from the Bill, Hillary &amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation to the Clinton Foundation if she wins the presidency.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Its official name will change from the Bill, Hillary &amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation to the Clinton Foundation if she wins the presidency.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brooks Kraft/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Trump has donated to the foundation previously, he has accused Hillary Clinton of creating a \u201cpay-for-play\u201d scheme whereby donors to the foundation got preferential treatment at the state department.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>He was given fresh ammunition on Monday when a batch of 20 emails released by <a href=\"http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/new-abedin-emails-reveal-hillary-clinton-state-department-gave-special-access-top-clinton-foundation-donors/\">the conservative group Judicial Watch</a> showed how the foundation sought access to Clinton on donors\u2019 behalf.</p> <p>On 23 June 2009, for example, Doug Band, a senior executive at the foundation, wrote to Clinton\u2019s deputy chief of staff Abedin. Band wanted to arrange for the crown prince of Bahrain, a US ally, to meet the secretary of state during a visit to Washington. \u201cGood friend of ours,\u201d Band wrote to Abedin.</p> <p>After initial doubts over scheduling, Abedin confirmed that Clinton would meet Crown Prince Salman, who in 2005 had made a $32m commitment to the Clinton Global Initiative. Copies of Clinton\u2019s calendar obtained by the Associated Press confirm that the meeting took place in her state department office on 26 June 2009.</p> <p>Another exchange shows Band requesting that Clinton help a member of British football club <a href=\"http://www.wolves.co.uk/\">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> \u2013 presumably a player, though no name is given \u2013 who was struggling to get a US visa to visit Las Vegas for a \u201ccelebration break\u201d because of a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d. This was at the behest of Hollywood and sports executive Casey Wasserman, who had donated between $5m and $10m to the Clinton Foundation.</p> <p>But Clinton\u2019s office did not comply and no visa was obtained. Abedin said it \u201cmakes me nervous to get involved but I\u2019ll ask\u201d. Band replied: \u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>The emails also show that Clinton met SlimFast founder <a href=\"http://www.centerpeace.org/about/staff/s-daniel-abraham/\">Daniel Abraham</a>, founder of the Center for Middle East Peace and another Clinton Foundation donor, at a day\u2019s notice in May 2009. According to the Associated Press, the calendars show the meeting was one of eight between Abraham and Clinton while she was secretary, the most of any foundation donor.</p> <p>On Monday the state department rejected any allegations of undue influence. Deputy spokesman Mark Toner said: \u201cI would just once again emphasise that there wasn\u2019t a single channel for access to the secretary of state than secretary of state Clinton. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cAnd for senior aides working at the department at the time to have connections with the Clinton Foundation \u2013 which by the way was working on, for example, Haiti relief, post-earthquake, pretty significant roles in that, in fact \u2013 only speaks to the fact that these were important people who had reason to convey information to the secretary. There was nothing that we have seen that implied any kind of untoward relationship.\u201d</p> <p>The Clinton campaign rejected the criticism and took a swipe at Judicial Watch. Spokesman Josh Schwerin said: \u201cOnce again this rightwing organisation that has been going after the Clintons since the 1990s is distorting facts to make utterly false attacks. No matter how this group tries to mischaracterise these documents, the fact remains that Hillary Clinton never took action as secretary of state because of donations to the Clinton Foundation.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s running mate <a href=\"http://www.kaine.senate.gov/\">Tim Kaine</a>, speaking at the ironworkers\u2019 annual convention in Las Vegas, said: \u201cAll the donors to the foundation have been disclosed. And the foundation has said, \u2018We\u2019ll go further. We\u2019ll restructure itself completely if Hillary Clinton is elected president.\u2019 That\u2019s a pledge.</p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump, on the other hand, has told us nothing about how he\u2019ll deal with the conflicts posed by his business dealings, like the money his company owes to the Bank of China. And I have this to say to Donald Trump, because these ties affect your net worth: before you go about attacking a charity, why don\u2019t you come clean about your own business dealings and tell the American people who you are in debt to?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Wind musicians have be warned to clean their instruments after a man died from a lung disease triggered by fungi lurking in his bagpipes.</p> <p>The piper developed a serious inflammation of the lungs, known as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, that worsened over a number of years, leaving him with a dry cough, breathlessness and curtailing the distance he could walk from 10 kilometres to just 20 metres. Eventually, in 2014, the 61-year old was admitted to hospital where he later died. </p> <p>While the trigger for the disease was initially a mystery, a series of clues led doctors to discover that the cause was most likely a collection of fungi living inside the man\u2019s bagpipes. </p> <p>The case has led doctors to propose that \u201cbagpipe lung\u201d be added to the long list of alternative monikers for <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hp\">hypersensitivity pneumonitis</a>, which is already known as \u201cbird fancier\u2019s lung\u201d, \u201cfarmer\u2019s lung\u201d and even \u201chot tub lung\u201d after the wide range of activities to which it has previously been linked.</p> <p>\u201c[Musicians] need to be aware that there are risks that instruments can become colonised with mould and fungi and this can be related to serious and potentially fatal lung disease,\u201d said Dr Jenny King, first author of the study, of North Manchester general hospital. </p> <p>She added that the warm, moist environment of wind instruments is an ideal breeding ground for such organisms. \u201cWind instrument hygiene is really important in preventing this and [musicians] should be stringent in cleaning their instruments regularly.\u201d</p> <p>Writing in the journal <a href=\"http://thorax.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2016-208751\">Thorax,</a> King and colleagues from the University Hospital of South Manchester warn that wind players should disinfect their musical instruments regularly with a brush and detergent. \u201cPhysicians should be aware of this potential risk factor and promote wind instrument hygiene,\u201d they add.</p> <p>The case of the 61-year-old man initially baffled doctors, with common triggers of the lung disease, such as bird-keeping and household mould, ruled out. </p> <p>However, a clue appeared after the patient was admitted to hospital in 2014. Examining his history, the medical team discovered that the man had spent three months in Australia in 2011, during which time his health bounced back, before once again deteriorating upon his return to the UK.</p> <p>Close scrutiny of his habits offered a lead. During his trip to Australia the man had temporarily abandoned his daily custom of playing the bagpipes, but had returned to playing them every day once back in the UK.</p> <p>An investigation of the bag, neck, stock and reed protector of the instrument yielded even stronger evidence that the bagpipes were at the root of the problem. \u201cWe isolated mould and fungi that are known to be associated with hypersensitivity pneumonitis and propose that was the likely cause of it,\u201d said King. \u201cIt is likely [down to] spores from the fungi and mould that, when you inhale them, your body and your immune system react to them,\u201d she said, adding that while not everyone would be susceptible to the spores, it is hard to predict who was likely to experience a reaction. </p> <p>It is not the first time that bagpipes have been hailed a health hazard. In 2013 the Glasgow-based <a href=\"http://www.collegeofpiping.org/\">College of Piping</a> issued a <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/news/bagpipe-warning-over-threat-of-fatal-fungus-1-2828835\">warning</a> after expert piper John Shone fell seriously ill with symptoms of breathlessness and weakness. Eventually it was discovered that he was suffering from a fungal infection that was triggered by organisms lurking inside his bagpipes. \u201cIt was very much life-threatening,\u201d Shone, a former competing piper, told the Guardian. \u201cI was near death.\u201d </p> <p>Shone recovered with treatment but he says not enough is done to warn players of the dangers that could be lurking in their pipes. \u201cIn the leather bagpipes we use what was called a seasoning in the bag, and that seasoning in fact has [an] antiseptic property,\u201d he said. Seasoning, he points out, is not used in bagpipes made from modern materials as they are already airtight; this necessitates regular cleaning, which modern bagpipes are designed to facilitate. <br></p> <p>Robert Wallace, an award-winning professional bagpiper and editor of the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association\u2019s magazine, said that pipers should not panic.<strong> </strong>\u201cIt\u2019s extremely rare,\u201d he said of the incident. \u201cHowever that doesn\u2019t mean to say we should drop our guard.\u201d</p> <p>Since his brush with death Shone says he has bought a new set of pipes and is careful to disinfect them. But doctors say it is not only pipers who should heed the warning to clean their instruments, highlighting previous reports of a saxophone and a trombone player with symptoms of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Both musicians recovered after cleaning their instruments.</p> <p>Dr Tamara Everington of Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, who treated Shone, says that musicians should be aware of possible health implications of their instruments. \u201cWe spend a lot of time thinking about the technical aspects of the instrument, but we don\u2019t spend enough time thinking about the impact on our own bodies,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you think about them and address them early on then you have the chance of being able to play your instrument for many years and get great pleasure from it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Any Sam Allardyce sceptics who question whether he will be a progressive England manager may wish to hear about his readiness to make John Stones the cornerstone of his rearguard.</p> <p>The Manchester City defender has often drawn criticism for his inconsistent ability to defend and his desire for over-elaboration: two attributes from which the supposedly pragmatic Allardyce might recoil. The opposite is true, however. Speaking at St George\u2019s Park on Monday, Allardyce was quick to correct a question that billed Stones as potential, instead stating that the 22-year-old has a great chance of being \u201cthe thing now\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/22/sam-allardyce-does-not-rule-out-england-recall-john-terry\">Sam Allardyce does not rule out England return for John Terry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Sunday the new head coach announces his first squad. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/09/manchester-city-complete-signing-of-john-stones-from-everton\">City\u2019s \u00a347.5m summer signing</a> will be included and, according to Allardyce, Stones can cement a starting place for the 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign, which begins in Slovakia on 4 September. Asked if he is a player for the future, Allardyce said: \u201cThere\u2019s that word then \u2013 we don\u2019t want potential, do we? I want the thing and right now. Potential is something that\u2019s going to be great in the future. I want it right now and he\u2019s got a great chance of becoming it right now with working with Manchester City.\u201d</p> <p>Stones\u2019s move from Everton made him the Premier League\u2019s most expensive defender and Allardyce believes that under Pep Guardiola\u2019s tutelage at City the former Barnsley player can be elevated to a new level, just as Gerard Piqu\u00e9 was when he was transferred from Manchester United to Barcelona in 2008.</p> <p>\u201cWith all respect to Everton, working with Manchester City and the level he has to get to there [to be a success]: you don\u2019t realise but Guardiola does focus quite a lot on defending. Not just winning the ball back,\u201d Allardyce said in regard to Stones, who has started and impressed in all three of City\u2019s matches this season.</p> <p>\u201cPiqu\u00e9 was a little similar at Man United until he went to Barcelona, then he became a good defender as well as a great attribute for Barcelona in possession. So he had both. That\u2019s why he\u2019s stayed there for so long.\u201d</p> <p>Allardyce is intent on using psychology with England at major championships, where they so often disappoint. This could provide Stones the mental strength required to deal with the fierce scrutiny that will come if he is to be the key factor the manager wishes.</p> <p>Allardyce said: \u201cWhen we\u2019re playing at a big tournament there\u2019s a game that we just can\u2019t get through. When it doesn\u2019t go the side\u2019s way they can\u2019t see themselves through that period and come out the other end by nicking a result or pinching a result they don\u2019t deserve. That barrier gets bigger and bigger every time we fail at it.</p> <p>\u201cPsychologists do work. It\u2019s proven that they do work but they didn\u2019t in this environment. It\u2019s all about the right one. Get the right one and you\u2019re laughing.</p> <p>\u201cI do a lot myself with sports psychologists. But I challenge them and, if you challenge them and they give you the right answers, you think: \u2018Wow, I quite like this lad, he can do good for you.\u2019 Other people think a different way: \u2018He\u2019s going to help me, so I\u2019ll sit and listen to him.\u2019 I don\u2019t do that. I challenge them.\u201d</p> <p>Allardyce is yet to appoint in this department but is already using Lane4, a team of medical psychiatrists that has worked with the Under-21s and is headed by the former Olympic champion swimmer Adrian Moorhouse. \u201cI\u2019ve sat in with them on a couple of occasions,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might get to the players ultimately but as a staff, if we are made better in our delivery psychologically, that makes us better and it makes the players better.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/22/sam-allardyc-joe-hart-england-squad-manchester-city\">Sam Allardyce: Joe Hart will definitely be in England squad \u2013 for now</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI really like their company in the short periods we\u2019ve been together. They will come in on most meetings with us just to have a point of view and what their ideas might be.</p> <p>\u201cBecause we\u2019ve just got a short period of time it\u2019s hard to fit everybody in. I don\u2019t want players to be coming in and then by the end of the day going: \u2018It\u2019s another meeting about a meeting.\u2019 We\u2019ve got to be careful just in how much I deliver.\u201d</p> <p>Raheem Sterling, whose confidence can be fragile, is another young player who may benefit from the approach. He has started the campaign impressively for City, after Guardiola employed a touch of his own psychology <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/24/pep-guardiola-raheem-sterling-england-confidence\">by phoning the winger during the close season</a> to tell of his admiration for him.</p> <p>Allardyce said: \u201cIf Pep\u2019s got him over that glitch, then he should be a much better player from now on than he was before he had that. There\u2019s always that time where people say that you have the dip \u2013 it\u2019s how well do you overcome it. When you do, you then end up being a much better player and generally your career lasts a lot longer.\u201d</p> <p>Stones, like Sterling, is having to convince the doubters and, as with his club, he may have the ideal international manager to enable it if he is to become England\u2019s linchpin.</p> <p>Allardyce promises a relentless drive for perfection. \u201cIt\u2019s what I am. I wouldn\u2019t have got here by doing it any other way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe staff and the players are what are going to make me successful and my guidance and my ideas and my experience. So I demand from them to please make me successful.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the pinnacle of my career and I don\u2019t want to fail.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>How Stones and Pique compare</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>John Stones</strong></p> <p><strong>Age</strong> 22 <strong>Turned pro</strong> December 2011</p> <p><strong>Clubs</strong> Barnsley, Everton, Manchester City</p> <p><strong>Appearances</strong> 126 (2 goals)</p> <p><strong>Club honours </strong>None</p> <p><strong>International caps </strong>10 (England)</p> <p><strong>International honours</strong> None</p> <p><strong>Biography </strong>Born and raised in Barnsley, Stones made his debut for his hometown club in 2012, making 28 appearances before signing for Everton in January 2013 for \u00a33m.

  "<p>Ian Bell is being considered for a possible Test recall this winter, having already been sounded out by the England head coach, Trevor Bayliss, regarding his desire to return.

Key to any recall, therefore \u2013 along with a strong finish to the summer with the bat \u2013 will be convincing Bayliss and the Test captain, Alastair Cook, that it has returned.</p> <p>Bayliss in particular is keen to forge on with a younger crop of players but, given the daunting challenge of trying to emulate the 2012 team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/dec/17/england-in-india-2012-13-england-cricket-team\">who won away in India</a> for the first time in 27 years, the Australian could yet be convinced by the case for Bell, as well as that of the 38\u2011year\u2011old off-spinner Batty, when the selectors meet in the second week of September.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/21/stuart-broad-signs-hobart-hurricanes-big-bash-league\">Stuart Broad signs for Hobart Hurricanes and targets England T20 recall</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Talk of a possible return has come at a time when Bell, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/21/ian-bell-warwickshire-captain-england\">took over the Warwickshire captaincy</a> at the start of this year, is weighing up new opportunities in the autumn of his playing career, with negotiations over a deal to play Twenty20 cricket for Perth Scorchers in Australia\u2019s Big Bash League understood to be taking place.</p> <p>Perth have one overseas place free in their squad after agreeing to re-sign the England and Yorkshire all-rounder David Willey over the weekend following his impressive first season in Australia last winter. It was a deal that Justin Langer, the Scorchers head coach, admitted bent the team\u2019s policy on foreign signings, given the all-rounder will be available for just the first half of their season because of England\u2019s post-Christmas one-day international series in India.</p> <p>Were Bell to earn an England recall he would likely miss Perth\u2019s opening fixture on 23 December, which comes only two days after the fifth Test against India in Chennai, but would then be available for the remainder of the campaign.

  "<p>Air conditioning was a luxury in Britain 40 years ago, but the long hot summer of 1976 changed that. The scorching heat that summer lasted two months and most people sweated it out indoors with only open windows and electric fans for ventilation.

  "<p>A federal court in Texas has blocked new US school rules for accommodating transgender students, setting up a legal battle with the White House that may soon head to the supreme court.<br></p> <p>As millions of American children prepared to return for the new academic year, <a href=\"http://www.txnd.uscourts.gov/judge/district-judge-reed-oconnor\">Reed O\u2019Connor</a>, a district judge in Forth Worth, issued <a href=\"https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/files/epress/Texas_et_al_v._U.S._et_al_-_Nationwide_PI_(08-21-16).pdf\">the nationwide injunction</a> late on Sunday night to prevent public schools from being forced to allow equal access to bathrooms and changing facilities. </p> <p>The case follows <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-departments-justice-and-education-release-joint-guidance-help-schools-ensure-civil-rights\">guidance issued in May</a> by the US justice and education departments which said transgender students were entitled to protection under sex discrimination laws and should be allowed access to \u201cactivities and sex-segregated facilities consistent with their gender identity\u201d.</p> <p>This rapidly escalating skirmish in American culture wars came after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/09/lgbt-bathroom-bill-north-carolina-justice-department\">Department of Justice sued North Carolina</a> for a state law that forced people to only use public bathrooms that correspond to the gender listed on their birth certificates.</p> <p>But now Judge O\u2019Connor has upheld a complaint brought by Texas and a dozen other mostly Republican states who argue the Obama administration overstepped its constitutional authority by forcing schools to allow the opposite.</p> <p>\u201cThis case presents the difficult issue of balancing the protection of students\u2019 rights and that of personal privacy when using school bathrooms, locker rooms, showers, and other intimate facilities, while ensuring that no student is unnecessarily marginalized while attending school,\u201d wrote the judge in his 38-page ruling.</p> <p>\u201cThe resolution of this difficult policy issue is not, however, the subject of this order. Instead, the constitution assigns these policy choices to the appropriate elected and appointed officials, who must follow the proper legal procedure.\u201d</p> <p>Equality campaigners reacted angrily to the latest decision, which they said would put vulnerable students at risk.</p> <p>\u201cJudge O\u2019Connor\u2019s decision to bar the Department of Justice from enforcing this important guidance puts thousands of transgender students at even greater risk of marginalization, harassment, and discrimination as they return to school this fall,\u201d said Human Rights Campaign (HRC) legal director Sarah Warbelow. \u201cAll students, regardless of their gender identity, deserve to be able to learn in an environment free from discrimination.\u201d</p> <p>The nationwide ruling does not prevent schools or states from allowing access, something both sides claimed was a silver lining.</p> <p>\u201cAs the separate facilities provision is permissive, states that authorise schools to define sex to include gender identity for purposes of providing separate restroom, locker room, showers, and other intimate facilities will not be impacted by it,\u201d said Judge O\u2019Connor.</p> <p>\u201cDespite this judge\u2019s decision, schools are not barred from following the federal guidance, and school administrators still have a responsibility to ensure that the civil rights of all students are respected and that transgender students have access to facilities consistent with their gender identity,\u201d responded the HRC. \u201cAs lawsuits on the scope of Title IX proceed, we believe that justice will prevail as courts continue to recognise that discrimination against transgender students is a form of sex discrimination.\u201d</p> <p>Assuming it is challenged and then held up by the Texas-based appeals court, the latest ruling \u2013 from a judge who also fought gay rights advances \u2013 is likely to mark the opening salvo in what will swiftly become a major test of the supreme court\u2019s approach to civil rights for transgender individuals.</p> <p>\u201cWe are pleased that the court ruled against the Obama administration\u2019s latest illegal federal overreach,\u201d <a href=\"https://texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/ruling-in-favor-of-school-and-state-rights-federal-court-stops-enforcement\">said Texas attorney general Ken Paxton</a>, who led the challenge by Alabama, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Tennessee, Arizona, Maine, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Utah, Georgia, Mississippi and Kentucky.</p> <p>\u201cThis president is attempting to rewrite the laws enacted by the elected representatives of the people, and is threatening to take away federal funding from schools to force them to conform,\u201d he added. \u201cThat cannot be allowed to continue, which is why we took action to protect states and school districts, who are charged under state law to establish a safe and disciplined environment conducive to student learning.\u201d</p> <p>The White House declined to join direct criticism of the judge\u2019s ruling. Press secretary Josh Earnest said: \u201cThe primary goal in offering this guidance was to ensure a safe educational environment for all students \u2026 It certainly was not a mandate. It was not described that way by the administration.</p> <p>\u201cIt was described that way by some of the administration\u2019s critics. I understand there are people eager to play politics with this just a few months before an election.\u201d</p> <p>Earnest added: \u201cOur goal has been from the beginning to provide for the safety, security and dignity of students all across the country \u2026 we certainly have confidence in the legality of the guidance.\u201d</p> <p>The White House also respected the rulings of federal judges, he said, and would allow the Department of Justice to determine the next step.</p> <p>The US supreme court, currently operating with a depleted bench of eight justices, recently temporarily blocked another similar rule in Virginia while it considers whether to take up the overall issue of transgender bathroom access in the coming term.</p>",

The road to recovery was challenging, undergoing numerous operations and learning how to walk again along the way.

All I did know was I was going to give it everything I possibly could. Behind the scenes they knew that I was never going to play again but I just seem to have this never, never give up attitude and I wanted to give it everything I possibly could to get back playing again. In the meantime, I was trying to organise an event to get Manchester United down for my testimonial.\u201d</p> <p>Sir Alex Ferguson sent down a young team including Ravel Morrison, Jesse Lingard and Joshua King to play at Huish Park. Way entered the field as a last-minute substitute to rapturous applause. \u201cIt was a big thing for me,\u201d says Way, who retired in 2010. \u201cIn my heart of hearts I knew I would do well to get back and I knew deep down inside my body was never going to allow me to get back.\u201d</p> <p>Ferguson\u2019s kindness was echoed by those at Yeovil, his former club Swansea City and friends within the game, notably Craig Bellamy, who he played with at Norwich City as a schoolboy. Bellamy sent Way, a boyhood Chelsea fan, a signed Gianfranco Zola shirt while in hospital. \u201cTo take a gift from him at that important time, it was a nice moment,\u201d Way says. \u201cIt was great to have that support. I\u2019ll never forget Martin Allen called me, Gary Johnson came to my bedside. The Yeovil team wore shirts that year with my name on it. Garry Monk came to visit. It was only recently I had come back to Yeovil from Swansea and the Swansea supporters were fantastic, too. I think they could see the pictures of the accident and how serious it was.\u201d</p> <p>Swansea\u2019s manager at the time of the accident was Roberto Mart\u00ednez, who Way considers a mentor and a good friend. It has proved a useful relationship, too, with Mart\u00ednez instrumental in allowing Shane Duffy and John Lundstram to join Yeovil on loan from Everton three years ago as well as Liam Walsh last season. Yeovil\u2019s reputation as a trusted stable for young players to develop has also ensured Ryan Mason, Steven Caulker and Andros Townsend have shone in Somerset over previous seasons.</p> <p>Mart\u00ednez was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/12/roberto-martinez-sacked-everton\">sacked by Everton in May</a> and there is a sense of frustration the two did not reunite last season after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/19/yeovil-carlisle-fa-cup-third-round-replay-match-report\">losing to Carlisle United on penalties in an FA Cup third-round replay</a> denied Yeovil a trip to Goodison Park in the next round. \u201cI wanted it desperately last year but it wasn\u2019t to be,\u201d Way says. \u201cI believe he\u2019s a fantastic manager and he gave me an insight into the change in English football, how he manages and how he coaches. I\u2019ll never forget when he took us to Barcelona and the next minute we\u2019re having conversations with Johan Cruyff. I was 28 at the time and you do not really understand when you\u2019re a young player: was it a trip? There were reasons why he did it.</p> <p>\u201cYou only have to look at how Swansea kicked on under him and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/03/roberto-martinez-appointed-belgium-manager-everton\">now he\u2019s with Belgium</a>. He\u2019s somebody I\u2019ve always looked up to and a very good manager in the way he deals with situations. I have no doubt in my mind he\u2019ll be a successful manager.

Financially, the club is run on fumes. On the day of this interview, Tuesday\u2019s opponents, Everton, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/15/yannick-bolasie-signs-everton-crystal-palace\">completed the signing of Yannick Bolasie</a> for about \u00a328m and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/09/manchester-city-complete-signing-of-john-stones-from-everton\">sold John Stones</a> for almost \u00a320m more. Most players arrive at Yeovil with a point to prove: the defender Bevis Mugabi signed this summer from Southampton, Otis Khan from Barnsley and Tom Eaves from Bolton Wanderers. For Yeovil, it was not unusual for the match-day squad to comprise only six substitutes from a possible seven last season.</p> <p>\u201cWe had one player the other day who\u2019s never even played extra time and that shows you perhaps the experience is not there,\u201d Way says. \u201cI\u2019ve said to the players: if you\u2019re unknown, you need to make sure you are known and by the end of the season you need to have a good CV.</p> <p>\u201cYou can outwork a team and that\u2019s one thing that money can\u2019t buy. I\u2019ve got to make sure the players relish the environment they\u2019re going to. They have to show no fear, enjoy the moment because they\u2019ve worked hard for this.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>If you walk along Britain\u2019s poorest streets, the phrase \u201cleft behind\u201d \u2013 in vogue again after many such places voted to leave the EU \u2013 takes on a complex meaning. It\u2019s not just that they are lagging behind the richer, better-connected places. It can seem, as you survey the pound stores and shuttered pubs, that these towns have been discarded: left behind, as in \u201cunwanted on the journey\u201d. Wealth has flowed out of them to somewhere else.</p> <p>The logical question should be: who did this? Sometimes it\u2019s obvious: in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/25/view-wales-town-showered-eu-cash-votes-leave-ebbw-vale\">Ebbw Vale</a>, for example, the answer is the Anglo-Dutch steel company Corus, which closed the plant in 2002. In many places it\u2019s not obvious. Jobs seep away; council services are privatised; bus timetables dwindle; the local school gets taken over by a \u201csuperhead\u201d from somewhere else, outsourcing the dinner ladies on day one. You can get angry about it, but there is nobody specific to be angry at.</p> <p>Faced with the same problem, union and community organisers in the US have, in the past 12 months, adopted a novel way of fighting back. Through a campaign group called <a href=\"http://hedgeclippers.org/hedgepapers-no-19-hedge-funds-attack-baltimore/\">Hedge Clippers,</a> they have begun tracing the lineages of financial power behind the decisions that affect specific places, and targeting those financiers \u2013 pension funds \u2013 with a new kind of pressure.</p> <p>Steve Lerner, one of the instigators of the 1980s <a href=\"https://talkpoverty.org/2015/06/16/justice-for-janitors/\">Justice for Janitors</a> campaign, which, for the first time, organised migrant cleaning workers in the US, explains how the tactic evolved. \u201cWe were organising janitors working for contract cleaning companies: but they\u2019re just middlemen,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we targeted the building owners. It turned out they, too, were dependent on banks and pension companies, so we got a trillion dollars worth of pension money to say it won\u2019t invest unless there is decent pay. Then we asked ourselves: OK, what else do they own?\u201d</p> <p>It turns out, quite a lot. In Baltimore, the city\u2019s privatised water industry hiked its bills. Then, when people started to fall behind in payments, the city agreed to bundle up their unpaid bills into a financial vehicle called a \u201ctax lien\u201d and sell it to investors. The investors can, after two years, evict people from their homes for non-payment.</p> <p>When campaigners looked at who was buying up the debt, they included an anonymous company linked to one of the biggest hedge funds in <a href=\"http://www.fortress.com/OurBusinesses/AlternativeAssetManagement/PrivateEquity/Default.aspx\">America: Fortress Investments</a>, with $23bn worth of assets invested in \u201cthe largest pension funds, university endowments and foundations\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/27/wales-referendum-remain-leave-vote-uk-eu-membership\">Why did Wales shoot itself in the foot in this referendum? | Richard Wyn Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since the 2008 crisis, with returns on government bonds negative, and stock market dividends depressed, pension funds have been pouring money into the hedge fund sector. \u201cIt\u2019s a form of assisted suicide,\u201d Lerner argues: \u201cWorkers are investing their pension money into firms whose mission is to destroy us.\u201d</p> <p>He set up Hedge Clippers, which aims to force pension funds to divest from companies whose investment strategies fuel the cycle of impoverishment.</p> <p>If you apply the same approach to Britain, you\u2019re dealing with a different ecosystem. No city has yet securitised the unpaid debts of the poor, as Baltimore did. While there is no shortage of predatory lenders to the poor, there are \u2013 after a campaign led by Labour MP Stella Creasy \u2013 at least elementary controls on them.</p> <p>However, pension funds are now the biggest source of money for UK hedge funds, according to a Financial Conduct Authority survey last year, with 43% of their money coming from institutional investors. The most obvious act of financial predation is the private finance initiative (PFI), where schools and hospitals were built with vastly lucrative private loans. As a result, the taxpayer is committed to <a href=\"https://scmdirect.com/sites/default/files/Hedge%20Fund%20Research%20Report%20-%20SCM%20Direct,%2017%20May%202016.pdf\">paying back \u00a3232bn on assets worth \u00a357bn</a>.</p> <p>Many pension funds, either directly or indirectly, are investing in the so-called \u201cinfrastructure funds\u201d who buy up PFI debt. The investment analyst <a href=\"https://www.preqin.com/docs/reports/Preqin-Infrastructure-PPP-PFI-July-2016.pdf\">Preqin</a> found 588 institutional investors worldwide with \u201ca preference for funds targeting PFI\u201d, 40% of which were based in Europe.</p> <p>Tracing the more complex ways institutional finance is funding the cycle of impoverishment is not easy. What you would want to know, in places such as Stoke-on-Trent or Newport, is not just who took the decisions to close high-value workplaces but, more importantly, who makes the decisions that lead to chronic under-investment now. Governments, including the devolved ones of the UK, spend a lot of time and money effectively bribing global companies to create jobs and keep them in Britain\u2019s depressed areas. Communities themselves have little or no input into the process, which is in any case all carrot and no stick.</p> <p>Lerner\u2019s initiative in the US grew out of trade union activism, because the unions there learned to follow the money instead of wasting time trying to negotiate with the powerless underlings of global finance. They worked out that, in an age where the workplace and the community can seem like two different spheres of activism, it is the finance system that links the two.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/left-behind-eu-referendum-vote-ukip-revolt-brexit\">Older \u2018left-behind\u2019 voters turned against a political class with values opposed to theirs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Union organising of the unorganised, and community activism in Britain have both traditionally been weak because top-down Labourism has been strong.

  "<p>Since its inception, Airbnb \u2013 the website that allows people to rent out their homes for holiday accommodation \u2013 has been a contentious issue in cities. It\u2019s a cost-saving convenience for travellers and a money-making opportunity for homeowners, yet a source of ire to scores of traditional hotels and guest-houses. </p> <p>Some have accused the global home-sharing initiative \u2013 which operates in 34,000 cities \u2013 of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/22/airbnb-san-francisco-wanted-posters-chinatown\">playing a part in gentrifying neighbourhoods</a>, as more Airbnb listed properties means fewer available homes to live in, thus pushing up prices. Mark Tanzer, chief executive of the Association of British Travel Agents, has also criticised Airbnb\u2019s contribution to growing tourism numbers as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/25/from-berlin-to-barcelona-will-airbnb-ruin-our-most-loved-cities\">a threat to historic cities</a> around the world.

Earlier this August the multi-billion-dollar company launched a brand new initiative called <a href=\"http://samara.airbnb.com/\">Samara</a>. It claims it is an innovation and design studio that \u201cgenerates new ideas and building products that serve the Airbnb community\u201d and \u201cexplores new attitudes to sharing and trust\u201d. So far, so vague. Samara will apparently focus on architecture, product design, software engineering, and new economic models \u2013 but the design studio has started with a house for a Japanese village.</p> <p>The Yoshino Cedar House, created in collaboration with Tokyo-based architect Go Hasegawa, explores \u201chow architectural features can engender a deeper relationship between hosts and guests.\u201d The house \u2013 made of cedar wood with a living room, kitchen, dining room and bedrooms \u2013 will be permanently installed in Yoshino, a rural town in the Nara district of Japan, where it will be a bookable Airbnb that is maintained collectively by the community. The house is currently installed at the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://house-vision.jp/en/exhibition.html\">House Vision exhibition</a> in Tokyo until the end of August.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b1653f3eb4854dec5dc6597ba387efe63a35fb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b1653f3eb4854dec5dc6597ba387efe63a35fb7/0_425_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yoshino Cedar House\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The communal dining space inside the Yoshino Cedar House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Airbnb/Edward Caruso</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Samara says the rental income from stays at the house will be used to \u201cstrengthen the cultural legacy and future of the town\u201d, which has struggled as young people move away to cities \u2013 an issue that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/20/japan-towns-face-extinction\">has affected many of Japan\u2019s rural communities</a> as the country\u2019s population ages, shrinks and urbanises.

Apparently, her neighbours thought no one would visit \u2013 but many did. The tourist influx resulted in the woman enlisting her neighbours as hiking guides, translators, and tour guides for the guests. The venture ultimately boosted the local tourism economy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/27/oldest-residents-elderly-ageing\">Which cities have the oldest residents?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Yoshino building hopes to be both a community centre and a form of communal housing: aside from the bedrooms, all rooms in the house are designed to be shared by visitors and community members. The idea is that local residents act as tour guides for the Airbnb guests. \u201cIt\u2019s a pathway to get the community to help each other, and it happens to be in the form of architecture,\u201d explained Joe Gebbia, Airbnb\u2019s co-founder and chief product officer, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/home/airbnb-urban-planning-samara/#ixzz4HbBVp5a8\">in Digital Trends</a>.

Essentially, it seems Airbnb would build its own listings. \u201cGiven the size and scale of the Airbnb community, the areas to explore are limitless,\u201d says Gebbia. So could they include cities?</p> <p>Many websites reporting on Samara \u2013 from <a href=\"http://www.fastcodesign.com/3062246/an-exclusive-look-at-airbnbs-first-foray-into-urban-planning\">Fast Co</a> to <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2016/08/04/airbnb-samara-design-hotels/#FMEGoKPRHPq7\">Mashable</a> \u2013 have announced that Airbnb is branching out into urban planning. As it stands though, Samara\u2019s work is firmly targeting a rural context. Over email, a representative from Samara says they \u201caren\u2019t contemplating\u201d an urban version of the Yoshino Cedar House right now, but as a studio they are focusing on how people will live in communities in the future. \u201cUrban planning is one of the many concepts we will think about, but it isn\u2019t the only one and calling Samara an urban planning outpost misses the mark.\u201d</p> <p>Other experts seem to agree, judging by their reactions to the stories being circulated. \u201cIt\u2019s a stretch to call this urban planning or urban development,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emilymbadger/status/765598474062536704\">tweeted</a> The Washington Post\u2019s Emily Badger; \u201cIt\u2019s just not urbanism,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LangeAlexandra/status/765601464190377985\">agreed</a> architecture critic Alexandra Lange. If the model scales, it will be interesting to see whether rural communities will come across the same issues for local residents presented by Airbnb in cities. This new approach demonstrated in the Yoshino house, however, seems to answer critics by ensuring the process directly benefits the local community (in theory, at least).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/video/2016/jun/14/new-yorkers-who-live-exclusively-via-airbnb-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4yxfz\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2540265\"            data-video-name=\"The New Yorkers who live exclusively via Airbnb \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-575edff5e4b0aa348f1cc3a1\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/06/13/160613VeniceNYC_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/06/13/160613VeniceNYC_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/06/13/160613VeniceNYC.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/06/13/160613VeniceNYC_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/06/13/160613VeniceNYC_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/video/2016/jun/14/new-yorkers-who-live-exclusively-via-airbnb-video\">The New Yorkers who live exclusively via Airbnb: \u2018Home is where the Wi-Fi is\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Translated to a city level, the concept would surely require self-contained neighbourhoods in order to work properly: who exactly would look after the houses, who would benefit, and how would the local boundaries be drawn? The notion of a community centre doubling as communal housing with rentable rooms, however, seems potentially promising as a new co-living model in cities.</p> <p>Perhaps Samara\u2019s remit is vague because Airbnb wants to be able to test out as much as possible under its umbrella. If the last few years have proved anything it\u2019s that we shouldn\u2019t underestimate the impact Airbnb can have on our cities, culturally and economically \u2013 whether that\u2019s positive or negative for local residents.

  "<p>Since its debut 16 years ago, Deus Ex\u2019s primary weapon has been choice: where to go, how to get there, who to speak to and how to speak to them are all up to you in a series where almost every scenario has multiple outcomes. After releasing 2011\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/aug/22/deus-ex-human-revolution-review\">Human Revolution</a> \u2013 a lavishly depicted near-future thriller \u2013 to widespread critical acclaim, developer Eidos Montreal\u2019s follow up, Mankind Divided, picks up the exact same threads that its predecessor left tantalisingly unanswered five years ago.</p> <p>This is a tall order and its makers clearly recognise it, front-ending the game\u2019s campaign with an almost laughably long 12-minute recap to bring you up to speed on everything Deus Ex. Protagonist Adam Jensen returns \u2013 still half-Lagerfeld, half-Motorola Razr \u2013 working as a special agent at Interpol two years after the events of Human Revolution. Like many, he\u2019s coming to terms with the devastating aftereffects of The Incident \u2013 a cyber-attack that deliberately caused the bio-technologically \u201caugmented\u201d population to turn violent against their will, leaving millions dead. It was a global catalyst, accelerating the divisions between the human and augmented populations, but as thematically charged a setup as this is, Adam and his world can\u2019t help but feel outdated.<br></p> <p>Mankind Divided is undeniably beautiful, soaked in the neon golds and vibrant lights that made its predecessor such a striking spectacle, but its weak opening results in a slow start that never quite gains the momentum it needs. When it does finally get going, some shoddy voice work and awful facial animations make for a game that fails to convey the societal and racial messages that its strong writing attempts to.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"612d6036bb27e74db140f35fd2a1c401ffef4a3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/612d6036bb27e74db140f35fd2a1c401ffef4a3e/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u200bDeus Ex: Mankind Divided\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">After a pre-credits mission in Dubai sets up the game\u2019s central conspiracy, you relocate to Prague.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Worse yet, it offers very few notable opinions on its focal prejudices, and the best it seems to do to force home its messaging is interrupt you with annoying documentation checks between metro stations. There\u2019s racist graffiti on the walls, slurs get shouted as you walk through the streets, but the overall result is a social commentary that feels, at best, lacking conviction.</p> <p>After a pre-credits mission in Dubai sets up the game\u2019s central conspiracy, you relocate to Prague; a rich, multifaceted hub full of apartment blocks, a bank, abandoned theatre and underground anti-terrorism facility. Prague never imposes the same visual impact as Human Revolution\u2019s depiction of Hengsha or Detroit, but it is explored and revisited several times in different visual states over the game\u2019s 20-25 hours, and it\u2019s a veritable playground of stuff to do. Between the various metro stations that transport you to each corner of the capital, you\u2019ll find multiple side quests that are multi-part branching path adventures in themselves. There\u2019s a bank break-in to dig up dodgy info on one of the game\u2019s main mega-corps, and an investigation into an underground cult \u2013 finding every possible side story is a completionist dream, and the game makes pursuing these optional plots worthwhile with some great moments that rival the main story.</p> <p>There are a couple of mainline departures from the Czech capital; an infiltration into Golem City \u2013 a cramped, higgledy-piggledy ghetto for the augmented that is by far the game\u2019s most interesting setting \u2013 as well as a recon mission to a facility in the Swiss Alps and a rescue mission in London. Despite these four locations, each far larger than anything in any Deus Ex previously, Mankind Divided doesn\u2019t feel half the grandiose globe-trotter that Human Revolution was. In some ways, this works in the game\u2019s favour, grounding itself to focus its story. In others, it results in a game that\u2019s half-baked, especially after proceedings aren\u2019t so much cut short as they are forcefully cauterised, resulting in the most telegraphed setup for a sequel since 2004\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2004/nov/10/halo2biggest\">Halo 2</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e374345300c7f1659535d2ad694fffe15128704\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e374345300c7f1659535d2ad694fffe15128704/116_0_1688_1013/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u200bDeus Ex: Mankind Divided\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Despite an improved control scheme, combat is still the least enjoyable way to play.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But, despite its terrible non-ending and the uninspiring boss fight that triggers it, the game still frequently finds immense strength in its moment-to-moment play. Mankind Divided retains the series\u2019 mechanical tri-force of stealth, hacking and combat, but it does a much better job of blending these different styles \u2013 even if you want to play stealthily, for example, you\u2019ll benefit from investing upgrade points into combat and hacking abilities to benefit from different routes that these styles allow.</p> <p>After setting up a narrative hard-reset of Adam\u2019s abilities, the resulting blank slate lets you experiment with the huge variety of augments and weapons. There\u2019s an invisibility cloak, smart vision for seeing through walls, a set of rebreather lungs for gas immunity, a social enhancer to open up more conversational options at certain points in the game, and lethal and non-lethal weapons aplenty. There are also new \u201coverclock\u201d augments, too, which Jensen uncovers when he undergoes surgery at the beginning of the game, including a gauss wrist attachment that sends enemies flying, a long-range taser, and a remote hacking tool that\u2019s incredibly useful when you\u2019re in a sticky spot. Coupled with your existing playthings, these eight over-clocked augments elevate Mankind Divided\u2019s depth beyond the strong foundations that Human Revolution laid out.</p> <p>This leads to a more fluid role-playing experience, but one which suffers from many of the same pitfalls as its predecessor. Despite an improved control scheme, combat is still the least enjoyable way to play, and shooting just isn\u2019t as satisfying as it needs to be to become your primary choice. Similarly, hacking is still really empowering, allowing you to turn the tide by sabotaging turrets, controlling cameras remotely and manipulating walker robots to turn on your enemies, but the mini-game with which you hack terminals and computers isn\u2019t fun enough to justify how often you\u2019ll be doing it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a38f7283342592364bf9ab1bc6e1f1d9723fb804\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a38f7283342592364bf9ab1bc6e1f1d9723fb804/248_0_3600_2160/1000.png\" alt=\"Deus Ex: Mankind Divided\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The multitude of options at almost every other stage of the game apart from the ending is impressive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Regardless of this, the open-ended nature of almost all missions means that you\u2019re rarely punished for whichever way you want to play \u2013 you will find that in moments where you have to hack something, for example, it won\u2019t require any upgrades to get past cybersecurity \u2013 and this makes for a game that begs to be played, manipulated and re-explored on several occasions, even despite its uneven core mechanics (something that the game\u2019s New Game Plus encourages, too). It\u2019s a disappointment that the game\u2019s biggest moments don\u2019t seem to have the multitude of outcomes that some of its smaller missions do; its grand finale seems to be the same no matter what your endgame decisions might be, but the multitude of options at almost every other stage of the game is impressive.</p> <p>As a completely separate component from the main story, Breach mode adds time-trial style challenges. It\u2019s by no means a worthy replacement of, you know, the end of the story, but Breach has some cool ideas, online leaderboards and exclusive augmentations that aren\u2019t featured in the main game.</p> <p>It\u2019s a shame that in a world obsessed with the conflict between man and machine, Mankind Divided\u2019s characters feel more robot than human. Hopefully, Eidos Montreal has strong post-release support planned to fill in the absent third act. Regardless of this, the game\u2019s broad level of creative opportunities, memorable infiltrations and beautiful attention to detail in such a visually interesting world make for a game that\u2019s fun to experiment with again and again, despite its structural cracks.</p> <p><strong>PS4, Xbox One and PC; Pegi 18.

  "<p>It is two months since British voters surprised themselves by deciding to end the UK\u2019s 43-year relationship with the European Union \u2013 \u201cindependence day\u201d to some and \u201cthe worst political decision since 1945\u201d to others. </p> <p>As stunned political leaderships on both sides of the Channel continue dithering about what to do next, it is worth looking back at the origins of a crisis the EU elite had not expected.</p> <p>1) It may have started with Harold Macmillan\u2019s father taking the future prime minister to watch Queen Victoria\u2019s diamond jubilee parade in 1897. Aged just three, Macmillan was very impressed by its splendour, but years later he would tell audiences that the pomp and power had been \u201call an illusion\u201d. Two world wars (Macmillan was wounded in both) and the Great Depression put paid to it. The answer was a Europe that replaced old enmities with cooperation, he decided. But in 1955 Anthony Eden was PM and clung to old illusions. His government sent no minister \u2013 only a middling trade official named Russell Bretherton \u2013 to the summit in Messina, Italy, that led to the 1957 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Rome\">Treaty of Rome</a>. Britain missed the boat. The French president, Charles de Gaulle, regarded Britain as an American Trojan horse and vetoed Macmillan\u2019s first bid to join in 1963 and Harold Wilson\u2019s in 1967.</p> <p>2) After De Gaulle\u2019s retirement, Ted Heath achieved entry for Britain on 1 January 1973, splitting both the Labour and Tory parties in the process. Key policies such as fishing and farming had not been designed to meet UK needs, and some people were worried about pooling aspects of sovereignty with the \u201cCommon Market\u201d six. They were now nine, as Ireland and Denmark joined too, but Norwegians voted against membership. Heath was a hopeless salesman. When he lost power in 1974, Labour\u2019s Wilson embraced Tony Benn\u2019s idea of a referendum to legitimise British membership. With most of Fleet Street and the new Tory leader, Margaret Thatcher, on his side, Wilson won heavily by a margin of two to one against a coalition of rightwing Tories, Bennites and much of the Labour movement. Union leaders saw the economically booming Europe as a capitalist plot.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p> 3) The Common Market evolved into the European Economic Community (EEC) and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union#Enlargement\">membership expanded</a>, taking in former dictatorships Spain, Greece and Portugal in the 1980s, neutrals and ex-Soviet bloc countries after the end of the cold war. It would be 28 in all when Croatia joined in 2013. To keep growing, Europe needed to reduce tariff barriers and in 1986 signed the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_European_Act\">Single European Act</a> (SEA), which committed members to free movement of goods, capital, services and people in a \u201csingle market\u201d by 1992. Acknowledging emerging fears of a \u201cdemocratic deficit\u201d, the SEA also gave the elected European parliament greater powers. But it also replaced national vetoes with qualified majority voting on many decisions in the EEC\u2019s council of ministers. Denmark\u2019s parliament rejected the SEA, but it was endorsed by a referendum, as it was in Ireland. An opponent of referendums, Thatcher did not hold a British referendum and only later regretted that she had been deceived by the \u201cfederalist conveyor belt\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dcadfb6850f40cd0ceb32b49413293fa31fdbfb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dcadfb6850f40cd0ceb32b49413293fa31fdbfb/387_132_1624_974/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Thatcher\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Thatcher made her Bruges speech in 1988 opposing economic and political union</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ANL/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>4) The next signpost on the road to what EU integrationists hoped would be \u201cever closer union\u201d was to set up a single currency. By now Thatcher was vocally against such a move and in 1988 made her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1988/sep/21/emu.theeuro\">Bruges speech</a> opposing economic and political union, but backing cooperation between nation states. (It was not meant as a Brexit speech, aides would stress in 2016). Meanwhile Labour\u2019s modernisers, led by Neil Kinnock, had reversed the party\u2019s opposition to EU membership. They had been wooed by the vision of a high-wage workers\u2019 Europe promoted by Jacques Delors, the visionary French socialist who was president of the powerful Brussels bureaucracy, the European commission. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 opened up the prospect of German reunification, the French insisted on a currency union to tie an ever more dominant Germany to the EU project. Britain wanted the project to be \u201cbroader, not deeper\u201d by expanding eastwards. Both policies were implemented; both would later have fateful consequences.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>5) As Thatcher\u2019s power weakened she quarrelled with key allies such as Geoffrey Howe and Nigel Lawson over Europe. But her new chancellor, John Major, persuaded her to link sterling to the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) at what some feared was too high a rate for British industry. When Thatcher fell, Major took over and negotiated British opt-outs from the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maastricht_Treaty\">Maastricht treaty</a> (1992), which reorganised the EU and set timetables and rules for a single currency zone and for the no-passport Schengen zone. As part of Major\u2019s \u201cvariable geometry\u201d strategy for a two-speed Europe, Britain was also allowed not to join the \u201csocial chapter\u201d covering workers\u2019 rights. Denmark needed two referendums before signing; France\u2019s was only narrowly carried. Major won the 1992 election, but opposition to Europe crystallised at this time into demands for an in/out referendum on UK membership. The sterling crisis of September 1992 forced Britain out of the ERM. The economy recovered, but not Major\u2019s reputation. What became Ukip was founded and Major\u2019s government was hobbled by backbench \u201cEurosceptic\u201d rebellions, billionaire Jimmy Goldsmith\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum_Party\">Referendum party</a> and Thatcher\u2019s criticisms. BSE (\u201cmad cow disease\u201d) turned into an ugly beef war with Europe.</p> <p>6) Major\u2019s EU problems helped Tony Blair pile up a 179-seat majority in 1997 as the most pro-European PM since Heath. Labour talked a positive game on Europe, but Fleet Street had moved against it in line with rightwing public opinion, and Blair never dared expend much political capital making the positive case for Europe. Instead his turf war with Gordon Brown ensured that the chancellor imposed a near-impossible \u201cfive tests\u201d of the British national interest before he would consent to sterling joining the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro\">euro</a>, whose coins and notes were launched in 2002. Labour joined the \u201csocial chapter\u201d that Major had blocked, but fell out with most of its EU partners over UK support for the US-led invasion of Iraq. The French were denounced as \u201ccheese-eating surrender monkeys\u201d.</p> <p>7) Serious strategic mistakes were then made on both sides of the Channel. Labour decided not to impose transitional restrictions on the free movement of workers when mostly former Soviet bloc states known as the A10 joined the EU on 1 May 2004, unaware that France and Germany would do so. Instead of the estimated 13,000 annual arrivals expected, mostly from Poland, more than a million came in the years that followed. It allowed Ukip to capitalise on fears of wage competition, pressure on social services and cultural resentment in many areas, pushing the Tories to the right. Labour failed to respond to fears shared by many of its supporters. Tony Blair promised a referendum on the EU \u201cconstitution\u201d but ducked it when French and Dutch voters said no. Resentment grew when a version of the constitution became the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Lisbon\">Lisbon treaty</a> (2009).<br></p> <p>8) When the global banking crisis began in mid-2007, initially in France and Britain, it was blamed by many in Brussels on irresponsible \u201cAnglo-Saxon\u201d speculative banking. But US and British central bankers proved much more nimble in restructuring and bailing out troubled banks than the EU did at both national and eurozone level. At Germany\u2019s insistence, a tough line was taken against eurozone states, notably Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal \u2013 \u201cperipheral\u201d economies that had borrowed heavily on the new currency\u2019s credibility to launch unsustainable booms. The subsequent austerity regime crippled Greece and killed growth elsewhere. Free to devalue and with flexible labour laws, Britain was able to navigate the crisis more adroitly. Badly hit by the rising economic power of Asia, the eurozone looked less like an engine of growth than one of stagnation, and some of its banks a submerged problem that leaders tried to ignore.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d038a7941534fef2018f6dfffc70b1a4fd9f915\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d038a7941534fef2018f6dfffc70b1a4fd9f915/0_228_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Cameron\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron hoped he could sell the economic case for continued EU membership.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>9) David Cameron had won the Tory leadership in 2005 by outflanking his main rival, David Davis, over Europe, promising to quit the main conservative group of MEPs. After becoming prime minister in 2010 he talked tough, but Eurosceptic colleagues never trusted him and used his appeasement tactics to demand more. Despite investing less effort and manpower at the Brussels negotiating table, Britain was winning key battles, its language had now replaced French, its approach to law and free trade gained ground and it was outside the floundering eurozone and Schengen\u2019s border free-for-all. It was already half out. But that was not enough for critics. Ahead of the 2015 election Cameron promised an in/out referendum after a \u201crenegotiation\u201d (the tactic Wilson had used in 1975), probably expecting Nick Clegg to veto it again in a renewed coalition. Instead he won an outright majority and decided to resolve the issue early, in 2016 rather than 2017.<br></p> <p>10) Cameron\u2019s elevation of party management tactics over strategy was rapidly compounded by a perfect storm for what became known as the Brexit campaign. Tory promises to reduce net immigration from about 300,000 to below 100,000 repeatedly failed, weaponising the \u201cTake Back Control\u201d slogan. Middle East wars (in which British action and inaction made things worse) compounded the economic and asylum migration flow. The spread of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism into Europe added fresh fears to the mix. The eurozone was easily portrayed as a basket case in which failed EU policies were stirring up the very extremism the union had been devised to prevent. Yet the cross-party remain camp\u2019s lacklustre campaign clung to the economic case for membership, revealing an arrogant metropolitan disdain for voters\u2019 fears on immigration in less prosperous regions. </p> <p>Cameron thought he could keep the wavering Boris Johnson onside. Instead the London mayor became leave\u2019s biggest campaign draw, willing to deploy some of its most unscrupulous claims about migration (\u201cTurkey is joining the EU\u201d) and budget savings (\u201c\u00a3350m a week for the NHS\u201d). Cameron had also banked on strong Labour backing. But the official opposition had elected Jeremy Corbyn, a lifelong anti-European, as its leader. He declared for Europe, but millions barely noticed his feeble contribution. Nor did they believe remain\u2019s warnings of the dangers of a leave vote, some too crude to impress anyone, some from foreign VIPs like Barack Obama. In the brave new world of Brexit, Michael Gove spoke for the 52% to 48% majority on 23 June when he said: \u201cI think people in this country have had enough of experts.\u201d<br></p> <p>It wasn\u2019t quite the outcome Macmillan had in mind when he denounced imperial illusions and sought refuge in Europe.

To which <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/donald-trump-nuclear-weapons\">Trump replied</a>: \u201cThen why are we making them? Why do we make them?\u201d</p> <p>This sort of stuff has been too much, for some Republicans. One of them is John Noonan, who worked for many years as a Minuteman III nuclear launch officer under the Wyoming tundra, hoping never to receive a particularly urgent call from presidents Bush or Obama. He is not voting for Trump because he thinks the Republican is too irrational and doesn\u2019t understand nuclear deterrence strategy that, in his view, has spared the world from destruction since 1945. \u201cThe very point of nuclear weapons is that they are never used,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-noonan-trump-nuclear-20160809-snap-story.html\">wrote Noonan in the LA Times earlier this month</a>. \u201cWe have them to dissuade hostile powers from attacking us, and vice versa.</p> <p>\u201cI sat at my post believing, through both the Bush and Obama administrations, that the president was fundamentally rational and would never ask me to do my terrible duty. Not unless the country was in the direst of national emergencies. With Trump as president, the young men and women who are assigned to our nuclear forces will have no such assurances.\u201d</p> <p>To be fair, maybe Trump does understand something of the mind-boggling, games-theory-based logic underpinning deterrence strategy. He was <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/9-terrifying-things-donald-trump-has-publicly-said-about-nuclear-weapons-99f6290bc32a#.7d54x6q0i\">asked on CBS in March</a> when should the US use nuclear weapons. \u201cWell, it is an absolute last stance. And, you know, I use the word unpredictable. You want to be unpredictable.\u201d The corollary? If you\u2019re too predictable, then the enemy can get the nuclear jump on you.</p> <p>In another interview, Trump was asked if he would nuke Europe. \u201cEurope is a big place,\u201d he replied airily. \u201cI\u2019m not going to take cards off the table.\u201d</p> <p>What Clinton must have known better than most when she made her San Diego speech is that Donald Trump will never get his fingers on the nuclear button. Not because the polls suggest she will trounce him in November, but rather because it is merely a figure of speech. In a 1980s Spitting Image sketch, Ronald Reagan had two buttons at his bedside. One was labelled \u201cnurse\u201d, the other \u2013 inadvertently pressed \u2013 labelled \u201cnukes\u201d.

In any case, Reagan\u2019s Soviet counterpart, Mikhail Gorbachev, was also accompanied during the visit by a military aide holding a very similar bag, known in Russian as the chemodanchik, or \u201clittle briefcase.\u201d</p> <p>Over the years there have been several nuclear footballs, all manufactured for the White House by <a href=\"http://zerohalliburton.com/#\">Zero Halliburton</a>, the Utah firm that also supplied aluminium briefcases <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120314205312/http://www.zerohalliburton.com/index.php?dispatch=pages.view&amp;page_id=17\">for movies</a> like Men in Black II, Air Force One and perhaps less reassuringly, Dude, Where\u2019s My Car? and Spy Kids. Today, visitors to the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History in Washington can see a retired nuclear football and, if so minded, salute its gallant contribution to global security.</p> <p>The nuclear football came into active service after the 1962 Cuban missile crisis when President Kennedy worried how the Pentagon and nuclear launch officers would be sure that it was really the president ordering a strike. Declassified documents <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2pEQpx8CB7oC&amp;pg=PA294&amp;lpg=PA294&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CWhat+would+I+say+to+the+Joint+War+Room+to+launch+an+immediate+nuclear+strike?%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jfksuHVMEc&amp;sig=PBJ_MNOo84HEPyBBVN1PAw1C-pA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbuaP8lrfOAhXIShQKHXF1CNQQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CWhat%20would%20I%20say%20to%20the%20Joint%20War%20Room%20to%20launch%20an%20immediate%20nuclear%20strike%3F%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false\">reveal his concerns</a>: \u201cWhat would I say to the Joint War Room to launch an immediate nuclear strike?\u201d Kennedy asked. \u201cHow would the person who received my instructions verify them?\u201d</p> <p>Now, long after the end of the cold war, the man bag still shadows the president on his or her travels. There are in fact three nuclear footballs \u2013 one kept near the president when they leave the White House, another for the vice-president and a third kept in storage in the White House. The nuclear football is not handcuffed to aides, as some have claimed, but has a leather cinch strap <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/138042614/\">that can be looped around the wrist</a>.</p> <p>Why is the briefcase nicknamed the nuclear football? According to former US secretary of defence Robert McNamara, it was so-named because it was part of an early nuclear war plan code-named Operation Drop Kick.</p> <p>In Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 1964 nuclear black comedy Dr Strangelove, there is also an Operation Drop Kick. It denoted a nuclear exercise that goes wrong when the unhinged US general played by Sterling Hayden orders a first strike on the Soviet Union. All the president\u2019s men strive to recall the bombers to prevent nuclear politics. As you know (spoiler alert!), they fail and the film concludes with Major TJ \u201cKing\u201d Kong played by Slim Pickens, dropping from Russian skies astride a nuclear weapon.</p> <p>In reality, happily, Operation Drop Kick hasn\u2019t resulted in nuclear catastrophe. That said, there have been nuclear-football fumbles. Peter Metzger, a former marine who was one of five military aides charged with carrying the nuclear football for Reagan, recently recalled that once a colleague steered him into a different lift from the president and tricked him into thinking he had missed the motorcade. Metzger said his heart was racing \u201clike a gerbil in a cage\u201d until he realised his colleague was playing a practical joke.</p> <p>Metzger said that carrying the nuclear football is a worrisome responsibility. \u201cThe result of a decision the president would make is so grotesquely horrible \u2013 it would change the face of the earth, it would change humanity, it would change mankind,\u201d <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/06/politics/nuclear-football-president-button/\">he said</a>. \u201cI guess when you\u2019re on duty, you try not to think of the import of that. But you are fully prepared to do so if you have to.\u201d</p> <p>Robert Patterson, who carried the football for Clinton, said: \u201cYou\u2019re always kind of on edge. I opened it up constantly just to refresh myself, to always be aware of what was in it, all the potential decisions the president could possibly make.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, one of the nuclear football\u2019s trusty carriers, ex-marine John Kline, even used footage of the bag in a TV ad to help his campaign for re-election to Congress. \u201cIn this briefcase lies the fate of the world,\u201d <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-05-05-nuclear-football_x.htm\">went the voiceover</a>. \u201cIt contains top-secret codes to launch a nuclear strike. Two presidents \u2013 one from each party \u2013 trusted a young marine named John Kline to safeguard it.\u201d It\u2019s not clear how key that ad was to his successful campaign, but it probably didn\u2019t hurt.</p> <p>Aides who carry the nuclear football have extensive psychological evaluations to assess whether they\u2019re up to the task. Metzger discloses that he underwent extensive vetting by the Defense Department, the secret service and the FBI before he was given the job. The incoming president, whether it is Trump or Clinton, will undergo no such checks as to their mental stability. There is, though, one consoling thought. Even if Trump did nuke Europe, he\u2019d probably spare part of Aberdeenshire \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t want to destroy his golf resort.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 23 August 2016. An earlier version said that George C Scott played the unhinged US general who ordered an attack on the Soviet Union in the film Dr Strangelove. The general, Brig. General Jack D. Ripper, was played by Sterling Hayden.</p>",
  "<p>After a century of shooing away hunters, tending to trails and helping visitors enjoy the wonder of the natural world, the guardians of America\u2019s most treasured places have been handed an almost unimaginable new job \u2013 slowing the all-out assault climate change is waging against national parks across the nation.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/index.htm\">National Parks Service</a> (NPS) has charted the loss of glaciers, sea level rise and increase in wildfires spurred by rising temperatures in recent years, the scale of the threat to US heritage across the 412 national parks and monuments has become starkly apparent.</p> <p>As the National Parks Service turns 100 this week, their efforts to chart and stem the threat to the country\u2019s history faces a daunting task. America\u2019s grand symbols and painstakingly preserved archaeological sites are at risk of being winnowed away by the crashing waves, wildfires and erosion triggered by warming temperatures. </p> <p>The Statue of Liberty is at \u201c<a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/883/\">high exposure</a>\u201d risk from increasingly punishing storms. A national monument dedicated to abolitionist Harriet Tubman, who will be enshrined on a new $20 note, <a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/global_warming/National-Landmarks-at-Risk-Full-Report.pdf\">could be eaten away by rising tides</a> in Maryland. The land once walked by Pocahontas and Captain John Smith in Jamestown, the first English settlement in the US, is surrounded by waters rising at twice the global average and <a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/global_warming/National-Landmarks-at-Risk-Full-Report.pdf\">may be beyond rescue</a>. </p> <p>These threats are the latest in a pile of identified calamities to befall national parks and monuments due to climate change. Receding ice, extreme heat and acidifying oceans are morphing America\u2019s landscapes and coasts at a faster pace than at any time in human history.<br> </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/19/governors-island-remodelled-climate-change-new-york\">New York's remodelled Governors Island has built-in climate change defense</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYosemite\u2019s famous glacier, once a mile wide, is almost gone,\u201d fretted Barack Obama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/18/yosemite-obama-national-parks-climate-change\">during a visit to the vast park in June</a>. </p> <p>\u201cRising temperatures could mean no more glaciers in Glacier national park, no more Joshua trees in Joshua Tree national park. </p> <p>\u201cRising seas can destroy vital ecosystems in the Everglades and at some point could even threaten icons like the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. That\u2019s not the America I want to pass on to the next generation.\u201d</p> <p>Change, however, is inevitable no matter how quickly greenhouse gas emissions are cut. An NPS <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0101302\">study from 2014</a> found four in five of America\u2019s national parks are now at the \u201cextreme end\u201d of temperature variables charted since 1901. </p> <p>\u201cWe are starting to see things spiral away now,\u201d said Gregor Schuurman, an ecologist at the NPS climate change response program. \u201cWe are going to look back at this time and actually think it was a calm period. And then people will start asking questions about what we were doing about the situation.\u201d</p> <h2>Alaska: the front line</h2> <p>There is now a broad new push to work out exactly what heritage is at risk and how to best to react.</p> <p>If there is a front line, it\u2019s probably found in Alaska. The state has 24 national parks, including Denali, the largest protected park in the US at 6m acres. It is also part of the Arctic, the fastest warming region on Earth. </p> <p>Permafrost, which currently sits underneath 80% of Alaska, is beginning to melt, causing sinkholes and landslides. The north-west coast is being chewed away by almost 150ft a year in places due to sea level rise aided by wind erosion from more intense storms. Wildfires are increasing, with a lack of snow cover allowing the flames to lick areas that haven\u2019t burned in almost 5,000 years.</p> <p>These trends imperil treasures such as those found in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cakr/index.htm\">Cape Krusenstern national monument</a> on the north-west coast. It has extensive evidence of human habitation stretching back 9,000 years. The NPS is scrambling to survey the area as inundations are wiping away this heritage, often before archaeologists can document it.</p> <p>Dael Devenport, an NPS archaeologist based in Anchorage, takes regular helicopter trips to survey the 70-mile coast of the park. There are groups of abandoned houses claimed by the sea and wind, containing items such as lamps, stone tools and ulus \u2013 a type of half moon-shaped knife used to skin seals and caribou. The Inupiat people who live in the region have retreated from this part of the coast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"b6a809b58e7a19808d65b7355e13cf8b5ab3a628\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6a809b58e7a19808d65b7355e13cf8b5ab3a628/0_0_5200_3120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The remote Cape Krusenstern national monument, on the northwestern coast of Alaska, is being claimed by sea and wind.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The remote Cape Krusenstern national monument, on the northwestern coast of Alaska, is being claimed by sea and wind.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danita Delimont/Getty Images/Gallo Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cA lot of these sites haven\u2019t been surveyed properly, we are trying to figure out which are most vulnerable and mitigate against that,\u201d Devenport said. \u201cYou can see houses that are washing away, if you walk along the coast you see the profile of houses.</p> <p>\u201cMost people haven\u2019t thought about how climate change affects archeological sites. A site is a snapshot in time, it\u2019s not like we can pick it up and move it somewhere else. We are in danger of losing a great deal.\u201d</p> <p>The problem is exacerbated by rampant looting of artifacts. A recent survey found almost all of a former settlement of the Thule culture, ancestors of today\u2019s Inuit, had been disturbed and stripped of items such as harpoon tips and figurines carved from walrus ivory. As permafrost melts and walls are washed away, more treasures are revealed to opportunists. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big problem,\u201d Devenport acknowledged. \u201cIt\u2019s probably done by people from local communities who know where the sites are. They can sell items onto dealers, who can get about $50,000 for a figurine from a buyer in Japan. </p> <p>\u201cWhen that artifact has been pulled out from the ground and not documented, we lose all of that information. You\u2019ve lost the whole story behind that item and how it was used.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018The longer we wait, the more we lose\u2019</h2> <p>Further south, in the lower 48 states, a different heritage is at risk. Changing rainfall patterns are affecting a number of parks in the south-west. Extreme rain events caused two major wall collapses in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/indian/2006/park.htm\">historic structures</a> at Tumac\u00e1cori national historical park in southern Arizona.</p> <p>The structures, built by Spanish missionaries more than 300 years ago, are made from adobe, a type of sun-dried clay. The NPS already devotes 2,500 hours a year to maintain these buildings. However climate change is placing a further strain on this heritage.</p> <p>\u201cFor the more vulnerable sites, particularly adobe structures which seem to be the canaries in the coal mine in the south-western US, losses are already rapidly occurring,\u201d said the NPS\u2019 Lauren Meyer, who is heading new research into the issue. </p> <p>Meyer said there is a \u201cgreat urgency\u201d to intervene and save cultural sites at risk from a rapidly warming planet. \u201cThe longer we wait to act, the more history we lose,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Conservationists complain about a lack of funding to identify and preserve at-risk sites, but even if these locations could all be propped up and artifacts protected, the changes to the wider ecosystems march on.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Climate change is set to alter American forests as much \u200bas the arrival of white settlers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Temperature increases vary slightly according to park (the Grand Canyon has warmed on average by 2.4F since 1916, while the Everglades has heated up by 1.5F) \u2013 but the trend is inexorably upwards.</p> <p>This warming is influencing a complex web of processes in national parks. As John Muir, considered the father of US national parks, put it: \u201cTug on anything at all and you\u2019ll find it connected to everything else in the universe.\u201d</p> <p>Climate change is set to <a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/NationalParksClimate/?src=features-hp&amp;eocn=home&amp;eoci=feature\">alter American forests</a> as much as the arrival of white settlers did. The fire season is expanding dramatically. Some species are suffering, such as the native birds of Hawaii targeted by invasive mosquitos, which are able to survive in higher elevations as the forest habitat warms. </p> <p>The remaining 65 groves of huge sequoia trees in California, among the largest living things on the planet, could be decimated by a warmer, drier climate. High-elevation species, such as red spruce and balsam fir, could be pushed off the mountains. The tree that gives Joshua Tree national park its name <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/eij/article/no_more_joshua_trees/\">may not be able to adapt</a>.</p> <p>Such changes cascade through the food chain. The grizzly bears of Yellowstone like to feast on the cone seeds of the white bark pine, a species under attack from the mountain pine beetle. If warmer winters fail to kill off the beetle, the bears will have to find another food source, impacting other species. A lack of snow for denning will affect bears and wolves; warming river waters will force out the salmon.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict exactly what will happen but some systems have been pushed over the threshold, certainly,\u201d said Schuurman. </p> <p>\u201cWe need to recognize that climate change is ongoing and we can only expect the impacts will get stronger time goes on. I tell park managers that whether they are thinking about climate change every day or not, it is likely to find you and tap you on the shoulder. We should take heed of it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"766e5207a27b24810a209fb159b88b76e2b336a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/766e5207a27b24810a209fb159b88b76e2b336a3/0_112_1632_979/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The number of glaciers in Glacier national park, Montana, has halved since 1968 due to rising temperatures.

Last year was a record, with 305 million visitors to national parks. But Sally Jewell, secretary of the interior, recently warned that a lack of funding to deal with the \u201cexistential\u201d threat of climate change, along with unchecked development, will lead to ruin.</p> <p>Jewell said that current trends mean that the next century will mean \u201cnational parks and wildlife refuges will be like postage stamps of nature on a map. Isolated islands of conservation with run-down facilities that crowds of Americans visit like zoos to catch a glimpse of our nation\u2019s remaining wildlife and undeveloped patches of land.\u201d</p> <p>Some national parks are already looking at how to respond to this potentially diminished future. Parks in the south, for example, may offer nighttime activities such as star gazing or bat-spotting. </p> <p>Visitation could actually jump by nearly 25% in 2060 as it warms, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/climatechange/upload/NPS_visitation_climate_brief.pdf\">according to one forecast</a>.The summer months may become too hot for visitors to parks in the southwest.</p> <p>Either way, it will be hard to hide that a trip to the Rocky Mountains in Montana to see Glacier national park won\u2019t involve seeing any actual glaciers.</p> <p>\u201cYes, that will be a visible and dramatic change,\u201d said Schuurman. \u201cWithout being blas\u00e9 in any way, people are adaptable and Glacier national park without its glaciers will still be a stunningly beautiful place. That said, I think anyone would look back and be sad about the loss.\u201d</p> <h2>The effects of climate change</h2> <p><strong>Temperature rise</strong></p> <p>Temperatures across US national parks have risen by about 2.4F in the past century. </p> <p><strong>Disappearing snow and ice </strong></p> <p>The number of glaciers at Glacier national park has halved since 1968. All of the park\u2019s glaciers are on course to completely disappear by the middle of the century.</p> <p><strong>Sea level rise</strong></p> <p>Approximately 40 protected sites are at risk from a 1m sea level rise, with an NPS <a href=\"http://www.nature.nps.gov/geology/coastal/coastal_assets_report/executive_summary.pdf\">analysis</a> calling it \u201cone of the most obvious and most challenging impacts\u201d of global warming. The Everglades could become inundated with salt water, with the ecosystem overwhelmed by invasive species drawn to its changed environment. More powerful storms could endanger the Statue of Liberty, which closed for nine months after Hurricane Sandy in 2012. </p> <p><strong>Wildfire</strong></p> <p>The wildfire season in the west <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/30/wildfires-california-fueled-by-climate-change\">is far lengthier</a> than it was in the 1970s. The risk is compounded by shrinking snow abundance \u2013 in Yellowstone there is an average of 30 fewer days with snow on the ground compared to the 1960s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"41bf217c5dce6f9321332ebadc1f7ac938653449\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41bf217c5dce6f9321332ebadc1f7ac938653449/0_7_2000_1201/1000.jpg\" alt=\"yosemite\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A wildfire burns in Yosemite national park.

  "<p>They wasted a lot of time this season, but boy, the Seattle Sounders are making up for it. Sunday\u2019s Cascadia Cup win over the Portland Timbers means that since firing Sigi Schmid the CenturyLink Field side have drawn one and won three of their four league matches, lifting them into play-off contention in the West. A race that looked to have settled into a rhythm just a few weeks back is now a chaotic hot-mess. Seattle haven\u2019t just lit the fuse, they\u2019ve sparked a raging furnace.<br></p> <p>The 3-1 win over Portland was probably their most satisfying under Brian Schmetzer yet, with the Sounders at their attacking best against their closest rivals. Clint Dempsey has finally found the groove that makes him one of the most potent attackers in the league, but it is the improvement of his supporting cast - and the introduction of Nicolas Lodeiro - that has been most stark.</p> <p>Cristian Roldan, for instance, was outstanding throughout. The 21-year-old looks more suited to the deeper role given to his by Schmertzer in recent weeks, scoring twice, assisting twice and drawing two penalties in the four games he\u2019s played under the interim head coach. Roldan has finally found his identity as a soccer player. It\u2019s not as a playmaker or as a box-to-box operator, but as a space occupier. He fills the areas left by others, and he is just another talent that Schmertzer is now making the most of.</p> <p>So just how far can the Sounders go and how hard can they press for a play-off place, given how late they have left it to make a charge? Their chances could rely on the consistency of their starting lineup. Against Portland, Schmertzer picked the same team for the fourth straight game (the first time since 2010 that Seattle have done that). With the Sounders currently a well-balanced, cohesive, winning side that was to be expected, but what happens when changes have to be made? Will Seattle retain that balance and cohesion? The true depth of their challenge is not yet known.</p> <p>Nonetheless, with the form of the San Jose Earthquakes and the Timbers patchy at present, Seattle\u2019s upward arc could take them all the way into the top six and the play-offs. The Cascadia Cup win over Portland on Sunday proved that their resurgence is for real and not just a fleeting flash of green. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2><strong><br></strong></h2> <h2><strong>Jesse Marsch needs a plan for when things collapse on the road</strong></h2> <p>The New York Red Bulls should have known what to do this time. They\u2019d been there before, after all. Holding a 2-0 lead on the road, on this occasion at East coast rivals DC United, Jesse Marsch\u2019s side looked on course for a statement win. But the Red Bulls know by now not to count their away points until they are on the board. In the end, only one was tallied up after they once again conceded a two-goal lead away from home.</p> <p>It was the same against the Philadelphia Union last month, when a Sacha Kljestan double gave the Red Bulls a 2-0 lead, only for the visitors to PPL Park to capitulate and eventually settle for a 2-2 draw. It happened at StubHub Center too, with the LA Galaxy fighting back from a two-goal deficit to claim a point against an away team all too vulnerable from a winning position. The Chicago Fire also claimed a 2-2 draw against the Harrison side, although they only ever trailed by a single goal.</p> <p>Surely by now Marsch should have a plan to address this critical shortcoming? With Marcelo Sarvas\u2019 penalty kick on Sunday evening, dragging DC United back into the contest at 2-1, the Red Bulls should have resorted to a tactical blueprint designed to limit the damage. Instead they made the same mistakes they have made so many times before. This is more than just misfortune. This is now careless management.</p> <p>Just as in Carson and Chester before that, the Red Bulls were found out at full-back. DC United exploited the space left in behind Kemar Lawrence on the left and Chris Duvall on the right, as Lamar Neagle, Patrick Nyarko and Patrick Mullins exposed the visitors to the Capitol. It\u2019s somewhat astonishing that lessons hadn\u2019t been learned already, but Marsch, as a priority, must ensure his players know how to deal with such a situation when it arises again.</p> <p>Ordinarily, Marsch could put Sunday\u2019s result and the manner of their surrender down to the unpredictability of local rivalries, but this has become a glaring weakness of his team over the past month or two. This deficiency could undermine the Red Bulls\u2019 challenge in the East, certainly hindering their chances of catching New York City FC. Marsch must address it. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2><strong>New York City FC find home comforts</strong></h2> <p>Sometimes, it takes a little while for people to adjust to their new home.<br></p> <p>New York City FC have dealt with that reality for their entire existence \u2013 and opposing fans have relished that fact. From inception, NYC FC have had a tough time traversing the laid-in sod of the Yankee Stadium diamond, the narrow confines of their makeshift home and the depth perception issues common with the sprawling baseball stadium. Last year, those struggles led to an unsightly 6-7-4 record at home.</p> <p>This year, however, Patrick Vieira and his staff have begun to use the baseball ground to their favor. The latest example of this came Saturday evening as NYC FC rode a sixth minute David Villa goal towards an impressive 1-0 win over the LA Galaxy. <br></p> <p>This match was supposed to be about Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard rekindling their vaunted rivalry on the other side of the Atlantic. Instead, it was NYC FC\u2019s stout defensive effort that took center stage, neutralizing the midfield and making two of England\u2019s greatest ever players an afterthought.<br></p> <p>Forget about the fact that Villa\u2019s winner came while he was offside. Instead, focus on the NYC FC defense that, without Maxime Chanot, managed to hold the big-name Galaxy roster to a single shot on goal. Their ability to confound Bruce Arena\u2019s troops resulted in a club record fourth straight victory at home. With that win, NYC FC are just one victory away from tying their 2015 home mark \u2013 with four games yet to be played in the Bronx. </p> <p>Beating the Galaxy and shoring their home form also raises important question: are NYCFC for real? Their current home winning run seems to suggest so, with impressive victories over MLS powers like LA, the New York Red Bulls, Philadelphia Union and the Colorado Rapids.</p> <p>But that streak is only part of the NYC FC revival. Their stellar away form (6-4-3), the leadership of MLS goal scoring leader Villa, their dynamic wing options in Jack Harrison and Tommy McNamara and their reinforced defense also speaks to a larger narrative.<br></p> <p>In short: NYC FC have proven their place amongst the upper echelon of MLS teams. And despite all the setbacks they endured in the nascent days of this franchise, it is now impossible to deny: NYC FC are an MLS Cup contender. And they have earned that distinction. <strong>DM</strong></p> <h2><strong>FC Dallas are paying the price for not signing a top-class striker</strong></h2> <p>Sitting atop the Western Conference, leading the race for the Supporters\u2019 Shield, FC Dallas\u2019 away loss to Real Salt Lake on Saturday was hardly the manifestation of a side on the slide. Yet there were hints at how the Texans\u2019 downfall could happen. Oscar Pareja has forged an astute outfit that could go the distance this season, but he could yet count the cost of his team\u2019s attacking deficiencies.</p> <p>Against RSL, their shortcomings were exposed, succumbing to a goal on the counter-attack having passed several chances of their own. A top-class No9 would surely have taken one of those chances, but FC Dallas don\u2019t have a top-class No9. They have Max Urruti - one of MLS\u2019s most infuriatingly inconsistent forwards - and Getterson - a journeyman on loan from the Brazilian fourth tier. In that respect, they are grossly under-equipped for a tilt at North American soccer\u2019s top prizes.</p> <p>It was a similar story against the Vancouver Whitecaps a week previously, with Urruti spurning a number of chances to secure three points for FC Dallas. The Texans could have been out of sight - or certainly further ahead - at the top of the Western standings were it not for their lack of killer instinct in the final third. Subsequently, Pareja must surely rue not making a move for a dependable striker when the window was open, especially with Fabian Castillo now in Turkey.</p> <p>Of course, FC Dallas could still sign an out-of-contract player, with murmurings that they might have freed up an international spot this week in preparation for a new arrival, but it seems unlikely that Pareja will find the number nine he needs in the free agent market. Truly top-class strikers tend not to be free agents for long, particularly at this time of year.</p> <p>Up until now, FC Dallas have managed to spread the goals across their team. They average 13.1 shots per game, making them MLS\u2019s fourth-most prolific shooters, with their tally of 39 goals for the season so far making them the West\u2019s top scorers. But what happens when goals from midfield and elsewhere dry up, like they did against Real Salt Lake? FC Dallas are hardly renowned as big-spenders, but they might regret not stumping up for a striker good enough to carry them when others can\u2019t. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2>An unenviable streak comes to an end</h2> <p>Two years? 110 weeks? 770 days? No matter which unit of time you use, we can all agree that the Chicago Fire waited a long time to break their winless road streak. <br></p> <p>Goals from Luis Solignac, David Accam and Matt Polster propelled the visiting Fire past Didier Drogba\u2019s Montreal Impact 3-0 at Stade Saputo on Saturday evening. It is Chicago\u2019s first road win since 12 July 2014 when they beat the New England Revolution 1-0 at Gilette Stadium.<br></p> <p>Let\u2019s put that stretch into perspective. In the time since Chicago\u2019s last road victory, New York City FC and Orlando City SC entered MLS, and Minnesota United and Los Angeles FC announced their intent to join the league.<br></p> <p>And who remains on the roster from the 2014 Fire? Only Sean Johnson and R\u0103zvan Cocis \u2013 and Cocis wasn\u2019t even there for the last road win. He joined the club two days after that victory, leaving Johnson the lone witness to Chicago \u201chistory\u201d.<br></p> <p>Chicago didn\u2019t just end that drab road form with Saturday\u2019s win. They also snapped a nine-match road losing streak that dates back to 11 May. Their last away point came against New York City FC on April 10th. Since then, they have been outscored 19-7 in their away fixtures, averaging less than a goal per game while being shut out in four of those nine encounters.<br></p> <p>But how MLS is this? The Chicago Fire are still in the playoff hunt. That comes courtesy of the cannibalization of the Eastern Conference. As of Saturday night, the bottom feeding Chicago Fire sit six points away from sixth place Orlando City for the final postseason berth with 11 games to play. Five of their final 11 matches will come on the road against playoff bound NYC FC, DC United and Toronto FC. Cellar dwellers Seattle Sounders and Columbus Crew will also host Chicago. Their remaining home matches are no picnic either, with encounters against the LA Galaxy and Philadelphia Union in the cards.<br></p> <p>Nevertheless, the Fire fans finally have reason to celebrate. Not only did the team win on the road, but they also gifted their followers something they have not enjoyed in a long time: hope.<br></p> <p>Now let\u2019s see how long that lasts. <strong>DM</strong></p>",
  "<p> The Well Baby clinic in Buchanan is busy. But that\u2019s not unusual. The clinic, a two-hour drive from Liberia\u2019s capital, Monrovia, sees between 700 and 1,000 mothers and children each week.</p> <p>Nurse Cellian Fahncole sits in a consulting room off the main waiting room. She<strong> </strong>is examining a baby girl and<strong> </strong>asking the mother a series of questions, checking the responses against a list. \u201cI am asking, \u2018Does the child have fever and for how long? Is the fever accompanied by other symptoms?\u2019 I refer to my book and check for danger signs, which are highlighted in pink. If there is any one of the danger signs, I know that I need to refer the child to a hospital,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Fahncole is using a system of diagnosis in which midwives and nurses in 77 health facilities across three counties were recently trained.</p> <p>\u201cThe mother said the child was coughing so I did a breath count on the child, measuring how many breaths per minute, but the breath count did not fall into the pink zone on my check list so I know that was not serious.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2302e708e83414d6da3f62ec80ff41da0b945995\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2302e708e83414d6da3f62ec80ff41da0b945995/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cellian Fahncole at the well baby clinic that she runs in Buchanan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cellian Fahncole at the well baby clinic she runs in Buchanan</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Holt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe same with diarrhoea. She had it but it wasn\u2019t threatening her life. I asked, \u2018Is she drinking normally? Is she thirsty all the time?\u2019 If it showed symptoms of dehydration, then I go to that column and explore that aspect in more detail. But she didn\u2019t have more than two of the signs, so I was able to rule it out. It helps me know I am making good decisions.\u201d</p> <p>The system is being introduced by the international health organisation <a href=\"https://www.jhpiego.org/\">Jhpiego</a>, which has supported the mother and baby clinic since the Ebola crisis.<br></p> <p>Jhpiego, an affiliate of Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, US, provided training on how to use protective equipment for staff during the Ebola epidemic. It now offers wider medical staff training and, crucially, the introduction of standardised systems of care designed to better spot and treat illnesses.</p> <p>The new system is part of a global push to better <a href=\"http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/topics/child/imci/en/\">manage childhood illness</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt was difficult for our government to standardise healthcare; they do not have the resources. The best thing that Jhpiego has done here, aside from giving us protective kit during Ebola, is training us. I feel now that we have the best knowledge to help people. We really didn\u2019t have that before,\u201d says Fahncole.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1720c8834139643900040f5d679f8f3e235c9cd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1720c8834139643900040f5d679f8f3e235c9cd5/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Satto Johnson is a county health programme officer at the well baby clinic in Buchanan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Satto Johnson is a county health programme officer at the Well Baby clinic in Buchanan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Holt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The training is really helping nurses, says Satto Johnson, a county health officer. Until recently she worked as a nurse in a government-run hospital that faced huge difficulties providing care where there is a chronic lack of equipment and expertise.</p> <p>Johnson adds: \u201cOnce I had three patients needing oxygen and only one oxygen tank, so I kept having to move it between the three of them. That kind of thing is really tough when all you want to do is help people but you can\u2019t. At the hospital only the bosses used to get any training, never the nurses. But now every level of worker gets it. It has really helped us to stay on top.\u201d</p> <p>Babygryl is at the clinic with her daughter Ellis for vaccinations. It cost her 25 Liberian dollars (about 20p) and took two hours to get here by motorbike taxi. When she arrived she asked for paracetamol because Ellis had a fever. Normally, the fever would have prevented staff from vaccinating her. But rather than letting her go, nurses have kept her at the clinic all day, regularly bathing her in a bid to bring down her fever.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not ideal,\u201d explains a nurse. \u201cBut if we let her go she probably won\u2019t come back so we want to see if we can bring down the child\u2019s temperature enough to safely vaccinate her. I am also a little concerned about the mother\u2019s health. When I was talking to her I could see she sounded a little depressed, so we want to assess her too.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/archive-5-zip/giv-31075c9cYRDkaIBJQ/\" data-alt=\"Liberia factbox\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/archive-5-zip/giv-31075c9cYRDkaIBJQ/\">Liberia factbox</a> </figure>  <p>The clinic is streamlining its services for women. In the past if a woman came to have a baby vaccinated, she would be told to come back on another day if she also needed family planning. Attempts are now being made to identify and serve all a woman\u2019s needs in one visit.</p> <p> Jamyah, 17, came to the clinic for antenatal care but was also offered family planning advice by a specialist worker. She says she didn\u2019t know about family planning \u201cso it is good to learn this today\u201d.</p> <p>Stephen E James, the local director for community health, says he\u2019s confident that standardised systems could be key to helping Liberia withstand another Ebola outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cBefore, we didn\u2019t do enough prevention control or case management of individual patients. But now, if you take this clinic as just one example, you can see the changes. Where once only senior level staff had proper training, now it has cascaded to all healthcare workers.\u201d</p> <p>Fahncole diagnoses the baby girl with non-life threatening malaria and she is allowed to go home. But as she points out, there is still a long way to go when it comes to improving the health of the nation.<br></p> <p>\u201cMalaria is one the biggest killers of children here. Many families have no roofs on their houses so they have no way to protect themselves from malaria. When it rains they have to sleep in the wet, then they get pneumonia. We still have no way to stop poverty making people sick.\u201d</p>",
  "<p></p> <p>Inequality and gender have rightfully become subjects of study at many schools and institutions in Uganda. But, despite the years that have passed, we have not really succeeded in creating gender equality here or in most other countries across the globe.</p> <p>Due to the way we have grown up, many people still hold the old attitudes: women are the ones supposed to cook, wash, take care of the children, and kneel down when greeting others. While women are in the kitchens cooking, men should go and work to provide for the family. Men give the instructions at home because they are seen as the controllers in the relationship. We teach these ideas to our children without even realising it, as they watch and copy the older generation.</p> <p>During my childhood, I spent most of my time with my mother because my dad had multiple wives. I could see he didn\u2019t help my mum in any domestic work and he would blame her if anything went wrong.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The man\u2019s work still remains going to work, watching TV, playing football and sleeping</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2>Is this the way it should be?</h2> <p>A few years ago, gender roles in Uganda started to shift. Women have begun to go out to work and now they contribute the family finances. However, even though there has been this change at work, women still seem to hold all the domestic roles they had from the past. They are still given instructions by men, they are the ones who cook all the meals, they are supposed to take care of their babies, to wash clothes for the children and their husbands, and do all the housework. The man\u2019s work still remains going to work, watching TV, playing football and sleeping. Worst of all, when she gets her salary, the man takes 90% or even 100% control over it in many cases.</p> <p>If you are a married man, have you ever tried to do all the work that your wife does before she goes to work? Have you tried to sit at home with your children, to know how much work your wife\u2019s days are?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4fafc2c3285261a52f8acc84de54f177d32fab8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fafc2c3285261a52f8acc84de54f177d32fab8f/0_205_3240_4050/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sam stirs a large pot\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women are expected to cook all the meals, take care of the children, clean the house and do the washing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Woira</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I speak to women and ask them how it is to be a woman, they tell me: \u201cThat is what I am, I can\u2019t change anything. It is our way. I do what makes my husband happy.\u201d This means that not only do they try to do everything just to make us men happy, but they are not happy themselves.</p> <h2>My inequality challenge</h2> <p>I am a social worker and I know that I have a big responsibility. I know that the street children I work with watch me and learn how to act. I know I have to be a role model for them and for the community. </p> <p>At Salve, we organised an <a href=\"http://www.inequalityquestion.com.\">Inequality Question challenge</a> for the children we work with \u2013 each month they debate a question they choose. I saw this as my opportunity to learn how it feels to be a woman, having many decisions made for you by someone of the opposite gender.  </p> <p>As I am a single guy and I don\u2019t yet have a wife or children, I gave up all of my powers of decision making to six women. They each controlled me for one day. </p> <h2>So what happened?</h2> <p>Every day I was given different instructions from my female controllers. Some of them were easy, such as calling five women who inspire me to tell them why I admire them so much. I chose friends, work colleagues and of course my mother. Other tasks made me feel embarrassed and some even caused friends to laugh and stop talking to me.</p> <p>On the first day, I was told I should clean all the utensils in my house and leave it clean before I go to work. I had planned to wake up at 5:30am but I slept until 6:00am and had to do everything in a rush. I first mopped the house and then cleaned the plates and the cups. When I finished it was already 7:30am. I had 30 minutes to reach work but had not finished bathing and could not leave home without taking a shower. For the first time this year, I reached work 30 minutes late. </p> <p>Because of the pressure of having a lot of work to do at home, it\u2019s easy for women to reach their workplaces late and be told off by their managers. I wish the bosses could understand what they go through before abusing them. </p> <p>After hearing that I was late, some of my friends acknowledged how hard it is to be a woman. One of them promised to help his wife with domestic work so that she can also reach work on time. But some of my friends were just rude. They laughed and said if I was becoming a woman, I should stop working altogether. Some people still believe that women should not work. We have really a long way to go when it comes to teaching people about gender and how men and women need the same opportunities.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At my workplace, I was instructed to put on a bright blue wig so that I can look beautiful</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At my workplace, I was instructed to put on a bright blue wig so that I can look beautiful, exactly how African women are expected to wear wigs or weaves by the community. Of course, everyone\u2019s focus was now on me and my wig. The children I work with were all commenting on it, saying I am like a woman, too focused on my looks rather than work. They started calling me aunt instead of uncle. They said I should change my voice to be high pitched and they wouldn\u2019t listen to me when I gave them instructions. They started to not respect me. I couldn\u2019t focus well on my work. It showed me that the children on the streets hadn\u2019t learned a lot of gender respect in their lives so far. </p> <p>Another day, I was told to greet all of the women by kneeling to them as a sign of respect, in the same way that children and women are expected to kneel to elders here in Uganda. It had been so long since I last had to do this (when I was a young boy). But women have to keep doing it \u2013 it is like we are saying a woman doesn\u2019t grow up but remains a girl. In doing this, I noticed how much the women themselves appreciated it. They liked me showing them extra respect and trying to put myself in their shoes. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ed789eeb1ed614e140b1485d275b31ae8d47b3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ed789eeb1ed614e140b1485d275b31ae8d47b3f/61_21_885_653/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sam kneels to a female colleague, wearing his blue wig\" width=\"500\" height=\"369\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kneeling is seen as a sign of respect, but only children and women are expected to do it.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Woira</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was also instructed to get oranges and put them on my chest to see how awkward breasts make life. That was a bit hard. I couldn\u2019t walk at a fast rate. I am sure my manager didn\u2019t like my laziness that day. And the way I was treated was rude. Men called me silly names like \u201cDem\u201d which they usually call cute girls. You don\u2019t know how insulting it can be if you\u2019re called funny names just because you\u2019re a woman. It is really awkward and makes you feel ashamed.</p> <p>Women in Africa always sit down on the floor while eating food. And that is one of the instructions that one of my female controllers gave me. I had started getting used to behaving in a way that got attention so this was easy. I was growing harder skin. But still my male workmates thought I was mad. They did not think they could do something like that. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/apr/03/my-careers-biggest-lesson-no-women-no-development\">My career\u2019s biggest lesson:  no women, no development</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You may not call these serious challenges, but some of my friends changed their attitude about me. When I told them I was doing an inequality challenge, they thought I was stupid. I have a friend who stopped talking to me. I began to ask him questions that challenged his thinking. I asked whether he had ever taken any good ideas from a woman \u2013 whether he had any lecturers at university that were women, whether his mother is important in his life. He said yes and eventually accepted that women are also important.</p> <p>Most of the women really liked the idea. Most of the ladies that asked me about why I was doing this were happy. They saw me as someone who will show other men that it is just physical make up that makes us different, but they can do all of the things that men can do. They liked that we could challenge inequality together. </p> <h2>What should the permanent solution be?</h2> <p>Men need to wake up to the opportunities that equality could bring. Why don\u2019t we stand by our sisters, mothers, wives and daughters? That is how we can build a great Uganda. We have female MPs, lawyers, doctors and teachers \u2013 we need to show them respect and appreciate their value in our society. I identify as a feminist and I want to inspire every man and woman to join me in this identity.</p> <p>Try it one day, be treated like a Ugandan woman. I promise you will be surprised and extremely tired. But if you decide to change and to work together, then both of you can be at your best for the day ahead. Give it a try \u2013 we need to create a good example for our children to learn from. </p> <p></p> <p>Words without action mean nothing. This is my call for action. Let\u2019s fight inequality.

This is where the Rio police were going to speak publicly about the American swimmer Ryan Lochte last Thursday. Nothing summed up the crazy, wonderful, chaos of Rio and these Games more than the sight of some 200 journalists storming the front of the station. Realising they were overwhelmed the police quickly announced they were moving the press conference to the lobby of a theatre across the street. A police banner was quickly dangled over a sign that read \u201cFree Territory of Democracy\u201d, a table was pulled up, chairs shoved behind it, the reporters wedged into every available space including windows, up a staircase and seated on the floor until it looked less like a press conference and more like a sit-in. The police chief came in, spoke almost non-stop for an hour in Portuguese. When he was finished many of the journalists clapped.

I really do think we are entering a period where some of the previous certainties are no longer quite so certain and you really need to rethink the monetary policy framework.\u201d</p> <p>Davies said he agreed with John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, who said last week central banks should consider adopting a higher inflation target more suited to lower growth.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in favour of trying to lift over time the level of inflation we target,\u201d Davies said. The BoE aims to keep inflation rising at a rate of 2%, a target it is likely to exceed as the falling pound pushes up prices even as the economy slows. </p> <p>Global interest rates are very low and are negative in the eurozone and other jurisdictions as central banks seek to discourage companies and banks from hoarding cash by charging banks to park money with the central bank.

For example, some <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/leading-scientists-explain-how-climate-change-is-worsening-californias-epic-drought-476ceae51a6d#.3pie25ln6\">research has suggested a possible connection</a> between the Arctic sea ice decline and the intensity of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/dec/08/california-just-had-its-worst-drought-in-over-1200-years\">California\u2019s recent record drought</a> (although the connection is not definitive). Those record drought conditions in turn contributed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/18/blue-cut-fire-growth-climate-change-california-wildfires\">the intense wildfires currently raging across California</a>. Other research has suggested<a href=\"http://www.climatecentral.org/blogs/closer-look-at-arctic-sea-ice-melt-and-extreme-weather-15013\"> possible connections between disappearing Arctic sea ice and extreme weather events</a>, but again, these connections aren\u2019t yet definitive.<em><br></em></p> <p>The loss of ice causes what scientists call a feedback effect. Ice is highly reflective, while the ocean beneath is dark. When the ice on the ocean surface melts, the Arctic becomes less reflective and absorbs more sunlight, causing it to warm faster, melting more ice, causing more warming, and so on. This feedback is <a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=81214\">one of the main reasons</a> why the Arctic is Earth\u2019s fastest-warming region, with temperatures rising about twice as fast as in lower latitudes.<em> </em><br></p> <p>Swedish scientist <a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=81214\">Svante Arrhenius predicted this Arctic amplification effect in 1896</a>.<em> </em>As a result, the Arctic is effectively the \u2018canary in the coal mine\u2019 of the Earth\u2019s climate, showing us the dramatic effects human-caused global warming can have on the climate system. The signal is clear, but the question remains whether we\u2019ll take action, or stay in the coal mine.<br></p>",

While the UN\u2019s own World Youth Report released last month described unpaid positions as \u201cexploitative\u201d, some interns speaking out on the issue have faced resistance from their superiors. Last year, FII members protesting at the UN headquarters in New York were <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/un-intern-protest-ends-with-security-breaking-things-up-asking-to-delete-photographs\">removed by security</a>.<br></p> <p></p> <p>The status of interns at the UN remains a complicated and contentious topic. At the highpoint of media attention last year, the UN was quick to blame the policy on a general assembly resolution banning the payment of interns. However, the UN later admitted that the resolution didn\u2019t actually exist. In fact, interns are classified under a decade-old administrative instruction<strong> </strong>known as \u201cgratis personnel\u201d \u2013 a term originally invented for peacekeeping troops lent by governments to the organisation. UN secretariat leaders are able to change this instruction and have done so multiple times in the past.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"david kaye tweet\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;is this really the policy &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/UN&quot;&gt;@UN&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/k0590aEvh7&quot;&gt;https://t.co/k0590aEvh7&lt;/a&gt; via vicenews &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/GUXT5f0CHu&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/GUXT5f0CHu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; David Kaye (@davidakaye) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davidakaye/status/664279309369126914&quot;&gt;November 11, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>The leading the UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression then took to Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidakaye/status/664279309369126914\">to question</a> the organisation\u2019s treatment of protests.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The UN has also claimed they would need to ask for an extra budget from member states to pay their interns. However, their spending priorities are questionable when last year the UN secretariat asked the general assembly to <a href=\"https://www.letemps.ch/economie/2015/08/20/onu-ne-paie-stagiaires-veut-augmenter-salaires-cadres\">raise the salaries of their top employees by 10%</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is something inherently wrong when the organisation is not the first one to implement its own rules</p> <footer> <cite>Alfred de Zayas</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Furthermore, the costs of paying all interns a living stipend, similar to that offered by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), would require less than 0.5% of the organisation\u2019s budget, despite the fact that the organisation employees more than 4,000 unpaid interns (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/14/un-employed-thousands-unpaid-interns\">according to 2012-13 figures</a>). When the ILO first implemented a stipend programme, after discovering one of their interns living in the building\u2019s basement, they did so without searching for a new budget but by simply incorporating the cost into existing allocations.</p> <p>The FII has developed a range of strategies to push the organisation and other employers to change. While a taskforce meets with ambassadors and diplomats, another group is involved planning the next protest action. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"David Hyde intern living in a tent.\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.theguardian.com/embed/video/world/video/2015/aug/13/united-nations-intern-david-hyde-living-in-tent-geneva-resigns-video\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>An <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/100012187664664/videos/124949677921287/\">anonymous video</a> posted by a UN intern calling for the organisation to end the policy recently went viral on social media. It raised the point that \u201cas interns we do real work of real value but are rarely recognised\u201d.

  "<p>Reporters working for western news outlets in the Middle East are routinely accused by Isis, among others, of being spies. Their claims to being impartial observers are scorned.</p> <p>Given the situation, it is surely crucial for front-line journalists to do all they can to illustrate their neutrality. </p> <p>So I\u2019m not sure it was wise for the Mail on Sunday to publish a picture of its correspondent in Iraq, Mark Nicol, posing with a rifle taken from a dead Isis fighter.</p> <p>In his article, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3751054/Terror-Tigris-gripping-dispatch-reporter-captured-jihadi-rifle-hands-s-shelled-Kurdish-Black-Tigers.html\">Terror on the Tigris</a>, Nicol explained how it came about. Along with photographer John McLellan he was accompanying Kurdish Peshmerga forces who are attempting to dislodge Isis from the Iraqi city of Mosul.</p> <p>In so doing, they came under heavy bombardment and Nicol described how they were forced to dive for cover. I will not be alone in applauding their bravery. But what happened next is more questionable:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cInvited by the Peshmerga to pose with an AKM assault rifle taken just hours earlier from a dead IS fighter, I reluctantly oblige in front of Qwer bridge. I am distracted by the thought of how many lives it may have taken, but the Kurds hold up their camera phones and snap away.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>And, of course, McLellan snapped away too. His pictures were then - unwisely in my view - transmitted to the newspaper in London.</p> <p>I somehow doubt that Nicol or McLellan asked for, or knew, that the image would end up on page 45 of yesterday\u2019s Mail on Sunday and, of course, on Mail Online (where it could be seen by Isis). </p> <p>The pair must have known the photograph would increase their chances of being Isis targets and, just as significantly, that it would have the effect of increasing the danger for their journalistic colleagues.</p> <p>Editors should have realised the risks too and should not have run it. A picture of a gun-toting journalist, no matter how uncomfortable he looked, no matter that he was \u201cpersuaded\u201d to do it, is the last thing that should appear.</p> <p>Vaughan Smith, founder of London\u2019s Frontline Club, which includes many foreign correspondents among its membership, said: \u201cThis is awful.\u201d </p> <p>He thought it would imperil frontline journalists, arguing that it was \u201cindulgent and dangerous dilettantism\u201d that invited armed groups \u201cto treat us as participants in conflict, making us more vulnerable while decreasing our value as observers.\u201d</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt fecklessly undermines the work of many industry institutions over the years to promote journalists as neutral observers.\u201d</p> <p>Steven M Ellis, director of advocacy and communications with the International Press Institute (IPI), thought it \u201cextremely irresponsible to do anything that might blur the line between journalist and combatant.\u201d</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt unnecessarily puts journalists, and their colleagues, in greater danger. As there always may be a camera around, we strongly advise against posing with firearms in conflict zones.\u201d</p> <p>There was strong criticism from journalists working in the Middle East, such as freelancer Peter Schwartstein. He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PSchwartzstein/status/767601966239408129\">addressed Nicol directly on Twitter</a>: \u201cJournos in MENA frequently get accused of being spies. Prats like you posing w guns provide fodder.\u201d<br></p> <p>Sky News\u2019s Tom Rayner <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RaynerSkyNews/status/767614354464223232\">was also critical:</a> \u201cJournalists in conflict zones face enough danger without this kind of idiocy\u201d. And <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bencnn/status/767614679959146496\">CNN\u2019s Bed Wedeman</a>, wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s the last thing we need in an already perilous environment.\u201d</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkNicolMoS/status/767628248566132736\">a Twitter response to Rayner and Wedeman</a>, Nicol appeared to apologise: \u201cI think on reflection you\u2019re right and I\u2019m wrong. Sometimes it is easy to make misjudgements.\u201d (However, that had not stopped him from using the picture, albeit briefly, as his Twitter profile image).</p> <p>But the real culprits were at the paper\u2019s headquarters. Given that the Mail on Sunday\u2019s editor, Geordie Greig, was on holiday, it meant that his deputy, Gerard Greaves (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/20/daily-mail-paul-dacre-jon-steafel-gerard-greaves\">soon to join the Daily Mail</a>), was in overall charge. </p> <p>The Mail on Sunday declined to comment. But executives clearly took the matter seriously and, after some discussion, later removed the picture from the online report.<br></p>",

But it still intends to use good scores on the TEF as licence for individual universities to raise fees in line with inflation.</p> <p>This should be one of the most important points for scrutiny in parliament \u2013 especially in the light of news that <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/university-condemned-after-raising-fees-for-students-82pjqk0ck\" title=\"\">at least one university</a> is raising fees already on the back of the TEF not just for new students but for existing ones too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/nov/02/teaching-excellence-framework-university-tef-student-data-higher-education\">The Teaching Excellence Framework: can higher education up its game?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With the relocation of responsibility for universities into the Department for Education some worry that the TEF is uncomfortably close to Ofsted grades, and we know what those can do to a school\u2019s reputation and fortunes. Universities UK, the vice-chancellors\u2019 body, has called for implementation to be delayed until universities\u2019 post-Brexit links with the EU are clarified. Many are concerned that the TEF will be too heavily driven by blunt metrics. However, the idea is too good an opportunity to miss for universities to promote teaching excellence.</p> <p>We now know what the key criteria will be: the headings are \u201cteaching quality\u201d, \u201clearning environment\u201d (eg facilities) and \u201cstudent outcomes &amp; learning gain\u201d (eg the employment outcomes of graduates and the gains made by students from a range of different backgrounds). Universities will be judged on each of the three areas on the basis of performance indicators (or \u201cmetrics\u201d) alongside, crucially, universities\u2019 own additional evidence. These will be combined to yield a grade: \u201cmeets expectations\u201d, \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201coutstanding\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTeaching Quality\u201d is defined as \u201cteaching practices which provide an appropriate level of contact, stimulation and challenge, encourage student effort and engagement\u201d. This will be measured by National Student Survey (NSS) questions. Institutions will add their own statements on issues such as effectiveness of innovative approaches, new technology or educational research and \u201crecognition and reward schemes, including progression and promotion opportunities for staff\u201d.</p> <p>Here the TEF, if implemented well \u2013 and it\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d \u2013 can be a force for good by providing parity of recognition for committed and effective teaching alongside research. Let\u2019s hope this dimension also encourages a reduction in the casualisation of the academic workforce.</p> <p>The \u201clearning environment\u201d may include use of technology, work experience, extraurricular activities and opportunities for peer-to-peer interaction. This is a broader, richer conceptualisation than many had anticipated. Alongside NSS scores, judgments here will also reflect dropout rates. Universities will be able to contextualise the data by outlining what they are doing to improve retention. This seeks to address the spectre of some universities rejecting non-traditional students for fear of their potential impact on dropout rates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jul/21/higher-education-student-debt-teaching-excellence-framework-tef-jo-johnson\">Outstanding higher education teaching should not increase students\u2019 debt | Patrick McGhee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The metric for the student outcomes category is not only the unloved first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/20/students-vote-to-sabotage-plans-to-rate-teaching-in-universities\" title=\"\">Destinations of Leavers from Higher Education </a>(DLHE) survey, which measures employment and training a mere six months after graduation, but also potentially a new index on \u201chighly skilled employment\u201d.

More changes and improvements will come.</p> <p>However, more important than the detail of these measurements and statements is the link between how universities perform and tuition fees: this should be cut once and for all.

But they continued to operate throughout most of these wars, with a number still running as late as 2015,\u201d said Hickman.<br></p> <p>Evidence of the pollution effects on Iraqi communities is barely known because little research has been done. But Savabieasfahani said the toxicological effects of the air pollution would inevitably have been damaging. </p> <p>\u201cWe know that they burned pesticides, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, solvents, medical waste and toxic heavy metals. All are extremely polluting to the environment. Thick black clouds of pollution were common, day and night,\u201d she said.</p> <p> \u201cI was alerted to the pollution when living close to Basra when the invasion started and several women at the university where I was teaching spontaneously aborted.</p> <p>\u201cBut getting tissue samples out of Iraq has proved nearly impossible and little research into the pollution\u2019s effect on people living close to the burn pits has been conducted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe found very high levels of mercury, lead, titanium and various toxic metals in hair of children and parents of children with disorders or severe birth defects, showing metal contamination has happened since 2003 \u2013 with increased disorders and defects.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cWe could see that when the bombing started so did the birth defects. In May 2010, 15% of 547 babies born at the [Basra] hospital had severe birth defects. This is in contrast to 2% to 4% that is normal,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Later in 2010, rates of babies being born with birth defects were as high as 30%, said Savabieasfahani. \u201cPollution all ends up in the body.

  "<p>On the eve of the Rio 2016 opening ceremony, the director of communications for the organising committee was holding forth in the lobby of the International Olympic Committee family hotel, from which one member would later be led by police investigating ticket touting. Asked if he had a message for those arriving in Rio for the Games, Mario Andrada half smiled and half sighed. \u201cBuckle up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a bumpy ride.\u201d</p> <p>A bit like the city of Rio de Janeiro itself, that ride has been by contradictory turns chaotic, uplifting, amusing, enchanting and enraging. But as far as the IOC president, Thomas Bach, was concerned, these Games have been an unalloyed triumph from start to finish.</p> <p>He did not appear to see empty seats in venues amid huge disparities between the claimed number of sales and those actually present. He did not worry at the waste of convoys of buses speeding along dedicated lanes, many of them virtually empty. Or the fact that cuts to the numbers of volunteers had appeared to leave those left exhausted and out on their feet. Or that those Brazilians and international fans who made it to the Olympic Park had missed the last metro by the time their events finished.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/22/cheers-boos-and-a-carnival-atmosphere-as-flame-goes-out-on-rio-olympics\">Rio 2016: cheers, boos and a carnival atmosphere as Olympic flame goes out</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet despite everything, by the end the excitement of the sporting action had permeated the heart of this city and at its climax every bar and restaurant was tuned to Brazil\u2019s progress in the volleyball, beach volleyball and \u2013 most of all \u2013 the football.</p> <p>But it felt like it was happening in spite of the IOC and the organisers rather than because of them.

Which might come as news to those who had been promised that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jun/01/grassroots-efforts-lead-the-clean-up-of-brazils-guanabara-bay\">Guanabara Bay would be cleaned up</a> but who will now find the temporary fix installed so that the world\u2019s sailors did not have to compete in foul, sewage-infested waters is swept away by the tide of effluent flowing back into the bay.</p> <p>He waxed lyrical about how it would leave a \u201cnew educational infrastructure\u201d because the handball arena will be turned into four schools. That will be scant reward for those more concerned about the deep-rooted public-funding crisis that is affecting not only schools and universities but also hospitals and other services.</p> <p>The most jaw-dropping moment in this broadcast from Planet Bach was when he claimed the Games had been arranged without a single Brazilian real of public subsidy. \u201cThere is no public money in the organisation of this Olympic Games,\u201d he said. Over the previous week it had become clear that the Paralympics, paid for out of the same budget as the Olympics, would not happen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/19/rio-paralympics-downsized-disappointing-ticket-sales\">without a substantial bailout from the public purse</a>. For Bach not to refer to that was hubris of the highest order. It also relied on the sleight of hand long employed by the IOC \u2013 separating the \u201coperational budget\u201d from the \u201cinfrastructural budget\u201d.</p> <p>In fairness, some long-overdue improvements to the public transport network have been willed into being by the fixed deadline of the Games. Whether the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/15/2016-olympics-games-metro-extension-delay\">$3bn metro extension</a> into the upmarket Barra stretch of condos and strip malls that housed the Olympic Park at its far end is the best use of that investment will become clear in time.</p> <p>Bach was most excited about the surge in social media traffic, in which he claimed that the main headlines were \u201cthe people\u2019s Games, the most happy Games ever, the beautiful Games, the passion Games\u201d.</p> <p>In George Orwell\u2019s 1984, Newspeak was the official language and blackwhite was a key concept within it. Orwell wrote: \u201cApplied to an opponent, it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the plain facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when Party discipline demands this. But it means also the ability to believe that black is white, and more, to know that black is white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary.</p> <p>\u201cThis demands a continuous alteration of the past, made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest, and which is known in Newspeak as doublethink.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/21/um-mundo-novo-the-olympic-rings-leave-rio-rustier-but-brighter\">Um Mundo Novo? The Olympic rings leave Rio, rustier but brighter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Swap Party for the IOC and the basis on which the guardians of the five rings invent their own mythology as they go along becomes much clearer.</p> <p>Bach went on to prove the point further: \u201cIt\u2019s also a Games in the middle of reality. This Games has not been organised in a bubble.\u201d In all honesty, the opposite is true.</p> <p>The blame for some of the pressures that have threatened to tear at the fabric of these Olympics can be laid squarely at the door of the IOC. Others were the fault of the vainglorious Brazilian politicians determined to add the ultimate seal of international approval to their story of economic growth by hosting the World Cup and Olympics back to back.</p> <p>It is true to say that Brazil has been assailed by an economic and political hurricane since winning, in 2009, the right to host the Games, on a wave of optimism as one of the emerging Bric \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India, China \u2013 powerhouses.</p> <p>Fifa and the IOC have been keen over recent decades to spread the gospel into new territories, largely for commercial reasons. But in doing so they have sought to take all of the upside and leave nothing behind.</p> <p>The IOC in particular has legions of working groups and committees dedicated to sustainability. In the run-up to the London Olympics there was much talk about a \u201ccompact\u201d Games. Bach was elected on the back of his Agenda 2020 reform plan.</p> <p>But it is largely just talk. The reality is that the IOC is committed to crowd-source decisions from its peculiar membership of minor royals, former athletes and slick sports politicians who play to their own vanity.</p> <p>It is right that major sporting festivals such as the Olympics should be taken to all corners of the world. But it should be done on a scale that is sensible and in a way that leaves lasting benefit. Instead, even as it was assailed by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/russia-doping-scandal\">Russian doping crisis</a> on the eve of the Games the IOC voted to add five sports to the schedule for 2020; it is accelerating endlessly towards gigantism.</p> <p>Even the crowds coming out of the feelgood fillip of the packed finals of the beach volleyball on Copacabana were a reminder of the corporatism that is hardwired into the Games. As they streamed out, many started scanning for the helpers holding lollipop signs bearing the names of sponsors that would lead them back to their hotels.</p> <p>In a sane world Rio might be, in its own way, a reminder that the Olympics need not be a cookie-cutter experience, that it should embrace different parts of the world and that staging it need not mean bankrupting a state. The rough edges were in some way pleasing, a reminder that the Games has got too fat.</p> <p>It could be a signal that there is a better, lower-key, more affordable (for hosts and for spectators), more sustainable way of staging the Olympics that leaves behind a genuine legacy rather than just saying it will.</p> <p>Instead, the logistical difficulties involved \u2013 and the temerity of the Brazilian police in targeting the ticketing arrangements of some of its members \u2013 are more likely to have made this self-aggrandising \u201cmovement\u201d revert to type and start looking up five-star establishments in Tokyo and, beyond that, in Hollywood or Paris.</p>",

Physically fit, a good shot, and an experienced leader. I will do what has to be done and I work hard for those who work hard for me. As a lieutenant, I commanded over 40 soldiers in Afghanistan. As an adjutant of a regiment, I was where the buck stopped for all HR and personnel issues and ultimately, for how \u201cdeployable\u201d all our soldiers were. But I am a new breed, and I am not alone in my outlook.</p> <p>A new century brings with it new challenges for the army; the soldiers and officers of a new generation expect different things. We are no longer the army of the 1970s, where shouting was pretty much how everything got done. The way we as a disciplined and uniformed force interact with the UK and the wider world has changed.</p> <p>LGBT and ethnic minority issues have been placed squarely at the front and centre of the army\u2019s agenda. There is an <a href=\"http://armylgbt.org.uk/\" title=\"\">annual army LGBT conference</a>, that I have attended and which is a productive event: everyone regardless of sexual orientation leaves feeling positive, included, and inspired about the future. We have transgender people currently serving who are well-supported by their colleagues. Ethnic minority recruitment is on the rise and it is now, more than ever, socially acceptable within these communities to sign up. Each regiment has a welfare department to help with a soldier\u2019s financial problems, divorces, custody disagreements, and the promotion of harmony within the army. Why? Because a satisfied soldier is an effective soldier. How many other employers can boast such a supportive system?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Your average soldier or officer is still essentially a flawed human, working for other flawed humans</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, your average soldier or officer is still essentially a flawed human, working for other flawed humans. Remember that when you see the sharp-eyed rifleman on the news sitting in a Chinook helicopter somewhere hot, or patrolling foreign streets in an attempt to bring stability to another part of the world. The man behind that rifle has a family, a mortgage, a baby, a sick mother \u2013 in short, he has a life, a life I as his officer have a direct investment in. It is a life with emotions, feelings, stresses. He might even be your brother or son, if things were different.</p> <p>As soldiers, we go to places on the whim of a government that does not always grasp the human element surrounding the young people they may send to their deaths. We are often working with loose planning in dangerous environments, in countries without a stable government in place.

It\u2019s not like the movies: in such situations every action is conducted meticulously, as it has to be. Planning over and over again, and conducting pre-patrol checks on ammunition, radios, body armour, and water are unglamorous but good drills that will ultimately save lives.</p> <p>I can go from exhilarating deployment to drumming my fingers on an empty desk in HQ in the same week.</p> <p>In barracks day-to-day, we are like any other corporation: navigating out-of-touch superiors, jumping through hoops, completing idiotic health and safety courses. My particular bugbear is other soldiers who are not prepared to go the extra mile, those who will make this whole rollercoaster feel like merely a job; as opposed to the all-singing, all-dancing vocation.</p> <p>Politics (with a capital P) definitely shapes the lives of soldiers and officers, but office politics and daily frustrations are prominent and the same as anywhere \u2013 little arguments, line manager power struggles, coffee fund spats, open-plan offices, ineffective coworkers ... the list goes on.</p> <p>The recent redundancies and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/05/army-2020-fighting-future\" title=\"\">Army 2020 cuts</a> have left many people doing upwards of three jobs to cover the workload.

Here is what the illusion typically looks like:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc3de52ea7c8dc493661fff29c8b6458b9057b80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc3de52ea7c8dc493661fff29c8b6458b9057b80/0_7_650_390/500.png\" alt=\"Ebbinghaus illusion\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Ebbinghaus illusion</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wikimedia Commons/Wikimedia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Almost everyone who sees this image will say that the central circle on the left is smaller than the one on the right. In fact the two orange circles are exactly the same size \u2013 measure them if you don\u2019t believe me. Even when you have produced the illusion yourself, using the same 5 pence coin to create the two circles, it\u2019s very difficult not to see the one on the right as being bigger.</p> <p><strong>How it works</strong></p> <p>The illusion rests on the fact that the visual-attention system uses context to determine the size of objects. The orange circle on the left is surrounded by larger circles, making it seem small by comparison. The one on the right is surrounded by smaller circles, making it seem big.</p> <p>Interestingly, adults who fall for the illusion visually tend not to succumb if asked to reach for the two objects. Although their eyes are telling them that the circles are different sizes, their grip size is the same in both cases. This has been used as evidence that there are <a href=\"https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-19/edition-11/one-brain-two-visual-systems\">two separate pathways</a> for vision in the brain, one used for identifying objects and the other used for action.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2016/aug/08/is-your-memory-as-accurate-as-you-think-it-is\">Is your memory as accurate as you think it is?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The illusion feels fast and automatic yet is surprisingly susceptible to individual differences. Although most people across cultures experience the illusion, it is <a href=\"http://pec.sagepub.com/content/37/9/1426.full.pdf+html\">stronger</a> for those from Japan than those from the UK. This cultural difference interacts with other factors: the effect is stronger on average in women than men (though there is massive overlap) and in <a href=\"http://pec.sagepub.com/content/33/1/79.full.pdf+html\">social scientists than in mathematicians</a>.</p> <p>These differences are thought to rest on processing style. Those who experience the illusion most strongly tend to have a more global, holistic processing style as compared to a more local, analytic style. </p> <p>Interestingly, children <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00931.x/epdf\">below the age of 7</a> do not seem to experience the illusion, regardless of where they come from. No-one is quite sure why but it may be because it relies on familiarity with depth cues in printed images. While most adults have years of experience of quickly making sense of size differences in 2D images, and so are easily fooled, children have a great deal less. The effect is surprisingly reliable \u2013 if you have any young children hanging about, try the illusion out on them.</p> <p><a><br></a></p>",
  "<p>In the cavernous assembly hall at Victor public school in the Delhi suburb of Shahdara, hundreds of pupils sit cross-legged on the floor to watch a story about seven-year-old Komal.</p> <p>Komal\u2019s parents become friendly with a new neighbour. He treats her affectionately and her parents tell her to call him Bakshi Uncle. He gives her sweets. He plays hide-and-seek with her. Then he plays another \u201cgame\u201d that leaves her feeling dirty. The video concludes with an explanation about the difference between \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d touches. </p> <p>Two female police officers then talk to the children about sex and sexual abuse.</p> <p>The session is part of Project <em>Nirbheek</em> (meaning fearless in Hindi), launched in 556 schools in the north-east district of the city in August last year to raise awareness of child abuse and give youngsters a safe environment in which to speak out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/05/new-financial-bond-helping-us-get-more-girls-into-schools-india-education\">A new financial bond is helping us get more girls into schools in India</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As well as the video and weekly visits by police officers, children can confidentially post any experiences of abuse or concerns they have in dropboxes installed in each school.</p> <p>India has <a href=\"http://The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012\">laws against child abuse</a>, but implementation and knowledge of them are problematic. </p> <p>\u201cI realised we had to take the law into the classroom and create an atmosphere that allows children to invoke the law, otherwise the laws are pointless,\u201d says the deputy commissioner of police, Veenu Bansal, who devised the project.</p> <p>In the first six months, the police received more than 5,000 written and verbal complaints of abuse. Encouraged by the overwhelming response, Delhi police extended the programme to all schools in the capital.</p> <p>\u201cFor the first time, children have a non-frightening way of reporting abuse in the familiar environment of school,\u201d says Mukesh Kumari, one of the police officers visiting Victor public school.</p> <p>Many of the children tell her that they thought adults would punish them if they talked about such \u201cshameful\u201d things. \u201cEven I felt uneasy at first. It\u2019s just not something we Indians talk about,\u201d says Kumari.</p> <p>During the session, many pupils look embarrassed. \u201cIn our house we don\u2019t talk about such things. My father would slap me if I talked about this,\u201d says 12-year-old Neelam Sharma.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/08/india-dalit-how-can-a-girl-become-a-taxi-driver-defying-caste-gender-taboos\">'How can a girl become a taxi driver?': defying India's caste and gender taboos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But others were less timid. Two girls speak to Kumari and her colleague, Preeti Tomar, to complain about rowdy youths standing outside the school gates as they leave, directing obscenities at them. Another says she doesn\u2019t like the way the auto-rickshaw driver who drives her home insists she sit close to him even when there is space on the back seat. </p> <p>Across the city, one or two female police officers visit a school every week, wearing a Nirbheek armband. The police have so far interacted with more than 1 million children and installed complaint boxes in more than 1,500 schools.</p> <p>Stalking, lewd comments by shopkeepers, inappropriate behaviour by auto-rickshaw drivers, and youths loitering outside the school propositioning girls are common complaints. </p> <p>In many cases, it is relatively easy for the police to take prompt action against the lesser forms of harassment. If it\u2019s a stalker, a visit to his home to speak to his family usually works. An auto-rickshaw driver can be warned. If it\u2019s a teacher, the school authorities act to discipline, suspend or sack him. The more serious cases require a police investigation. The police have filed formal charges in 11 cases of sexual abuse so far in the north-east district alone.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.childlineindia.org.in/pdf/MWCD-Child-Abuse-Report.pdf\">only statistics on child sex abuse</a> (pdf) in India are from a 2007 government survey that showed half of children under the age of 18 had suffered some form of sex abuse, ranging from rape to fondling and forced kissing.</p> <p>\u201cI think the 2007 figure is an eye-opener and the actual problem may be much larger,\u201d Bansal says. \u201cFrom what I see, a very large number of girls face abuse at some stage in their lives. It\u2019s grim. It happens under everyone\u2019s nose. How can we let our girls, one-quarter of our population, be damaged for life by sexual abuse?\u201d</p> <p>Bansal enlisted the support of the <a href=\"http://www.rahifoundation.org/\">Recovery and Healing from Incest Foundation (Rahi)</a>, an NGO that works with child abuse survivors to train police officers. About 500 have been trained so far.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt has to be handled sensitively because the social and family dynamics can be so complex. They need to understand these aspects because it will shape their response. It\u2019s great that the police are not waiting for cases to be registered but are being proactive,\u201d says Rahi\u2019s founder, Anuja Gupta. </p> <p>Tomar admits to being deeply distressed hearing some complaints. \u201cA father had been raping his daughter for years. When she told her mother, the mother said, \u2018Just the way I\u2019ve tolerated these things, you will have to tolerate it too.\u2019 After the girl reported the abuse through the dropbox, the mother tried to force her to withdraw it but the girl refused,\u201d she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/06/why-is-the-crisis-in-rural-india-passing-under-the-radar\">Why is the rape crisis in rural India passing under the radar? | Priya Virmani</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In another case, says Bansal, a maths teacher had been assaulting girls for many years, touching them inappropriately when alone in the classroom. After two girls put a complaint in the dropbox, the other teachers sided with him and tried to bully the girls into retracting the allegation. But the police contacted ex-pupils who said they would testify against the teacher even if the two girls retracted their statements. The teacher is in police custody.</p> <p>The success of Nirbheek in Delhi has come to the attention of Maneka Gandhi, minister for women and child development, and plans are being made to roll it out nationally <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Soon-an-e-dropbox-for-kids-to-report-abuse/articleshow/52931133.cms\">using e-dropboxes</a>, which will be hosted on the <a href=\"http://ncpcr.gov.in/\">National Commission for Protection of Child Rights website</a>. </p> <p>Critics, though, say it\u2019s not the police\u2019s job to talk about sex abuse, and <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Sex-education-in-schools-should-be-banned-Union-health-minister-Harsh-Vardhan-says/articleshow/37274947.cms\">argue for sex education in schools</a>. </p> <p>Sex education is banned in 13 states and non-existent in the remaining 16. Because of ignorance, children usually don\u2019t even know they are being abused. And the cultural pressure to respect and obey older relatives adds to their reluctance to speak out.</p>",

  "<p>Six people have drowned in the UK in two days as strong winds and high seas battered much of the British coastline.</p> <p>A man who got into trouble outside the safe swim area at Sandbanks beach in Poole, Dorset, on Saturday afternoon is the latest person to be confirmed to have died this weekend during rough coastal conditions.</p> <p>The man, who was seen having difficulties in the rip current, was recovered from the water by lifeguards who performed CPR, Dorset police said. An air ambulance and paramedics attended, but he was pronounced dead at the scene.</p> <p>Later on Saturday, a woman died after being recovered from treacherous seas off Jersey. Rescue boats from Jersey fire service and the RNLI were launched at about 8.20pm after two swimmers were reported to be in difficulty near Green Island beach.</p> <p>A male swimmer was rescued by a member of the public. The woman was later recovered from the water and transported to hospital, where she died, Jersey police said. It was revealed on Sunday that her name was Joy Godfray and she died the day before her 32nd birthday. Police said her family wanted to pass their \u201cheartfelt thanks to the members of the public and all the emergency services who fought to save the life of their daughter\u201d.</p> <p>Also on Saturday, the bodies of a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/21/mother-and-son-killed-aberdeen-cornwall-winds\">mother and her six-year-old son</a> were recovered from the sea off Aberdeen, and a windsurfer in his 60s died after being caught in difficult conditions off West Mersea, Essex. </p> <p>The pair in Aberdeen were named as Julie Walker, 37, and her son Lucas. It is believed that Walker had gone into the sea to try to rescue him and another boy, 13, who had got into trouble while swimming. The second boy and two other people believed to have gone in to help, a 25-year-old woman and a 28-year-old man, were taken to hospital.</p> <p>On Friday, a man died after he and his family were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/20/man-swept-out-to-sea-by-10ft-wave-in-newquay-cornwall-dies\">swept off rocks into the sea</a> in Cornwall. He was named on social media as Rudy Bruynius, who was on holiday with his wife and three children.</p> <p>The family had been walking at South Fistral beach in Newquay. The two boys were able to scramble back on to the rocks and Bruynius\u2019s wife, Lisinda, was rescued on a RNLI sea scooter. The boys were treated for minor injuries.</p> <p>A lifeboat was deployed to rescue Bruynius and the couple\u2019s two-year-old daughter, McKayla. The pair were airlifted to Royal Cornwall hospital, where Bruynius died. McKayla remained in a critical condition on Sunday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56ac9231a75bad1a271dddfd319069e20401d5fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56ac9231a75bad1a271dddfd319069e20401d5fb/0_84_2519_1512/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The scene in Newquay, Cornwall, where a man died and his wife and daughter were rescued off Fistral beach\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The scene in Newquay, Cornwall, where a man died and his wife and daughter were rescued off Fistral beach</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Blatchford/SWNS.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A crowdfunding page set up by a friend to support the family has already <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/terri-anne-remant?utm_id=106&amp;utm_term=7wqyZY9p9\">raised more than \u00a316,000</a>.</p> <p>An RNLI spokesperson said crews had had an extremely busy weekend with a high number of callouts, and warned people to take care in and around water.</p> <p>\u201cEssentially, the conditions we\u2019ve got are approaching more what you\u2019d expect in late autumn or winter in terms of the swells,\u201d said Peter Dawes, the RNLI lifesaving services manager. \u201cIt has caught a lot of people by surprise at the end of the summer holidays. It\u2019s bigger and worse conditions than they\u2019re used to.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that more than half the people who get in trouble had no intention of getting into the water \u2013 they\u2019re swept off rocks, falling off paths or marinas into water. They have to be aware that water is a very unforgiving environment and you really can\u2019t afford to make a mistake.\u201d</p> <p>Mark Wilson, a Met Office meteorologist, said the rough conditions on Saturday had been caused by a combination of strong winds and spring tides. \u201cWe saw an unseasonably deep area of low pressure yesterday that brought strong winds,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause that was combined with spring tides, it led to some large waves across western areas in particular. We saw some gusts of 50-60mph. It was this combination that caused these coastal conditions.\u201d</p> <p>Conditions were improving on Sunday, with the low pressure system moving away.</p>"
