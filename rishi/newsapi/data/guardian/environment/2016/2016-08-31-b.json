  "<h2>Arsenal</h2> <p>It has taken two summers but Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has finally bought to strengthen the spine of his squad. Coming in after Petr Cech last season are players to address key positions that have needed bolstering for some time. Wenger hopes Shkodran Mustafi quickly forms a great partnership with Laurent Koscielny, while Granit Xhaka has already inspired comparisons to Emmanuel Petit in midfield. The wildcard is the 27-year-old Lucas P\u00e9rez up front. Arsenal fans craving a dream striker are hoping for the best from an unfamiliar name with a reputation as a late developer, a Spanish Jamie Vardy. Jack Wilshere\u2019s loan move to Bournemouth stands out among the departures. <strong>Amy Lawrence </strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/31/david-luiz-shock-return-chelsea-34m-transfer-psg\">David Luiz completes shock return to Chelsea from PSG for \u00a334m</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Major moves</strong></p> <p><strong>In:</strong> <strong>Granit Xhaka</strong> Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach \u00a335m; <strong>Shkodran Mustafi</strong> Valencia \u00a335m; <strong>Lucas P\u00e9rez</strong> Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a \u00a317m; <strong>Rob Holding</strong> Bolton Wanderers \u00a32m</p> <p><strong>Out:</strong> <strong>Tomas Rosicky</strong> Sparta Prague Free; <strong>Joel Campbell </strong>Sporting Lisbon (loan); <strong>Calum Chambers </strong>Middlesbrough (loan); <strong>Jack Wilshere </strong>Bournemouth (loan)</p> <h2>Bournemouth</h2> <p>Signing Jordon Ibe from Liverpool for a club-record \u00a315m was an early sign of intent and the winger was soon followed by Brad Smith, with the Anfield left-back moving for \u00a33m. But few could have expected Jack Wilshere would be heading to the Vitality Stadium. The signing of the Arsenal midfielder on loan \u2013 in the face of interest from Milan, Roma and Crystal Palace \u2013 represents a significant coup. There is excitement, too, about Lewis Cook, the teenage midfielder who arrived for \u00a37m from Leeds United. Marc Wilson has signed from Stoke in an attempt to improve Bournemouth\u2019s leaky defence. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <p><strong>Major moves</strong></p> <p><strong>In:</strong> <strong>Jordon Ibe</strong> Liverpool \u00a315m; <strong>Lewis Cook</strong> Leeds United \u00a37m; <strong>Lys Mousset</strong> Le Havre \u00a35m; <strong>Brad Smith</strong> Liverpool \u00a33m; <strong>Marc Wilson</strong> Stoke \u00a32m; <strong>Nathan Ak\u00e9</strong> Chelsea (loan); <strong>Jack Wilshere</strong> Arsenal (loan)</p> <p><strong>Out:</strong> <strong>Matt Ritchie</strong> Newcastle United \u00a310m; <strong>Tommy Elphick </strong>Aston Villa \u00a33.3m; <strong>Lee Tomlin</strong> Bristol City \u00a33m</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/31/the-ups-and-downs-of-jack-wilsheres-career-so-far-video-report\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xyx5\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2692229\"            data-video-name=\"The ups and downs of Jack Wilshere's career so far \u2013 video report\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c70aabe4b0df5f040dc06a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/31/160831Wilshere_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/31/160831Wilshere_WebM.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/31/160831Wilshere.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/31/the-ups-and-downs-of-jack-wilsheres-career-so-far-video-report\">The ups and downs of Jack Wilshere\u2019s career so far</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Burnley</h2> <p>The club have spent around \u00a318m on reinforcements, a piddling sum next to the amounts being flashed by north\u2011west neighbours but considerably more than the \u00a35m they spent to no avail two years ago, the previous time they were promoted. Burnley have broken their transfer record twice, first for the Belgium defender Steven Defour, then with the deadline-day acquisition of their long-term target Jeff Hendrick, though a deal for the Poland winger Kamil Grosicki fell through. Burnley should be competitive again, if not yet quite the new Leicester, particularly as Sean Dyche has picked up a couple of shrewd loan signings in Patrick Bamford and Jon Flanagan. <strong>Paul Wilson</strong></p> <p><strong>Major moves</strong></p> <p><strong>In:</strong> <strong>Steven Defour</strong> Anderlecht \u00a37.3m; <strong>Jon Flanagan</strong> Liverpool (loan); <strong>Patrick Bamford</strong> Chelsea (loan); <strong>Jeff Hendrick</strong> Derby \u00a310.5m</p> <p><strong>Out:</strong> <strong>Joey Barton</strong> Rangers (free); <strong>Matt Gilks </strong>Rangers (free)</p> <h2>Chelsea</h2> <p>For the second summer in succession, there was a rather slapdash feel to much of Chelsea\u2019s business. The arrivals of N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and Michy Batshuayi set an upbeat tone but the pursuit of defensive reinforcements led Michael Emenalo and Marina Granovskaia on a rather tortuous pursuit of various overpriced centre-halves in Serie A. They ended up pursuing Marcos Alonso for cover at left-back, with all routes eventually, and rather bafflingly, leading to David Luiz at Paris Saint-Germain. Antonio Conte clearly likes a challenge. There have been the usual flurry of loan departures and last year\u2019s surprise deadline-day signing, Papy Djilobodji, was sold at vast profit. <strong>Dominic Fifield</strong></p> <p><strong>Major moves</strong></p> <p><strong>In:</strong> <strong>Michy Batshuayi</strong> Marseille \u00a333m; <strong>N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 </strong>Leicester City \u00a330m; <strong>Marcos Alonso </strong>Fiorentina \u00a323m; <strong>David Luiz</strong> PSG \u00a334m</p> <p><strong>Out:</strong> <strong>Mohamed Salah</strong> Roma \u00a312m; <strong>Papy Djilobodji </strong>Sunderland \u00a38m; <strong>Juan Cuadrado </strong>Juventus (loan)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/aug/31/david-luiz-rejoin-chelsea-psg-deal-video-report\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xy35\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2692283\"            data-video-name=\"David Luiz set to rejoin Chelsea in \u00a334m deal \u2013 video report\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c732e5e4b04fe839bc535a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/01/160831luizup_KP-29095181_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/01/160831luizup_KP-29095181.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/01/160831luizup_KP-29095181_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/aug/31/david-luiz-rejoin-chelsea-psg-deal-video-report\">David Luiz set to rejoin Chelsea in \u00a338m deal</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Crystal Palace</h2> <p>The failure to secure Jack Wilshere on deadline day suggested anticlimax but Alan Pardew could hardly complain as to the bulk of the business conducted in this window. Palace\u2019s deficiencies up front should be remedied by the arrivals of Christian Benteke and Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my, while Andros Townsend and Steve Mandanda also represent a step up in quality. James Tomkins is the extent of the defensive cover while Yannick Bolasie will be missed as will Mile Jedinak but there can be no more excuses. After two wins in 24 Premier League games, this team must now revive. <strong>DF</strong></p> <p><strong>Major moves</strong></p> <p><strong>In:</strong> <strong>Christian Benteke</strong> Liverpool \u00a327m; <strong>Andros Townsend</strong> Newcastle United \u00a313m; <strong>James Tomkins</strong> West Ham \u00a39.9m; <strong>Steve Mandanda</strong> Marseille Free; <strong>Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my</strong> Chelsea (loan)</p> <p><strong>Out:</strong> <strong>Yannick Bolasie</strong> Everton \u00a325m; <strong>Dwight Gayle</strong> Newcastle United \u00a310m; <strong>Alex McCarthy</strong> Southampton \u00a34m; <strong>Mile Jedinak</strong> Aston Villa \u00a33.2m; <strong>Adrian Mariappa</strong> Watford (free); <strong>Marouane Chamakh</strong>, <strong>Emmanuel Adebayor</strong> Both released; <strong>Brede Hangeland</strong> Retired</p> <h2>Everton</h2> <p>Ronald Koeman\u2019s first summer in charge of Everton revolved around the two big names who wanted away \u2013 John Stones and Romelu Lukaku \u2013 and the club appear to have done well in keeping one and obtaining a handsome fee for the other. Lukaku should be as good as a new signing as long as he commits himself fully to the cause this season, and he will have Enner Valencia to support him in attack after failing to land Moussa Sissoko or Yacine Brahimi, while bringing in Ashley Williams to replace Stones could turn out to be one of the smartest bits of business of the summer. Newcomers Maarten Stekelenburg and Idrissa Gana Gueye have already made a favourable impression at Goodison. Yannick Bolasie was more of a surprise but has all the attacking qualities Everton seek. <strong>PW</strong></p> <p><strong>Major moves</strong></p> <p><strong>In:</strong> <strong>Yannick Bolasie</strong> Crystal Palace \u00a325m; <strong>Ashley Williams</strong> Swansea \u00a312m; <strong>Idrissa Gueye</strong> Aston Villa \u00a37m; <strong>Maarten Stekelenburg</strong> Fulham \u00a3850k; <strong>Enner Valencia</strong> West Ham (loan)</p> <p><strong>Out:</strong> <strong>John Stones</strong> Manchester City \u00a347.5m; <strong>Tim Howard</strong> Colorado Rapids (free); <strong>Steven Pienaar</strong> Sunderland (free); <strong>Leon Osman</strong> Released</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bc77a7837ad59139987e8907cb49e467c2f123f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bc77a7837ad59139987e8907cb49e467c2f123f/0_0_4500_3054/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Everton\u2019s Ashley Williams applauds fans after the match against West Bromwich Albion alongside Yannick Bolasie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"679\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Everton\u2019s Ashley Williams applauds fans after the match against West Bromwich Albion alongside Yannick Bolasie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Hull City</h2> <p>A summer of turmoil featuring Steve Bruce\u2019s departure, several serious injuries and a potential Chinese takeover threatened to produce no signings. Happily for Mike Phelan a collective \u00a317m was belatedly spent on three players \u2013 Ryan Mason, David Marshall and Will Keane \u2013 before the midfielder James Weir joined from Manchester United and the striker Dieumerci Mbokani came in from Norwich on deadline day. The caretaker manager must also have been relieved to see Abel Hern\u00e1ndez, his star striker, stay put in the face of a \u00a320m Aston Villa bid. The squad remain understaffed but Hull\u2019s position no longer looks quite as critical as it did a week ago. <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p> <p><strong>Major moves</strong></p> <p><strong>In:</strong> <strong>Ryan Mason</strong> Tottenham \u00a312.5m; <strong>David Marshall</strong> Cardiff City \u00a33.5m; <strong>Will Keane</strong> Manchester United \u00a31m; <strong>James Weir</strong> Manchester United (undisclosed); <strong>Dieumerci Mbokani</strong> Norwich City (loan); <strong>Markus Henriksen </strong>AZ Alkmaar (loan)</p> <p><strong>Out:</strong> <strong>Mo Diam\u00e9</strong> Newcastle United \u00a34.5m; <strong>Sone Aluko </strong>Fulham (free)</p> <h2>Leicester City</h2> <p>Leicester broke their transfer record three times, first to sign Nampalys Mendy and Ahmed Musa and then on deadline day to bring in Islam Slimani. The one downside for the Premier League champions \u2013 and it came as a major blow to Claudio Ranieri \u2013 was N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9\u2019s departure to Chelsea. Musa and Slimani will give Leicester plenty of attacking options while Mendy has to fill Kant\u00e9\u2019s boots \u2013 good luck with that. A question mark hovers over the quality of their central defensive cover for Wes Morgan and Robert Huth. <strong>SJ</strong></p> <p><strong>Major moves</strong></p> <p><strong>In:</strong> <strong>Islam Slimani</strong> Sporting Lisbon \u00a330m; <strong>Ahmed Musa</strong> CSKA Moscow \u00a316m; <strong>Nampalys Mendy</strong> Nice \u00a313m; <strong>Bartosz Kapustka</strong> Cracovia \u00a34.25m; <strong>Ron-Robert Zieler</strong> Hannover \u00a32.8m; <strong>Luis Hern\u00e1ndez</strong> Sporting Gij\u00f3n (free)</p> <p><strong>Out:</strong> <strong>N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9</strong> Chelsea \u00a330m; <strong>Andrej Kramaric </strong>Hoffenheim \u00a38.5m; <strong>Ritchie De Laet</strong> Aston Villa \u00a31.9m; <strong>G\u00f6khan Inler</strong> Besiktas (undisc)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/aug/31/islam-slimani-leicester-sporting-30m-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xkbk\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2691785\"            data-video-name=\"Islam Slimani joins Leicester from Sporting in \u00a330m move \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.com\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c6acfde4b0df5f040dbf0d\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/31/160831leicester_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/31/160831leicester.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11833798&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/aug/31/islam-slimani-leicester-sporting-30m-video\">Islam Slimani joins Leicester from Sporting in \u00a330m move</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Liverpool</h2> <p>J\u00fcrgen Klopp did most of his business quickly and decisively, bringing in a couple of proven though expensive Premier League performers in Sadio Man\u00e9 and Georginio Wijnaldum, while adding bargains from around Europe such as Loris Karius and Jo\u00ebl Matip. It is the outgoing list that catches the eye at Anfield, however. Only Chelsea have moved on or released as many players, but Liverpool\u2019s departees are better known, with Christian Benteke, Joe Allen, Jordon Ibe and Martin Skrtel among the headliners. While Liverpool still have a large squad their slightly muted start to the season has led to some discussion about whether Klopp has left all his bases fully covered. <strong>PW</strong></p> <p><strong>Major moves</strong></p> <p><strong>In:</strong> <strong>Sadio Man\u00e9</strong> Southampton \u00a330m; <strong>Georginio Wijnaldum</strong> Newcastle United \u00a325m; <strong>Loris Karius</strong> Mainz \u00a34.7m; <strong>Ragnar Klavan</strong> Augsburg \u00a34.25m; <strong>Jo\u00ebl Matip</strong> Schalke (free)</p> <p><strong>Out:</strong> <strong>Christian Benteke</strong> Crystal Palace \u00a327m; <strong>Jordon Ibe</strong> Bournemouth \u00a315m; <strong>Joe Allen</strong> Stoke City \u00a313m; <strong>Martin Skrtel</strong> Fenerbahce \u00a35m; <strong>Luis Alberto</strong> Lazio \u00a34.3m; <strong>Brad Smith</strong> Bournemouth \u00a33m; <strong>Jon Flanagan </strong>Burnley (loan); <strong>Kolo Tour\u00e9 </strong>Celtic (free); <strong>Mario Balotelli </strong>Nice (free); <strong>Lazar Markovic </strong>Sporting Lisbon (loan)</p> <h2>Manchester City</h2> <p>Pep Guardiola can be as happy with his trading as Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is with his at Manchester United. City\u2019s major acquisitions are Leroy San\u00e9, Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, John Stones, Nolito and Claudio Bravo. The last player is the replacement for Joe Hart, whose fall as the No1 goalkeeper and loan to Torino is the story of this window. Out, too, have gone Samir Nasri and Wilfried Bony, also on a loan basis. But it is the Hart-Bravo move that Guardiola may be judged on. If the Chilean proves a bad buy City could struggle. <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> <p><strong>Major moves</strong></p> <p><strong>In:</strong> <strong>John Stones</strong> Everton \u00a347.5m; <strong>Leroy San\u00e9</strong> Schalke \u00a337m; <strong>Gabriel Jesus</strong> Palmeiras \u00a327m; <strong>Ilkay G\u00fcndogan</strong> Borussia Dortmund \u00a321m; <strong>Claudio Bravo</strong> Barcelona \u00a315.4m; <strong>Nolito</strong> Celta Vigo \u00a314m</p> <p><strong>Out:</strong> <strong>Edin Dzeko</strong> Roma \u00a39.5m (loan made permanent); <strong>Wilfried Bony</strong> Stoke City (loan); <strong>Joe Hart</strong> Torino (loan); <strong>Samir Nasri</strong> Sevilla (loan); <strong>Eliaquim Mangala</strong> Valencia (loan); <strong>Mart\u00edn Demichelis</strong> Released; <strong>Richard Wright</strong> Retired; <strong>Jason Denayer </strong>Sunderland (loan)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/01/13-players-who-broke-club-transfer-records-premier-league-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xype\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2692886\"            data-video-name=\"The 13 players who broke club transfer records in the Premier League \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c83178e4b09a68e9b64ca2\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/01/160901transfers2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/01/160901transfers2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11833823&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/01/13-players-who-broke-club-transfer-records-premier-league-video\">The 13 players who broke club transfer records in the Premier League</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Manchester United</h2> <p>Eric Bailly, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Paul Pogba are four headline signings who appear to have significantly strengthened Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s squad as his side\u2019s flying start underlines. The manager identified right-back and centre-half as weak areas but has not added any players in those departments. Still, Mourinho did all his recruitment before the campaign started and the United he is fashioning have pace, power and a win-at-all costs mentality that will remind seasoned United watchers of the best Sir Alex Ferguson XIs. <strong>JJ</strong></p> <p><strong>Major moves</strong></p> <p><strong>In:</strong> <strong>Paul Pogba</strong> Juventus \u00a389.25m; <strong>Eric Bailly</strong> Villarreal \u00a330m; <strong>Henrikh Mkhitaryan</strong> Borussia Dortmund \u00a326m; <strong>Zlatan Ibrahimovic</strong> PSG (free)</p> <p><strong>Out:</strong> <strong>Paddy McNair</strong> Sunderland \u00a35m; <strong>Donald Love</strong> Sunderland \u00a31m; <strong>Will Keane</strong> Hull City \u00a31m; <strong>Guillermo Varela</strong> Eintracht Frankfurt (loan); <strong>James Wilson</strong> Derby County (loan); <strong>Adnan Januzaj</strong> Sunderland (loan); <strong>Cameron Borthwick-Jackson</strong> Wolves (loan); <strong>Nick Powell</strong> Wigan Athletic (free); <strong>V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s</strong> Middlesbrough (free); <strong>James Weir</strong> Hull City (undisc)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/aug/09/pogba-back-home-manchester-united-win-titles-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4q69p\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2642164\"            data-video-name=\"Pogba: I am back home at Manchester United and here to win titles \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"MUTV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57a9cd92e4b0f5d064841c9a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/09/160809pogbaxx_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/09/160809pogbaxx.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/09/160809pogbaxx_V4.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/aug/09/pogba-back-home-manchester-united-win-titles-video\">Pogba: I am back home at Manchester United and here to win titles</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Middlesbrough</h2> <p>By doing the bulk of their transfer business early, Boro have had a chance to bed in newcomers. Aitor Karanka certainly seems quietly content with a window that has left him contemplating strong competition in every position across a well-balanced squad who should be capable of holding their own in the Premier League. While V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s and \u00c1lvaro Negredo are the star imports, Boro appear to have shopped sensibly \u2013 even if many Teessiders will have been saddened to see Albert Adomah, a very popular winger (albeit one who did not always see eye to eye with Karanka) depart for Aston Villa on Wednesday. <strong>LT</strong></p> <p><strong>Major transfers</strong></p> <p><strong>In:</strong> <strong>Marten de Roon</strong> Atalanta \u00a312m; <strong>Viktor Fischer</strong> Ajax \u00a34m; <strong>\u00c1lvaro Negredo</strong> Valencia (loan); <strong>Calum Chambers</strong> Arsenal (loan); <strong>V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s</strong> Manchester United (free); <strong>Brad Guzan</strong> Aston Villa (free); <strong>Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez</strong> Southampton (free); <strong>Adama Traor\u00e9</strong> Aston Villa (undisc)</p> <p><strong>Out:</strong> <strong>Albert Adomah</strong> Aston Villa Part-exchange; <strong>Adam Reach</strong> Sheffield Wednesday (undisc)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0bd706c7d42a3757fd6d7ab4a9ec181b6ca034e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0bd706c7d42a3757fd6d7ab4a9ec181b6ca034e6/0_0_5088_3392/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alvaro Negredo of Middlesbrough tussles with Gareth McAuley of West Bromwich Albion.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alvaro Negredo of Middlesbrough tussles with Gareth McAuley of West Bromwich Albion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Southampton</h2> <p>The window began with yet another round of departures. Ronald Koeman joined Everton, and replacing Sadio Man\u00e9, Victor Wanyama and Graziano Pell\u00e8 has not been easy. However, Southampton broke their transfer record when they signed Lille\u2019s attacking midfielder Sofiane Boufal for \u00a315.9m and, although they look light up front, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Nathan Redmond are promising young talents. <strong>JS</strong></p> <p><strong>Major moves</strong></p> <p><strong>In:</strong> <strong>Sofiane Boufal</strong> Lille \u00a315.9m; <strong>Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg</strong> Bayern Munich \u00a312.75m; <strong>Nathan Redmond</strong> Norwich City \u00a311m; <strong>Alex McCarthy</strong> Crystal Palace \u00a34m; <strong>J\u00e9r\u00e9my Pied</strong> Nice (free)</p> <p><strong>Out:</strong> <strong>Sadio Man\u00e9</strong> Liverpool \u00a330m; <strong>Graziano Pell\u00e8</strong> SD Luneng \u00a312.9m; <strong>Victor Wanyama</strong> Tottenham \u00a311m; <strong>Juanmi</strong> Real Sociedad \u00a34m; <strong>Sam Gallagher</strong> Blackburn Rovers (loan); <strong>Paulo Gazzaniga</strong> Rayo Vallecano (loan); <strong>Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez</strong> Middlesbrough (loan)</p> <h2>Stoke City</h2> <p>This had the makings of a frustrating window for Stoke but a couple of important loan deals on deadline day have changed things. Wilfried Bony\u2019s arrival from Manchester City gives Stoke a genuine goal threat \u2013 something that they have been lacking for a long time \u2013 while Bruno Martins Indi\u2019s loan move from Porto will strengthen central defence. Signing Joe Allen, like Bony a former Swansea player, earlier in the summer was also a very good piece of business. <strong>SJ</strong></p> <p><strong>Major moves</strong></p> <p><strong>In:</strong> <strong>Joe Allen</strong> Liverpool \u00a313m; <strong>Ramadan Sobhi</strong> Ahly \u00a34.3m; <strong>Wilfried Bony</strong> Manchester City (loan); <strong>Bruno Martins Indi</strong> Porto (loan); <strong>Lee Grant</strong> Derby County (loan)</p> <p><strong>Out:</strong> <strong>Marc Wilson</strong> Bournemouth \u00a32m; <strong>Steve Sidwell</strong> Brighton (free); <strong>Peter Odemwingie</strong> Released; <strong>Joselu </strong>Deportivo la Coru\u00f1a (loan)</p> <h2>Sunderland</h2> <p>The hiatus prompted by England\u2019s courtship of Sam Allardyce before David Moyes\u2019s appointment as his successor hardly helped Sunderland\u2019s transfer strategy and they were never on the front foot . Club-record signing Didier Ndong appears a midfield gamble following a series of rebuffs from more experienced options and the squad still look worryingly thin in places, most notably attack where Moyes must dread Jermain Defoe getting injured. Jason Denayer has joined from Manchester City to provide further options in defence. <strong>LT</strong></p> <p><strong>Major moves</strong></p> <p><strong>In:</strong> <strong>Didier Ndong </strong>Lorient \u00a313.6; <strong>Papy Djilobodji </strong>Chelsea \u00a38m; <strong>Paddy McNair</strong> Manchester United \u00a35m; <strong>Donald Love</strong> Manchester United \u00a31m; <strong>Steven Pienaar</strong> Everton (free); <strong>Javier Manquillo</strong> Atl\u00e9tico (loan); <strong>Adnan Januzaj</strong> Manchester United (loan); <strong>Jason Denayer</strong> Manchester City (loan); <strong>Mika</strong> Boavista (undisclosed)</p> <p><strong>Out:</strong> <strong>Youn\u00e8s Kaboul</strong> Watford \u00a33.5m; <strong>Emmanuele Giaccherini</strong> Napoli \u00a31.2m; <strong>Liam Bridcutt</strong> Leeds United \u00a3978k; <strong>Santiago Vergini</strong> Boca Juniors \u00a3765k</p> <h2>Swansea City</h2> <p>What a disappointment. Joe Allen and Wilfried Bony were available this summer, two former players who would have been happy to go back to the Liberty Stadium and, in doing so, would have given everyone at the club a huge lift, yet Swansea missed out on both to Stoke. They badly need the striker Borja Bast\u00f3n, their \u00a315.5m club-record signing, to come good and Fernando Llorente must also weigh in with a few goals. Another concern would be the failure to sign an experienced replacement for Ashley Williams, their former captain. <strong>SJ</strong></p> <p><strong>Major moves</strong></p> <p><strong>In:</strong> <strong>Borja Bast\u00f3n</strong> Atl\u00e9tico \u00a315.5m; <strong>Alfie Mawson</strong> Barnsley \u00a35m; <strong>Fernando Llorente</strong> Sevilla \u00a35m; <strong>Leroy Fer</strong> QPR \u00a33.5m (loan move made permanent)</p> <p><strong>Out:</strong> <strong>Andr\u00e9 Ayew</strong> West Ham \u00a320.5m; <strong>Ashley Williams</strong> Everton \u00a312m; <strong>Alberto Paloschi</strong> Atalanta \u00a35m; <strong>\u00c9der</strong> Lille \u00a33.8m</p> <h2>Tottenham Hotspur</h2> <p>Spurs were always building from a strong base and the additions of Vincent Janssen and Victor Wanyama have served to add more strength in depth. Georges-K\u00e9vin Nkoudou, whose move from Marseille seemed to drag on for weeks, could be an intriguing addition. Mauricio Pochettino will hope Moussa Sissoko, a late \u00a330m purchase from Newcastle from under the noses of Everton, can find the form he showed with France at Euro 2016 rather than return to the up-and-down form he showed at St James\u2019 Park.

Several are familiar names, with Youn\u00e8s Kaboul and Daryl Janmaat providing much-needed experience across the backline but the most exciting business has been in attack. The arrival of Roberto Pereyra from Juventus should boost their firepower in a move partly funded by the sale of Matej Vydra to Derby County. <strong>Tom Morgan</strong></p> <p><strong>Major moves</strong></p> <p><strong>In:</strong> <strong>Isaac Success</strong> Granada \u00a312.7m; <strong>Roberto Pereyra</strong> Juventus \u00a311m; <strong>Sven Kums</strong> Gent \u00a38.5m; <strong>Daryl Janmaat</strong> Newcastle \u00a37.5m; <strong>Christian Kabasele</strong> Genk \u00a35.9m; <strong>Stefano Okaka</strong> Anderlecht \u00a35.1m; <strong>Youn\u00e8s Kaboul</strong> Sunderland \u00a33.5m; <strong>Brice Dja Dj\u00e9dj\u00e9</strong> Marseille \u00a33m; <strong>Adrian Mariappa </strong>C Palace (free); <strong>Kenedy</strong> Chelsea (loan); <strong>Camilo Z\u00fa\u00f1iga </strong>Napoli (loan);</p> <p><strong>Out:</strong> <strong>Matej Vydra</strong> Derby \u00a38m; <strong>Miguel Lay\u00fan </strong>Porto \u00a35.1m; <strong>Almen Abdi</strong> Sheffield Wednesday \u00a33.1m; <strong>Jos\u00e9 Manuel Jurado</strong> Espanyol \u00a31m; <strong>Juanfran</strong> Dep La Coru\u00f1a (free); <strong>Daniel Pudil</strong> Sheff Wed (free); <strong>Gabriele Angella</strong> Udinese (free); <strong>Mario Su\u00e1rez</strong> Valencia (loan); <strong>Obbi Oulare</strong> Waregem (loan); <strong>Steven Berghuis</strong> Feyenoord (loan); <strong>Ikechi Anya</strong> Derby (undisclosed)</p> <h2>West Bromwich Albion</h2> <p>The club-record signing of Nacer Chadli from Tottenham for \u00a313m is the one bright spot during a thoroughly underwhelming window for West Brom. If anything summed up the desperate nature of their transfer business it was the news the unattached forward Hal Robson-Kanu, who had been available all summer, had joined on deadline day. The Watford right-back Allan Nyom arrived in a late deal.

  "<p>Following their meeting on Wednesday, Mexico\u2019s president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, insisted he told Donald Trump, during their meeting in Mexico City, that Mexico would not pay for a border wall between their two countries.</p> <p>\u201cAt the start of the conversation with Donald Trump, I made clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall,\u201d Pe\u00f1a Nieto <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EPN/status/771118159654891520\">tweeted</a>. A spokesman for the Mexican president later told the Guardian that there was no discussion of paying for the wall because Trump did not respond to Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s statement. \u201cThe president told him clearly and the matter was not discussed further.\u201d </p> <p>Trump had told reporters after the meeting that while the pair had discussed a border wall, the topic of who would pay for it did not come up. \u201cWe didn\u2019t discuss payment of the wall. That\u2019ll be for a later date,\u201d Trump said.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign later released a statement that did not directly address the controversy.</p> <p>\u201cToday was the first part of the discussion and a relationship builder between Mr Trump and President Pe\u00f1a Nieto. It was not a negotiation, and that would have been inappropriate. It is unsurprising that they hold two different views on this issue, and we look forward to continuing the conversation.\u201d</p> <p>A Trump source with knowledge of the meeting later added to the Guardian, \u201cboth parties knew each other\u2019s positions going into today, and we didn\u2019t think it was appropriate to start negotiating during this meeting.\u201d</p> <p>Pe\u00f1a Nieto had faced a wave of domestic criticism for inviting Trump to see him at Los Pinos, the residence of the Mexican president. The controversy came just hours after Trump left Mexico City for Arizona, where he was due to hold a major policy speech on immigration that same evening. </p> <p>The two met for an hour and then appeared before reporters to make separate statements about their unusual summit.</p> <p>Speaking at a podium next to Pe\u00f1a Nieto, Trump did his utmost to appear presidential on his second trip abroad and first meeting with a head of state as a candidate. However, in doing so, Trump seemed to continue <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-pena-nieto-immigration-arizona\">the \u201csoftening\u201d of his rhetoric</a> on immigration in advance of his policy speech on the topic, which he was to deliver later on Wednesday night.</p> <p>Speaking at the podium in restrained and almost subdued tones, Trump described undocumented immigrants as those entering the United States \u201cwithout legal authorization\u201d, praised first-, second- and third-generation Mexican Americans as \u201cbeyond reproach\u201d and talked about keeping jobs \u201cin our hemisphere\u201d. This was in addition to Trump\u2019s concession to reporters afterwards that while he had discussed building a border wall with Pe\u00f1a Nieto, he did not even bring up his <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/05/donald-trump-mexico-border-wall-plan-remittances\">signature proposal that Mexico would pay for such a wall</a>. </p> <p>This served as a major contrast to Trump\u2019s fiery and often bombastic tone on the campaign trail. </p> <p>He launched his candidacy in June 2015 by accusing Mexico of deliberately sending criminals and \u201crapists\u201d to the US and has since claimed that a federal judge, Gustavo Curiel, could not do his job impartially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/03/donald-trump-judge-curiel-university-case-biased-mexican\">because of his Mexican heritage</a>. At almost every campaign rally since then, Trump has held a call and response with his rambunctious crowds, asking: \u201cWho is going to pay for the wall?\u201d The shouted answer has invariably been: \u201cMexico.\u201d</p> <p>The Republican nominee has also repeatedly bashed free trade agreements, like Nafta, which he has said allows US workers to lose their jobs to Mexicans; as well as attacking specific companies for shifting their operations to Mexico. </p> <p>While it was speculated that Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who has a 23% approval rating in his own country, might berate Trump for political gain, the Mexican president took a rather restrained stance speaking before his guest. </p> <p>He praised Trump for the \u201copen and constructive\u201d conversation they had. The Mexican president also did not directly criticize any of the controversial and racially charged remarks Trump has made since launching his campaign last year. Rather, Pe\u00f1a Nieto rebutted them indirectly by praising Mexican Americans.</p> <p>\u201cThey are honest people, working people \u2013 they are people that respect family, they respect the life in the community and they are respective of the law. As such, Mexicans deserve everybody\u2019s respect.\u201d Although Pe\u00f1a Nieto pointedly defended Nafta, a longstanding target of ire for Trump, he concede the free trade agreement \u201ccould be improved\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"811c8e5e49aafe501608c2f8f866a26ce747200b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/811c8e5e49aafe501608c2f8f866a26ce747200b/0_472_5362_3218/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump Mexico City\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators hold placards during a protest against the visit of Donald Trump in Mexico City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tomas Bravo/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mexicans reacted with outrage to Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s perceived deference and refusal to be tough with Trump. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t recall a time in the last 50 years when a Mexican president was so thoroughly humiliated in his own home,\u201d said Esteban Illades, editor of the intellectual and current affairs magazine Nexos. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cPe\u00f1a Nieto managed to make Trump look presidential while making himself look incredibly small.

Analysts expect the encounter to diminish Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s popularity even further, especially since many Mexicans were expecting a robust response to a presidential candidate whose protectionist policies could cost Mexico economically. </p> <p>\u201cPe\u00f1a Nieto claims he is just trying to protect Mexicans. How, by welcoming to Mexico the candidate who has portrayed them as the enemy?\u201d said Carlos Bravo Regidor, a journalism professor at the Centre for Research and Teaching in Economics. \u201cThis is more than a diplomatic blunder. This is a mistake of global proportions.\u201d</p> <p>The event was held just hours before Trump\u2019s scheduled speech on immigration in Phoenix, Arizona, and came as the Republican nominee is trying to pivot to appeal to moderate suburban voters that he alienated during his primary campaign. </p> <p>In recent days, Trump has shifted away from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-immigration-policy-deportation\">his calls for \u201ca deportation force\u201d</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/21/donald-trump-deportation-immigration-plan-meeting-latino-leaders\">deporting all 11 million illegal immigrants</a> in the US within two years of taking office. </p> <p>Instead, he has flip-flopped in the past week about a potential path to legal status for undocumented immigrants and attacked the media for even focusing on the issue. </p> <p>\u201cIn recent days, the media \u2013 as it usually does \u2013 has missed the whole point on immigration. All the media wants to talk about is the 11 million or more people here illegally,\u201d Trump told voters in Iowa on Saturday.</p> <p>The campaign heralded Trump\u2019s trip, where he was accompanied by Alabama senator Jeff Sessions and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani as a sign of Trump\u2019s statesmanship. </p> <p>In a statement, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, Mike Pence, said: \u201cWhat the American people are seeing today is the kind of decisive president Donald J Trump will be. This meeting begins a relationship where we can talk about the issues we\u2019ve got to resolve between the United States and Mexico, as well as the issues we have in common.\u201d</p> <p>It didn\u2019t publicize this statesmanship as much as it could have. Trump\u2019s campaign intentionally left the traveling press corps in the United States and prevented reporters from coming along, something the campaign treasurer, Jeff DeWit, bragged about at the campaign rally in Phoenix on Wednesday night.</p> <p>John Podesta, the chair of the Clinton campaign, mocked Trump for not pressing for Mexico to pay for the border wall in his meeting with Pe\u00f1a Nieto. </p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump has made his outlandish policy of forcing Mexico to pay for his giant wall the centerpiece of his campaign,\u201d said Podesta. \u201cBut at the first opportunity to make good on his offensive campaign promises, Trump choked. What we saw today from a man who claims to be the ultimate \u2018deal maker\u2019 is that he doesn\u2019t have the courage to advocate for his campaign promises when he\u2019s not in front of a friendly crowd.\u201d</p> <p> After Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s tweet, Podesta revised his statement: \u201cIt turns out Trump didn\u2019t just choke, he got beat in the room and lied about it.\u201d</p>",

His availability had sparked interest from over 20 clubs from England and abroad, though Wilshere considered the offers from Bournemouth, Crystal Palace, Roma and Milan at length.</p> <p>While he was willing to move overseas and spoke with the former Tottenham Hotspur director of football, Franco Baldini, who is now working as a transfer consultant for Roma about a move, Arsenal rejected the proposal put forward by the Italian club. Regardless, it was the proposals from the two Premier League clubs which the 24-year-old considered the most appealing after talks with Eddie Howe and Alan Pardew respectively on Tuesday. Arsenal would not countenance his departure to a club they consider a direct rival for a top four finish.</p> <p>Palace had appeared to be in pole position to secure the player, who has been omitted from Sam Allardyce\u2019s first England squad despite being in Roy Hodgson\u2019s party for Euro 2016. Yet, with Wilshere having not completed a full 90 minutes in a Premier League game since September 2014, it is understood the south London club were seeking to pay only a proportion of the player\u2019s \u00a390,000-a-week wages.</p> <p>Bournemouth, in contrast, are to meet the player\u2019s entire salary, making a move to the Vitality stadium more appealing to Arsenal. The player travelled down to the south coast club on Wednesday afternoon. Arsenal have sold Serge Gnabry to Werder Bremen, with the Germany Olympic player suggesting he was moving to the Bundesliga \u201cto get playing time, to develop further and to help the team\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43bc54791ad7dc80c1a2b17a893b3ded371aeb31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43bc54791ad7dc80c1a2b17a893b3ded371aeb31/0_196_2329_1397/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Wilshere\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Wilshere will sign on loan for Bournemouth, subject to passing a medical.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Davy/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c70e5de4b0f6cb85628b1a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T17:10:31.154Z\">6.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Some Celtic news ...</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Celtic defender Emilio Izaguirre has failed in his efforts to find himself a new club and will be staying with the Scottish champions until January.

Whether Valencia is the answer, is another matter. Over to you for the verdict on that one, Mr Steinberg. Leo Ulloa was on Swansea\u2019s list of targets earlier in the summer but I was told yesterday that he\u2019s not being considered now. Understand Ulloa\u2019s representatives held talks with Leicester about his future first thing this morning. Seems certain to go and has options in the Premier League (Sunderland) and in Spain.</p> <p><em>To answer your question, Stu, Enner Valencia had a promising start at West Ham, scoring that stunner at Hull and linking up well with Diafra Sakho. But he looked lost whenever he played without the more muscular Sakho and suffered a bad knee injury last summer.

The England midfielder has offers from virtually half the Premier League to consider - Arsenal will not countenance him moving to a direct rival for a top four place - as well as Roma, Celtic and Valencia from abroad. But, with a young family, he may be more enticed by the prospect of moving to Palace, Bournemouth or Watford.</p> <p>The south London club are privately hopeful a deal will be concluded today and, with Yohan Cabaye having withdrawn from the France squad with a knee injury which is still being assessed, he will be needed in a side desperately lacking in creativity.

Brahimi moved to Porto in 2014 for around \u00a35m, although 80% of that fee was paid by investment group Doyen Sports. </p> <p>Capable of playing on either wing or in the No10 role, Brahimi scored seven league goals in both of his two seasons in Portugal. He is currently on international duty with Algeria ahead of their African Nations Cup qualifier against Lesotho. </p> <p>Despite reports in Italy on Tuesday that Everton\u2019s had ended their interest in Gabbiadini, it is understood that a deal could still be reached for the Italy striker.

  "<p>Chelsea\u2019s summer-long pursuit of defensive reinforcements prompted an outlay close to \u00a360m on transfer deadline day, with the eye-catching return of David Luiz from Paris Saint-Germain complementing Marcos Alonso\u2019s arrival from Fiorentina.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/31/tottenham-moussa-sissoko-everton-newcastle\">Tottenham gazump Everton and land Moussa Sissoko for \u00a330m</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Antonio Conte, exasperated at seeing interest in players such as Napoli\u2019s Kalidou Koulibaly and Alessio Romagnoli of Milan rejected, gave the green light to the return of David Luiz for \u00a334m, with further fees due in future, after it emerged the Brazil international had become unsettled at PSG. The centre-half was expecting to find himself demoted behind his compatriots Marquinhos and Thiago Silva at Parc des Princes and, two years after departing for France in a deal potentially worth \u00a350m, he made clear his desire to return to London.</p> <p>The 29-year-old has signed a three-year contract at Stamford Bridge, where he claimed the FA Cup, Champions League and Europa League during a three-and-a-half-year spell under the stewardships of Carlo Ancelotti, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, Roberto Di Matteo, Rafael Ben\u00edtez and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho.</p> <p>There had initially been reluctance among some members of the hierarchy at Chelsea to bring David Luiz back to the club, with PSG sounded out over Marquinhos and a possible loan move for Aymen Abdennour at Valencia also explored, but Conte, so desperate to add to his options and frustrated in the Italian market, eventually expressed a willingness to restore the Brazilian to the ranks. That prompted a formal approach to PSG.</p> <p>The centre-half has always been a favourite with the Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, and played 143 times for the club in that first spell. Chelsea received encouragement from the player this week and, eventually, from the Parisian club, after an offer worth \u00a330m had been knocked back. The player\u2019s agent, Kia Joorabchian, has worked closely with Chelsea in the past on other deals \u2013 not least over Ramires, Alex, Kenedy, Oscar and Matt Miazga \u2013 in partnership with Giuliano Bertolucci \u2013 with agreement eventually reached with PSG for the improved fee late on Wednesday afternoon.</p> <p>There is an acceptance David Luiz\u2019s defending can be erratic at times but his performance, despite carrying an injury, in the 2012 Champions League final against Bayern Munich has marked him out as a significant figure in Chelsea\u2019s recent past, with his reputation not damaged by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/mar/12/david-luiz-brazilian-psg-chelsea-champions-league\" title=\"\">his eagerness to celebrate scoring against Chelsea for PSG in the Champions League in 2015</a>. He is experienced, knows the Premier League and his presence would allow Conte to explore the possibility of playing three centre-halves, a system he utilised at Juventus and with Italy. The Brazilian\u2019s charisma and influence off the pitch have been missed over the past two years.</p> <p>Alonso, a left-back, has signed a five-year contract after Chelsea reached agreement with Fiorentina over a \u00a323m move for the former Bolton Wanderers and Sunderland defender. The Italian\u2019s arrival takes Chelsea\u2019s spending on left-backs to around \u00a357m since Ashley Cole departed in the summer of 2014, albeit with some of that money recouped when Filipe Lu\u00eds returned to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very happy: it\u2019s a step up in my career and I think this is the perfect place for me to continue developing,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to win some titles. It was an easy decision to make when I heard the club were interested. My family and close friends know Chelsea is the club I have dreamed about playing for, so I\u2019m really excited about the challenge and I\u2019m looking forward to working with my new team-mates.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/aug/31/transfer-deadline-day-news-jack-wilshere-shkodran-mustafi-and-more-live\">Transfer news: Hart, Nasri and Bony leave City, Chelsea bid for David Luiz \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chelsea, who rejected an inquiry for Milan as to the availability of Cesc F\u00e0bregas, have also continued to clear players from the fringes of the club, with Juan Cuadrado completing a return to Juventus, where he spent last season, on a three-year loan with an option to buy. The intricacies of the deal will effectively see the Colombia forward join for an annual fee of \u20ac5m (\u00a34.25m) with Juve having the option to buy him permanently but also obliged to complete a deal for \u20ac25m, minus the loan fees already paid, if certain clauses are triggered by appearances. A further fee of \u20ac4m would be applicable dependent on the club\u2019s success with Cuadrado in their ranks.</p> <p>Christian Atsu has joined Newcastle, Jake Clarke-Salter and Charlie Colkett have moved to Bristol Rovers, Islam Feruz to Royal Mouscron, Cristian Cuevas to Sint-Truidense, Miazga to Vitesse Arnhem and Kenneth Omeruo has moved to Alanyaspor, all on season-long loan moves.

  "<p>The smell in the autopsy room is indescribable. It lingers on your clothes and in your hair long after you leave. Staff are constantly cleaning the linoleum floors and wiping down every surface with harsh disinfectants.

They learn the intricacies of their job on site. Without them, the office would cease to function. They are the ones dispatched to collect the bodies for autopsy. They are often the first people from the office a family encounters when grieving. </p> <h2>Being the doctor\u2019s doctor</h2> <p>In addition to the medical examiners, there are x-ray technicians who scan for bullets and broken bones; DNA and toxicology laboratory staff; consulting dentists for matching dental records for identification; anthropologists who specialize in discovering the race, age and height of skeletal remains and figuring out what tools caused blunt force traumas; mortuary technicians who assist with autopsies; a variety of administrators; death scene investigators; and professional photographers who take careful photos of every autopsy for detailed record keeping.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/29/space-travel-side-effects-scott-kelly-nasa-mars-astronauts-ross-3-mins\">Heart disease, depression and blindness \u2013 the hazards of deep space travel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the photographers on staff also takes professional photos of food, Hammers tells me with a smile. </p> <p>While the doctors examine the body and determine the cause of death, the technicians do a lot of careful and very skilled cutting to assist them.

When he first started, he dreaded touching bodies and entering strangers\u2019 homes. It was fear of the unknown, he explains. But these days, working as a lead technician, there is little left unknown when it comes to the dead. </p> <p>Daniels was on the job during 9/11. He also responded to Flight 587, which crashed in Queens in November 2001, killing everyone on board. That time created his worst memories of the job. But it also gave him the greatest sense of the work\u2019s importance: none of those families would otherwise have had closure. He now \u201cloves the job\u201d, he says.</p> <h2>The case that hits home</h2> <p>No matter how long they have been working at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, and how many bodies they have seen, everyone has a case that hits home.</p> <p>For Barbara Sampson, the chief medical examiner for New York City, it was a 9/11 case. The terror attack on 9/11, which Sampson refers to as the biggest homicide in US history, was a difficult time for all of the staff at the office. They worked round the clock to identify bodies, and the images they saw still haunt most of them fifteen years later.</p> <p>Identification often had to be done from DNA analysis of fragments of remains and is still ongoing as new DNA techniques are discovered.</p> <p>One particular case sticks out for Sampson: a Belgian man who died during the collapse of the World Trade Center towers. His parents were elderly, and while they knew that he had died, without official scientific confirmation, they could not get closure. His remains had not been identified. They were afraid they would pass away never having his death confirmed.</p> <p>Two years ago, Sampson\u2019s office was able to identify the Belgian man\u2019s remains through DNA analysis. \u201cI had the honor of telling them we had found their son. That was one of the most incredible experiences of my life,\u201d she says. Thirteen years after 9/11, the parents could finally put their son to rest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0accecd2c47f0d2b40275b03c3474aa19efe01e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0accecd2c47f0d2b40275b03c3474aa19efe01e1/0_29_1400_840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Office work station in the Brooklyn office of Chief Medical Examiner of New York\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The desk of the Deputy Chief Medical Examiner</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Zucker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Aglae Charlot, an elegant senior medical examiner with a pronounced French accent who has worked at the office since 1987, it was a teenage girl who came in a few years back. The girl died in the hospital of an unusual illness, from which her mother also suffered. The illness can be idiopathic or caused by Aids. The hospital had assumed it was idiopathic since the mother had the same illness.</p> <p>When Charlot investigated, she found the teenager did actually have Aids, which she must have been suffering from for five or six years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/30/sitting-down-too-much-health-costs-economy\">New study finds sitting down too much costs the world $67.5bn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Upon further investigation, she discovered the mother\u2019s boyfriend had died of Aids. </p> <p>Infecting a child and causing her death is murder, she explains to me, her jaw tensing. Charlot knew she could probably trace the particular strain of Aids back to the boyfriend, but what would it change? He was dead, so could not be charged, and it would only cause more pain for the living. She put Aids as the cause of death on the certificate, and left it at that.</p> <h2><strong>Seeing the lighter side</strong></h2> <p>\u201cWe all have an odd sense of humor,\u201d says Christopher Borck, a bearded young medical examiner sitting in front of a file cabinet covered by photos of his wife and two young children. \u201cWe are often smiling, and I think you have to when you are surrounded by this every day.\u201d</p> <p>In Hammers\u2019s office, her crooked playfulness is on display in a framed, fake blood-spattered sign above her desk that reads: \u201cBraainns.\u201d</p> <p>Humor can provide a release in an environment that is fraught with stress. \u201cOne of the things a lot of people don\u2019t realize is that we deal with the living just as much as we deal with the dead,\u201d says Borck. \u201cWe provide answers to families.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce3afd9793e21ede2c22b2b403d830a2cd6bb146\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce3afd9793e21ede2c22b2b403d830a2cd6bb146/0_84_1400_840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Check out station at Morgue in the office of Chief Medical Examiner of New York in Brooklyn, NY\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Check out station at the morgue</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Zucker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much of the week is spent performing autopsies, and the rest of it filling out paperwork, testifying in court and speaking with the families of the dead.</p> <p>At a time when primary care physicians rarely have more than two minutes to speak with a living patient, it\u2019s strange somehow that the medical examiners can spend hours explaining their findings to the families, comforting them and helping them deal with their grief.</p> <p>\u201cEvery family really wants to know what happened to their loved one and have their questions answered in order to have closure,\u201d says Hammers. \u201cEven if it is a hard answer like in the case of a suicide, it wouldn\u2019t be what they prefer to hear but it allows them to have an answer and then work their grief around that and move through it.\u201d</p> <p>As Borck puts it, when it comes to the deceased: \u201cWe are their last physicians.\u201d</p>",

More than half thought world poverty was rising, against 10% who thought it falling. It was the same in the US.</p> <p>Norberg points out that every index of global improvement \u2013 measuring starvation, poverty, child mortality, literacy, women\u2019s education, democracy, violence, death in war \u2013 shows a steady upward graph. It is easy to retort, \u201cBut what about Syria and the Congo?\u201d When an argument is general, the objection must be general.</p> <p>What exercises Norberg is that progress deniers risk generating what he&#xa0;calls \u201cnativist backlash\u201d.

Now that the remainers\u2019 Project Fear has been shown to be exaggerated, Brexit must tone down its own gloom. It must see some virtue in European co-operation, and build a new relationship of continental trust. Given the recent past, this will be a hard sell, but sold it must be. Optimism must become a strategy.</p> <p>A running theme of Norberg\u2019s book is the dependence of such political argument on the media. He is right.

In the case of bird flu, the diversion of medical resources was said to have caused more deaths than the epidemic itself.</p> <p>By far the most positive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/nov/19/better-angels-nature-steven-pinker-review\" title=\"\">sign of humanity\u2019s advance is the decline in global violence</a>, on a state and personal level. The cognitive scientist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/steven-pinker\" title=\"\">Steven Pinker</a> attributes this to historical evolutions. These include nations becoming inherently more \u201cpacifist\u201d, the \u201cfeminising\u201d of politics, the growing power of reason and \u201cthe expanding circle of sympathy\u201d. He, like Norberg, is puzzled by the potency of pessimism.</p> <p>My optimistic future sees the post-digital age as putting live experience back at the centre of human activity. Machines will serve humans ever more efficiently, but not enslave us, as Harari miserably predicts. But that is the future. Optimism\u2019s trump card is the past and present. It is facts. These too can lie, but those who say so must prove it.</p>",
  "<p>This was compelling political theatre. On Wednesday Theresa May sent the country a message about authority. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/no-staying-in-eu-by-back-door-theresa-may-brexit\">Summoning the cabinet to Chequers</a> and then summoning the television cameras to record her opening statement, she was saying unmistakably: \u201cKeep calm and remember who\u2019s boss.\u201d</p> <p>But the pith of her short message \u2013 no covert attempt to stay inside the EU, no second referendum \u2013 made clear which side she is coming down on, despite No 10\u2019s \u201cmotherhood and apple pie\u201d briefing that Britain\u2019s future relationship with Europe will involve controls on immigration and be good for trade. The simple truth is that much as we may want access to the single market with no free movement of labour, that is not, and never will be, on offer. By promising to push ahead so firmly with no second referendum and no early general election, May has given comfort to the hardline cabinet Brexiteers.</p> <p>We know now that her first priority is Conservative unity, even above an easy election victory. Some Tory commentators and politicians are horrified that she has not chosen to go to the country early. Labour, they say, is in a worse state to fight an election than for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_(UK)\">35 years</a>, riven from top to bottom. This is the moment to strike, they plead. You shouldn\u2019t waste chances like this.</p> <p>But May is a cool customer, and she has decided to play long. I assume that during <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/12/theresa-may-seeks-peace-and-quiet-on-alpine-walking-holiday\">her Alpine walking holiday</a> she concluded that she has nothing to fear from other parties and everything to fear from her own.</p> <p>If, as the polls strongly suggest, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourleadership\">Jeremy Corbyn wins the Labour leadership again</a>, there will be moves in the parliamentary Labour party for a breakaway, plunging constituency parties into the turmoil of loyalty oaths and feuds. If (unlikely, I know) it\u2019s Owen Smith, the base and the leadership will be at war. Either way, it doesn\u2019t seem likely that the official opposition will grow more appealing or stronger in the next few years. Let them stew and twist, seems to be May\u2019s approach.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/31/theresa-may-tells-cabinet-no-back-door-attempts-to-stay-in-eu-brexit-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xkgk\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2691920\"            data-video-name=\"Theresa May tells cabinet 'no back door attempts to stay in EU' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c6c1a5e4b0df5f040dbf5f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/31/160831Cabinet_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/31/160831Cabinet_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/31/160831Cabinet.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/31/theresa-may-tells-cabinet-no-back-door-attempts-to-stay-in-eu-brexit-video\">Theresa May tells cabinet \u2018no back door attempts to stay in EU\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>This has profoundly disturbing implications. We have a one-party hegemony. The prime minister, looking around for sources of serious political pushback, knows they are inside her party. The momentum isn\u2019t coming from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/08/momentum-corbyns-shock-troops-labour\">Momentum</a>: it\u2019s all from the right.</p> <p>And they are riding high on recent good economic news, which helps the narrative that Brexit was a triumph of popular common sense. However, consumer confidence and employment figures mean nothing yet.</p> <p>Until new tariffs start to bite, until major <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/london-city-eu-passport-brexit\">City players unable to get their \u201cpassporting\u201d deals</a> to continue trading inside the EU start to leave London, until there are concrete examples of major investment being withheld, we can\u2019t begin to assess what leaving the EU actually means for our long-term prosperity. Declaring Brexit a triumph now is like punching the air with delight because you\u2019ve beaten the field in the first 100 yards of a 10-mile race.</p> <p>Does May understand this? Maybe she does. And perhaps what she\u2019s doing is carefully giving rope to the hard right, so they can hang themselves. Plenty of time \u2013 no election yet, no \u201cbackdoor\u201d EU membership \u2013 let\u2019s see what Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox actually come back with from their negotiations. If it\u2019s grim for business and prosperity by the time of a 2020 general election, the right will be discredited.</p> <p>However, there is a darker possibility, which is that May isn\u2019t playing a tactical game; that she has accepted their agenda. In normal political times the not insignificant number of Tory MPs who don\u2019t like Brexit would be able to argue for delay, for another chance for the electorate to have their say, pointing out that getting the terms of Brexit wrong would be a gift to Labour.</p> <p>But at the moment, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/aug/31/corbyn-labour-leadership-yougov-poll-leadership-with-increased-majority-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57c6c6c2e4b0df5f040dbf89#block-57c6c6c2e4b0df5f040dbf89\">opinion polling suggesting</a> a future Tory majority of well over 100 seats, there is no political pressure at all. Labour\u2019s rhetoric about \u201ctaking the fight to the Tories\u201d seems merely forlorn.</p> <p>The Tories are waiting and watching for a Jeremy Corbyn victory followed by the deselections of \u201cBlairites\u201d and moderates. Labour\u2019s battles will be vicious and local, and will leave lasting scars across the political landscape. There is no chance that it will all be healed, forgotten and forgiven by 2020.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/no-staying-in-eu-by-back-door-theresa-may-brexit\">No staying in the EU by the back door, says Theresa May</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But if the Labour centre-right decides to break away and form a new party then the Tories are in an even better position. Across most constituencies, the anti-Tory vote would be divided at least three ways \u2013 Corbynite Labour, the new party and the Liberal Democrats \u2013 perhaps with the Greens challenging too. Under our first-past-the-post system, with the Tories facing such a divided opposition the result would be slaughter.</p> <p>And then, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/28/boundary-review-changes-affect-200-labour-party-seats-robert-hayward-report\">as the Guardian revealed</a> at the weekend, there is the potentially devastating effect of the boundary changes, which can\u2019t really be brought in before an early election but will radically tilt the field by 2020. We are, in short, lacking the usual checks and balances that parliamentary politics normally provides. We are going into the huge Brexit experiment with the tiller of state tied fast in a single position, without proper parliamentary opposition and under a new leader who has only to look in one direction to maintain her position.</p> <p>That\u2019s what May\u2019s political theatre on Wednesday implied. Perhaps she was playing a cynical political game \u2013 but I fear she wasn\u2019t.</p>",

  "<p>The impeachment of Dilma Rousseff is not just the story of one woman, who in her youth bravely fought dictatorship, rose to become president and has now been ushered from power amid an unprecedented country-wide corruption scandal. It is also the story of a nation: South America\u2019s largest country, once applauded for its growing influence and its fight against poverty, now struggling with political tensions that have up-ended the 13-year rule of its Workers\u2019 party (brought to prominence by Ms Rousseff\u2019s charismatic predecessor and mentor, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva). It is equally a tale of today\u2019s shifting global landscape, in which powers that just years ago were celebrated as \u201cemerging\u201d and likely to reshape the world find themselves confronted by difficulties rooted in economic downturns and flawed governance.</p> <p>Brazil\u2019s senate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/31/dilma-rousseff-impeached-president-brazilian-senate-michel-temer\">voted 61 to 20 for her removal</a> today. That her ousting had the hallmarks of a personal tragedy is hard to dispute. There were tears and shows of anger, as Ms Rousseff <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/29/brazil-president-dilma-rousseff-impeachment-trial\">put up an epic fight</a> against what she and her supporters have consistently called a \u201ccoup\u201d, but her many critics described as the logical outcome of a long, constitutional process aimed at clearing the graft and unaccountability that have too long dominated Brazilian politics. Emotions were high as Ms Rousseff drew parallels with the way she had endured torture under Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship. \u201cI won\u2019t abandon the principles that have guided me,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a coup, it\u2019s democracy in evolution,\u201d one opposition senator answered back.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/aug/30/brazilian-president-dilma-rousseffs-impeachment-trial-video-explainer\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xjmb\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2691344\"            data-video-name=\"Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff impeached \u2013 video explainer\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c5a44de4b0f6cb856287cb\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/31/160831RoussffImpeached_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/31/160831RoussffImpeached.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/31/160831RoussffImpeached_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/aug/30/brazilian-president-dilma-rousseffs-impeachment-trial-video-explainer\">Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff impeached</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It is hard to overlook a degree of unfairness in this brutal downfall: Ms Rousseff never stood accused of personally benefiting from corruption (she was on trial for window-dressing state budget figures), unlike dozens of Brazilian officials and politicians \u2013 many of whom voted for her removal. That the crisis has come to this cathartic moment says perhaps as much about an \u201cevolving\u201d democracy as about the cynicism of some of its elites, much exposed by the Petrobras and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/31/lava-jato-brazilian-anti-corruption-minister-quits-over-secret-recording\">Lavo Jato</a> corruption investigations.</p> <p>This has been a downwards slide for Brazil. In 2010, when Ms Rousseff was first elected, Brazil was the seventh-largest economy in the world and widely recognised as a power on the rise. It wanted to display its accomplishments as host of the 2014 World Cup and this summer\u2019s Olympic Games. Its successes in reducing inequalities made it a model for the global south. But the collapse of commodity prices halted a decade-long export boom \u2013 and social tensions, mass street demonstrations (triggered by bus fare rises in 2013) and popular discontent, including among the new middle classes, emerged. That the opposition to her Workers\u2019 party capitalised on these frustrations is unsurprising. But to say Brazil\u2019s rightwing forces emerged looking \u201ccleaner\u201d than the government when financial dealings and vast political kickback schemes were uncovered would be a stretch of the imagination.</p> <p>Brazil\u2019s crisis in some ways resembles those of other \u201cdeveloping\u201d countries where governance issues and economic setbacks have led to political tensions: witness the difficulties of South Africa\u2019s ANC or the anti-corruption campaigns waged by China\u2019s autocratic leader. None of this can be a consolation for Ms Rousseff, nor will it erase the mistakes she made as a leader. But to ascribe all of Brazil\u2019s ills to one woman, or think they will disappear with one vote, would be both simplistic and disingenuous.</p> <p>Many of those happy to see her thrown from office are the very people who hope that, as a result, they will be spared the attention of anti-corruption judges. Brazil is now a highly polarised nation and its citizens are deeply divided, but they want a political class that can restore the public confidence needed to address the country\u2019s many challenges. Whether the new president Michel Temer \u2013 who had led the attacks against Ms Rousseff \u2013 can deliver on those expectations is the next daunting question.</p>",
  "<p>I am outraged that Apple is outraged by&#xa0;its tax bill (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\" title=\"\">Apple rages at EU\u2019s \u20ac13bn tax demand</a>, 31 August). Apple has hundreds of stores in Europe to sell its products. The message to Apple is very simple: if any of your stores catch fire, don\u2019t bother to call the fire service. If&#xa0;you are burgled, don\u2019t call the police. If&#xa0;you want to deliver your products using public roads, you can\u2019t. If someone falls off a ladder in one of your stores, don\u2019t call the medical services.</p> <p>If you do not want to pay your taxes, fine. But do not expect to use the infrastructure paid for by our taxes.<br><strong>Neil Holmes</strong><br><em>Bromsgrove, Worcestershire</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is counterintuitive that Ireland should benefit from the \u20ac13bn tax, given that the Irish government knowingly set up the scheme to reduce the taxes paid to the rest of the EU. With the current solution, Ireland gets the historic benefits of employment and the&#xa0;unexpected future benefit of the tax. Sharing the \u20ac13bn across the countries where Apple products were sold and profits made would correct the wrong that is implied by the ruling.<br><strong>Paul Morrison</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The Irish government has been told to collect \u20ac13bn from Apple. But it is to appeal against the decision. Can someone please explain why?<br><strong>Ian Reissmann</strong><br><em>Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Even before the crash it was possible to see weaknesses in the Irish economy. Any economy that grows at the runaway rate that Ireland did for many years usually suffers a major damaging correction in due course. And when you have a freakishly high proportion of GDP being given to property speculation (higher even than the UK\u2019s), you have a recipe for disaster. In addition the OECD points out that Ireland\u2019s GDP (national output) is significantly greater than its GNP (national income) due to the repatriation of profits and royalties by multinational firms \u2013 to say nothing of the nameplate presences in Dublin, there merely for tax purposes and with a&#xa0;skeleton staff.</p> <p>Ireland may well have a skilled, hi-tech workforce, but this is no use if the country goes into boom and bust and you have paid for your workers\u2019 training only to lose them abroad. What&#xa0;a pity that the country didn\u2019t have some skilled economic advisers as&#xa0;well. They could have pointed out that copying the UK\u2019s model merely leads to&#xa0;disaster and a race to the bottom.</p> <p>Forget the Apple tax squabble for the moment. Ireland might be advised to take an economic health check and ask whether the Anglo-Saxon model is the way to go.<br><strong>David Redshaw</strong><br><em>Gravesend, Kent</em></p> <p>\u2022 Had Apple not offshored and arranged a sweetheart deal with Ireland to avoid US and EU taxes, thus amassing a huge cash pile, it would not be in this situation. And had the US tax authorities chased it aggressively, we would all be much better off. Apple is very greedy. It makes 40% gross profit from overpricing its products, exploiting their designer-label status, and all on the backs of underpaid Chinese workers. This is the true face of neoliberal global capitalism.<br><strong>Michael Miller</strong><br><em>Sheffield</em></p> <p>\u2022 The story of Apple\u2019s sweetheart Irish tax deals shows that something is deeply flawed in the way we currently do business. While we should not tar all multinationals with the same brush, we have undoubtedly seen a concentration of power and profit in fewer and fewer hands, allowing companies to set the rules and play the system.</p> <p>How the UK government acts now is crucial is establishing what kind of nation and economy we want to be. In&#xa0;the face of increasing pressure to turn the UK ever more into a tax haven, Theresa May needs to note that there are alternatives. The UK is home to about 70,000 social enterprises. They are growing faster than other businesses, reinvest profits to tackle social and environmental challenges, and contribute over \u00a324bn to the economy. They are keeping money in local communities and creating employment opportunities. There is even a social enterprise alternative to the iPhone, the Fairphone.</p> <p>For every bad Apple there is a social enterprise showing how business can act responsibly.<br><strong>Peter Holbrook</strong><br><em>Chief executive, Social Enterprise UK</em></p> <p>\u2022 Of course Apple is protesting about having to pay proper tax. It is in the nature of large corporations to do so. But thank goodness it looks as though the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/france-demands-end-to-ttip-trade-talks-matthias-fekl\" title=\"\">may be ditched</a>, with Germany, France and both US presidential candidates against it. If TTIP were in operation then Apple could take the EU&#xa0;to a court biased in favour of the corporation merely on the grounds that&#xa0;EU policy was reducing its profits.<br><strong>Michael McLoughlin</strong><br><em>Wallington, Surrey </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",
  "<p>Rafael Behr is absolutely right that the owners and providers of the global electronic infrastructure believe they can operate without either paying taxes or taking responsibility for the safety of their product (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/30/tech-giants-power-tax-apple-google\" title=\"\">Tech giants know where the power lies</a>, 31 August). The elements of that infrastructure, analogous to aircraft and airlines, leave gaping holes that allow access to hackers, virus-makers, pornographers and other criminals. Their \u201cairports\u201d \u2013 service providers \u2013 have no security scans for illegal material. All of them provide passage to&#xa0;the dark web. No wonder their profits are so enormous, for they take all the benefits of global markets without assuming any of the responsibility for basic safety and security standards. If they spent the resources they should to develop and provide secure systems, and to give users safe products the way other manufacturers have to, they might at the same time prevent some of the vicious invective that does so much harm to private individuals on social media.<br><strong>Anna Hodgetts</strong><br><em>Burgess Hill, West Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Rafael Behr is wrong to claim that giant technological corporations possess power that goes beyond the control of elected governments. What they do have is the power to defy weak government \u2013 a situation common in Europe, where the prevailing neoliberal doctrine states that the best societies have small and weak governments. It was the member governments of the EU that created the legislation that enabled the technological giants to avoid taxes. Only recently George Osborne with his patent box legislation gave additional opportunities for these companies to avoid tax. This contrasts to the situation in China, where all of these companies have had to kow-tow to the strong government if they wish to engage in trade. Google struck a self-censorship deal with Beijing so it could continue operating. Where there is the political will these companies can be brought to heel.</p> <p>In the case Behr cites as an example of the power of Apple, where it &#xa0;refused to accede to the request of the &#xa0;FBI to unlock the operating system of a terrorist\u2019s phone, the FBI was able to employ hackers to break into the phone. The outcome may have been very different if the FBI had failed to break into that phone. It is quite possible that Washington would have introduced a law compelling Apple to give the FBI access to its operating system.</p> <p>These companies don\u2019t seem to realise that what governments give they can take away.

The people he empowered and the structures he put in place mean the menace of Isis will continue without him.</p> <p>Since 2014, Adnani had been the voice who galvanised so-called lone wolves to launch attacks. He had also overseen the deployment of some of the group\u2019s most lethally trained operatives, many of whom have been sent to Europe to wait for instructions to launch more co-ordinated missions, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/20/brussels-bombings-osama-krayem-suspect-charged-role-paris-attacks\">those that struck Paris and Brussels</a>.</p> <p>Global savagery had become Adnani\u2019s calling card. Operating with more autonomy than most other leaders, he had ensured the group could still make its mark even as the territory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/11/islamic-state-has-lost-grip-on-12-of-territory-in-six-months-study\">it held shrank rapidly</a>.</p> <p>The foreign operations file was given to him by the Isis leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/06/mosul-video-purports-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-islamic-state\">Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a>, in as early as 2014. By then he was already the group\u2019s leader in Syria, one of two centres of gravity for Isis, the other being Mosul in Iraq.</p> <p>The heady early months of Isis\u2019s rise kept Adnani focused on consolidating gains in Syria until mid-2015, by which time land it held in both countries was being steadily stripped from its control. Population groups had started to flee en masse, many leaving for Europe on the migrant route, and out of chaos, Isis, led by Adnani and Baghdadi, sensed opportunity.</p> <p>Adnani, as well as another senior Iraqi member of the group, was responsible for smuggling militants disguised as refugees to Europe. Intelligence services in the UK, France, Germany and elsewhere believe the number of operatives to be at least 200. The fraught job of tracking the whereabouts of militants who left their home countries for Iraq and Syria has left European spies fearing the actual number may be substantially higher.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f7c8375cf7b6dbaca08c7b43db675cf755cb948\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f7c8375cf7b6dbaca08c7b43db675cf755cb948/48_408_2918_1750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iraqi fighter during clashes with Isis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Iraqi Shia fighter fires artillery during clashes with Isis State militants near Falluja, Iraq.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since late last year, Adnani had spent much of his time plotting attacks abroad. He is believed to have had direct links to the Paris cell and is also thought to have had a hand in Brussels and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/29/istanbul-ataturk-airport-attack-turkey-declares-day-of-mourning\">the strike on Istanbul\u2019s Atat\u00fcrk airport</a> in June.</p> <p>By then the group had lost an estimated 35,000-50,000 of its fighters, many of them jihadis who had travelled to join them. A stock take of the group\u2019s fortunes makes for grim reading for those who remain.</p> <p>More than 10 senior members of its two organising bodies, the shura and military councils, have been killed by airstrikes in the past 18 months. The toll on more junior members \u2013 mid-ranking commissioned officers in military terms \u2013 has been substantially higher.</p> <p>What to make of morale within the group is exercising military and intelligence chiefs ahead of what they believe will be a defining push against Mosul mooted for early next year. With Iraq\u2019s national army making surprising ground from the south and the Kurds holding positions to the north, and victories in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/26/falluja-iraq-fully-liberated-from-isis\">three other Iraqi cities</a> already up their sleeve, Mosul appears to be a less formidable target than it was a year ago.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2016/jan/08/us-led-airstrikes-against-islamic-state-syria-iraq-interactive-isis\">US-led airstrikes against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Isis\u2019s days as a standalone military force appear numbered. However, the group\u2019s ideological appeal is harder to defeat in a region that continues to offer little political buy-in for disenfranchised Sunni Muslims. A large part of Isis\u2019s appeal, even among communities that do not share its implacable take on Islam, is that it offers support in the absence of any other organised system.</p> <p>Adnani was one of the last last leftovers of the original alumni that had adopted a de facto role as protector of the region\u2019s Sunni Muslims. He was among the few surviving leaders with personal links to the group\u2019s founder, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jun/09/guardianobituaries.alqaida\">Abu Musab al-Zarqawi</a>, who moulded the most ruthless group of modern times from the resentment that steamed from the ousting of Saddam Hussein.</p> <p>Military men who had lost all when the Iraqi dictator fell were central to all subsequent incarnations of Isis. They blended their own strategic calculations with the zealotry of the Zarqawi\u2019ists, laying the ground for Isis\u2019s success and in doing so creating the most capable enemy that the west has seen for decades.</p> <p>Adnani had championed an expansion of Isis at any cost. His legacy will be written far from the northern Syrian town of al-Bab where a suspected US airstrike finally caught up with him.</p>",
  "<p>Most scientific experts agree that data from the initial trial badger culling areas in Gloucestershire, Somerset and Dorset do not justify further extension of culling (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/30/badger-cull-areas-more-than-triple-under-new-government-licences\" title=\"\">Scientists criticise badger cull extension</a>, 31 August). In ignoring this advice, and extending culling to five new areas, the government risks not only wasting much money but also giving farmers false hope that the approach will contribute to reducing TB in cattle. The initial trial areas were set up to test whether free-range shooting could be done humanely and at the same time reduce badger populations by at least 70% \u2013 the figure previously established as the level needed to achieve a significant reduction in TB in cattle.</p> <p>The government was able to announce last year that it had achieved its culling targets, but only because they were based on unrealistically low badger population estimates \u2013 not on the central or best estimate value, but on the lowest bound value of the statistical margin of error around this estimate. This was simply a fudge. In none of these exercises did it achieve a 70% reduction based on the most likely population estimate.</p> <p>As Professor Woodroffe, one of the scientists involved in the original 10-year badger culling trials, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-34089606\" title=\"\">put it</a>: \u201cSetting the targets in this way gives a small possibility of reducing badger numbers by 70%, but a much smaller reduction is much more likely.\u201d</p> <p>Non-achievement of culling targets not only risks the whole exercise being futile but might actually increase the infection rate in cattle due to the wider ranging of surviving badgers within the culling areas.</p> <p>Bovine TB has been declining since the introduction of stricter pre-movement testing of cattle in 2007-08, so it is difficult to tell what effect the culling is having on disease incidence within and around the culling areas. Nevertheless, contrary to anecdotal evidence from farmers, the only detailed analysis published so far showed no significant effect over the first two years.</p> <p>An honest government would admit that the culling methodology doesn\u2019t work and abandon it altogether. Failing this, an alternative would be to complete the initially planned four years of culling in the existing areas, basing targets on the most realistic population estimates, and then to follow up with a detailed analysis of the results before deciding whether to extend or discontinue culling.<br><strong>Dr Francis Kirkham</strong><br><em>Crediton, Devon</em></p> <p>\u2022 The pointless ineffective badger cull is not only being extended but is no longer to be independently monitored. Is this because previous monitoring found the cull was inhumane and not effective? As the slaughtered badgers are not tested for TB, how can any conclusions be drawn? The farming lobby and its leaders, such as the NFU, are not and never have been interested in scientific findings and instead come out with such ridiculous statements as \u201cwe can\u2019t be seen to be doing nothing\u201d though what they are doing appears to be compounding and worsening the problem.</p> <p>Who are these \u201clicensed shooters\u201d who will be wandering around our countryside at night, and furthermore who actually licenses them? We need to know a lot more about what is actually going on. Why no mention of a cattle vaccine that could be in place quickly and would put an end to all this cruelty and inefficiency which is at the taxpayer\u2019s expense, or is that again a solution that is too scientific?

  "<p>London\u2019s traditional elite, such as lawyers, architects and academics, are being pushed out of their enclaves in Mayfair, Chelsea and Hampstead by an influx of global super rich investors, causing a chain reaction of gentrification across the capital, according to research by the London School of Economics.</p> <p>An influx of extremely wealthy overseas buyers is leading the old elite to sell up and move from London\u2019s most exclusive postcodes and buy in areas they previously considered undesirable, said Dr Luna Glucksberg, of the <a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/InternationalInequalities/Home.aspx\">LSE\u2019s International Inequalities Institute</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/06/battle-rages-for-soul-of-highgate\">Fenced off: how London\u2019s super-rich are destroying the soul of their community</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This displacement of old money and affluent middle class professionals is in turn pricing neighbourhoods in south and east London out of the reach of average Londoners and threatening to push those on low incomes to the margins of the city and beyond, she added.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe changes happening at the top end of the market are real, and although they do not affect large numbers of people directly, the ripple effects they generate do resonate across London,\u201d Glucksberg said.</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of the impact on London as a whole, this represents a very different kind of \u2018trickle down\u2019 effect from what politicians across the spectrum have long argued would be the benefit of the \u2018super rich moving into our city\u2019,\u201d said Glucksberg. \u201cAffordability for average Londoners in the rest of the city is likely to become an even more difficult issue to solve.\u201d</p> <p>The trend was contributing to dramatic house price rises in areas ranging from Battersea and Clapham to Acton, as the old elite bought property there with the significant profits \u2013 usually in the millions \u2013 made from selling up to the global uber wealthy, the researcher found.</p> <p>\u201cThe study shows that the wealthy individuals and families that live in London\u2019s most exclusive areas no longer feel able to compete at the top end of the capital\u2019s property market,\u201d said the researcher. \u201cInstead they feel like they are being pushed out of elite neighbourhoods. For the first time, this elite group are buying flats for their children in areas they never would have previously considered.\u201d</p> <p>Glucksberg, who previously spent seven years researching London\u2019s most deprived estates, said while the displacement of wealthy residents might not inspire sympathy the trend illustrated the deep social impact of the global super rich on the city. </p> <p>\u201cIf wealthy Londoners feel powerless to resist the global super rich what hope do the women of Focus E15 have?\u201d she posed, referring to the young mothers from Newham who were threatened with eviction from their hostel and advised they would be resettled as far away as Birmingham or Manchester.</p> <p>The researcher added that international buyers of luxury high rise apartments did not want social housing on site and developers did everything to shift social tenants elsewhere.</p> <p>London is home to around 4,900 \u201cultra-high net worth\u201d individuals, with assets of at least \u00a323m, a rise of 39% in the past decade, according to the latest <a href=\"http://www.knightfrank.com/wealthreport\">wealth report by estate agents Knight Frank</a>. In central London, overseas buyers bought as much as 85% of \u201cprime\u2019\u201d properties worth at least \u00a35m in 2012-13 and nearly all those worth more than \u00a310m, according to estate agents LPP.</p> <p>One family interviewed for the research, presented on Wednesday at the <a href=\"http://www.rgs.org/WhatsOn/ConferencesAndSeminars/Annual+International+Conference/Annual+international+conference.htm\">Royal Geographical Society annual international conference</a>, said they had recently sold their home in South Kensington to an international banker and were moving out of London. But they had helped their son buy a house in Acton.</p> <p>\u201cThe consequences are clearly further property price increases, gentrification and ultimately displacement in areas of London that are not \u2018elite\u2019 or prime at all,\u201d Glucksberg said.</p> <p>This process of displacement by Middle Eastern, Asian and East European buyers was leading to feelings of \u201cboth overt and covert racism\u201d, she added.</p> <p>The study, part of a <a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2013/01/27/life-in-the-alpha-territory-investigating-londons-super-rich-neighbourhoods/\">two-year investigation of London\u2019s elite neighbourhoods</a>, also found the old elites felt driven out of their traditional enclaves by the impact of the global super rich on the local environment, such as the proliferation of mega-basements, which led to considerable distress for longstanding residents. Glucksberg said a university lecturer in Highgate told her they were unable to cope with the years of drilling and digging under neighbouring houses.</p> <p>Karen Buck, MP for Westminster North, who has dealt with dozens of cases of neighbours affected by iceberg basements (where so much of the home is hidden underground), said: \u201cIt is profoundly damaging to the fabric of London life when the people who make up the city\u2019s workforce are priced out or see their children priced out of London. It leads to sterile communities and neighbourhoods that are scarcely lived in.\u201d</p> <p>Richard Webber, managing director of data analytics firm OriginsInfo.Ltd, who co-authored <a href=\"http://research.gold.ac.uk/14533/1/PDF_Proof.PDF\">a report on the impact of the super rich on Highgate</a>, said the displacement of middle class professionals also contributed to the decline of high end local shops and services. </p> <p>He said: \u201cThe old elite would have bought their curtains and food locally. Now the hairdresser comes to you, the food is delivered. Even going to restaurants \u2013 chefs come and cook [for the super rich] in their house.\u201d</p>",

It is down to me to prove I am good enough in a position where competition for places is fierce.\u201d</p> <p>Te\u2019o does not hold back when it comes to the global calendar debate. \u201cIt has to be sorted out because the season is all over the place,\u201d he says. \u201cTour matches are always played when one side is at the end of its season and worn out. I know it is a winter sport but sometimes you need to change things. People do not want to watch crap rugby, scrum after scrum, knock-ons and penalties.

With the Earth\u2019s known rock record only extending around 4.2bn years, the site is home to some of the world\u2019s older rocks. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a300e5e15166d62f168e35f1eb92e2e2b8640d09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a300e5e15166d62f168e35f1eb92e2e2b8640d09/0_0_999_1198/834.jpg\" alt=\"The stromatolites in figure a are from Greenland; those in c and d are younger stromatolites from Western Australia.

Isua rocks are metamorphic - they formed from sedimentary rocks that have been subjected to intense heat and pressure - conditions that typically deform the rocks. That, the authors say, made the discovery of stromatolites something of a surprise. \u201cWe were not exactly expecting to see them,\u201d said Friend, who with Nutman has been studying Greenland\u2019s rocks for more than 35 years.</p> <p>Fortunately, the team had a stroke of luck. A snow patch had melted, exposing an outcrop that still contained evidence of features from its sedimentary past. </p> <p>Visible on the surface of the rock, but extending deeper within it, the newly discovered stromatolites are peak-like structures 1-4cm in height; some dome-like, some more akin to the shape of a shark\u2019s tooth. These structure form from a build-up of very thin layers, produced by microbial communities as they trap and bind sediment or cause carbonate to be deposited from surrounding water. \u201cSediment is being trapped by algae or bacteria, or a combination of both,\u201d said Friend. \u201cYou can find similar things in Australia currently forming in Shark Bay.\u201d</p> <p>While the nature of the microbes in question remains unknown, the researchers say they would have had a watery existence. \u201cWe know that\u2019s true because the sediments themselves wouldn\u2019t form unless they were in water,\u201d said Friend, adding that other evidence from the rocks suggests that the water was most likely to have been shallow.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/10/the-vital-question-nick-lane-review\">Nick Lane</a>, an evolutionary biochemist from University College, London, said that the finding ties in with <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18825275-800-young-earth-not-as-hellish-as-we-thought/\">recent revelations</a> that the Hadean - an eon that ended around 4bn years ago - was probably not the hellish environment it was previously thought.</p> <p>\u201cThis idea of the Earth as being bombarded by meteorites and, basically, volcanoes and [having] no water, has kind of evaporated so now we have a rather modern-looking planet with global oceans and some land going back several hundred million years before these fossils were found,\u201d said Lane. </p> <p>While Lane says it is surprising to have found stromatolites in the Greenland rocks, he believes the conditions on Earth 3.7bn years ago make it far from astonishing that life could have been present. Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/oct/19/life-on-earth-began-300m-years-earlier-than-previously-thought\">recent discoveries</a> have offered tantalising suggestions that organisms could have been around 4.1bn years ago, while the authors note that so-called \u201cgenetic molecular clocks\u201d also suggest that life is likely to have emerged around that time.</p> <p>\u201cThis is really just another piece of evidence that suggests that the world was far more comfortable, if you like, for life as we know it on a global scale than you would perhaps read in even quite recent books,\u201d said Lane of the new discovery. </p> <p>But while the authors say the shape of the newly discovered structures, together with clues from their chemical make-up and signs of layers within them, suggests that they were formed by microbes, not everyone is convinced.</p> <p>Robert Riding, of the University of Tennessee says while the similarities of the structures to younger, better-preserved, stromatolites from Australia are intriguing, the poor preservation of the rocks throws doubt on whether the structures were indeed produced by living organisms as opposed to physical processes.</p> <p>\u201cThese examples underscore the problem that we really have not yet found sufficiently well-preserved very old - i.e., between 3500 and 4000 million (3.5 and 4bn) year - sediments to be confident that what we are seeing could definitely be regarded as stromatolites,\u201d he said. But, he adds, \u201cIt is completely plausible that we could find stromatolites in rocks of Isua age, and perhaps even older, because available evidence suggests that the Earth\u2019s surface at that time already had conditions suitable for microbial life. We just need to find well-preserved sediments of that age to be really sure.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/14/rebuild-world-after-apocalypse-lewis-dartnell\">Lewis Dartnell</a>, an astrobiologist at the University of Westminster, says that if the newly discovered structures are indeed stromatolites, the authors have \u201cstruck gold\u201d given that plate tectonics and metamorphism of rocks typically destroys such structures.<br></p> <p>\u201cTrying to understand such ancient life on our own planet is greatly complicated by the geological activity of the Earth, and the destruction of old crust by plate tectonics and metamorphism of rocks that overwrites many signs of life,\u201d he said. \u201cThese stromatolites don\u2019t tell us much about the chemistry or environment of how life originally got started on Earth, but they do indicate the presence of biology in a shallow sea 3.7bn years ago.\u201d</p> <p>Dartnell agrees that the discovery could help researchers explore whether life was once present on other planets. \u201cThe Martian surface today is very cold and dry, but around the time that these ancient layered rocks formed in Greenland, Mars was itself a much warmer and wetter, and thus habitable planet,\u201d he said. While finding stromatolites with robotic landers or even manned missions is likely to be challenging, says Dartnell, if stromatolites are present, they could offer a wealth of information. \u201cOn Mars, we\u2019d expect stromatolites, even as old as 3.5-3.8 billion years, to be better preserved than on Earth as Mars hasn\u2019t experienced geological processes like plate tectonics,\u201d he said.</p> <ul> <li>The caption on the main picture erroneously referred to the stromatolites pictured as as fossils previously thought to be the world\u2019s oldest.

  "<p>When you put tequila and cars side-by-side, the story doesn\u2019t usually end well. But Ford is trying to change the narrative.</p> <p>The car manufacturer has plans to introduce a new kind of plastic for some of its automobile parts using waste material generated by Jose Cuervo, the tequila manufacturer. Tequila is made by juicing the heart of an agave plant, a spiky desert succulent with a core composed of very strong fibers. These fibers are left over during the juicing process, and are usually thrown away or burned.</p> <p>Now, Ford hopes to use these agave fibers to create a so-called bioplastic to replace synthetic materials, such as fiberglass, which are used to strengthen plastic components in cars \u2013 things such as storage bins, air-conditioning ducts and fuse boxes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/25/wool-shoes-green-footwear-ugg-allbirds-glerups\">Would you wear wool shoes to save the environment?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bioplastics are an old class of materials, invented after <a href=\"http://cell.sites.acs.org/anselmepayenaward.htm\">Anselme Payen</a>, a French chemist, discovered cellulose in 1838 \u2013 a compound in many plants that can be made into fibers. By the late 1800s, cellulose from plants was being used to make rayon and viscose fabrics, as well as cellulose acetate photographic film, or safety film, designed to replace highly flammable nitrate film. Carmaker Henry Ford became an early champion, developing soybean-based plastic auto parts in the 1940s.</p> <p>Ford began using a soy-based foam in seat cushions for the Mustang coupe in 2001, a material produced from crop waste on soybean fields in the Midwest. It is now used in every vehicle Ford makes in North America, and has also been adopted by the mattress industry.</p> <p>Later, in 2010, the car manufacturer looked at using plastics produced with wheat straw in the Flex SUV, which is manufactured in Ontario, Canada. The straw was previously burned by Canadian farmers because the climate was too cold to compost it. It was adopted as a reinforcing material in automobile plastics to replace talc, which must be mined.</p> <p>Agave fibers will serve the same purpose in a new hybrid plastic. The fibers are extremely strong and resilient, and have been used for centuries by indigenous people in both the US and Mexico for sewing and weaving, and for making rope.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of companies around the world that are looking at agave fibers,\u201d says <a href=\"http://dgrewell.public.iastate.edu/\">David Grewell</a>, an associate professor at Iowa State University and also director of the <a href=\"http://www.cb2.iastate.edu/index.html\">Center for Bioplastics and Biocomposites</a>, a National Science Foundation research center.</p> <p>\u201cThe fibers themselves are relatively flexible, so that when they go through processing equipment, they are able to retain their strength. They don\u2019t break and they\u2019re relatively tough. Unlike glass fibers, which tend to be relatively brittle and not able to absorb energy.\u201d</p> <p>Ford hopes to begin using the new bioplastic made from agave at its factory in Hermosillo, Mexico, where it builds the Fusion and Lincoln MKZ sedans, within a year or two.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb3244ac0a9c92cb7e98faa6f5c40d369d0907f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb3244ac0a9c92cb7e98faa6f5c40d369d0907f0/52_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Agave fibers are put into a processing machine at a Ford lab.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Agave fibers are put into a processing machine at a Ford lab.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ford</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard of the farm-to-table movement in food,\u201d says Debbie Mielewski, Ford\u2019s senior technical leader of sustainable products. \u201cThis is sort of the same kind of thinking, where you would look at the local farms and see what kind of things could be incorporated into our products. We call it farm-to-car.\u201d</p> <p>Bioplastics may sound natural, but there is some controversy about how they break down. Many people make the assumption that because bioplastics contain natural materials, they must also be recyclable or compostable \u2013 or both. Whether either of these is possible generally depends upon what makes up the plastic substitute in the final material.</p> <p>Frederick Michel, <a href=\"http://fic.osu.edu/members/directory/m/michel-frederick.html\">an associate professor of food, agriculture and biological engineering at Ohio State University</a>, notes that despite robust recycling programs in the US, most plastics still end up as garbage in a landfill. So a new product\u2019s fate in that environment is important to consider. Michel says Ford\u2019s new material can\u2019t be considered a true bioplastic, because the agave fibers are merely a strengthening filler mixed with a petroleum based plastic, not one derived from natural materials.</p> <p>\u201cIf [bioplastics] are made from carbon from the atmosphere, and do not degrade in the landfill, then they can sequester atmospheric carbon and reduce global warming,\u201d Michel says. \u201cIf they do biodegrade in the landfill, they form methane, which is a greenhouse gas 20-30 times worse than carbon dioxide. So it depends.\u201d</p> <p>One example of a petroleum based bioplastic is the <a href=\"http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/plantbottle-frequently-asked-questions\">PlantBottle</a> developed by Coca-Cola in 2009. Some 30% of the material comes from sugar cane, the remaining 70% is petroleum derived. The company has been gradually phasing in the use of this material, and expects all its plastic bottles to use it by 2020.</p> <p>Ford has collaborated with Coca-Cola in the past to use PlantBottle material on a <a href=\"http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/driving-innovation-coca-cola-and-ford-take-plantbottle-technology-beyond-packaging\">trial basis</a> in seat fabrics.</p> <p>Mielewski says Ford\u2019s tests with the agave bioplastic have switched 30% of the strengthening material in the bioplastic to agave fibers, while the rest remains either fiberglass or talc. The balance of the material is a petroleum-derived plastic.</p> <p>She said the company has not yet found a bioplastic that lasts long enough in car parts. Most biodegrade too quickly, yielding a shorter lifespan than the car itself.</p> <p>\u201cThe advantage with switching out fiberglass with agave is the agave is more recyclable,\u201d she says. \u201cThe fiber doesn\u2019t break when remolding, so there is potential there to reuse it in the same product.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/06/eating-insects-food-grubbly-farms-sustainable-seafood-startups\">Let them eat bugs: US startup sees future of sustainable food in creepy crawlies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Possibly the most direct advantage, Mielewski says, is improved fuel efficiency. A typical car totes around some 400lbs of plastic, she says. Plastics made with plants tend to be about 20% lighter, potentially cutting 80-100lbs off a car\u2019s weight. That\u2019s enough, she says, to produce a measurable drop in fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>Across the 2.6m vehicles sold by Ford in 2015, this has the potential to significantly reduce the company\u2019s carbon emissions.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/experts/darby-hoover\">Darby Hoover</a>, a senior resource specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, praised Ford for focusing on agricultural waste, rather than virgin materials. There are 5bn metric tons of agricultural waste produced globally every year, Hoover says, so reusing more of this is important to the planet. It is also preferable to growing a plant specifically to make plastic, which takes land and other resources out of food production.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely true that you\u2019re avoiding impacts that likely would happen if that agave waste were not repurposed,\u201d Hoover says. \u201cAll of that would create near term carbon emissions. So finding ways to repurpose those into products is commendable.\u201d</p>",

The spokesperson said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister chaired political cabinet at Chequers this afternoon.</p> <p>The meeting began with a discussion led by Patrick McLoughlin. He spoke about the strength of the Conservative party, with membership growing by almost 50,000 over the summer. Looking ahead to conference he announced the largest attendance in over a decade and that the theme would be \u201cA country that works for everyone\u201d. The prime minister added this reflected the fact that we are a united party and a united government, getting on with the job of delivering on the issues that British people care about. This was contrasted with the inward looking and divided opposition.</p> <p>It was agreed that the opening day of conference would be about global Britain - showing that we are more outward looking than ever before. In a discussion about Brexit the PM said that there were two related imperatives: getting the best deal for people at home, and getting the right deal for Britain abroad.</p> <p>There was a strong emphasis on pushing ahead to article 50 to lead Britain successfully out of the European Union - with no need for a parliamentary vote.</p> <p>Furthermore, several cabinet members made it clear that we are leaving the EU but not leaving Europe, with a decisive view that the model we are seeking is one unique to the United Kingdom and not an off the shelf solution. This must mean controls on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe but also a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services.</p> <p>On the agenda and discussed at length was the commitment to the devolved nations to make sure that Brexit works for all - but cabinet members were clear that it is the United Kingdom\u2019s government\u2019s decision to establish its terms and on when to trigger article 50.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>The cabinet has agreed that getting a Brexit deal that will allow the UK to control immigration will take precedence over getting a deal that gives full access to the single market.</strong> That is the implication of the statement that the deal \u201cmust mean controls on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe but also a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services.\u201d The word \u201ccontrols\u201d is specific; the phrase \u201cpositive outcome\u201d is vague, and could mean very little.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>MPs will not get a vote on the decision to invoke article 50, triggering the formal two-year EU withdrawal process, the cabinet has confirmed.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be consulted over Brexit, but will not get a veto, the cabinet has confirmed.</strong></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01031b4f94d43a585fce05decca7af8c85eeb354\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01031b4f94d43a585fce05decca7af8c85eeb354/0_63_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May addressing cabinet at Chequers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May addressing cabinet at Chequers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T16:26:42.111Z\">at 5.26pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c6f66de4b0f6cb85628ace\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T15:25:56.972Z\">4.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I\u2019m told there was more said about Brexit at the political cabinet.

This is from the prime minister\u2019s spokeswoman.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister chaired cabinet at Chequers this morning. After the usual update from the Leaders of the Commons and the Lords on parliamentary business, the discussion moved on to the economy.</p> <p>The chancellor provided cabinet colleagues with an update on the economic outlook. The cabinet reiterated the government\u2019s commitment to fiscal discipline and living within our means. Ministers agreed that we should be seizing the opportunity of Brexit to confirm the UK\u2019s place as one of the great trading nations in the world, fostering entrepreneurialism and setting out a long term vision for the country. They also agreed on the vital need to increase productivity and the importance of doing more to foster economic growth and industrial development in regions up and down the country.<br></p> <p>The foreign secretary then provided an update on the campaign to defeat Daesh in Syria, Iraq and Libya and the UK\u2019s role in supporting political progress in all three countries. The foreign secretary highlighted the progress that had been made in squeezing the territory held by Daesh, with 40% reclaimed, as well as a fall in support for Daesh\u2019s ideology around the world. The cabinet agreed that Islamist terrorism continues to be one of the greatest security threats we face and therefore we must continue to work closely with our allies to defeat Daesh and to support strong, stable governance in countries around the world, particularly in countries where terrorists are trying to establish safe havens.<br></p> <p>Conversations continued after lunch during a meeting of the political cabinet.</p> </blockquote> <p>This morning, in her opening remarks, Theresa May said cabinet would discuss \u201cthe next steps\u201d to be taken in relation to Brexit. (See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/aug/31/corbyn-labour-leadership-yougov-poll-leadership-with-increased-majority-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57c6acf5e4b0f6cb8562899d#block-57c6acf5e4b0f6cb8562899d\"> 11.26am.)</a> But this statement says very little about this, beyond saying the government wants Britain to remain \u201cone of the great trading nations in the world\u201d. At this stage (I have not had any further briefing yet) it is not clear whether that is because ministers did not agree anything meaningful on the next stage of Brexit, or whether they did but are just choosing to keep it all secret. May says \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d but that\u2019s just circular logic. As for what it really means, that remains as much of a mystery as ever.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T15:18:57.192Z\">at 4.18pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c6ee01e4b04fe839bc5292\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T15:03:52.600Z\">4.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Corbyn proposes 'gender audit' of Labour policies</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At an event at Unison HQ later this afternoon <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> will be announcing proposals to benefit women. His team have just emailed out the details. </p> <p>His plans include having a regular \u201cgender audit\u201d of Labour policies, setting up a new women\u2019s advisory board to advise the leader and toughening the law (in a manner so far unspecified) on online harrassment.</p> <p>Here are the key announcements from the news release.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> <strong>Increasing women\u2019s representation in our society, democracy and party</strong> by supporting all women shortlists to achieve 50:50 representation in parliament and the same aim for all public offices; supporting a policy-making annual Labour women\u2019s conference; publishing a regular \u2018gender audit\u2019 of Labour policies; and consult on establishing a high level, strategic women\u2019s advisory board linked to the leader\u2019s office to ensure women are at the heart of our policies, and to support the shadow secretary of state for women and equalities, along with advisory boards on other equality strands.</p> <p><strong>Investing in an economy that delivers for women. </strong>Austerity isn\u2019t working and has disproportionately harmed women. Our public investment strategy will provide a foundation for the economy to grow, and from which to properly fund and democratise our public services and end the cuts that women, as the majority of public service users and workforce, have borne the brunt of. Labour will ensure increased recruitment of women into science, technology, engineering and manufacturing occupations and will tackle occupational segregation in our economy. Labour will also give enhanced powers to the Equality and Human Rights Commission to penalise companies that do not publish detailed gender pay data at a company-wide level as part of tackling equal pay issues.</p> <p><strong>Tackling sexual harassment and threats online</strong> through a wide-ranging consultation exercise on how to strengthen the law and its implementation and increase organisations\u2019 responsibility towards promoting safe and respectful \u2018community standards\u2019 online. Within the party we will take forward the recommendations of the Shami Chakrabarti Inquiry to consult on and introduce a wider equal opportunities policy, training and guidance for members and staff, recognising that online abuse is often also racist and homophobic in nature as well as misogynistic.</p> </blockquote> <p>Some of these proposals (for example, on equal pay audits) are similar or identical to what Corbyn proposed in his <a href=\"https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/jeremyforlabour/pages/87/attachments/original/1438076296/WorkingWithWomen.pdf?1438076296\">Working with Women policy paper (pdf)</a> in last year\u2019s leadership contest, but in some respects Corbyn is now going further. For example, last year he spoke of wanting to ensure 50% of Labour MPs were women. Now he is talking of aiming to get 50/50 male/female representation \u201cfor all public offices\u201d.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c6e450e4b0f6cb85628a89\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T14:10:48.995Z\">3.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On the World at One <strong>Jacob Rees-Mogg</strong>, the Conservative backbencher, explained why hardline Brexiteers like himself were opposed to Britain remaining in the single market.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think the expectation or desire to remain in the single market is basically code for rejecting the referendum result. The single market is the engine room of EU regulation; it\u2019s the requirement for free movement of people that comes with it that has put people off the European Union, and so I think any effort to keep us within the single market is basically rejecting the referendum result.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also dismissed claims that the government would have difficulty deciding Brexit policy because the three leading Brexit ministers - Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, David Davis, the Brexit secretary, and Liam Fox, the international trade secretary - do not get on. It would be fine, he suggested, because they were all \u201caffable personalities\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They\u2019re three strong but enormously affable personalities.

You can also just about hear him come out with a half-hearted cheer (more like a \u2018yurggh\u2019) as May says there must be no attempts to stay in the EU by the back door <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/28/boris-johnson-eu-referendum-double-strategy-vote\">(even though this was a strategy Johnson himself seemed to be backing last year.)</a></p> <p>May seemed to be speaking off the cuff, rather than from notes.

It\u2019s our first opportunity to meet since the summer recess, but also the first opportunity for us to meet since the fantastic success of the GB Team at the Olympics \u2013 absolutely great. And also the Paralympics will be starting very soon, so we wish our Paralympic athletes all the very best and success there as well.</p> <p>But obviously over the summer \u2013 over the last few weeks \u2013 quite a lot of work has been done. We\u2019re going to be having an opportunity today to discuss this. We will have an update on Brexit; we\u2019ll be looking at the next steps that we need to take, and we\u2019ll also be looking at the opportunities that are now open to us as we forge a new role for the UK in the world. We must continue to be very clear that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d, that we\u2019re going to make a success of it. That means there\u2019s no second referendum; no attempts to sort of stay in the EU by the back door; that we\u2019re actually going to deliver on this.</p> <p>We\u2019re also going to talk this morning about social reform. We want to be a government and a country that works for everyone, and we\u2019ll be talking about some of the steps that we need to take in order to build that society that works for everyone. And I want it to be a society where it\u2019s the talent that you have and how hard you\u2019re prepared to work that determines how you get on, rather than your background.</p> <p>We\u2019ll be having an update on the state of the economy. We\u2019ll be looking at how we can work to increase productivity \u2013 that\u2019s one of the key issues that we want to address. But also how we can get tough on irresponsible behaviour in big business \u2013 again making sure that actually everyone is able to share in the country\u2019s prosperity.</p> <p>We will be looking at the legislative programme that we have coming up in parliament. And we\u2019ll also be hearing a political update from the party chairman, particularly as we look forward to our party conference.</p> <p>So quite a packed agenda for our meeting today. But can I just remind everybody that this really is a very significant moment for the country, as we look ahead to the next steps that we need to take. We have the opportunity to forge a new positive role for the UK in the world; to make sure that we are that government and country that works for everyone \u2013 that everyone can share in the country\u2019s prosperity. So there are challenges ahead but it\u2019s an important and significant moment for us and I think we have real opportunities to develop the United Kingdom and ensure that it does work for everyone in the UK.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c69c2fe4b0f6cb85628973\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T10:04:14.395Z\">11.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">YouGov's Labour leadership poll - 10 findings from the small print</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As promised, here is more from the detail of the YouGov poll. I posted the key findings at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/aug/31/corbyn-labour-leadership-yougov-poll-leadership-with-increased-majority-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57c685f6e4b0f6cb85628930#block-57c685f6e4b0f6cb85628930\">9.02am</a>. Here are 10 more findings from the survey.</p> <p><strong>1 - Corbyn\u2019s key strength is that he is seen as \u201cprincipled\u201d.</strong> Some 76% of the Labour selectorate said they saw him this way. He also scored well for honesty (64%) and for \u201cshares my political outlook\u201d 58%. But only 33% of the Labour selectorate as a whole said he was likely to lead the party to victory at the election, and only 35% said he was competent. This is from the New Statesman\u2019s<strong> Stephen Bush.</strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/stephenkb/status/770741279336570880\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hard to sustain from these numbers that Labour members are &quot;mad&quot; or in denial about Corbyn&#39;s failings. <a href=\"https://t.co/iVBpT8K48g\">pic.twitter.com/iVBpT8K48g</a></p>&mdash; Stephen Bush (@stephenkb) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephenkb/status/770741279336570880\">August 30, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>People planning to vote for Corbyn in the contest were more likely to rate his competence and electability, but even amongst this group only 56% said he was likely to lead the party to victory, and only 60% said he was competent.</p> <p><strong>2 - Smith\u2019s key strength is that he is seen as \u201ccompetent\u201d.</strong> But only 30% of the Labour selectorate said they saw him as competent - a remarkably low figure, given that he has put this trait at the centre of his leadership campaign. His biggest weakness is that he is seen as \u201cuntrustworthy\u201d - by 45% of those voting in the contest.</p> <p><strong>3 - Smith is seen as even less likely than Corbyn to lead Labour to victory at the general election by those voting in the contest.</strong> Only 12% of them said they thought Smith was likely to win the general election for the party. And even amongst those planning to vote for Smith the figure was only 33%.</p> <p><strong>4 - Women seem to be more pro-Corbyn than men. </strong>The YouGov crosstabs have 67% of female members of the Labour selectorate backing Corbyn, but only 57% of men. Crosstab findings are less reliable than the headline poll findings (because they involve a smaller sample), but a 10-point gap is quite big, and so some gender gap is probably real. During the campaign <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/2016/07/four-times-owen-smith-has-made-sexist-comments\">Smith has been accused of sexism,</a> and Corbyn\u2019s advantage with women may be a result.</p> <p><strong>5 - Corbyn\u2019s support is broadly consistent amongst all age groups. </strong>It is often assumed that his backing comes from the young. But the crosstabs (in so far as they are reliable - see above) suggest age is not a factor in his support. His ratings are 61% amongst 18 to 24-year-olds, 64% amongst 25 to 39-year-olds, 63% amongst 40 to 59-year-olds and 57% amongst over-60s.</p> <p><strong>6 - A majority of Labour members are in favour of getting rid of the nuclear deterrent. </strong>Some 53% of those voting in the leadership contest, and 52% of those voting because they are full party members, think Britain should get rid of nuclear missiles. Only 23% of party members favour full Trident renewal, while another 14% of members favour replacing the Trident submarines but not equipping them with nuclear missiles. These figures suggest Corbyn, who is in favour of nuclear disarmament, would be able to win a vote on Trident if he put it to a ballot of party members. But this would involve bypassing the normal policy-making procedure, a vote at party conference. Corbyn would find it much harder to win a conference vote on this because unions have 50% of the vote at conference and the big unions are pro-Trident because they want to preserve defence jobs.</p> <p><strong>7 - Corbyn\u2019s supporters are more likely to leave the Labour party if they do not get the leader they want than Smith\u2019s. </strong>Corbyn\u2019s supporters sometimes accuse their opponents of wanting to split the party <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/31/owen-smiths-team-says-corbyn-reluctant-to-take-part-in-live-debates\">(John McDonnell has said this explicitly.)</a> But the YouGov poll suggests the Corbynistas would be more likely to walk away. Asked what would happen if Corbyn won, and his opponents formed a rival party, 18% of members said they would leave and join it. But when asked what would happen if Smith won, and his opponents formed a rival party, 32% of members said they would leave and join it.</p> <p><em>UPDATE:</em> On Twitter and perhaps BTL (I have\u2019t read comments yet) readers have challenged this on a couple of grounds.</p> <p>First, Genie Research points out that, given there are almost twice as many Corbyn backers as Smith backers, it is not surprising that Corbyn backers seem more included to split.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/genieresearch/status/770932197041770496\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow</a> Maths is wrong on 7/10: Corbynite Propensity To Leave = 32/62 = 52%; Smithite PTL = 18/38 = 47%. A very small gap - half each</p>&mdash; Genie Research (@genieresearch) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/genieresearch/status/770932197041770496\">August 31, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The crosstabs present slightly different figures. Amongst those planning to vote Corbyn, 54% would join a new party if they did not get the leadership result they wanted. Amongst Smith supporters, the figure is 45%. So there is a difference - but it is not a big one.</p> <p>Second, some readers think the first sentence in paragraph 7 is misleading because the YouGov questions were based on the assumption that MPs might split and form a new party, and arguably it is the anti-Corbynites in the PLP who are most likely to do this. It is certainly true that no pro-Corbyn MPs have been talking about forming a new party if Corbyn loses. But anti-Corbyn MPs do not seem to be seriously talking about a new party either. There are reports that some of them are considering setting up a new gropu in parliament. But launching an entirely new party would be hugely problematic, and I am not aware of any MP advocating this.</p> <p>What is true is that some people who used to support other parties (eg, the Greens, TUSC) have joined Labour because they like Corbyn. It is easy to see them leaving if he were replaced - although that is not the same as them defecting to form a new party.</p> <p><strong>8 - More than a third of those voting in the contest (39%) think it is likely the Labour will split when it is over.</strong><br></p> <p><strong>9 - Almost half of those voting in the contest (48%) think Labour MPs should be subjected to mandatory reselection.</strong></p> <p><strong>10 - The traingate controversy damaged Corbyn\u2019s standing in the contest - but not by much. </strong>Some 20% of those voting in the contest said they had a more negative view of him as a result of it, against 10% who said they had a more positive view of him as a result. Almost 70% said it had no effect on their thinking.</p> <p>As I said earlier (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/aug/31/corbyn-labour-leadership-yougov-poll-leadership-with-increased-majority-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57c685f6e4b0f6cb85628930#block-57c685f6e4b0f6cb85628930\">9.02am)</a> YouGov\u2019s record last year suggests this poll is likely to be a reasonably reliable guide to the eventual outcome. But <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/08/30/labour-leadership-election-corbyn-leads-smith-24/\">in his own write-up of the survey,</a> YouGov\u2019s Matthew Smith says it is important to remember the various factors that could lead to the final result being different.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are a number of important caveats that should be highlighted. Our survey sample is composed of 1,236 members of the Labour selectorate, with the representation levels of difference membership types (member/supporter/union affiliate) based on how each group turned out in the 2015 leadership election. Changes in turnout have the potential to affect the results: this is particularly true of trade union affiliates (amongst whom turnout was low in 2015) given that the GMB is under new leadership and has come out for Smith this time round.</p> <p>The make-up of registered supporters is also difficult to judge, whilst the effects and scale of Labour party membership suspensions also has the potential to make a difference. Last, but not least, there are still three weeks left to vote, and unforeseen events could drastically affect the course of the contest. Nevertheless, Team Corbyn will be pleased by the security afforded by the double digit lead they are currently sitting on.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T11:21:43.559Z\">at 12.21pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c697c1e4b0df5f040dbec4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T08:54:44.820Z\">9.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Anna Soubry,</strong> the Conservative former business minister and an opponent of Brexit, was on the Today programme this morning being interviewed ahead of today\u2019s cabinet meeting at Chequers (which she is not attending, obviously.)

I believe in the free movement of labour from the EU. It has benefited our country, especially business.</p> </blockquote> <p>Theresa May and her ministers have said very little about what their negotiating priorities will be, although what they have said suggests Soubry will not get her way. May has suggested that taking control of immigration will be a priority, even if that results in Britain not being able to remain a full member of the single market.</p> <p>(Two weeks ago ITV\u2019s Robert Peston wrote <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pestonitv/posts/1675210406137031\">a revealing Facebook post about the government\u2019s Brexit thinking.</a> Peston did not disclose his sources, but it read as if it were based on a briefing from someone in David Davis\u2019s Brexit department. Peston said the government was examining the case for a Canada-plus free trade deal with the EU.)</p> <p><strong>Lord Lawson,</strong> the pro-Brexit Conservative former chancellor, was also on the programme.

There were concerns about what would happen to the sheep, but the charity has insisted they will be saved.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b17d4544a823c8c91d3c7905ebe50d20f66939e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b17d4544a823c8c91d3c7905ebe50d20f66939e/0_317_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Purcell in the Borrowdale Valley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Purcell in the Borrowdale Valley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This week the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg accused the National Trust of bullying.

We will be speaking to a wide range of stakeholders to understand the options and won\u2019t be rushing into any immediate plans (ie it will still be a farm and we won\u2019t be rewilding).</p> <p>\u201cWe will be looking to continue the woodland restoration work commenced by the previous owners and their tenants. We will also explore how we may be able to use the land to slow the flow of the upper river Derwent, thereby contributing to the prevention of flooding downstream in communities such as Keswick and Cockermouth. This is an action included in the Cumbria Flood Partnership\u2019s Action Plan. Many of the habitats, including the rare and important wood pastures, have been sustained with traditional grazing by the Herdwick flock, and that will be part of the management mix too.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><em>Ian McEwan\u2019s new book Nutshell is inspired by Hamlet and told from the perspective of a foetus witnessing a murder from inside his mother\u2019s womb. It has been described <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/30/nutshell-ian-mcewan-review-hamlet-foetus\">by the Guardian as \u201cvirtuoso entertainment\u201d</a> by a practiced storyteller. McEwan told an audience at the book\u2019s launch last week, organised by the Guardian, that his in-utero narrator is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/01/ian-mcewan-nutshell-identity-politics\">a \u201cleft-of-centre\u201d foetus who celebrates a diverse range of gender identities</a>. Six Guardian members who attended the launch, from school teacher to craft beer entrepreneur, said the renowned author and his book kept them fascinated and entertained.</em></p> <p><strong>Darell Philip is a teaching assistant at an east London primary school</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f515f33e28cbe9f457fb0d83312719cfdc0a4596\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f515f33e28cbe9f457fb0d83312719cfdc0a4596/329_375_753_942/400.jpg\" alt=\"Darell Philip\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I recently read Atonement and The Children Act and really enjoyed them, and I thought the premise of Ian McEwan\u2019s new novella Nutshell looked strangely interesting. I got the book on the night of the event, started reading it straight away and then continued on the train home.<br></p> <p>I thought it was fascinating to have the narrator in the womb as the detective. I was also intrigued by the science of the idea, how the baby is trying to pick up signals and make sense of the world around him. McEwan said he had been reading a lot of Shakespeare and that the novel was based partly on Hamlet, with the baby questioning himself about the world around him in a similar way to the play\u2019s protagonist. The murder is based on Macbeth. It\u2019s a fitting tribute considering 2016 is the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare\u2019s death.</p> <p>McEwan seems to be political, and many of his views appear to be reflected in the baby - he listens to the BBC World Service, and there were references to Palestine and Istanbul. Someone asked how the baby would feel about Brexit: very disappointed, McEwan said, as he was pro-Europe and wanted the world to be united. The baby is trying to make sense of the world and judges the negative things that take place. He wants the world to be more harmonious.</p> <p>I love reading and writing, and one thing I took away with me was that McEwen recommended keeping a journal to generate ideas. I work with children and they often find it difficult to come up with ideas so this is something I will definitely use.</p> <p><strong>Francine Kruyt lives in the Netherlands and is a doctor</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1254365de4b3b90af1dcb56aed5fb4260770266d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1254365de4b3b90af1dcb56aed5fb4260770266d/482_60_392_490/392.jpg\" alt=\"Francine Kruyt.\" width=\"392\" height=\"490\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve been an admirer of McEwan\u2019s novels for many years. He struck me as a man with a typical sense of English humour, full of understatement. He gave us a good tip: \u201cLock the door of your study and read your text aloud.\u201d</p> <p>When he started reading Nutshell to us I became very enthusiastic. The intonation and accents he put into the text made it very special and lifted the evening.</p> <p>The outlook of the world from the uterus is an amazing point of view, and sometimes a little shocking \u2013 an embryo that has thoughts and feelings and also explicit preferences for wines!</p> <p>McEwan is often called the master of suspense. With one word he can give a clue to the storyline of the book. The sentences themselves are built and structured very well. I think you could compare him to an architect: the concrete and bricks he uses to design and build his novels are sentences and words, all very precisely and carefully chosen.</p> <p><strong>Jenny Bardwell is a freelance radio producer, teacher and writer from Sutton</strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2b5117ca31fd39d79b57b9c637a05551c6084ddf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b5117ca31fd39d79b57b9c637a05551c6084ddf/373_157_2131_2663/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jenny Bardwell.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I went to the event as a devotee of Ian McEwan\u2019s novels, which turn up every couple of years just as summer is ending. I sat next to an amusing American author from Stanford University, but stupidly didn\u2019t ask his name.</p> <p>I liked it when a woman asked if he ever had any self-doubt. He visibly winced, I imagine at the memory of sitting alone for decades trying to invent plausible yet gripping worlds. Then someone asked for advice on writing dialogue and he said you have to act it out - but it\u2019s quite hard to imagine him doing something as uncool as putting on funny voices.</p> <p>I have only just started to read Nutshell. I usually have a little weep at the close of his novels that engage both head and heart so vigorously, but Nutshell sounds wacky.</p> <p><strong>Lynn Parkin lives in Brighton where she teaches English to adults</strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f3364364c262f888856dff65f3f95521d0e5e058\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3364364c262f888856dff65f3f95521d0e5e058/185_82_117_146/117.jpg\" alt=\"Lynn Parkin.\" width=\"117\" height=\"146\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I first read In Between the Sheets 32 years ago, and now as part of a book group I have read several more Ian McEwan stories and intend to read Black Dogs next. My favourite McEwen novels are Saturday and Atonement, which I thought had a brilliant sex scene in a library.</p> <p>Nutshell promises to be quite a humorous book, with many of McEwan\u2019s trademark references to the cultural aspects of life. His concerns about a narcissistic trend among some elements of youth were striking, as I hadn\u2019t previously connected it with apathy towards global issues such as climate change and world poverty.</p> <p>McEwen also made a memorable point about people\u2019s intolerance of opposing opinions at universities and on social media. He suggested that people are becoming incapable of disagreeing without resorting to threats of violence, which is a reversal of civilised values.</p> <p>Sharing a room with a writer enables you to feel much more connected to their work, and shows that it is a job for them - the words don\u2019t just flow like magic.</p> <p><strong>Mic Dover is a freelance writer and craft beer entrepreneur based in Nelson, New Zealand.

The premise of Nutshell sounds good - it\u2019s a novella, so only around 200 pages long, and he said you could read it in about four hours.</p> <p>He was as sharp, witty and erudite as you\u2019d expect. I\u2019m normally a bit iffy about listening to authors talking about their books as they can be quite boring, but he was really interesting. I\u2019m pleased that he made comments about the political landscape as he did in The Ploughman\u2019s Lunch.</p> <p><strong>Peter Wilson lives in London, has worked in the third sector and also writes stories</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"952f8b6f208785b6938ea702ef47e9d6cf10efd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/952f8b6f208785b6938ea702ef47e9d6cf10efd6/249_0_243_304/243.jpg\" alt=\"Guardian Member Peter F Wilson\" width=\"243\" height=\"304\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s interesting when you\u2019ve read a number of books by a particular author to hear them speak in their own words. I\u2019ve read a fair few of McEwan\u2019s books - probably about half of them over the years.</p> <p>The foetus as the narrator is a good idea. It\u2019s a unique point of view and a classic example of requiring a suspension of disbelief. Once you do, it makes perfect sense that the foetus learns about the world by listening to Radio 4.</p> <p>He said he doesn\u2019t believe in writer\u2019s block, he simply regards it as hesitation. As a writer I think he\u2019s more perspiration than inspiration. He\u2019s like a method actor for writers.</p> <p>McEwan handled himself well and I like the fact he\u2019s considered in his replies - it suits his method of writing. He said he was happy to talk in paragraphs. I could have listened to him for a lot longer \u2013 and it felt like he could have spoken for much longer too.</p> <p><em>To buy tickets for other Guardian Live events with authors including Jonathan Safron Foer, Eimear McBride and Amos Oz visit <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/guardianlive\">theguardian.com/guardianlive</a></em></p>",

The challenge claims that some of the EDF board members who voted in favour of Hinkley Point represent companies that are EDF customers and could benefit from the UK contract. French firms Bouygues and Vallourec have denied that members of their boards who are also on the board of EDF had a conflict of interest in their Hinkley Point vote. </p> <p>Laurent Langlard, spokesman for the national mines and energy branch of the powerful CGT union which is supporting the court action brought by the five board members, said: \u201cWe\u2019re worried. We have never been against the Hinkley Point project in itself. Our concern is the timing. This project can\u2019t be charged into too fast. EDF\u2019s economic situation is serious. More time has to be taken for full feedback and lessons to be learnt. So we want the board decision annulled and we want a full debate at board level.\u201d</p> <p>He said ensuring that EDF could financially stay on its feet was paramount and the company should take two more years to study and prepare the project. </p> <p> The complaint is the latest in several objections to Hinkley Point by workers at EDF. It follows previous legal efforts by several of EDF\u2019s unions to block and then overturn the approval of the project, which they consider a huge financial risk to the heavily indebted company.</p> <p> The unions argue that Levy and representatives of the French state should have informed the board that they knew the British government wanted to take more time to review the contract. </p> <p>Hours after EDF\u2019s board approved the project last month, the UK government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/30/nuclear-power-hinkley-point\">postponed its decision</a> until early autumn. Days later, in an email to top EDF executives, Levy admitted that the night before the board meeting he had been told the new prime minister Theresa May wanted a bit more time. He said he had learned that May \u201cwas asking for a little more time, without reassessing the project, without giving the date when it could be signed\u201d. </p> <p>However, the unions said that at the board meeting \u201cthe British desire to proceed very quickly was again presented as a reason to quickly sign\u201d the deal. Levy has denied lying to board members, saying he was not aware that the British government would in fact announce hours later a review of the project.</p> <p>The nuclear reactors carry huge risks for both France and Britain.

  "<h2>Will a knee ruin Minnesota\u2019s season? </h2> <p>Pretty doomed, if the thoughts of Mike Zimmer are any indication. In the hours after the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/30/teddy-bridgewater-injury-minnesota-vikings-nfl\"> team\u2019s young QB blew out of his knee</a>, the reference he went to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Vikings/status/770731159537856512\">was the death of his wife six years ago</a>. That is depressing on several levels.</p> <p>The Vikings entered training camp as the defending division champions and with an eye on getting to the Super Bowl. Those sort of goals are a big ask for the average 23-year old quarterback, but Bridgewater had shown signs he could become one of the NFL\u2019s best at the position. </p> <p>Perhaps because he was the final pick of the first-round in 2014, long after Blake Bortles and Johnny Manziel were taken, and just before Derek Carr was selected by the higher-profile Raiders, Bridgewater\u2019s first two years with the Vikings were largely overlooked. But he\u2019s clearly been the best of those taken in the first-round \u2013 Manziel is famously out of football and out on the town while Bortles has yet to distinguish himself \u2013 and Bridgewater\u2019s numbers compare favorably to Carr\u2019s so far, too. He\u2019s also the only regular starting quarterback drafted into the NFL since 2013 to have made the playoffs and he would have a playoff game-winning, fourth quarter drive under his belt if not for <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap3000000620504/Blair-Walsh-misses-game-winning-FG\">a shanked chip-shot field goal last January</a>.

If true, that is fortunate for the Bears because they were absolutely dreadful in August, failing to score more than seven points in two of their first three games \u2013 all losses \u2013 and seeing several key players get hurt. For a team like the Patriots or Seahawks or Steelers, preseason struggles aren\u2019t a huge cause for concern. But the Bears are not the Patriots, Seahawks or Steelers. They are not a consistent contender, unless they\u2019re looking to contend for the No1 overall pick. The Bears won just 11 games over the last two years, finishing dead-last in a division that has sent a team to the Super Bowl just four times in 30 years. So the preseason is alarming because it\u2019s looked exactly like most every Bears full season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/31/nfc-south-season-preview-carolina-panthers\">NFC South season preview: were the Panthers a one-year wonder?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The 2016 season will be John Fox\u2019s second at the helm in Chicago.

Yet it\u2019s hard to see where the Bears will be significantly better than last year\u2019s 6-10 team. </p> <p>Jay Cutler remains the starting quarterback, for good or ill. The good is that Cutler had maybe the best season of his career in 2015 under offensive coordinator Adam Gase. The ill is that he\u2019s still Jay Cutler, his 2015 season wasn\u2019t all that amazing, and Gase is now the head coach of the Dolphins. The offense should be aided by the addition of a healthy Kevin White, the 2015 first-round receiver who missed all of his rookie year due to injury. The defense \u2013 always the backbone of Fox\u2019s best teams \u2013 will look to improve with this year\u2019s No1 pick, linebacker Leonard Floyd, and free agent Danny Trevathan. Nice additions, but no one is yet comparing this defense to any Fox had in Carolina or Denver. </p> <p>Chicago\u2019s best offseason acquisition probably came the day the team got its schedule. The NFC North is gifted with games against the AFC South and NFC East, with Chicago also getting Tampa Bay and the 49ers. Maybe those match-ups alone will see them exceed six wins, but any meaningful improvement may not come until 2017.

When the Packers drafted Lacy in 2013 out of Alabama, they no doubt hoped he would generate more headlines for chewing up yardage than delicious pastries. But Lacy\u2019s three solid but unspectacular seasons thus far as Green Bay\u2019s feature back have been clouded by constant questions about his weight and fitness. So this offseason he hit the P90-X hard \u2013 yes, the workout your co-worker did to try to look good for his beach vacation \u2013 and is down 15lbs to 20lbs and has added muscle. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/16/aaron-rodgers-green-bay-packers-nfl\">The Aaron Rodgers dynasty: the NFL era that never came to pass</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Lacy\u2019s defense \u2013 and defense is a thing consistently lacking in Green Bay in recent years \u2013 the running back may have looked at the struggles the Packers offensive line had last year in protecting Aaron Rodgers and thought: \u201cMaybe I should become a guard so I can help block for Aaron.\u201d The newly-svelte back is in the final year of his rookie contract and will be looking to produce a breakout season to earn a big, new deal (so he can continue to afford that expensive P90-X subscription, no doubt).

Remember when Joe Flacco reached peak eliteness in 2012-2013? Caldwell was his position coach then and the offensive coordinator in the playoffs. But he has yet to carry that kind of success over to a head job. The Lions surprisingly earned a wildcard spot his first season in Detroit in 2014, but slipped to 7-9 last year, following the pattern of Caldwell teams always seeming to get worse the longer he\u2019s around. Not really a great resume slug. </p> <p>The task of improving is even harder with Detroit facing its latest era in which the franchise must deal with the early retirement of a superstar. As Calvin Johnson <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2016/08/29/calvin-johnson-dancing-with-stars/89570708/\">dances with the stars this fall</a>, Matthew Stafford will hope Golden Tate and Marvin Jones can bring down the same passes Johnson used to. If they can\u2019t, and if the losses pile up, Caldwell could be replaced by talented defensive coordinator Teryl Austin. If not Austin, offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter is another contender. Just try to make the case that the NFL is the No Fun League when a man named Jim Bob Cooter is a head coach. You will fail. </p> <h2>How loud is the Vikings new stadium? </h2> <p>So loud you\u2019re probably never going to stop hearing about it. The Vikings open their new 66,143-seat stadium this year and early reviews say it could be louder than the Metrodome and possibly the loudest stadium in the entire NFL. In fact, the Vikings plan to offer ear plugs to their fans at Guest Services.

But the real cause of public disgruntlement is the draining away of power to transnational corporations who operate in a limboland beyond national borders, and the politicians who do not have the courage to stand up against the bullying of these corporations.</p> <p>Apple has benefited from both a favourable Irish tax regime and the notorious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/13/ireland-close-double-irish-tax-loophole\" title=\"\">\u201cdouble Irish\u201d</a> scheme, exploiting the fact that revenues declared as earned by subsidiaries or Irish companies outside its territory are not liable to tax. This, combined with the fact that US corporations can defer paying taxes on foreign income, creates a tax incentive for multinational corporations to effectively be resident nowhere. For Apple, this meant holding $187bn outside the US in 2015, a considerable share of the total $1.2tn that US multinationals have parked offshore. If the company were to repatriate their profits in the US they would face a corporate tax rate of 35%, so they log it in Ireland and leave it offshore.</p> <p>The US Treasury has been swift to attack Brussels\u2019 attempts to ensure that a fair rate of tax is paid, getting its retaliation in first in the form of a report last week accusing the commission of acting like a <a href=\"https://www.cchdaily.co.uk/us-treasury-hits-out-supra-national-eu-probe-apple-tax\" title=\"\">\u201csupranational tax authority\u201d</a>. This is a classic example of an economic rival deliberately undermining cooperation between European partners to benefit its own multinational corporations. We should celebrate the fact that the European commission is acting to protect citizens against excessive corporate power. In the global economy the real division is not between nation states but between citizens and corporations.</p> <p>This is not the first time faceless Brussels bureaucrats have been sticking their noses into others\u2019 business, namely giant corporations and the way they do business in Europe. Shortly before the referendum, the commission launched proposals on public <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/country-by-country-reporting-updated\" title=\"\">country by country reporting</a> (CBCR), ensuring the public disclosure of where companies do business, employ people, declare profits and pay taxes. this was all in the interests of transparency, and the need to hold corporations to account.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/30/apple-tax-avoidance-vindication-protest-ttip\">Apple must now pay its taxes.

I believe leave voters had a justifiable sense that we are all losing control over our work, and our public sphere. Unfortunately, with the EU, they chose the wrong target. As Vestager has proved, many of our most urgent problems can only be solved by cross-border cooperation.</p> <p>No one country alone can resist the power of global corporations; to do this we need to work in cooperation with other countries. Ironically, the Brexit vote reduces our power to ensure corporations pay the taxes we need to build a thriving society and a flourishing economy. Indeed, there is a real danger that the Tories, and particularly those leading the Brexit negotiations, will seek to make the UK infamous for being one of the world\u2019s leading tax havens.</p>",

Now, conservation and tourists have arrived. They\u2019re all just passing through. Us, we\u2019re staying.\u201d</p> <p>Tourism has had a major impact. In 1990, the Chilean government established the <a href=\"http://www.visitchile.com/en/los-flamencos-national-reserve/\">Los Flamencos national reserve</a>. Rather than resist the move, the Lickan Antay \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.iwgia.org/images/stories/sections/regions/latin-america/documents/IW2016/Chile_IW2016_web_redu.pdf\">who, along with other indigenous peoples of Chile, are among the poorest in the country</a> (pdf)  \u2013 chose to negotiate and adapt. The national reserve is the first example in Chile of the co-management of a protected area by the state and indigenous people.</p> <p>It is now seen as a strategic alliance that allows the government and the people to preserve the environment more effectively, and channel tourism. The co-management agreement also allows the Lickan Antay to attract other opportunities for development.</p> <p>Leticia Gonz\u00e1lez-Silvestre was born in Toconau, one of the desert villages of the Lickan Antay. After studying away from home, she has returned with an agricultural engineering diploma.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5cd083ed507ad825aa2f2a8a26c40ad73b3b8fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5cd083ed507ad825aa2f2a8a26c40ad73b3b8fa/0_0_2560_1706/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leticia Gonz\u00e1lez-Silvestre, of the Lickan Antay\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leticia Gonz\u00e1lez-Silvestre, a respected member of the indigenous council.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Riccardo Pravettoni</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She says co-management of the reserve has given them employment and training opportunities. The communities have formed a non-profit association to collect and redistribute money earned from the reserve. \u201cIt\u2019s a benefit in terms of economics and development, but it\u2019s also a recognition of our culture. We continue to negotiate an increasingly important part of the management, taking advantage of the fact that the government has neither the capacity nor the means to invest more.\u201d</p> <p>The national forest corporation, <a href=\"http://www.conaf.cl/\">Conaf</a>, which coordinates the management of protected areas for the government, says the collaboration allows it to fill a gap in its teams. Alejandro Santoro, Conaf\u2019s regional director, says: \u201cThis gives us a constant and broader view of the situation. This way, the Lickan Antay are assimilated like personnel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a positive approach,\u201d adds Ivonne Valenzuela, who is in charge of a Conaf unit<strong> </strong>dedicated to relations with indigenous communities. \u201cThe model we\u2019ve adopted is to engage in contracts with the communities. In this way, they can benefit from tourism while we concentrate on the protection of biodiversity. We work with them on many aspects of the management of the reserve, and on the planning and management of eco-tourism projects.\u201d</p> <p>But not everyone is happy about the surge in the number of tourists spending time in the<strong> </strong>reserve, which is now the second most visited in Chile, with <a href=\"http://www.conaf.cl/wp-content/files_mf/1454955121Tot_a%C3%B1o_2015.pdf\">more than 300,000 visitors a year</a> (pdf). While some welcome the economic advantages, others are concerned about the establishment of tour companies and agencies that ignore the Lickan Antay\u2019s customs and, in some instances, deny their existence.</p> <p>The small town of San Pedro de Atacama is a succession of hotels, restaurants, bars, souvenir shops and tourist agencies. Nights are festive, the restaurants offer international cuisine and the wisest visitors go to bed early to be ready for their treks to discover the geysers and flamingos of the salt flats.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"6c8795d23ae9746d9b579da9019b974fefa13ca1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c8795d23ae9746d9b579da9019b974fefa13ca1/0_0_2560_1706/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The landscape around San Pedro de Atacama\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">San Pedro de Atacama lies in a region of volcanoes and salt flats, in an arid high plateau of the Andes mountains.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Riccardo Pravettoni</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAll that interests them is filling the bus and visiting the sites, not experiencing a different way of life,\u201d says Sandra Flores, one of the Lickan Antay, who runs a small tourism company, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/caravana.ancestral\">Caravana Ancestral</a>.</p> <p>\u201cFor us it\u2019s very difficult to know that our existence is negated in this way. And we\u2019re unable to get a foothold in the tourism market. The guides say the desert is empty, that there are no more indigenous people. Sure, we\u2019re not in San Pedro, but we\u2019re everywhere in the desert. We dedicate ourselves to our animals, to farming the land.</p> <p>\u201cBefore the creation of the reserve there wasn\u2019t a single tourist, and suddenly they\u2019re everywhere. We haven\u2019t had the time to react and to learn how to set up commercial establishments. But we exist. And our existence is a constant battle.\u201d </p> <p>Flores set up her business four years ago. She and several members of the community receive tourists in their homes, share a moment together to talk about their way of life, let tourists take out the llamas, and show visitors a Lickan Antay archeological site. But none of them speak fluent English and the business is not well established.</p> <p>However, the most serious impact of the tourism explosion has been to put pressure on the precarious water situation. The hundreds of hotels being built in San Pedro guzzle water.</p> <p>\u201cThe hotels wanted to buy land and we sold it to them. Already we didn\u2019t have enough water to farm, and now we have to go to another river to fetch water, one we didn\u2019t go to before,\u201d says L\u00f3pez Ramo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2510b709b0a67dce6d802c5dddaed7e3fd4d240\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2510b709b0a67dce6d802c5dddaed7e3fd4d240/0_0_2560_1706/1000.jpg\" alt=\"San Pedro de Atacama, a town full of bars, restaurants and tourist agencies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">San Pedro de Atacama, a focus for tourism within the Atacama desert.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Riccardo Pravettoni</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Because of the hotels, some of the Lickan Antay who live close to San Pedro say, their usual water source dried up.

It\u2019s like wine: one wants to say, \u2018It\u2019s a good antioxidant.\u2019 Yes, but if you drink litres every day, you\u2019re not going to feel good.\u201d</p> <p>Felipe Guerra Schleef is a lawyer for the indigenous rights NGO <a href=\"http://observatorio.cl/\">Observatorio Ciudadano</a>.

  "<p>When I visited the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan earlier this year, I met with children who told me what education means to them. For Syrian youths who have been forced from their homes and have lost everything, education is about more than qualifications or test scores \u2013 it embodies their hope for the future.</p> <p>Children like those in Zaatari, and millions of others around the world, are central to the work of the <a href=\"http://educationcommission.org/\">International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity</a>, which I joined last September. This commission is committed to the fourth <a href=\"http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/education/\">United Nations sustainable development goal</a>, which aims, by 2030, to \u201censure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.\u201d</p> <p>This goal is still a distant prospect for far too many children. With so many development issues demanding our attention, policymakers should bear in mind that education is not just a good in itself; it is also a catalyst for many other development gains.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As the old African proverb goes, if you educate a girl, you educate an entire nation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As the old African proverb goes, if you educate a girl, you educate an entire nation. Ensuring access to quality education for children, especially girls, will lead to fewer <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ending-child-marriage-development-goals-by-mabel-v--oranje-2016-07\">child marriages</a> and less child labour and exploitation. Education also brings long-term societal benefits: aside from increased political engagement, educated children contribute intellectual capital and pursue entrepreneurial opportunities when they grow up, boosting economic growth.</p> <p>Tackling the education challenge needs to start from two principles embedded in the goal.</p> <p>First, \u201cfor all\u201d means that we must focus on the children who have been left behind. Millions of children are out of school or are receiving a sub-standard education because of who they are or where they live. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, refugee children are <a href=\"http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002448/244847E.pdf\">five times</a> [pdf] more likely to be out of school than other children in the countries to which they\u2019ve been displaced. In all but two African countries, girls remain less likely than boys to complete a primary education. Getting these children into school will require new approaches that directly address their exclusion and make schooling genuinely accessible and relevant.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/gallery/2016/jul/07/a-girls-view-of-the-17-sustainable-development-goals-in-pictures\">A girl's view of the 17 sustainable development goals - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Second, \u201cquality\u201d: education must be effective, so that children actually learn. For the <a href=\"http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002452/245238E.pdf\">61 million</a> [pdf] children who are out of primary school, formal education is beyond reach. But, just as urgently, more than one-third of children of primary-school age \u2013 250 million \u2013 are not learning the basics, according to the <a href=\"http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0021/002193/219349E.pdf\">Unesco Education for All Global Monitoring Report</a> [pdf]. Half of these children have been in school for at least four years. We must address the barriers to learning, both in the classroom and at home, by improving the quality of teaching and classroom conditions and teaching parents how they can support their children\u2019s education.</p> <p>Upholding these two principles will require increased investment. Last year, Unesco calculated that governments must <a href=\"http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002321/232197E.pdf\">double education spending</a> [pdf] as a share of national income to achieve the 2030 goals. This will require increased revenue from taxation and stronger efforts to collect what\u2019s owed. Donors also need to live up to their aid commitments and target aid more effectively. For example, less than one-third of education aid goes to Africa, even though the region accounts for almost two-thirds of out-of-school children. Moreover, at the moment, education budgets are often regressive, with almost half of spending in the poorest countries allocated to the most educated 10% of the population.</p> <p>Fixing education investment requires action in two key areas.</p> <p>First, we need equitable financing, with more investment in early childhood care and development, where there is the biggest potential for returns. Budgets must be focused on the most excluded children, and primary education must be free at the point of use, so that every child can learn. We also urgently need more transparency and accountability, so that budgets are visible and communities have a say in school governance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jul/20/we-must-focus-on-the-un-goals-that-are-the-best-value-for-money\">We must focus on the UN goals that are the best value for money</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Second, we need to strengthen domestic education systems so that governments see themselves as the guarantor of accessible, quality schools for their citizens, rather than abdicating that role to outside development agencies. In particular, we should push for partnerships between government and business to boost domestic resources for education, and eliminate illicit capital flows that deprive governments of the means to fund it, such as tax evasion and money laundering across national borders.</p> <p>With these priorities in mind, the education commission will deliver its recommendations at the UN General Assembly on 18 September, when the secretary-general will receive and act on them. The education commission will have succeeded if we are able to leverage the funding and political will to ensure that every child learns, regardless of their income, location, or social status.

  "<p>In May 2000, around half of Walkerton\u2019s 5,000 residents fell severely ill and seven people died when cow manure washed into a well. The extent of the water pollution in the small Canadian town was concealed from the public, people drank from their taps and the result was ruined lives.</p> <p>For academic microbiologist Joan Rose, who has observed water pollution outbreaks around the world, it was the worst that she had ever experienced.</p> <p>\u201cIt affected me the most. Walkerton is a small small farming community. The people there were very gracious. Two pathogens came in to their water supply. They did not know children would die, or would suffer kidney failure and be on on dialysis for the rest of their lives. I saw what it did to people. I saw the pain.\u201d </p> <p>Walkerton was one of Canada\u2019s worst-ever pollution incidents but there are hundreds of similar incidents every year around the world, albeit mostly less serious, says Prof Rose, who is laboratory director in water research at Michigan State University. </p> <p>Most come from people drinking water contaminated with sewage, she says. \u201cIn the US there are 12-18m cases of human water-borne diseases a year. In developing countries it is possible that one in three hospital cases may be due to contamination of water. We do not know exactly how bad it is but 1.5 billion people do not have access to adequate sewage treatment.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e1c5100c0692f5a56a04c59cadf99360ad58093c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1c5100c0692f5a56a04c59cadf99360ad58093c/0_0_3840_2560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prof Joan Rose received the world\u2019s most prestigious water prize at a conference in Stockholm this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prof Joan Rose received the world\u2019s most prestigious water prize at a conference in Stockholm this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mikael Ull\u00e9n/Stockholm International Water Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rose, who this week was presented with <a href=\"http://www.siwi.org/prizes/stockholmwaterprize/laureates/2016-2/\">the world\u2019s most prestigious prize for water</a> at <a href=\"http://www.worldwaterweek.org/\">a conference in Stockholm</a>, is alternately depressed and optimistic at progress to clean the world\u2019s water supplies and make water fit to drink.</p> <p>\u201cWe have started to decrease mortality for waterborne diseases but the big problem now is morbidity [disease-related]. People are getting more sick. We are now more polluted than we have ever been\u201d. </p> <p>The statistics are dismal. This week <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/newscentre/default.aspx?DocumentID=27081&amp;ArticleID=36251\">the UN Environment Programme reported</a> that \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of people face health risks like cholera and typhoid from pathogens in water. Water pollution in Asia, Africa and Latin America is worsening, said the report, with pathogen pollution now in more than half of all rivers stretches on the three continents. <br></p> <p>\u201cThere are 7 billion people and most of their waste is going into water. The water quality of lakes, rivers and coastal shorelines around the world is degrading at an alarming rate. There has been a great acceleration since the 1950s of human and animal populations, water withdrawals, pesticide and fertiliser use. But at the same time there has been a deceleration, or shrinkage, in wetlands,\u201d says Rose.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe are changing our lands. Land is the source of contamination, but climate is the driver [of contamination]. We know that the intensity of rainfall, storms and droughts is changing. More than 50% of community waterborne illness events in the US each year are associated with extreme rain.\u201d</p> <p>When it rains heavily or floods, pathogens like Leptospira, hepatitis, norovirus and cryptosporidium are all significant, she says. \u201cThere is a direct link between water pollution, certain food-borne disease outbreaks and warmer oceans. Temperature, precipitation, humidity and flooding are all factors in contamination of water and food systems by pathogens. Many developing nations suffer terribly from illnesses caused by lack of sewage treatment facilities which are exasperated by climate.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, sewage contains well over 100 different viruses. Newly emerging viruses such as Cycloviruses, which are causing neurological problems in children in Asia, are also emerging in sewage and are spreading. </p> <p>\u201cPollution is spreading to every part of the world. Everywhere is now under huge new attack from viruses and pathogens,\u201d she says.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Rose has led research into how new pathogens and viruses are being spread around the world by hitching rides in the ballast water which ships take on to stabilise them on long journeys. They are picking up viruses in one ocean or sea and bringing them to others, she says</p> <p>\u201cWe are infecting the food chain, and the whole system. I am thinking what are we missing about the bio-health of the planet. What do we know about what is happening in the wild? Frogs are dying, starfish are dying. We focus so much on humans we don\u2019t know about much else. Every part of the world is now under huge new attack from viruses and pathogens.\u201d <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a399acd85867d30ceeb8214104371d2bf9fbf2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a399acd85867d30ceeb8214104371d2bf9fbf2d/0_0_1500_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"For almost two years, there has been a water crisis in Flint, Michigan, US.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">For almost two years, there has been a water crisis in Flint, Michigan, US.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Garza/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The answer, she says, must be massive investment in water infrastructure. \u201cBut in the US alone, it\u2019s estimated that what is needed is $70 per person per day for 10 years. In developing countries its far more.\u201d </p> <p>But it has to be worth it, she says. \u201cAccess to clean water is a central stabilising force in societies and lack of access destabilises societies. As a microbiologist, I believe that the provision of safe drinking water is the basic building block of a healthy and successful society.</p> <p>\u201cIt is hard to progress when you are fighting cholera, or when there is an epidemic of child malnutrition as in India due to exposure to untreated water contaminated with fecal waste.\u201d<br></p> <p>The better news, she says, is that scientists can now monitor pathogens better and track their sources. \u201cWhat took three weeks to diagnose now takes 24 hours. There is more public support, more money, more political will to clean up water. We have more knowledge and more willingness to pay.</p> <p>\u201cThe key is education, specifically development of a global water curriculum to prepare the next generation of problem solvers.

Each will provide training, books and administrative systems, but they must use government teachers. At the end of the pilot, external assessors will report back on what and how much the children have learned.</p> <p>Yet the private operators will not be able to ensure teachers are paid on time. That remains the responsibility of the ministry.</p> <p>Bridge began training teachers this month. Its focus is on tech-savvy teaching and staff monitoring. In an attempt to counter absenteeism, teachers will be required to log on daily to a centralised system. They will also use online lesson plans downloaded daily. Josh Nathan, academic director at Bridge, says the system is about supporting \u201cnot oppressing\u201d teachers.</p> <p>He says: \u201cWatching people is a good first step but our system also makes sure teachers are able to come to school feeling ready to teach \u2013 critical factors in making sure people turn up and do the best they can every day.\u201d</p> <p>Bridge says proof that teachers \u201care eager for support\u201d came at a recent training session. All of the 300 invited teachers attended, even though working in pilot schools will mean longer hours.</p> <p>Teachers will be given electronic tablets. When they arrive at school their tablets link to a smartphone held by the school administrator, prompting an electronic roll call. During the school day, every move the teacher makes is monitored; both attendance and academic results.</p> <p>Nathan explains: \u201cEach time they download and deliver a lesson plan, the info is relayed to our system. Not only are we seeing that the teacher has arrived but seeing every single period they have taught. That way we can know if the lesson plan we have developed is too long or too short and needs to be revised. At the end of the school day a similar process tells us they have left. A teacher can\u2019t do any of this from home or another workplace. They need to be at school to do it, because it relies on central proximity to the main smartphone.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5bb41a0fdff689be184c154f8297994d1464ad0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bb41a0fdff689be184c154f8297994d1464ad0a/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Girls wait for their lessons outside a classroom at the Virginia secondary school in Montserrado\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Girls wait for their lessons outside a classroom at the Virginia secondary school in Montserrado.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Holt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are limitations to the system, which relies on 2G network connectivity and a minimum download speed of 50kb per second.</p> <p>\u201cThe vast majority of schools we have visited do have enough network connectivity,\u201d says Nathan. \u201cBut some parts of Liberia don\u2019t have access so clearly the programme can\u2019t happen tomorrow across the country.\u201d </p> <p>But he points out that technology has already been used in Liberia to combat teacher absenteeism. \u201cThere is a biometric reader in some schools, where teachers must scan their thumb prints, but what we are doing is fully integrated into the school day and how teachers teach.

I was unharmed, but the driver was gambling on the assumption that I would not, for example, hit a sudden pothole and swerve or wobble.</p> <p>Inevitably \u2013 as happened with Vine \u2013 the congested traffic meant I caught up with the driver at the next junction. His relatively minor but nonetheless very real roll of the dice with my chances of making it home safely that evening had all been for nothing. That\u2019s appallingly common.</p> <p>A couple of caveats must be noted. First however distressing such incidents can be \u2013 and there is evidence they help keep levels of cycling in Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/11/female-cyclists-bad-driving-harassment-study-uk-women-men-near-miss\" title=\"\">as pathetically low as they are</a> \u2013 riding a bike is still safer than many people think. The average Briton would ride 2m miles before they suffered a serious injury.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Driving is the sole event in most people\u2019s lives where there is a plausible chance they could kill another human being</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Secondly, while some are tempted to characterise such events as part of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2012/dec/13/war-britains-roads-fake\" title=\"\">\u201cwar on the roads\u201d</a> it\u2019s nothing of the sort, not least as the majority of cyclists also drive, and would thus be somehow waging war on themselves.</p> <p>The thing to grasp is that it\u2019s about the person, not the mode of transport they happen to be using at that particular time. As well as cycling, I walk, use buses and trains, sometimes drive, occasionally get planes. My personality is not changed, or defined, by any of those. I get the sense that all these forms of transport are populated by roughly similar proportions of idiots. They might push on to a train, barge past you on an escalator at an Underground station, recline their plane seat just as the meals are being served.</p> <p>Driving is, however, different in one way. It is the sole event in most people\u2019s everyday lives where there is a plausible, if remote, chance they could kill another human being. It\u2019s not about morals, it\u2019s simple physics. If I hit someone at 12mph even on my solid, heavy everyday bike it would impart something like 1,200 joules of kinetic energy. If I were in the last car I owned, a relatively tiny Nissan Micra, doing 30mph, you\u2019re suddenly at 100,000 joules. It\u2019s a very different impact.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/bike-blog/2016/aug/31/cyclists-have-you-experienced-an-altercation-like-jeremy-vines\">Cyclists: have you experienced an altercation like Jeremy Vine's?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s why police should take incidents like the one experienced by Vine more seriously than they generally do.

It\u2019s why the judicial system should take deaths and maiming caused by drivers a whole lot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/19/cyclist-julie-dinsdale-lost-leg-lorry-collision-driver-625-fine\" title=\"\">more seriously than it does</a>.</p> <p>In Vine\u2019s case there is more chance of police action, beyond even his celebrity as a broadcaster. After experiencing similar incidents in the past, his bike is now fitted with front and rear video cameras. Without this technology, nothing would be done.</p> <p>Next time you\u2019re in a car and you think a cyclist in front is holding you up, I\u2019d urge you to hold two very clear thoughts in your mind.</p> <p>The first is this: despite the apparent belief of many drivers, cyclists are <a href=\"http://www.motoring.co.uk/car-news/cyclists-why-do-they-ride-in-the-middle-of-the-road_62617\" title=\"\">not obliged or even advised to ride in the gutter</a>. If a rider is in the middle of the lane it could be to stay clear of opened doors on parked cars; it could be because the edge of the road is rutted and potholed; it might even be, as with Vine, to stop drivers squeezing past when it would be clearly unsafe to do so.</p> <p>Also bear this in mind: even if you\u2019re absolutely convinced the cyclist is in the wrong, hold back and be cautious anyway. In the majority of urban traffic situations, your overtake will be a very brief victory \u2013 they\u2019ll pedal past again in the queue for the next red light or junction.</p> <p>But most of all, remember that these are human beings, unprotected flesh and bone seeking to get to work, to see their friends, return to their loved ones. However much of a rush you think you\u2019re in, it never, ever justifies putting them at risk.</p>",

Learning the streets and the short cuts of a new city is the easy part, though; the social part of feeling home is trickier. In London it might be bumping into a person you know on the street, thereby evaporating some of the anonymity of the big city. In Oslo it might mean getting a coveted invite to a cottage in one of the lake districts north of the city. Of course, in an unequal world, accessing power and playing a part charting the city\u2019s future is the most elusive \u201chome\u201d feeling of all: only very few folks get to choose the city\u2019s wallpaper and carpet.</p> <p>My move 400km from Windsor to Toronto was not, in global terms, a difficult migration. I already had some friends and acquaintances waiting \u2013 and yet I still found the absence of feeling at home unsettling.

Thankfully, it was a brief illness; I later returned to the same hospital when that same friend gave birth to her first child. It had become a familiar place \u2013 and, I realised, a sign that I was developing roots here, getting tangled up with other people. The art deco facade of Toronto East General became an intimate landmark. For now, it is a place with good memories, though that will no doubt change \u2013 which is precisely how I know my city is home.</p> <p><em>When did you know your new city was home? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/31/new-city-start-feeling-like-home-share-your-story\">Share your moments with us using this form</a> and a selection will be published at Guardian Cities</em></p> <p> </p>",

  "<p>Leading shares are edging lower on the day but still look like posting a more than 1% gain for the month.</p> <p>Banks are among the main gainers, boosted by a number of positive economic signals from the UK despite the Brexit vote, the latest being consumer confidence figures.</p> <p>So <strong>Barclays</strong> is 4.1p better at 173.25p while <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> has been lifted 0.82p to 59.68p. <strong>HSBC</strong>, 10.7p higher at 568.2p, has also been helped by Deutsche Bank analysts raising their target price from 514p to 525p, albeit with a hold rating.</p> <p>The analysts believe the bank may benefit from being broken up, saying the costs of running a global business appear to outweigh the benefits. They said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The announcement of a $2.5bn share buyback at HSBC\u2019s interim results surprised market consensus that had been factoring in the prospect of a dividend cut. In this report we lay out a \u201cCapital Map\u201d for the HSBC Group that shows clearly where the group allocates capital geographically, what the returns generated on that capital are &amp; what the cash dividend paying capability is of each operating company up to the group. This we believe not only helps shed greater light on the sustainability of group dividend but illuminates the areas where the group still has large sums of capital allocated inefficiently. </p> <p>We believe our \u201cCapital map\u201d exercise also sheds greater light on the cost of \u201cbeing HSBC\u201d. Our analysis identifies two clear costs: 1) capital trapped in subsidiaries making sub-cost of equity returns but viewed as essential to generating group-wide synergies (e.g. GBM in the US); 2) the cost of group centre (we estimate this alone is around 2-3% drag on group return on equity). At present we believe there is little compelling evidence that the benefits of running a global HSBC are outweighing these costs. Whilst this remains the case it is hard to see HSBC\u2019s shares out-perform peers with cleaner and less complex business models. </p> <p>The estimated S$4.5bn annual bill for [the holding company] that we estimate in this report plus the capital trapped making sub-par returns in subsidiaries to generate the \u201cnetwork effect\u201d raises more fundamental questions for HSBC. Unless this bill comes down meaningfully in the coming years, or \u201cnetwork\u201d related revenues increase, it remains a considerable drag on group returns, and thus valuation. </p> <p>It may not be the right moment for HSBC to consider a wholesale breakup of the group into 3-4 separate companies \u2013 some Hold Co / central costs would undoubtedly trickle down into the separate business. Indeed there may never be a perfect time, given the risks and frictional costs involved. However, we struggle to think of a time in recent history when the case for a breakup of HSBC has been stronger.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ironically a report in a German newspaper that Deutsche Bank was considering a merger with rival Commerzbank has also helped lift the banking sector. </p> <p>Housebuilders are also higher after <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/31/uk-house-prices-edge-up-in-august-nationwide-says\">Nationwide said house prices rose in August</a></strong>. <strong>Berkeley Group</strong>, likely to be ejected from the FTSE 100 at today\u2019s reshuffle in favour of miner Polymetal International, is 81p better at \u00a326.76 and <strong>Persimmon</strong> has put on 7p to \u00a318.40.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is down 10.43 points at 6810.36, with mining groups pushing the index lower as the strength of the dollar continues to weigh on commodity prices. <strong>Fresnillo</strong> has fallen 52p to \u00a316.38 and <strong>Anglo American</strong> is down 215p at \u00a371.45.</p> <p>Elsewhere equipment rental group <strong>HSS</strong> has slumped 5p to 80p despite a 13.5% rise in half year revenues, as analysts worried about lower operating margins. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/28/888-buying-bookies-win-some-lose-some-gambling\"><strong>Investment group Toscafund wants rival Speedy Hire to merge with HSS</strong></a>.

  "<p>American design student Virginia Gardiner did not expect to end up finding her muse in a toilet, or find power and profit out of poo.</p> <p>She also did not expect to find herself and the waterless toilet she designed for wasteful westerners (originally it was embraced by posh festivalgoers), on the island of Madagascar, piloting a system that turns faecal waste into biogas. <br></p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know about the global sanitation crisis,\u201d says Gardiner, who founded the London-based company <a href=\"https://loowatt.com/global-sanitation-madagascar-toilets/\">Loowatt</a> in 2008. \u201cI wanted to turn the idea of a flushed toilet on its head and say that there should be a waterless toilet that turns shit into a commodity.\u201d </p> <p>Loowatt\u2019s system of an odourless, waterless and contactless toilet, involves a biodegradable liner that wraps human waste and is pulled into a cartridge with the foot pedal.

One of its first investors was living in Madagascar\u2019s hilly capital Antananarivo and invited Gardiner to see the state of sanitation there, starting with the low-lying neighbourhoods where most waste washes up.</p> <p>\u201cEverywhere you look, you just see faeces,\u201d she recalls. \u201cYou can\u2019t look around for more than a few seconds without seeing evidence of faecal contamination, children playing around it and leafy vegetables growing in or around cesspools.\u201d </p> <p>The problem, especially in a city where the water table is only a few feet below the earth, comes from pit latrines being flooded by rains, or people in crowded areas being forced to dump on their own doorstep. </p> <p>\u201cPeople, especially women and children, don\u2019t like to leave the house at night so they use buckets, and very often you\u2019ll see people emptying them into the canals as there\u2019s just nowhere else to put it,\u201d says Gardiner.

She explains that as a latrine is a hole in the ground, flies can go in an out and then might land on food. This has caused diarrhoea-related diseases that have <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-34528978\">stunted more than half the island\u2019s children</a> due to malnutrition. </p> <p>Even if Antananarivo\u2019s residents were conscientious about where they dumped their waste, the city of two million people has no working wastewater plant. \u201cNinety-eight percent of those latrines are emptied by unregulated service providers, so basically the faecal sludge is being dumped all over the city or in rivers just outside,\u201d says Gardiner.</p> <p>In 2012, with pilot funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Loowatt launched its first model in Madagascar named <em>Tsiky, </em> which is Malagasy for \u201csmile\u201d.

Social contact becomes less face-to-face due to the physical and logistical challenges a new baby brings. Leaving the house for a simple errand becomes a near military operation incorporating sleep schedules, changing supplies, feeding equipment. A spontaneous evening out to the cinema with friends? An impossibility. Text messages become almost nostalgic, phone calls time consuming and social media quickly fills the social void for the new parent, who is likely to be surviving on caffeine, chocolate and very little sleep. </p> <p>Connecting with people via social media is immediate, with responses often instant. Positive replies can become an addictive gratification, bringing confirmation of the image people want to project of themselves, be it intelligence, charisma or wit. Social media offers an uninhibited space in which people can express themselves freely, bringing with it the bounty of validation of who they are, where they fit within a social circle and their place within a community. Arguably, this is the essence of good mental health and is particularly pertinent when talking about women - and men - when they have a baby. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>The elephant in the nursery<br></h2> <p>Although social media presents an opportunity to make a connection with other new parents who, reassuringly, may be going through the same uncharted newborn territory, it may reveal the elephant in the nursery. The pressure to appear as the perfect parent is omnipresent online, and these platforms are particularly unhelpful when they present the Hollywood edit of parenthood. Carefully crafted sepia-toned Instagram glimpses of yoga mum or zen dad may actually disguise a multitude of imperfect truths. Research has found <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/falling-through-the-gaps\">there are many barriers to disclosure of perinatal mental health problems</a> including embarrassment, stigma and \u201cfailure at being perceived as not coping\u201d. What role does social media play in facilitating this unhelpful undermining of confidence and capability of a new parents? Is social media a witness to the development of perinatal mental health problems or a sly accomplice?</p> <p>My interest in the relationship between social media and maternal mental health has developed during the five years I have been working as a GP, as well the last 18 months working as a clinical fellow for the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP). Despite mental health problems during the perinatal time affecting <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg192/resources/antenatal-and-postnatal-mental-health-clinical-management-and-service-guidance-35109869806789\">one in five women and one in 10 men</a>, only 50% of these cases are identified, meaning many people are struggling on without receiving appropriate treatment they need. The RCGP is working to raise awareness on these issues, and social media has helped in many of these projects such as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://storify.com/RCGP/mumtalk\">#MumTalk in conjunction with Sport Relief</a> , open access <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/perinatal-mental-health/open-access-sessions/\">e-learning modules in conjunction with Health Education England</a> and most recently the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.rcgp.org.uk/clinical-and-research/toolkits/perinatal-mental-health-toolkit.aspx\">Perinatal Mental Health Toolkit</a> which was launched in July 2016 on the RCGP website. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The toolkit offers more than 300 free resources to help professionals care for those directly affected, as well as information for women who are affected. Social media has helped recruit women with lived experience to contribute in this important work, as well as sharing links across the healthcare online global community. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>Shared support<br></h2> <p>Through this role, I have met many inspiring women who show courage and conviction in telling their stories on blogs, such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/butterflymum83\">Laura Clark @butterflymum83</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/littlemissevec\">Eve @littlemissevec</a>. In sharing their recovery narrative so eloquently, they encourage others to come forward and seek help. There are also Twitter discussion groups, the most established of which is the brilliant <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PNDHour?src=hash\">#PNDHour</a> (weekly, Wednesdays 8-9pm), which is run by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/PNDandMe\">Rosey @PNDandMe</a> and recently hosted by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/cooksferryqueen\">Laura @cooksferryqueen</a>, both of whom have had postnatal depression. This platform in particular is unusual in that health professionals are welcome to contribute \u2013 the voice of a woman with expertise through her experience is considered equal to that of a professional expert by training, and both groups can learn much from each others\u2019 contributions. Misconceptions such as \u201cI thought it meant I was a bad mother\u201d and \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could take antidepressants if I was breastfeeding\u201d are commonly challenged, and damaging myths debunked. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>However, there is a risk that professional boundaries of the doctor/patient relationship become blurred and less visible to both parties, with unintentional consequences possible. This should not discourage GPs from contributing to these forums but the principles guiding their practice in the consultation room should be maintained on line, as discussed in the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.rcgp.org.uk/policy/rcgp-policy-areas/social-media-highway-code.aspx\">RCGP Social Media Highway Code</a>,including respecting privacy, treating others with consideration and maintaining confidentiality. This is in addition to a general consensus within the profession that social media is inappropriate for giving personalised medical advice on an individual basis. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/17/two-in-five-new-dads-concerned-mental-health-problems\">Two in five new dads concerned about mental health problems, survey says</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Peer support or trigger trouble?<br></h2> <p>Another innovative development of digital technology in mental health is online peer support groups. These are often quoted by women with lived experience as an important part of their recovery. One of the most established of these is the one run by the charity <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.app-network.org/peer-support/\">Action of Postpartum Psychosis</a> . Importantly, these groups need moderators who have access to training and clinical supervision so they can redirect someone to seek medical help when appropriate and moderate any unhelpful or unkind behaviour from those participating. This kind of forum may carry \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d. Triggering is a fairly new phrase for a familiar concept of bringing up negative emotions or memories from other people\u2019s words and is also something to be considered when discussing mental health online. Trolling or cyberbullying, misinformation and misdiagnosis are all potential risks from using social media to discuss maternal mental health. But the prospect of reaching so many women who are socially isolated, facing self-stigma or just living with undetected illness and encouraging them to come forward is a persuasive argument for exploring this area further.</p> <p>Social media has been a great driver for recognition of Perinatal mental health,raising professional and public awareness and influencing policymakers and commissioners - most recently future investment from NHS England has been promised. The full benefit of the public and healthcare professionals using social media in the ways described here are only just becoming apparent and are yet to be fully understood, with a quality evidence base slowly developing. So whilst social media is far from a panacea in terms of helping women facing perinatal mental health problems, there is great scope for health professionals to further exploit its full potential.</p> <p><strong>References:</strong></p> <p><strong>Khan L.</strong> Falling through the gaps: perinatal mental health and general practice. 2015; London: Royal College of General Practitioners and Centre for Mental Health. </p> <p><strong>National Institute for Health and Care Excellence</strong>.

  "<p>Does the European commission\u2019s demand that Apple pay a record-breaking \u00a311bn in back taxes to Ireland reflect well on the European Union?</p> <p>Does it justify the British people having opted for Brexit because of the EU\u2019s high-handedness? Or does it suggest that Britain has decided to quit the EU at the very moment it has shown its teeth by bringing a giant corporation to heel?</p> <p>Although national newspapers had different answers to those questions, they did appear united in their belief that Apple itself was in the wrong.

The pro-remain Mirror viewed the tax ruling as <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/voice-mirror-apples-sweetheart-tax-8738085\">\u201ca huge prize for the European Union.\u201d</a> It said: \u201cWe congratulate the European commission for fining the bad Apple but there are more companies spoiling this particular barrel.\u201d</p> <p>No so the Brexit-supporting Telegraph. It viewed the commission\u2019s decision as an interference in the free market, an example of <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2016/08/30/the-eu-is-showing-its-true-colours-high-tax-anti-trade-and-not-f/\">the EU failing to demonstrate a \u201ccommitment to economic openness.\u201d</a> It continued:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cThe European commission\u2019s dealings with Apple and Ireland are a textbook example of what is wrong with the EU, both economically and politically.</p> <p>Economically, a punitive approach to the taxation of highly mobile international corporations is an act of self-harm: such firms can and will relocate to countries that do not seek to milk them for every penny of tax they can.</p> <p>Politically, it is an affront to democracy that the unelected commission in Brussels should presume to dictate to Ireland\u2019s government what taxes it should levy.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The Telegraph sees Brexit as a chance to do as Ireland has done by striking deals with corporations and other non-EU economies.</p> <p>A news story in the fanatically pro-leave Daily Express, headlined <a href=\"http://www.pressreader.com/uk/daily-express/20160831/281522225519021\">\u201cApple\u2019s \u00a311bn tax levy \u2018will benefit UK after Brexit\u2019\u201d</a>, quoted \u201cexperts\u201d who claimed that an EU-free Britain could attract companies bu forging tax deals, \u201cunfettered by Brussels anti-trust rulings.\u201d</p> <p>The Times, which came out in favour of remain ahead of the EU referendum, was scathing about Apple\u2019s tax deal with the Irish authorities. It must pay what it owes, said the paper, and \u201cIreland must tighten its rules.\u201d<br></p> <p>It had little time for the argument that Apple created jobs in lieu of paying tax. Elected governments should worry about jobs, not \u201ctechnology executives\u201d. </p> <p>Conceding that \u201cit will always be difficult to devise a system without loopholes\u201d, the Times urged developed countries to co-operate and companies to \u201cplay fair\u201d so that governments can \u201ctake more of what they are owed.\u2019</p> <p>Brummer\u2019s commentary in the Brexit-supporting Mail was interesting because he praised the EU for its \u201cmost significant drive... to make multinational companies engaged in complex tax avoidance play fair.\u201d He wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cAll this is surprising because generally the EU is a sclerotic and slow-moving organisation. But now the arm that deals with corporate competition has showed itself to have real teeth...</p> <p>The take-no-prisoners intervention of the EU also offers a great contrast to the softly, softly approach of former chancellor George Osborne and Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in their efforts to make Google, Amazon, Starbucks and others pay their fair share of taxes.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>He thought Apple had previously benefitted from a \u201csoft ride\u201d in Europe but regarded \u201cthis economic howitzer launched at Apple\u201d as \u201ca huge step towards a fairer global tax system.\u201d</p> <p>In essence, the Mail\u2019s Brummer was in unusual accord with the Guardian. Its editorial, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/30/the-guardian-view-on-tax-and-ireland-apple-pay-your-way\">Apple, pay your way</a>\u201d, also saw the EU decision as a positive step.</p> <p>Unlike the Telegraph, it argued that Apple\u2019s tax avoidance \u201coffers the voters of Brexit Britain a grim warning of the ever more dysfunctional capitalism being urged on their government by the free-market fundamentalists around the cabinet table and the lobbyists for investment banks and big business.\u201d</p> <p>After examining Apple\u2019s global activities, it pointed to the company\u2019s creation of a \u201cpaper\u201d head office in Ireland where \u201cprofits allocated to it went untaxed\u201d and called it \u201ca version of globalisation taken to its deformed, absurd limit.\u201d</p> <p>As for Apple\u2019s plea about providing jobs in Ireland, the Guardian remarked: </p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cWhen Apple said yesterday that next to no research work was carried out in its European headquarters of Cork, it was both preparing for a legal appeal and giving the game away about the quality of jobs it has actually created in Ireland.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>And it concluded: \u201cThe lessons here for Brexit Britain are unignorable. For a long time, the City of London has functioned as a tax haven... As she maps out the UK\u2019s future outside the EU at Chequers today, Theresa May is under ever more pressure to go further down that route - to turn all of Britain into some lighttouch special enterprise zone, with favours for industries making extravagant promises. </p> <p>\u201cThe lesson of Apple in Ireland is that such promises are never as good as they seem.\u201d</p> <p>The Independent was also worried by <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/imperial-powers-were-the-ones-who-once-divided-and-ruled-now-its-corporations-like-apple-a7216876.html\">\u201chuge and powerful corporations\u201d that \u201coverwhelm small and feeble nation states\u201d</a> in an environment where \u201c\u2018intellectual rights\u2019\u201d can be relocated on a keyboard stroke.\u201d</p> <p>It said: \u201cSuch was all too obviously the case with Ireland, virtually bankrupted by the global financial crisis - and Apple, the world\u2019s richest company by some measures.\u201d<br></p> <p>So \u201cthanks to the European commission, which receives little gratitude whatever it does, Europe\u2019s citizens have discovered the full scale of this abuse.\u201d </p> <p>It contended that \u201cthe EU, by dint of its sheer size as marketplace, has the stature to stand up to the likes of Apple\u201d and continued:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cIt is painful to think what position HM Treasury will be in in these sorts of scraps, post-Brexit. It could follow the Irish example and leave these enterprises virtually untaxed in return for locating jobs in Britain; in which case our European neighbours would be entitled to object to unfair \u2018tax competition\u2019 on such a scale.</p> <p>They might well retaliate by restricting access to the single market still further. We would all be the losers then, except of course for global corporations like Apple, which would find no difficulty in exploiting these arguments to their best advantage.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The Irish Times <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/editorial/the-irish-times-view-a-damning-verdict-in-apple-case-leaves-government-with-little-option-but-to-appeal-1.2773307\">saw it somewhat differently</a>: \u201cIreland has always presented itself as having a tax system with a clear legal underpinning, offering certainty to companies. </p> <p>\u201cRightly or wrongly the judgment casts doubt over the way we taxed at least one major corporation \u2013 and this carries with it reputational damage for Ireland.\u201d It said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cThe damning verdict by the commission on how tax was applied in the Apple case leaves the [Irish] government with little option but to lodge an appeal, given the central importance of foreign direct investment to our economy...</p> <p>The Irish side is insistent that the commission has erred legally, as is Apple. Ireland will also claim an infringement on our tax sovereignty.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>But, like UK newspapers, it understood that \u201cbig US companies have used the interplay of European and US tax laws to pay very little tax on profits earned in European markets... There is no doubt that this needs to change and that the amounts paid by many of these companies has been indefensibly low.\u201d</p> <p>I applaud the Irish Times\u2019s columnist, Fintan O\u2019Toole, for arguing that <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/we-should-collect-apple-s-13-billion-and-change-ireland-1.2773136\">Ireland should take the money</a> and then use it \u201cproperly and rigorously\u201d in order to make \u201can epoch-making, transformational intervention\u201d for the good of the Irish people.</p>",

Australia needs a set of measures \u2013 in other words, a policy toolkit \u2013 that is well calibrated to capture reductions in different sectors.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cspecial review\u201d and associated electricity modelling report recommended an intensity-based scheme for the electricity sector, where dirtier operations are more heavily penalised. It said the baseline should be reduced over time, and reach zero \u201cwell before 2050\u201d.</p> <p>Generators would have access to credits to help them stay within the baselines, making the system a type of emissions trading scheme.</p> <p>The review also recommended the government strengthen its \u201csafeguards\u201d policy, which sets limits on how much greenhouse gas Australia\u2019s biggest polluters can emit but is now so generous it doesn\u2019t act to reduce emissions.</p> <p>It says the baselines should decline over time, \u201cin line with Australia\u2019s Paris commitments\u201d, and be extended to apply to more facilities.</p> <p>The review said facilities covered by the safeguards mechanism could trade carbon credits to help reduce emissions, making the system a second emissions trading scheme. \u201cWe also think that an enhanced safeguard mechanism offers a pragmatic and durable way of reducing emissions across a range of industrial, manufacturing and resource sectors,\u201d Craik said.</p> <p>For sectors not covered by those two policies, the review recommended a suite of regulations, including emissions reduction standards for light vehicles, and recommended a \u201ccost-benefit analysis\u201d be conducted to examine carbon dioxide standards for heavy vehicles.</p> <p>Energy efficiency information and regulations for buildings and homes should be continued and strengthened, the review recommended. It also called for an examination of the policies to be conducted every five years, starting in 2022.</p> <p>In a media release, Craik said the report did not seek to reassess Australia\u2019s 2030 targets, instead focusing on \u201cpolicy actions that Australia should take to meet its Paris obligations\u201d.</p> <p>But since Australia\u2019s 2030 targets are widely acknowledged as inconsistent with agreements made at Paris, some people \u2013 including two members of the authority \u2013think the organisation has not met the terms of reference for its review.</p> <p>The review was commissioned by the government in December 2014 to advise it as to whether Australia should institute an emissions trading scheme, and was ordered to consider any international agreements Australia has entered into.</p> <p>In December 2015 Australia signed the Paris agreement, in which governments agreed to limit global warming to \u201cwell below 2C\u201d and to aim to limit it to just 1.5C.

But the key to defining a geological age is finding global physical evidence of the transition that will be preserved for future geologists, and the chubby modern chicken eaten worldwide is a prime candidate. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/29/declare-anthropocene-epoch-experts-urge-geological-congress-human-impact-earth\">The Anthropocene epoch: scientists declare dawn of human-influenced age</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Prof Jan Zalasiewicz, a geologist at the University of Leicester and the chair of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://quaternary.stratigraphy.org/workinggroups/anthropocene/\">Working Group on the Anthropocene</a>, said: \u201cIt has become the world\u2019s most common bird. It has been fossilised in thousands of landfill sites and on street corners around the world.\u201d</p> <p>Global consumption of chicken expanded enormously as factory farming took off after the second world war, at a time when industrialisation and population growth made humanity the planet\u2019s primary driving force. Chickens are the world\u2019s most populous bird, with almost 60 billion killed a year.</p> <p>The chicken\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.iatp.org/blog/201303/how-the-chicken-of-tomorrow-became-the-chicken-of-the-world\">rise to global avian domination</a> took off in 1945, when the the US government and major poultry company A&amp;P announced a competition to breed the \u201cchicken of tomorrow\u201d, a bird that would grow fatter and more quickly than ever. The winner, called Arbor Acres, still dominates the genetic stock of domestic chickens around the world.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-the-chicken-conquered-the-world-87583657/#qK1KeJ61GWwDl8wC.99\">chicken was first domesticated</a> between 7,000 and 10,000 years ago from the red junglefowl, <em tabindex=\"-1\">Gallus gallus</em>, native to south-east Asia. The wild bird was a poor flier, making it the perfect catch. Over subsequent millennia, the bird was carried all over the world, giving it the global presence so useful to the Anthropocene geologists.</p> <p>However, even in the early 20th century, chickens were primarily sources of eggs. Male birds and exhausted egg layers were eaten, but only as a luxury on special occasions. The transition to the ubiquitous meat of today began with the discovery of vitamin D in the 1920s, meaning that the birds could be housed indoors all year round, rather than let out in the summer to soak up sunlight.</p> <p>After the second world war, large companies, particularly in the US, began to integrate hatcheries, grain supplies and slaughtering facilities into enormous battery farms. Vaccines and antibiotics enabled the birds to survive the close confinement and, by the 1950s, chickens that had taken 18 weeks to fatten up at the turn of the 20th century took six weeks to be ready for the chop.</p> <p>In 1950, British households <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/FILES/management/050.pdf\">ate about 1 million chickens</a>, but by 1965, they gobbled up 150 million. Another result of industrialisation was the greatest decline in domestic chicken diversity in history, with half or more of all <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/04/science/04obchicken.html\">ancestral chicken breeds now lost</a>. This makes the bird even more suitable as the type fossil of the Anthropocene. The same chicken leaves bones, bigger and differently shaped to its ancestors, all over the world.</p> <p>The domestic chicken\u2019s dominance was further increased in recent decades by the increase and liberalisation of global trade, along with the spread of industrial farming: about 75% of the world\u2019s chicken meat still comes from factory farms. The bird\u2019s trajectory remains upwards, with the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation projecting that it will be the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-satisfy-the-worlds-surging-appetite-for-meat-1449238059\">world\u2019s most eaten meat</a> by weight by 2020, overtaking pork. China, the US, Indonesia and Brazil are the world\u2019s biggest producers.</p> <p>It has been a long journey for a little bird that once scratched away at forest floors for insects, seeds and fruit. But despite the countless billions killed to feed humanity\u2019s seemingly insatiable appetite for its mild flesh, the domestic chicken looks set to be granted immortality.</p>",

Remember back then Morrison argued there were excesses in the system and had to tiptoe back after cabinet decided against it. <strong>Sid Maher</strong> in the Oz has the <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/treasury/turnbull-and-morrison-supported-negative-gearing-shift/news-story/582c5b4f48784e8d20ac1573041aafa1\">report here</a>. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In The Turnbull Gamble,<em> </em>the \u00adauthors reveal the prime minister and the treasurer were \u201call in favour\u2019\u2019 of making changes to negative gearing but in a \u201cmore considered\u201d and \u201cless extreme way\u201d than Labor had.</p> <p>Asked about the revelations in the book yesterday, a senior source confirmed Mr Turnbull and Mr Morrison had been in favour of changes to negative gearing to remove excesses from the system. One theory put to the Australian<em> </em>yesterday was Mr Turnbull was keen to pursue the change as a counter to attacks on his wealth and improve his status with lower and middle-income earners.</p> <p>A government spokesman said both the prime minister and the treasurer were vehemently opposed to Labor\u2019s negative gearing changes.</p> <p>In their book, van Onselen and Errington write: \u201cThe issue was debated in cabinet, with <strong>Peter Dutton, Josh Frydenberg </strong>and<strong> Christian Porter</strong> arguing against making any changes.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>All three supported <strong>Mr \u00adAbbott</strong> in the leadership ballot that elevated Mr Turnbull to the leadership in September last year.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is vindication for Labor who took their difficult policy to wind back generous tax concessions on capital gains and negative gearing to the last election.

  "<p>After Brexit, Londoners were heard muttering about having \u201cmore in common with Paris than Preston\u201d; some 70,000 people signed an online petition calling for the capital to secede from the UK. If that unlikely event should ever happen, the new city state could perhaps look to <em>Curiocity</em> for its little red book. Or, more accurately, its whopping great red book, since Henry Eliot and Matt Lloyd-Rose\u2019s cloth-bound, illustrated treasury of London-related data, tips, impressions, recommendations, instructions, injunctions, reminiscences, myths, lists, plans, flow charts and much else besides runs to more than 450 tactile paper pages. At this juncture, almost everything about it feels purposely, almost comically, designed to rub regional Brexiters up the wrong way.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Almost everything about it feels purposely, almost comically, designed to rub regional Brexiters up the wrong way</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For a start, its co-authors are youngish and have nothing but love for the capital. One of them, Lloyd-Rose, having decamped to Argentina in 2015 after seven years in London and a shared flat in Crouch End, filed his contributions from Buenos Aires \u2013 a detail trumpeted with a degree of global go-getting pride in the accompanying biographical notes. It also may explain the passing reference to a Jorge Luis Borges story in the introduction, and the hint in a section on dating that the <a href=\"http://www.negrachatangoclub.com/\" title=\"\">Negracha Tango House</a> in Holborn is the ideal place to take a date to if you want to reach third base.</p> <p><em>Curiocity</em> began life in 2009 as an easily pocketable, fold-out map-magazine that ran to six editions. This new, scarcely backpack-able volume, arranged in an A-Z format, also has cartography at its heart. Playful hand\u2011drawn pictorial maps by cartoonist Stephen Appleby and others \u2013 on such themes as London Utopia or featuring the Empire Windrush bobbing on the Thames \u2013 crop up with the regularity of&#xa0;Dot Cotton in <em>EastEnders</em>. Phyllis Pearsall, the progenitor of the London street atlas, is cited as inspiration, alongside the lexicographer and coiner of that most tiresome observation about tiredness of the capital, Dr&#xa0;Samuel Johnson.</p> <p>The ghost of quite another London Johnson \u2013 Boris \u2013 hangs over its Tiggerish authors\u2019 occasionally florid outbreaks of boosterism. (They do, however, rightly credit his mayoral predecessor Ken Livingstone for the \u201cBoris Bike\u201d cycling scheme.) Ultimately, this book is much more a product of Silicon Roundabout than Grub Street. While there are brief pieces from a former lord mayor, the astronomer royal and the writers Philip&#xa0;Pullman, Monica Ali and Nick Papadimitriou, a lengthy list of Twitter handles at the back credits unspecified contributions from the hive mind of social media.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The ghost of quite another Johnson \u2013 Boris \u2013 hangs over its Tiggerish authors\u2019 florid outbreaks of boosterism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Indeed the layout of the book, with its plethora of infographics, countless footnotes and cross-references to other&#xa0;sections, invites \u2013 quite possibly induces \u2013 internet-stye browsing of its pages. The pleasurably apocryphal can sometimes get crushed by qualifiers, and the fascinating lost amid dull exposition. A degree of press release cut-and-paste is also in evidence.

In 1977, the squatter residents of Freston Road in Notting Hill attempted to establish the breakaway <a href=\"http://www.frestonia.org/\" title=\"\">Independent Republic of Frestonia</a>; its citizens all adopted the surname Bramley in a bid to confuse local council officials intent on evicting them.

Symbolic attacks on places of worship are just one example.</p> <p>One way to appreciate the sharp escalation of conflict in Indonesia is to compare pre-1998 and post-1998 rates of attacks on places of worship. Prior to the democratic transition in 1998, there were reportedly over 450 attacked or closed during Suharto\u2019s regime (1966-1998).</p> <p>Since 1998, civil society organisations have documented a sharp rise in attacks against minority groups. In the first 10 years of democratisation, close to 600 churches were attacked, damaged or forced to close. This trend continues.</p> <p>While tensions between radical Islamists and Christians are well known, in recent years targeted campaigns have been directed against Shia Muslims, Ahmadiyah and Confucians.</p> <p>There has been an increase in attacks on the places of worship of minority communities. There have also been moves by Islamic leaders to ban minority groups by issuing fatwa (an Islamic legal opinion) or by pressuring local government officials to issue regulations that outlaw its activities. It is this combination of tactics \u2013 violence, intimidation campaigns and the use of law \u2013 that is most concerning.</p> <p>The explanation for this is clear. Democratisation has not only created greater freedom of expression, but in the absence of a strong state has amplified the demands of radical Islamic groups.</p> <p>In addition to democratisation, the shift to decentralisation has politicised religion at the local level. This means that in the competitive political environment, local politicians have become increasingly influenced by vocal Islamic leaders and their demands that the state enforce a certain form of Islamic orthodoxy.</p> <p>Of course local governments, with the exception of Aceh, do not actually have the power to use law to regulate religious practice.

Starting in 2008 but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/17/brazil-petrobras-scandal-oil-general-election\">ramping up in 2014</a>, federal police, prosecutors and judges have uncovered a multibillion-dollar kickback and bribery scandal at the state-run oil firm Petrobras, the biggest company in Latin America until the scandal hit.</p> <p>Essentially, contracts were inflated so up to 3% of funds could be channelled to the three parties that previously formed a ruling coalition: the Workers party, the Democratic Movement party of Brazil (PMDB) and the Progressive party.

No single party has ever come close to a commanding majority in Congress, so support is bought with cabinet posts and/or cash.</p> <h2>Who is making the accusations?</h2> <p>The investigation is nationwide, but the charge is being led by judicial figures in the southern city of Curitiba.

Prosecutors have found no evidence that she was involved and even her enemies acknowledge that she is one of the few politicians in Brazil not to accept bribes.</p> <p>However, it is widely assumed that Rousseff must have known what was going on because she was a former energy minister and chief of staff at the height of the wrongdoing. Many of her confidants have been arrested or are on trial. Whether she was aware of what was going on or not, she benefited from the campaign funds and failed to halt the corruption. Prosecutors allege she also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/17/brazil-judge-lula-da-silva-appointment-cabinet-wiretap-scandal-rousseff\">tried to obstruct their investigation</a> and protect her ally Lula by appointing him to the cabinet. </p> <h2>Is that why Rousseff was being impeached?</h2> <p>Only partly, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/12/the-guardian-view-on-dilma-rousseffs-impeachment-the-political-system-should-be-on-trial-not-one-woman\">for all the wrong reasons</a>. Rousseff has ostensibly been thrown out of office because she window-dressed government accounts ahead of the last presidential election. The charge is that her government filled holes in its accounts by taking loans from state banks without congressional approval.</p> <p>Opponents say this creative accounting \u2013 accounting sleights of hand known as \u201cpedaladas\u201d (pedalling) \u2013 allowed the administration to fund a program for family farmers using money that was not reimbursed until several months later, bypassing Congress, creating a misleading impression of state finances and adding to economic instability.</p> <p>In her defence, Rousseff said the money was not a loan because it was simply being transferred through the state banks from public coffers. Similar practices had also been used by previous administrations, though not at the same scale.</p> <p>But this is a pretext. The real reasons for impeachment are political. Rousseff is enormously unpopular because she is blamed for the multiple crises facing the country and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/09/dilma-rousseff-brazil-impeachment-fight-congress-vote\">has proved an inept leader</a>. But Brazil\u2019s constitution does not allow a no-confidence vote to eject her from office so her enemies are using impeachment to do the job.</p> <p>Some are clearly motivated by a desire to kill the Lava Jato investigation, which Rousseff refused to do. The impeachment process was initiated by Cunha after the Workers party refused to protect him from an ethics committee investigation. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/brazil-dilma-rousseff-plot-secret-phone-transcript-impeachment\">Secretly recorded conversations</a> have also revealed that the PMDB leader in the Senate, Romero Juc\u00e1, wanted to remove the president so the Lava Jato investigation could be choked by her successor.</p> <h2>Where does that leave interim president Michel Temer?</h2> <p>Rousseff\u2019s centre-right successor is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/03/brazil-michel-temer-dilma-rousseff-impeachment\">almost as despised</a> as his predecessor after helping lead the campaign to bring down his running mate, then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/13/brazil-dilma-rousseff-impeachment-michel-temer-cabinet\">naming an all-male, all-white cabinet</a> and losing three ministers to the Lava Jato scandal in his first month in office.

But none of the alternatives are popular. Temer\u2019s administration has ratings in the low teens. Lula\u2019s popularity is higher, but he is also hated by more people.

I know my worth in London from my time working there.\u201d His work in the capital tends to be for global companies (which are able to pay more); London costs and average salary are also higher than in the regions. </p> <p>Bridges has found that recruitment agencies tend to set a ballpark figure for freelancers, according to their experience, from which to begin negotiations between the client and the freelancer. </p> <p>Marshall acknowledges there are situations where freelancers need to compromise with the client. \u201cWhat\u2019s essential is that you consider your overheads and how much you need to live on, and make sure any deal you make doesn\u2019t leave you short,\u201d he says. </p> <p>However, it is worth setting a minimum amount you will work for and not budging from it. \u201cI regularly get asked if I will lower my rate, but you must know your worth,\u201d says Addison. \u201cI do find that the good companies, which will pay the going rate and pay on time, respect you more for knowing what your services are worth.\u201d</p> <p>As a freelancer, it is not uncommon to receive emails requesting that you work for no pay in return for exposure. This is a concern throughout the creative sector and has led to the creation of the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/263804607094399/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stop Working For Free</a> Facebook group, which has attracted more than 20,000 members. </p> <p>IPSE, meanwhile, has worked with <a href=\"https://freelancerclub.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Freelancer Club</a> (a creative community that supports freelancers) to produce a <a href=\"https://freelancerclub.net/resources/nofreework\" rel=\"nofollow\">code of conduct</a> to promote more ethical practices; it is available for freelancers, brands and employers to sign.</p> <p>Marshall says: \u201cIf you feel that taking on free work is the only way to build your portfolio, consider whether you\u2019re actually adding value for your client\u2019s business \u2013 and you almost invariably will be \u2013 so ask them why that value can\u2019t translate into a paid salary.\u201d</p> <p>But for those who have changed industries, it can be tempting to work for no pay to build a portfolio. York-based freelancer <a href=\"http://www.suzieyorkphotography.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Suzanne Braithwaite</a> experienced this when she swapped journalism for photography last year. She says: \u201cI felt at the time it was a needs-must to start the business, but it was only for a very short period.

  "<p>On a sultry Saturday evening in August, hundreds of young Kievans have descended on a vast courtyard a few miles from the city centre.

Its slow-drip, two-and-a-half-year conflict with Russia has killed nearly 10,000 people and displaced about two million in the east of the country. But if the Maidan revolution<strong>,</strong> which ousted a Russia-friendly regime in February 2014, has largely failed to install the transparent, democratic government its proponents envisioned, it at least appears to have democratised Ukrainian culture.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Young Ukrainians today \u2013\u00a0they are so free, and the revolution moved them, spurred them</p> <footer> <cite>Ivan Kozlenko</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bold young artists, promoters, entrepreneurs and officials have quietly begun to transform this city of three million into a hotbed of urban creativity, with innovative theatre, outdoor concerts and food events, a slew of smart bars and cafes, and a flowering of film production and appreciation. </p> <p>\u201cPeople stopped being afraid, after Maidan,\u201d says Ivan Kozlenko, the 35-year-old general director of Ukraine\u2019s national film archives. \u201cNobody\u2019s afraid any more to say what they believe, to express their visions, their ideas.

And of course, the Ukrainian singer Jamala won Eurovision 2016 with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/13/eurovision-2016-ukraine-singer-urges-vote-for-crimean-ballad\">a song about the suffering of Crimean Tatars</a>.</p> <p>But film may be Kiev\u2019s current hottest medium. The Russian Woodpecker, a documentary about one Kiev artist\u2019s bizarrely compelling spin on Russian imperialism, took the <a href=\"http://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/sundance-film-review-the-russian-woodpecker-1201420640/\">grand-jury prize</a> for world documentaries at last year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival. And Ukrainian-made docs about Maidan have won several top festival prizes; one, Winter on Fire, was nominated for the best feature documentary Oscar. </p> <p>Kozlenko has worked tirelessly to promote Ukrainian film, screening silent classics at major film festivals in Berlin, Cannes, and Karlovy Vary, and at the archives\u2019 headquarters, known as the <a href=\"http://www.dovzhenkocentre.org/eng/\">Dovzhenko Centre</a>. He has also developed innovative funding methods such as renting out unused building space, and recently launched a major renovation at Dovzhenko; a film museum is also set to open next spring.</p> <p>\u201cIvan has managed to single-handedly get the Dovzhenko Centre from an actual crumbling building into a legitimate cultural centre,\u201d says Myroslava Hartmond, the Ukrainian-British owner of Kiev\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TriptychGlobalArtsWorkshop/\">Triptych: Global Arts Workshop</a>.</p> <p>Hartmond and others, meanwhile, have sought to bring high-minded works to the masses.

Corruption remains <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/08/01/kiev-in-denial-ukraine-poroshenko-corruption/\">deeply endemic</a>. Unemployment hovers at around 10%, and the economy is still sluggish. Locals complain of huge potholes, pricey public services, and no parking.</p> <p>Kiev also appears to have become a more dangerous place of late. Serious crimes have more than doubled nationally since 2013, <a href=\"http://m.nv.ua/publications/stranu-nakryla-kriminalnaja-epidemija-nv-28-188138.html\">according to</a> the local weekly New Time. And in July, prominent journalist Pavel Sheremet was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/20/ukraine-journalist-pavel-sheremet-killed-kiev-car-bombing\">killed by a car bomb</a> in broad daylight on a busy street in central Kiev. </p> <p>But while some may dismiss the city\u2019s new ferment as just the latest chapter in the globalisation of hipster culture, Kiev\u2019s newfound creativity marks a shaking off of the Soviet mindset, a breaking away from a past where new ideas and free thinking occurred only underground.</p> <p>Consider that courtyard party. To boost revenues and attract Kiev\u2019s youth, last year Kozlenko rented an entire floor of Dovzhenko to Plivka, a group known for organising all-night raves. Plivka and another outfit, Rhythm Buro, put together that party \u2013 the first event in Dovzhenko\u2019s backyard \u2013 and in the process likely awakened hundreds of young Kievans to their national film archives. </p> <p>Slowly, even the government\u2019s top-down Soviet style appears to be shifting toward <em>glasnost</em>. \u201cBefore Maidan, our ministry would decide what each group or theatre should perform,\u201d says Ukraine\u2019s culture minister Yevhen Nyshchuk \u2013 a former actor and a prominent figure during the Maidan protests \u2013 during an interview in a stately conference room at his ministry.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We encourage self-expression.

But Freya Levy, 20, has had to live in sheltered accommodation for the over-60s since April because it was the only accessible option offered to her by her local council when she became homeless.</p> <p>Levy, who has been playing<em> </em>wheelchair basketball for four years, has muscular dystrophy. When the tenancy on the privately rented home where she lived with her mother and brother in Rayleigh in Essex wasn\u2019t renewed at the end of last year, the family couldn\u2019t find another property for all of them that had a ramp to the front door or a downstairs bathroom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"864c288802218e49640999fda6179de138374707\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/864c288802218e49640999fda6179de138374707/0_149_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Freya Levy defends the ball during the wheelchair basketball at the 2013 Sainsbury\u0092s School Games.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Freya Levy defends the ball during the wheelchair basketball at the 2013 Sainsbury\u0092s School Games.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Marshall/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To get a roof over their heads the family had to split up. Her mum was in a flat, her brother at their grandma\u2019s. Levy lived at a Premier Inn hotel for two months borrowing money from a friend to pay the hotel bills of at least \u00a340 a night.</p> <p>In April, Rochford district council accepted that Levy was officially homeless and offered her emergency accommodation, in a building with a broken lift. With nowhere else to go, she moved into the only accessible option the council gave her: a block of flats for older people.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just desperate for my own little bungalow that\u2019s accessible so I can get on with growing up,\u201d says Levy. \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating to know that if I was able-bodied, I would not at the age of 20 be in sheltered accommodation for the over-60s.\u201d</p> <p>Not only is it tough to be in this environment where she is often lonely, but it has put paid to her chances of competing at the Rio 2016 Paralympics which start next week. Levy had trials to be part of the GB Paralympic wheechair basketball team, but was forced to pull out because the rules of the sheltered housing scheme require her to sleep there every night. In order to try out for Rio she would have had to stay at the Paralympic training programme in Worcester every other week from spring.</p> <p>Levy says that she was \u201cgutted\u201d to miss out on taking part in the Paralympics, but the stress of her housing situation would have made it impossible for her to stay motivated enough to compete. \u201cMy energy was spent on finding somewhere to sleep that night and then somewhere more permanent.\u201d</p> <p>When the London 2012 Paralympic Games brought disability into the country\u2019s living rooms, there was an optimism, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19417094\">encouraged by the rhetoric of politicians</a>, that the event would mark a turning point to greater equality for the <a href=\"http://www.dlf.org.uk/content/key-facts\">more than 10 million disabled people in Britain</a>.</p> <p>But listen to disabled people like Levy and the reality has been damningly different: from continued inaccessible housing and deepening poverty to the dismantling of state support. According to a<a href=\"http://www.scope.org.uk/press-releases/rj-mitte-calls-more-disabled-people-tv\"> new survey by the disability charity, Scope, </a>more than three-quarters of disabled people say coverage of the London Paralympics had a positive impact on the public\u2019s attitudes to disability, but access to basic rights is still often out of reach. Britain\u2019s equality watchdog warned just last month that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/19/people-with-disabilities-treated-like-second-class-citizens-says-watchdog\">disabled people are being treated like \u201csecond-class citizens</a>\u201d. Branding it society\u2019s \u201cbadge of shame\u201d, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) pointed to inequalities such as the lack of political representation, the failure to make adjustments to housing, and the deficit in access to anything from transport and sports stadiums to music venues. It also announced a series of inquiries, including one into the pay gap between disabled and non-disabled workers, and another into the impact of social security changes.</p> <p>This comes at the same time as the UK is being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/20/un-inquiry-uk-disability-rights-violations-cprd-welfare-cuts\">investigated by the United Nations for alleged grave and systematic violations of disabled people\u2019s rights</a> as a result of government welfare reforms \u2013 notably the first country in the world to be under such.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You are simply not allowed to be chronically sick or disabled any more.

At the same time, punitive work measures have been brought in, including <a href=\"http://www.benefitsandwork.co.uk/news/2865-coalition-wages-war-on-disabled-with-580-increase-in-esa-sanction\">a 580% increase in benefit sanctions against sick and disabled claimants</a> between March 2013 and March 2014, and the acceleration of the highly controversial work capability assessment (WCA), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/27/thousands-died-after-fit-for-work-assessment-dwp-figures\">sparking ongoing investigations into deaths and suicides of disabled people</a> who had recently been found fit to work.</p> <p>\u201cI suffered a breakdown about a week afterwards,\u201d says Handel Thomas who applied for the sickness benefit, Employment and Support Allowance last June. Thomas, 35, had been forced to leave his job as a charity support worker in Swansea during the spring due to worsening depression. \u201cToo many sick days,\u201d he says. On the day of his WCA, he told the nurse conducting the test that he was considering suicide. Regardless of this, he was awarded zero points and declared \u201cfit for work\u201d. He appealed but the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) upheld the decision. \u201cBy this point, I was broke, unwell and quite frankly terrified,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d worked all my life but I felt like I was being accused of being a liar or a skiver.\u201d</p> <p>Jo Cole, in Stockton-On-Tees, says: \u201cYou are simply not allowed to be chronically sick or disabled any more. She adds: \u201cI\u2019m one of many who has had their life dismantled.\u201d A brain tumour left Cole, 60, partially deaf in 2013 and chronic osteoarthritis means she regularly trips and falls (she\u2019s broken her arm and four toes since becoming disabled). For more than a decade she has used part of her disability living allowance to lease a car under the <a href=\"http://www.motability.co.uk/\">Motability scheme</a>, which, in her words, has stopped her being housebound. But after being partly rejected for DLA\u2019s replacement support, personal independence payments (PIP) last month, she was forced to give up her car.</p> <p>\u201cIt broke my heart to hand it back,\u201d she says. Without her car, Cole, a part-time manager for a charity, would have no way to get to work, the hospital, or help her ill daughter. Motability agreed to give Cole a one-off charitable payment of \u00a32,000 but, in order to buy another car, her husband has \u201cmaxed out\u201d his credit card and the family now has to find \u00a3300 a month to pay off the new car: money they would normally save to pay heating bills during the winter to stop Cole getting seriously ill from the cold.</p> <p>\u201cSince the PIP notice, I\u2019ve not had a night\u2019s sleep and am exhausted and racked with pain,\u201d Cole says. \u201cI think stress is reacting with [my medication] causing my hair to fall out again.\u201d</p> <p>Since PIP was introduced in April 2013, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/07/pip-disaster-disabled-access-report-benefits\">up to 500 disabled people</a> each week have had to hand back their Motability vehicles, many of which would have been specially adapted to meet their specific needs.</p> <p>The campaign group, Disabled People Against Cuts (DPAC)is launching <a href=\"http://dpac.uk.net/2016/08/rightsnotgames-week-of-action-september-4th-10th/\">a series of austerity protests in a week of action to time with the Rio Paralympics</a>. It says that over the past few years, the series of cuts to disability benefits and support have turned back the clock on disabled people\u2019s rights by decades. \u201cThese are attacks in every area of our lives,\u201d says Ellen Clifford, from DPACs national steering group. \u201cSupport to eat, drink and use the toilet is being taken away.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06a15e5308cc4f2f75e7847f8460c439bb219d87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06a15e5308cc4f2f75e7847f8460c439bb219d87/0_188_5642_3385/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alice Dunn faced seven months on a waiting list for a wheelchair from the NHS.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alice Dunn faced seven months on a waiting list for a wheelchair from the NHS.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even something as fundamental as a wheelchair is not always available to disabled people now. When 20-year-old Alice Dunn became suddenly unable to walk last summer, she went to her GP for a referral to wheelchair services. But Dunn, a student from Manchester who has <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ehlers-danlos-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome</a> \u2013 an inherited condition that weakens connective tissue \u2013 was told she would have to wait seven months for an appointment. \u201cIt was so long, I would have had to drop out of university while waiting,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Without any help from the NHS, Dunn bought a \u00a3200 wheelchair online. Because it was cheap and ill-fitting, after trying to propel herself, she dislocated her elbow and has been left with permanent damage. To buy a suitable wheelchair, Dunn had to borrow \u00a32,500 from her family. Paying them back got even harder, she says, when she was rejected for PIP this year.</p> <p>Whether it is cuts to housing, benefits, or transport, the deficit in support for disabled people is in the context of existing, widespread poverty. <a href=\"http://npi.org.uk/publications/income-and-poverty/disability-and-poverty/\">Almost half of people in poverty in the UK are either disabled </a>themselves or in a household with a disabled person, according to the latest research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the New Policy Institute. Since the 2012 Paralympics,<a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/coalition-cuts-plunged-300000-more-6061959\"> a further 300,000 disabled people are living in poverty</a>.</p> <p>A DWP spokeswoman says: \u201cWe\u2019re committed to creating a Britain that works for everyone and our welfare reforms are helping more people find and stay in work. As well as offering the targeted support disabled people need to live independent lives, we are spending nearly \u00a350bn a year to support people with disabilities or health conditions.\u201d </p> <p>The DWP adds that sanctions are now dropping and each month on average more than 99% of ESA claimants were not sanctioned in the past year after March 2014. <br></p> <p> Back in Essex, a spokesman for Rochford council says: \u201cDue to a shortage of suitable housing within our district, particularly for residents with disabilities, finding accommodation poses a challenge. In some cases it may involve short-term placing them in sheltered accommodation as this may be the only accessible housing on offer. We will seek to find alternative accommodation when a more suitable placement becomes available.\u201d</p> <p>Levy says she is now relying on help from the charity Muscular Dystrophy UK to find a way out. Its 2015 report, <a href=\"http://www.musculardystrophyuk.org/news/news/breaking-point-the-crisis-in-accessible-housing-and-adaptations/\">Breaking Point</a>, found that 70% of councils who responded to its Freedom Of Information requests did not have a single accessible wheelchair house available, leaving people trapped in unsuitable housing. The charity is currently working on five cases for people in equally troubling situations as Levy.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a very damaging housing crisis that requires immediate focus from the government and councils to ensure more accessible housing is urgently made available,\u201d says a Muscular Dystrophy spokeswoman.<br></p> <p>As for Levy\u2019s Paralympic dream, she says: \u201cNow I\u2019m looking ahead to 2020, 2024, 2028 \u2026\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Conservationists have long known that it\u2019s hard \u2013 and in some cases \u2013 nearly impossible to survive as a tiger in Southeast Asia. Burning forests, high human populations and unflagging demand for tiger blood, tiger skin and crushed tiger bone means the big cats have to tread a daily gauntlet of snares, guns and desperate poachers. Now, conservationists are discovering, belatedly, that the same is largely true for leopards. <br></p> <p>A sobering <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320716302658\">new study</a> in Biological Conservation has found that the Indochinese leopard \u2013 a distinct subspecies \u2013 may be down to less than 1,000 individuals. And in the best-case scenario only 2,500 animals survive \u2013 less than the human population of Farmsfield village in Nottinghamshire.</p> <p>\u201cMost people assume that leopards are still common everywhere, whereas everybody probably knows by now that tigers and lions have become very rare in the wild,\u201d said co-author of the study, Jan Kamler with <a href=\"https://www.panthera.org/\">Panthera</a>. </p> <p>This has been in part due to the fact that leopards have been less rigorously studied than tigers and lions, but also the longtime assumption that leopards are more adaptable than many other big cats and therefore able to survive in more degraded habitats, on a wider variety of prey and closer to human dwellings. But even the leopard\u2019s supposed plasticity has not been enough to save them across most of Southeast Asia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6ebb36a910b679c380753592bd988ba52ec86e21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ebb36a910b679c380753592bd988ba52ec86e21/0_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A spotted leopard in Cambodia.

They are extinct in Singapore and are potentially extinct in Laos and Vietnam. Meanwhile, the few individuals hanging on in China are not expected to survive. </p> <p>Kamler said the illegal wildlife trade is the biggest factor behind this massive decline. </p> <p>\u201cIn particular, many areas have experienced epidemic levels of snaring, for wild meat and animal parts, which have devastated leopard populations in the region.\u201d </p> <p>Snares are rife across forests in Southeast Asia. Poachers may not be looking to kill a leopard \u2013 they may be after tigers for their body parts or small game for local consumption \u2013 but snares are indiscriminate killers. They will injure or kill any animal that stumbles on them them. Conservationists have warned for years that the forests of Southeast Asia are being <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2012/02/majority-of-protected-tropical-forests-empty-due-to-hunting/\">emptied</a> by overhunting for food, traditional medicine and the pet trade. And the Indochinese leopard is just one of thousands of victims in this local eradication of any living thing bigger than a mouse or a sparrow, a process that has come to be known as <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2014/07/its-not-just-extinction-meet-defaunation/\">defaunation</a>. <br></p> <p>At the same time, Indochinese leopards have been hit hard by deforestation, prey declines and what seems to be an increasing trade in leopard parts, including skins and bones. </p> <p>Although the Indochinese leopard was historically found in habitats across the region, the study found just two remaining strongholds for the subspecies: peninsular Malaysia and the Northern Tenasserim Forest Complex (spanning the border of Thailand and Myamnar). A third site was identified as a priority \u2013 the eastern plains region of Cambodia \u2013 due to the fact that the small population of leopards here have evolved some wild daring behaviors. <br></p> <h2><strong>Cambodia\u2019s banteng-hunting leopards </strong></h2> <p>Leopards are known for tackling an increadly wide variety of prey, but much of that is small and medium-bodied. Not so of Cambodia\u2019s leopards. An upcoming study by Susana Rostro-Garcia, a research student with <a href=\"https://www.wildcru.org/\">Wildlife Research Conservation Unit </a>(WildCRU), found that male leopards in Cambodia\u2019s dry forests routinely tackled one of the biggest animals in the area: <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2012/01/forgotten-species-the-wild-jungle-cattle-called-banteng/\">banteng</a>. These distinctly-coloured wild cattle \u2013 themselves endangered \u2013 can weigh more than ten times the leopard at their heels. </p> <p>Rostro-Garcia, who was also the lead author on the Indochinese leopard study, said that her research in Cambodia\u2019s Eastern Plains is the \u201cfirst study to show that the main prey of leopards was over 500 kg.\u201d <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5cc0e6fb261a15a14e72eec06939896419805b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5cc0e6fb261a15a14e72eec06939896419805b7/0_0_1260_756/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Banteng move across a camera trap in the dry forests of eastern Cambodia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Banteng move across a camera trap in the dry forests of eastern Cambodia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WWF Cambodia/WildCRU/Forestry Administration</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Rostro-Garcia found that only big males, not smaller females, were killing banteng. And \u201ceven among the males there were large differences in diets, as some male leopards focused almost exclusively on preying on banteng, whereas other males did not consume banteng at all,\u201d she said. </p> <p>The results were particularly unexpected given the availability of small prey in the ecosystem, such as muntjac (small deer) and various species of monkeys. </p> <p>\u201cThe tiger went extinct in this landscape over 10 years ago, so perhaps its absence allowed the leopard to expand its niche to include larger prey than usual,\u201d Rostro-Garcia said. </p> <p>The leopards of Cambodia are also the last population of Indochinese leopards that are uniformly spotted. Other populations sport a mix of spotted leopards and black, or melanistic, leopards. </p> <p>Indeed, the largest remaining stronghold of Indochinese leopards in Southeast Asia is known for housing almost only melanistic leopards. </p> <h2><strong>Malaysia\u2019s black panthers</strong></h2>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The black coat of melanistic leopards may have made them \u2018perfect stalkers\u2019 in the dimly-lit rainforests</p> <footer> <cite>Reuben Clements</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Not only does Peninsular Malaysia have the biggest population of Indochinese leopards left, but it is home to the largest population of black leopards on the planet. This fact may have helped preserve the population. </p> <p>Their black coats make them \u201cless sought after for their skins compared to spotted leopards,\u201d said Reuben Clements, an Associate Professor with Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, who has studied leopards in the region for several years. </p> <p> He also said the population may have hung on here due to \u201cmore forest\u201d and the fact that the denser canopy of this rainforest could offer \u201cadditional habitat for leopards to utilize and to evade dangers on the ground.\u201d</p> <p> But why are the vast majority of leopards here melanistic? </p> <p>\u201cNo one knows for sure,\u201d said Clements. \u201cSome suspect genetic drift. Others suspect the black coat of melanistic leopards may have made them \u2018perfect stalkers\u2019 in the dimly-lit rainforests, allowing them to compete with tigers for similar sized prey.\u201d</p> <p>As such, black leopards here may have found themselves with an evolutionary advantage. <br></p> <h2> <strong>Leopards in trouble everywhere</strong></h2> <p>The Indochinese leopard survey comes close on the heels of a larger study that found that the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/04/leopards-have-lost-75-percent-of-historical-habitat\">leopards have lost 75% of their range</a> across their full territory, from South Africa to Java. The survey has resulted in the species being downlisted on the IUCN Red List from near threatened to vulnerable. </p> <p>This means that of all the world\u2019s big cats (those in the genus Panthera) only one, the jaguar, is not considered threatened with extinction \u2013 it remains listed as near threatened. </p> <p>Conservationists, though, believe the situation can be turned around. </p> <p>\u201cIf governments can get poaching and snaring under control, then leopards would have a promising future in the Southeast Asia,\u201d said Kamler, who noted that there was still plenty of empty habitat available with sufficient prey. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe question is whether there will be any leopards left in the region to make a comeback, depending on when the governments finally decide to get serious about reducing the poaching,\u201d he added.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2016/mar/01/tiger-country-scientists-uncover-wild-surprises-in-tribal-bangladesh\">Tiger country? Scientists uncover wild surprises in tribal Bangladesh</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Combating snaring is particularly tricky, since many forests in the region are already blanketed with snares that would need to be removed \u2013 a difficult, but hardly impossible, task. If achieved, however, de-snaring would aid many other endangered species as well. <br></p> <p>Kamler thinks that leopards may have been largely overlooked in conservation circles because they are smaller and were long-considered to be less threatened than the super-popular tigers.But he hopes these recent surveys serve as a wake-up call. <br></p> <p>\u201cOnce people realize that leopards are becoming just as rare as the other big cats, hopefully there will be more interest in this species, and efforts to save them will increase,\u201d said Kamler, who added that in his opinion the leopard was \u201cthe most beautiful of the large cats.\u201d</p> <p>Okay, so ,tigers might disagree. And so might jaguars and snow leopards. But it\u2019s hard to dispute that leopards are still not getting the attention they deserve \u2013 or require. They may be more flexible than other big cats, but even this can only get them so far against the onslaught of butchery now occurring in Southeast Asia. <br></p> <p>If the region wants to maintain leopards \u2013 or tigers for that matter, or bears, <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2013/02/pity-the-pangolin-little-known-mammal-most-common-victim-of-the-wildlife-trade/\">pangolins</a>, hornbill, banteng, muntjacs, songbirds, monitor lizards, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2015/jun/25/dhole-asia-endangered-tiger-ignored\">dholes</a>, pretty much every species of turtle and some species that scientists have probably never even described \u2013 officials will finally have to get tough, really tough, on the wildlife trade. <br></p>",

  "<p>Amazon has finally launched its Dash physical instant purchase buttons in the UK, bringing one-push buying of nappies, toilet roll, dishwasher tablets and washing powder to a washing machine near you.<br></p> <p>The branded wireless buttons, which are essentially free to the consumer and purchase a set item when pushed, are another step in Amazon\u2019s attempt to lock customers into its Prime subscription service, and edge out traditional supermarkets from the household goods market.</p> <p>There are intially 40 branded buttons to choose from in the UK, each costing \u00a34.99 to purchase but come with \u00a34.99 in credit for the customer\u2019s first order. They\u2019re linked to an Amazon account and allow anyone in the home to instantly order replacement staples from toothbrush heads, kitchen roll and washing up liquid to coffee, anti-smoking aids and condoms.</p> <p>The director of Amazon Dash, Daniel Rausch, said: \u201cThere is no retail therapy in buying toilet roll or bin bags. It\u2019s just work. We wanted to take the one-click experience from our website and put it right where people need it most, in the home, near the products that run out. So that buying them is no longer work.\u201d</p> <p>The initial 40 brands cover a range of different types of products and include household names such as Air Wick, Andrex, Ariel, Cesar, Dettol, Durex, Fairy, Finish, Gillette, Huggies, Listerine, Nerf, Nescaf\u00e9, Nicorette, Olay, Pedigree, Play-doh, Regaine, Right Guard, Rimmel, Vanish and Wilkinson.</p> <p>The buttons are powered by Amazon\u2019s Dash Replenishment Service (DRS), which can be built directly into products such as a Britta water jug that orders new filters and printers that order new ink. It was launched in the US in March 2015 with small selection of brands. Since then, the number of brands available has reached over 150 and DRS has been built into washing machines and other household appliances.</p> <p>Setting the up buttons is simple using Amazon\u2019s smartphone app for Android and iOS, connecting to them via Bluetooth or ultrasonics. The buttons stay dormant until pressed, connecting to your home Wi-Fi network and placing an order on the first time they are pressed. The account holder is notified of the order, and can change the quantity or cancel it. Subsequent presses will be ignored until the item is delivered, preventing duplicates.</p> <p>Bosch and Siemens dishwashers will soon be available with DRS integration for ordering dishwasher tablets automatically in the UK, while Grundig\u2019s new washing machines will be able to do similar for detergent. Whirlpool Sense Live devices will also be able to order detergent, descaler, anti-bacterial filters or softener when needed. Some printers made by Samsung will be able to order ink automatically too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff6cfe081914b560b44128ecd61af93bb6886ce8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff6cfe081914b560b44128ecd61af93bb6886ce8/0_437_4704_2823/1000.jpg\" alt=\"amazon dash buttons\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dash buttons cover brands from a variety of product categories.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Convenience is the main selling point for consumers. For brands, a boost in sales and the ability to get a foot in the door of a large retailer\u2019s push for the future before rivals marks the main appeal.</p> <p>Taryn Mitchell, global vice president of Digital Sales for RB, manufacturer of brands such as Vanish, Harpic, Durex and Dettol said: \u201cA significant number of the orders we see through Amazon today are placed via the Amazon Dash Button. It\u2019s a remarkably convenient way for customers to reorder everyday items, and even adds a bit of fun to the process.\u201d</p> <p>Amazon refuses to disclose numbers, but Rausch said that buttons for beverages are used most frequently, being pushed more than once a week on average and that across the US two orders are placed via its Dash buttons every minute, with order rates increasing by three times in the past two months.</p> <p>Data from research firm Slice Intelligence paints a slightly different picture. In June it estimated that less than half of people who bought Dash buttons actually used them, and those that do only place an order via the Dash button once every two months. Since then Amazon has added another 50 brands to its Dash portfolio.</p> <h2>Transforming the distribution and retail of staple goods</h2> <p>Geoff Blaber, vice president of research for the Americas for CCS Insight said: \u201cBrands need to be onboard from the start. While Dash may appear gimmicky today it is very likely to transform distribution and retail of such products. Once the service is integrated into appliances and can automatically sense when replenishment is needed, brands will need to be involved or risk marginalisation.</p> <p>\u201cAmazon is seeking to establish itself as the scale supplier of high frequency purchase goods as diverse as printer ink and washing powder.\u201d</p> <p>The Dash button joins the recent launch of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/28/amazon-fresh-dash-gadget-uk-reorder-groceries-scan-barcode\">Amazon\u2019s Dash Barcode Scanner in the UK</a>, a device for buying groceries from the company\u2019s Fresh subscription service by blipping barcodes or saying the name of the product into the microphone.</p> <p>Between Fresh and Prime, Amazon is seeking to expand its market position from ocassional goods such as electronics, games and books to household staples and produce, directly challenging the biggest retailers, including supermarket chains Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s.</p> <p>But the Dash buttons also show Amazon\u2019s increasing precense in the next big technology space, the Internet of Things (IoT) - a series of connected devices that look to automate tasks such as lights that respond to presence or timers or smart thermostats that save energy by only putting the heating on when people are in the house.</p> <p>Rausch said: \u201cWe talk about the Internet of Things in tech, but customers are often left wondering what the utility of it is. Dash is a super accessible, practical, useful way to smarten up their homes, and that\u2019s the kind of reaction we\u2019ve had from customers in the US.\u201d</p> <p>Dash is just one element of Amazon\u2019s IoT push. Its wireless, voice-controlled speaker, Echo, has the company\u2019s Alexa smart voice assistant built in. It competes with Apple\u2019s Siri, Google\u2019s Now and Microsoft\u2019s Cortana, and is capable of connecting to and controlling various automated and IoT systems about the house with voice commands.</p> <p>Echo has rapidly become Amazon\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/26/amazon-echo-alexa-voice-recognition-superfans\">biggest sleeper hit</a> seizing the company a significant chunk of a market of which all the biggest technology firms in the US are seeking a slice.</p> <p>For an online retailer an automated purchase and replenishment service is an obviously logical next step.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/18/what-is-the-internet-of-things-arm-holdings-softbank\"><strong>What is the Internet of Things and how does ARM fit in?</strong></a><br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Linking low-income communities to the supply chains of large corporations - so-called inclusive business - has been a major trend over the past decade.</p> <p>In food and agriculture, this means including poor farmers in the supply chains of food manufacturers and retailers, rather than a traditional trade via middlemen. There\u2019s strong logic, given that there are more than <a href=\"https://www.ifad.org/documents/10180/ca86ab2d-74f0-42a5-b4b6-5e476d321619\" rel=\"nofollow\">half a billion</a> small farm households around the developing world. Farmers get access to higher value markets. Food businesses get access to new sources of supply. Donors and governments get a better development bang from trade and investment.</p> <p>But despite a huge and growing portfolio of successful pilot projects, there is evidence that under many circumstances inclusive business may struggle to get to scale. It can be a poor match to the realities of both farmers as suppliers and the businesses as buyers. </p> <p>First, the farming realities. There is growing competition for what farmers produce. Sub-Saharan Africa in particular is in the middle of a fundamental reorientation of its agriculture, away from global exports and towards supplying its own burgeoning urban populations. </p> <p>A recent <a href=\"http://oecdinsights.org/2016/07/11/economic-activity-west-africa-feeding-population/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=whatsnew\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a> from the OECD reveals that in the case of west Africa, where 42% of the population is already urban, agriculture has shifted from 50% dependent on exports to the global market in 1961, to only 12% in 2010. Food supply networks are stretching from urban areas deeper into the countryside, via small towns that have cropped up across rural sub-Saharan Africa. </p> <p>The market has moved closer to the farm, providing farmers with more choice of what to produce and where to market. Contract farming and exports to the global market are no longer the only games in town. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/africa-global-brands-sustainable-business-foundation\">Brands in Africa: laying the foundations for sustainable business at the outset</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Unilever\u2019s onions were too cheap</h2> <p>Cash is an important part of the story. Most smallholder households are severely cash strapped. The retreat by many governments from universal provision of health and education means that households must find money for school fees, placing a huge burden on poor households. Cash crops are grown to cover fees, and food crops for the family become cash crops in emergencies. </p> <p>Small wonder then if farmers are more inclined to sell to traders for cash than stick with a scheme that involves contracts, membership of a producer groups, delayed payments and strict compliance with standards for quality. </p> <p>I found this when <a href=\"http://pubs.iied.org/16563IIED.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">researching</a> a contract farming initiative in Uganda that linked very poor farmers with a food manufacturer - <a href=\"http://www.mukwano.com \" rel=\"nofollow\">Mukawno</a> - based in the country but with sales across east Africa. Presented as an inclusive business success story, the initiative was in fact struggling to compete with growing informal cash-based trade with local processors or traders from neighbouring Kenya. </p> <p>In Tanzania, a planned inclusive business <a href=\"http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/publications/project-sunrise-final-report-338731\" rel=\"nofollow\">project </a>to link onion farmers to Unilever was abandoned when it was realised that the local fresh market paid far more than the global commodity price.</p> <h2>We don\u2019t hear about the failures<br></h2> <p>Then there\u2019s the buyer\u2019s perspective. Food manufacturers and retailers want what they have ordered. Small farmers\u2019 reliability to fulfil orders will always fluctuate, as they have to manage risk in the face of climate variability and creaky infrastructure. The goodwill of a progressive company will stretch to a few failed consignments, but it is unreasonable to expect them to adjust to the vagaries of smallholder agriculture. There is a fundamental issue of business compatibility.</p> <p>I saw this in the case of a small innovative Kenyan company that linked hundreds of smallholders to the Dutch flower auction. The company wanted to expand into higher value markets and sell directly to supermarkets. With the help of a donor, an interested supermarket, and supply chain experts, the concept was piloted with some success. </p> <p>But over the years it became increasingly clear that this company and its suppliers were better off trading with the auction rather than with supermarkets, because the auction takes what the company and its smallholder growers supplied. Prices may on average be somewhat lower, but once all the costs are factored in, overall value to the farmers is higher. </p> <p>These issues of business incompatibility crop up across multiple projects. Successes may look distinctly shaky once donor funds and NGO support are withdrawn. But little gets written up, so what gets cemented into the business and development literature is almost entirely positive. Scratch the surface, however, and there is evidence from Nicaragua to Nairobi of dynamic informal markets trumping inclusive business.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jun/15/five-charts-food-prices-rises-africa-asia-hit-hardest\">Five charts that explain who gets hit hardest by food price rises</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Inclusive business needs informal sector<br></h2> <p>There is much to be gained from engaging agrifood businesses in development. Improving the welfare of workers, reducing environmental impact, and making trade fairer in their own operations and those of their suppliers is as pertinent as ever. But including more smallholders into supply chains can be a distraction from this core corporate agenda. </p> <p>If we are to combine inclusion and business in a more grounded and scalable way, driven less by wishful thinking and more by evidence, we need to look beyond big business. The irony is that inclusive business needs to be approached more inclusively. </p> <p>In many countries, the<a href=\"http://www.iied.org/informal-economy-green-growth-conference-pinpoints-need-for-new-policy-agenda\" rel=\"nofollow\"> informal economy</a> dominates food trading, processing and vending. But those actors may be subject to harassment and downright hostility from officials who see them as illegal, unhygienic, tax avoiding and anti-progress. </p> <p>There is tremendous scope for improving the economic, social and environmental performance of the <a href=\"http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/17365IIED.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">informal economy</a> at scale, without pushing people out of jobs. If the post-2015 development agenda \u2013 across jobs, food security and inclusive growth - is to succeed, governments should be focusing resources into understanding and improving the informal economy.</p>",

  "<p>\u201cWe are cleaning the house now\u201d, says Celso Correia. The young, smartly-dressed, minister for land, environment and rural development in Mozambique is talking about the corruption and illegal logging that has dogged the southern African country\u2019s timber sector for more than a decade.<br></p> <p>As recently as 2013, a remarkable 93% of all the logging taking place in the country was happening illegally, according to <a href=\"https://eia-international.org/chinas-illegal-timber-imports-ransack-mozambiques-forests\" rel=\"nofollow\">a report</a> from the nonprofit Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA). </p> <p>As well as leading to unsustainable levels of deforestation, the export of illegally logged timber was also depriving the country of <a href=\" https://eia-international.org/wp-content/uploads/First-Class-Crisis-English-FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">tens of millions of dollars</a> a year in lost tax revenue.</p> <p>The driving force behind this boom in illegal logging was China, the biggest importer of logs in the world. Chinese traders accounted for more than 90% of Mozambique\u2019s timber exports in 2013, according to the environmental research organisation <a href=\"http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/G03947.pdf?\" rel=\"nofollow\">IIED</a>. In 2014 Mozambican wood entering China surpassed $400m, up from $90m in 2009, according to <a href=\"http://www.africamonitor-newsletter.com/analysis/southern-africa/mozambique/feb-2016\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Africa Monitor</a> (paywall).</p> <p>Correia, who started in his job in the newly created environment department last year, acknowledges his country is a stark example of what happens when insatiable demand for logs, in this case from China, converges with weak law enforcement and corruption. His ambition is to change that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4e9bc56ff3342c8145365bc90b9c7a3ba993ee4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4e9bc56ff3342c8145365bc90b9c7a3ba993ee4/0_290_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trucks of woods\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Authorities in Mozambique checking for illegal logs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Estacios Valoi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe have seized more illegal wood in one year than Mozambique has since independence,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are passing a new forestry law and a new conservation law.\u201d</p> <p>Correia and Mozambique\u2019s long-term ambition is to develop a more sustainable timber market in the country, including developing a larger processing industry in the country rather than just exporting the logs. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind people cutting trees. We need to have a sustainable forest and we need to have a market,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In Gile National Reserve, situated in Zambezia Province, such measures are desperately needed. A total of 35 logging licences created a huge circle of harvested land around the reserve boundary for the 2,980km squared of protected area. After years of logging in the country, the reserve is the last area where Pau Ferro, a highly sought-after wood, still exists in Mozambique.</p> <p>Gile National Reserve attracts few tourists but an alarming number of illegal loggers, according to the warden Jose Dias. Since 2012, his team has captured a total of 58 trucks and 10 tractors packed with Pau Ferro from the reserve.

But the ban means little to Jorge Bing, a major timber dealer in Zambezia province. \u201cWhen villagers bring you the best wood on the market, \u201d he told me, \u201cwhy would you say no to it?\u201d</p> <p>The other ambition: to create a domestic processing market for timber in Mozambique, is not new.

In late 2015, the Mozambique government then decided to <a href=\"http://africageographic.com/blog/mozambique-announces-immediate-ban-timber-exports/\" rel=\"nofollow\">expand the ban</a> to all raw timber logs for two years. </p> <p>The ban was meant to create added value in Mozambique, by encouraging the processing of wood into planks before they are exported to China, but it does not appear <a href=\"http://blog.cifor.org/22055/surge-in-chinese-demand-exposes-cracks-in-mozambique-forest-policy?fnl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">to be working</a>. \u201cThe domestic processing sector does not have the capacity to absorb the logs,\u201d says Anne Terheggen, a sustainable trade specialist from Centre for International Forestry Research.</p> <p>Correia says he hopes to entice more responsible Chinese companies to Mozambique. \u201cWhen they decide to come, they will be the ones who solve our problems.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"360daa5379b52d3fdf1248d03da2739dc7069756\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/360daa5379b52d3fdf1248d03da2739dc7069756/0_295_4672_2804/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Authorities measuring seized illegal logs in the Natural Reserve Gille\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Authorities measuring seized illegal logs in the Natural Reserve Gille</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Baptiste Deffontaines</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of these new, potentially more responsible approaches is being proposed by Zheng Fei, a 50-year-old Chinese timber businessman who\u2019s been in Mozambique since 1998, and who has declared his intention to build a \u201cSino-Mozambique forest resource ecological zone\u201d.

  "<p>The decisions reached at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/19/gas-supplies-to-rise-and-secret-contracts-to-be-scrapped-under-coag-reform-plan\">recent Coag energy council meeting</a> are reminiscent of a long series of failures to understand the impacts of powerful business on the health of the community. </p> <p>The failures extend historically from tobacco, to asbestos to the health scourges of coal, and now to the health and community impacts of the unconventional gas industry.</p> <p>It is too much to believe that governments fail to understand the implications.</p> <p>Just 30 years ago, Australia was awash with tobacco advertising and promotion by tobacco companies and their agents through multiple media outlets and sporting organisations, supported by newspaper editorials opposed to any restrictions. </p> <p>Major political parties readily accepted large donations, and some individual politicians were not immune to personal gifts and favours. Tobacco lobbyists had ready access to legislators to ensure that measures to deal with the health consequences were thwarted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/19/gas-supplies-to-rise-and-secret-contracts-to-be-scrapped-under-coag-reform-plan\">Gas supplies to rise and secret contracts to be scrapped under Coag reform plan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While over 20,000 Australians were dying each year because of tobacco smoking, and children were being actively enticed into smoking addiction, their lives were valued less than an increasingly discredited industry. It remains a stain on governments of those days.</p> <p>The tragedy of asbestos mining, transportation and usage in Australia is another cautionary tale <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/08/asbestos-is-far-from-a-legacy-issue-this-is-no-time-to-rest-easy\">still being played out</a>. Mining continued, with active government support, well past the time when there was unequivocal medical evidence of lethal harm being caused by asbestos elsewhere in the world. Political intervention began far too late to prevent the deaths of thousands, with hundreds of distressing deaths still occurring.</p> <p>Another cloud of preventable misery is gathering in our land and beyond our shores with the dangerous push to tolerate and expand coal mining and unconventional gas extraction. The reasons for political short-sightedness are similar to those that prevailed with tobacco and asbestos.</p> <p>The fundamental reason has been the distortion of the political process that has enabled powerful commercial interests to buy political favours to crush health and environmental concerns and work against the wider public interest.</p> <p>There are glaring examples where the mining industry has gained <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-07-18/when-sand-mining-native-title-and-political/4829584\">political favours</a> through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/01/australian-political-donations-2014-15-resource-tycoons-and-unions-among-top-donors\">large direct and indirect donations</a> to political parties and favours to individual public servants and legislators.</p> <p>There also continues to be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/01/larissa-waters-ban-donations-from-mining-companies-and-stop-ministers-working-for-them\">revolving door of appointments</a> from the mining sector to pivotal public service positions and political careers, and the reverse. The industry has had, and continues to have, extraordinary access to policy makers and legislators.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.tai.org.au/content/greasing-wheels\">A report </a>by the Australia Institute and the Australian Conservation Foundation analysing this process in Queensland has laid bare the extent of this distortion of good governance in that state, and exposes the failure of successive Queensland governments to allow sufficient scrutiny.</p> <p>Genuine health and environmental concerns, and their associated financial consequences, are given minimal weight compared to that given to the proponents of exploration, mining, transportation and combustion of coal and of unconventional gas extraction and usage.</p> <p>By comparison, access by organisations and individuals who have real expertise in the health effects of coal mining go unheeded.</p> <p>This is nothing short of outrageous.</p> <p>It is estimated that air pollution in Australia already causes around 3000 deaths annually, more than the motor vehicle accident toll. Most of those deaths are from particulate matter released by mining, transport and combustion of coal.</p> <p>The recognition of black lung disease in coal miners in Queensland is a vivid reminder of the dangers involved. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/13/queenslands-black-lung-safeguards-major-system-failures-exposed\">inadequacy of regulatory standards</a> and enforcement has led to debilitating illness and death.</p> <p>The same could have been said of the asbestos tragedy on a much larger scale, and will eventually be said about coal mining.</p> <p>Climate change resulting from the cumulative effects of global fossil fuel combustion is already causing multiple <a href=\"http://dea.org.au/images/general/DEA_Climate_Change__Health_Fact_Sheet_final.pdf\">health consequences</a>, including deaths, from heat stroke, dehydration, bushfires, floods, typhoons, storm surges, vector borne diseases, cardio-pulmonary diseases and allergies. All of these problems will worsen as climate changes become more pronounced.</p> <p>Australia continues to lead the world in tobacco control and has saved the lives of thousands by doing so. It has protected its children in the process. It has belatedly learned some painful lessons on asbestos.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/13/queenslands-black-lung-safeguards-major-system-failures-exposed\">Queensland's black lung safeguards: 'major system failures' exposed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By comparison, Australia is ignoring the overwhelming evidence that fossil fuels must be rapidly phased out in the early part of this century. Australia is blessed with abundant solar, wind and wave resources but it has been deceived into becoming a laggard rather than a leader in harnessing them.</p> <p>It appears that the Coag decisions in their subservience to fossil fuel interests asked for information on the additional costs of renewable energy imposed on the national electricity market. There was no mention of the much greater costs imposed by coal on the health services by coal pollution and by gas on the health of communities from global warming.</p> <p>Australia must avoid hurtling headlong into further coal mining and destructive unconventional gas extraction. It needs to have vision and true leadership; a focus on innovation and employment; and to be conscious of its responsibility to protect the natural environment and the health of its citizens.</p> <p>This country has the intelligence, technological expertise, enterprise, workforce, space and moral obligation to make this possible. It will just take political wisdom and will to turn it into reality.</p> <p>If federal and state governments do not do so, it will be at the clear expense of the people they serve.</p> <p>As with asbestos, history will judge the responsible governments very harshly indeed.</p>"
