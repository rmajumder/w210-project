  "<p>Theresa May arrived in Downing Street from the Home Office in July with a reputation for being risk averse. The party she leads as prime minister has a wafer-thin working majority in the House of Commons of 17.</p> <p>As the opposition parties point out until they are blue in the face, she is an accidental prime minister with no general election mandate, who washed up at No 10 only as a result of the Brexit tsunami. Just over two months on, however, any suggestion that May would cautiously wield the power suddenly thrust upon her, easing her way in before making her mark, has been dispelled.</p> <p>Her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/14/michael-gove-sacked-as-theresa-may-appoints-new-cabinet\" title=\"\">ruthless cabinet purge of David Cameron\u2019s inner circle</a> in her first days in charge has been followed by a systematic re-examination of Cameroonian policies.

George Osborne\u2019s deficit-cutting plans have been ditched, signalling more state investment and an end to austerity.</p> <p>The former chancellor\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/north-east-england-devolution-deal-off-the-table-sajid-javid\" title=\"\">northern powerhouse ideas are being subsumed</a> into a wider national regeneration strategy. Bold plans for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/18/childhood-obesity-strategy-wasted-opportunity-campaigners\" title=\"\">tackling obesity have been watered down</a>. Tory housing policy, so long focused on home ownership, is to be recast with more emphasis on helping those in the rented sector. Most controversially of all, May wants to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/07/senior-tories-likely-to-resist-theresa-mays-grammar-schools-agenda\" title=\"\">expand the number of grammar schools</a>, something opposed by Cameron and that was never on the radar of his reforming former education secretary Michael Gove, cast by May into outer darkness on day one of her premiership.</p> <p>The new prime minister\u2019s approach has, in some respects, seemed to court risk rather than avoid it. Tory MPs loyal to the old order, and those dismissed from government by May, feel bruised and talk carefully but deliberately, in code. \u201cBold to say the least,\u201d said one sacked minister last week, raising his eyebrows and adding that he was \u201cone of a lot of people who she needs to vote with her on things\u201d.</p> <p>On Monday in the Commons, the new education secretary, Justine Greening, gave details <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2016/sep/14/why-does-theresa-may-want-to-bring-back-grammar-schools-video-explainer\" title=\"\">of the prime minister\u2019s grammar school revolution.</a> \u201cWe do not want to see a return to the old binary system of good schools and bad schools,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery child deserves a place in a great \u2026\u201d The Speaker had to intervene as the opposition benches erupted, asking where her mandate for more grammar schools was. Labour\u2019s Angela Rayner said, to cheers from opposition benches, that the new Tory agenda was one of \u201csegregation, segregation,&#xa0;segregation\u201d.</p> <p>Then Tory doubters spoke out one after another. First to his feet was former Tory education secretary Kenneth Clarke, who asked Greening to make sure that \u201cthis change does not damage the opportunities for pupils in other schools and does not distract priority from raising the standards of all schools for all pupils which has been the objective of this government\u201d.</p> <p>Nicky Morgan, sacked by May as education secretary, voiced her worries, as did the normally restrained Tory chair of the education select committee, Neil Carmichael. \u201cThere is no desire in my constituency for us to have selection,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/15/anna-soubry-sacked-as-theresa-may-carries-out-evening-reshuffle/\" title=\"\">another dismissed minister, Anna Soubry</a>, before former Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers weighed in. Labour\u2019s Lucy Powell and Nic Dakin counted the seconds between each Tory member saying how much they welcomed Greening\u2019s desire to widen opportunity and the moment they said \u201cbut\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5f59ba1680a2fc402036e8bae7bfc8b4d13e3390\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f59ba1680a2fc402036e8bae7bfc8b4d13e3390/270_93_2254_1352/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Cameron said he was stepping down as an MP to avoid being a \u201cdistraction\u201d.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron said he was stepping down as an MP to avoid being a \u201cdistraction\u201d.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On any other day, Greening\u2019s difficulties would have made big headlines. As it was, David Cameron chose Monday to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/12/david-cameron-to-stand-down-as-mp-for-witney\" title=\"\">announce that he was standing down as an MP</a>. The former PM insisted that he was not going in a huff because May was trashing his policies but because he did not want to be a \u201cdistraction\u201d. May had \u201cgot off to a cracking start\u201d, he said.</p> <p>Two months into her premiership, Theresa May\u2019s poll ratings remain in honeymoon territory. She is seen by most voters as a reassuring presence and a strong and competent leader, while the ratings for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are dire. She is also seen as slightly less rightwing than Cameron, and her chancellor, Philip Hammond, as a little to the left of his predecessor&#xa0;Osborne.</p> <p>Before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/theresa-may-becomes-britains-prime-minister\" title=\"\">she entered Downing Street for the first time on 13 July, </a>May said her government would not be driven \u201cby the interests of the privileged few\u201d but by those who had had little or none. \u201cWe will do everything we can to give you more control over your lives. When we take the big calls, we\u2019ll think not of the powerful, but you. When we pass new laws we\u2019ll listen not to the mighty, but to you. When it comes to taxes, we\u2019ll prioritise not the wealthy but you.\u201d She was clear, then, that the days of government by the \u201cNotting Hill set\u201d were over. But few expected her to move so fast and so boldly. Her supporters insist that a clear theme to her leadership is already emerging, much of it shaped by her chief of staff, the pro-grammar school Nick Timothy.</p> <p>Unlike the Cameron inner circle, from which May felt excluded, they say she wants not just to show that she cares about \u201cthe bottom 10%, but all those who deserve a chance\u201d. One ally said: \u201cTo her, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/george-osborne-to-chair-northern-powerhouse-partnership\" title=\"\">northern powerhouse looked like a gesture</a>, like it was just about being generous to the north. She wants to prioritise the whole country. If you understand that, you begin to understand her.\u201d</p> <p>Writing on these pages, Phillip Blond, the inventor of one-nation red-Toryism who became disillusioned with Cameron, says May is developing a new post-liberal Conservatism that challenges the idea of so much power and wealth being concentrated in the hands of the elite. For Blond and other \u201ccommunitarian\u201d conservative thinkers, the hope is that the May era will herald an end to laissez-faire economics and usher in an era of proactive government, dedicated to building a more inclusive society. Quite how her approach to grammar schools will help all children, however, is a question being asked by far more Tory MPs than are needed to kill her flagship education plan stone dead in the Commons. The Cameroons are not happy and joke that her biggest achievement in office so far has been to unite Labour over grammar schools in a way it could not have managed itself.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/george-osborne-to-chair-northern-powerhouse-partnership\" title=\"\">Osborne has launched an organisation to reboot the northern powerhouse idea.</a> Last week, at an event hosted by the pollsters Opinium and the Social Market Foundation, Nicky Morgan suggested May would lack the appeal to centre-ground voters that Cameron had.</p> <p>With Brexit to deal with, a majority of 17 and no direct mandate of her own, Theresa May may soon realise the downside of taking risks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"db1cfa10b4d3c7c34bd80b2c7680e525d155ddd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db1cfa10b4d3c7c34bd80b2c7680e525d155ddd7/0_73_4456_2673/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Osborne\u2019s plan to abolish the deficit was among the first Cameron policy to be jettisoned.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Osborne\u2019s plan to abolish the deficit was among the first Cameron policy to be jettisoned.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>CAMERON REFORMS BEING REVERSED</strong></h2> <p><strong>THE DEFICIT </strong></p> <p>The Tory election manifesto in May 2015 was clear: \u201cThe way to keep our economy secure for the future is to eliminate the deficit entirely and start running a surplus. Anything less would be to ignore the lessons of the past.\u201d Then came Brexit, out went David Cameron and George Osborne and all that changed. Even before becoming leader, Theresa May said she would no longer seek to reach a budget surplus by 2020, abandoning Osborne\u2019s pledge to more than balance the books by the next election. In July, his successor as chancellor, Phillip Hammond, went further, saying his first autumn statement would be a chance to \u201creset fiscal policy\u201d. The statement is expected to mark an end to austerity \u2013 with which Osborne will always be associated \u2013 and usher in an era of more state investment to boost the economy, improve infrastructure and create jobs.</p> <p><strong>NORTHERN POWERHOUSE </strong></p> <p>On Friday, Osborne said May\u2019s government had had \u201ca wobble\u201d on his plans for a northern powerhouse. But he claimed through gritted teeth that it was now \u201c100% committed\u201d. However, that overstated the reality. May made it clear on entering No 10 that she wanted a broader, nationwide industrial strategy rather than merely a \u201cnorthern\u201d one \u2013 an approach that covered the whole country. Initially, she even seemed reluctant to use the term \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d, reflecting her clear reservations and suggesting that she thought it was a something of a stunt. To keep the flame of the policy, which he launched in 2014, very much alive Osborne announced on Friday that he would chair a new organisation to advance the plans, including greater devolution of powers.</p> <p><strong>OBESITY </strong></p> <p>May\u2019s government has come under fire from the BMA, the Tory chair of the health select committee, Dr Sarah Wollaston, and celebrity chef, Jamie Oliver, for watering down plans for an ambitious anti-obesity strategy. Professor Parveen Kumar, chair of the BMA\u2019s board of science, said the government had \u201crowed back on its promises by announcing what looks like a weak plan, rather than the robust strategy it promised\u201d. Given concerns that NHS bills are soaring as a result of obesity, the government left itself open to attack. It said food companies would not be compelled to reduce levels of sugar in products but would be subject to voluntary targets. Kumar said this approach would be \u201cpointless\u201d. Wollaston said the plans showed \u201cthe hand of big industry lobbyists\u201d. Ministers said the plans, including a voluntary target to cut sugar in children\u2019s food and drink, were bold and announced new measures to try to expand sporting provision in primary schools.</p> <p><strong>GRAMMAR SCHOOLS </strong></p> <p>David Cameron said in 2006 that he did not want a return to selection. \u201cThe prospect of bringing back grammar schools has always been wrong and I\u2019ve never supported it. And I don\u2019t think any Conservative government would have done it.\u201d Instead, his administration sought to raise standards across the state sector by increasing school autonomy through the expansion of academies and Michael Gove\u2019s free schools project. May changed tack unexpectedly, prompting a huge row and raising concerns among many of her MPs. \u201cFor too long, we have tolerated a system that contains an arbitrary rule preventing selective schools from being established \u2013 sacrificing children\u2019s potential because of dogma and ideology,\u201d she said. \u201cThe truth is that we already have selection in our school system \u2013 and it\u2019s selection by house price, selection by wealth. That is simply unfair.\u201d</p> <p><strong>HOUSING</strong></p> <p>May\u2019s housing minister, Gavin Barwell, hinted strongly in a speech that the government would shift its focus from home ownership to helping those in the rented sector. \u201cWe need to build more homes of every single type and not focus on one single tenure,\u201d he said in terms that were seen in the housing industry as softening it up for a change of direction. Barwell appeared to recognise that many of those most in need are renters, who desire more security and protection. He also suggested that the government could ditch plans to build 200,000 \u201cstarter homes\u201d by 2020 \u2013 a plan that has been widely criticised on the grounds that such homes, although supposedly for those on low incomes, would turn out to be unaffordable for the less well off.</p> <p><strong>PRISON REFORMS </strong></p> <p>The new justice secretary, Liz Truss, threw Gove\u2019s plans for sweeping reforms of prisons in England and Wales into huge doubt within weeks of entering office. Under Gove\u2019s plans, prisons would have gained more control over budgets and how they were run. Truss said she was \u201cnot committing\u201d to such legislation. The Ministry of Justice insisted it was still \u201ctotally committed\u201d to prison reform although what emerges is likely to be Truss\u2019s blueprint. She told the Commons justice committee that she wanted to speed up the pace of change, including giving governors greater autonomy, as Gove suggested, but was looking at the \u201coverall system\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"94632e3beb4b44744444a140863c6d98bf8d974f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94632e3beb4b44744444a140863c6d98bf8d974f/1190_237_1166_1456/801.jpg\" alt=\"Phillip Blond\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phillip Blond</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephane Grangier - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>WHAT THE ANALYSTS SAY</h2> <p><strong>PHILLIP BLOND, DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRE-RIGHT RESPUBLICA</strong> <strong>THINKTANK</strong></p> <p>To chart the direction of the Conservative party under Theresa May, one need only point out the differences between her and David Cameron.</p> <p>Cameron unfortunately (and despite the early PR) turned out to be quite conventional. He was both an economic liberal and a social liberal, whereas I suspect May is neither. This does not make her a reactionary, but potentially somebody who can be revolutionary and can create a transformative and good post-liberal politics.</p> <p>Across the west, the failure of the liberal elite (both left and right) to recognise the damage liberalism has wrought has provoked all manner of reactionary politics, from Trump in the US to Le Pen in France. Yet we have failed to identify the cause \u2013 ever more extreme liberalism. On liberalism\u2019s watch, we have seen a massive concentration of wealth and power; whereas socially, we have witnessed the dismissal and humiliation of working-class people, coupled with the mindless endorsement of mass migration, as if we could replace the servile class with those more compliant. Unless we develop a non-regressive form of politics, the future promises to be more primitive and inhabited by racists, nationalists and perhaps fascists, because the conventional centre is empty, outmoded and has nothing to offer.</p> <p>That is why I have great hopes for May \u2013 she has the right targets and doesn\u2019t believe in old solutions. From recognising that infrastructure such as Hinkley Point shouldn\u2019t just go to the highest bidder but that government should retain a veto, to the idea that the poor, like the middle class, should have access to excellent schools.</p> <p>Expect more of the same, from mutualising infrastructure such as railways, to creating assets and savings for working people. I can also imagine her remodelling migration on the basis of shared values and integration, so as to draw its poison and keep Britain open to the world. In short, May is post-liberal, and that could be the most progressive politics we have had in decades.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0ecd063c0ab6b1dafced8153c94db0ec31d61696\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ecd063c0ab6b1dafced8153c94db0ec31d61696/445_1146_1137_1420/801.jpg\" alt=\"David Green\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Green</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>DAVID GREEN, DIRECTOR OF THE CIVITAS THINKTANK</strong></p> <p>Is Mayism different? Thatcherism was dominated by the view that freedom was the absence of government, which implied reducing the scope of the state by deregulating and privatising.</p> <p>For Mayism, freedom is a political achievement. If everyone is to have a share in prosperity, then it requires active government, not least in the form of a \u201cproper industrial strategy\u201d.</p> <p>Cameronism was more about image building than problem solving. Putting forward policy ideas under him might have got the reaction: \u201cThat\u2019s a good line, I can use that in a speech.\u201d Not so now. Mayism is different because it recognises that globalisation has not delivered for everyone. During the EU debate, Tories such as Boris Johnson criticised globalisation as manifested in the \u201cfour freedoms\u201d of the EU. They have little to do with personal freedom. Rather, they are the doctrines of laissez-faire economics, which lumps together four different things. Goods and services are produced with buying and selling in mind; but labour and money are not primarily commodities.</p> <p>Gordon Brown used to argue that the free movement of labour was counter-inflationary, which could only be the result of lowering wages. Now Theresa May defines the lowering of wages as a problem. Too much immigration makes it harder for people to make ends meet and achieve their personal best.</p> <p>The unexpected commitment to grammar schools comes from the same philosophical root. To be free is to be able to develop your talents to the full, but active government is needed to give everyone a fighting chance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"71a4b1302777f54af4050e56edd37e3c21ffbe93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71a4b1302777f54af4050e56edd37e3c21ffbe93/1969_524_2653_3316/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ayesha Hazarika\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ayesha Hazarika</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: sent by her</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>AYESHA HAZARIKA, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND FORMER ADVISER TO HARRIET HARMAN AND ED MILIBAND</strong></p> <p>Theresa May is no novice. She may have arrived at the top job by accident, but she has had a ringside seat at the top of politics for more than a decade.</p> <p>Although everyone, including George Osborne, is up in arms about the return of grammars and, let\u2019s be honest, secondary moderns \u2013 there is some method in her madness.</p> <p>She is normally an evidence-based cautious politician, yet has jumped headlong into this row with verve and enthusiasm. Why? The obvious reason is because she is trying to put clear water between her and Cameron. But there is more to it than that.She will know how critical the first big moments are for a new prime minister. Your first words on the steps of Downing Street. Your first PMQs. Your first hires and fires. And critically, your first fight.</p> <p>She knows the grammar school row will not be easy. Many on her own side hate it. The Lords will make serious trouble and it even unites the Labour party. But she knows that grassroots supporters and wavering Ukip voters, who may come back to the Tories, will see a fight for something which feels true blue, nostalgic, populist and bold.</p> <p>But she should beware. As her predecessor discovered, what starts as scratching an ideological itch can end up being a fatal political wound.</p>",
  "<p>Kristian Jensen, Denmark\u2019s foreign minister, gave a precise response last week to a request by Russia for the nations to enter bilateral talks over the ownership of the north pole. He flatly rejected the move. \u201cWe need to apply the international rules,\u201d he told reporters.</p> <p>The Russian request and the swift Danish response are intriguing. The United Nations is currently assessing Russian, Danish and Canadian claims to own sizeable chunks of the Arctic seabed. The Russian move was generally viewed as an attempt to strike a deal that would cut out Canada, while Denmark appears to believe its case is strong enough to exclude such manoeuvres.</p> <p>One thing is clear. The Arctic is heating up in meteorological, political and environmental terms as nations fall over themselves to exploit the region.</p> <p>Apart from Denmark\u2019s rebuff of Russia\u2019s Arctic overtures, Canadian explorers announced last week they had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/12/hms-terror-wreck-found-arctic-nearly-170-years-northwest-passage-attempt\">discovered the wreck of HMS Terror</a>, one of the two ships belonging to British explorer Sir John Franklin\u2019s doomed attempt to sail the Northwest Passage between the Atlantic and the Pacific. (The other expedition ship, Erebus, was discovered two years ago.) These two vessels have enormous symbolic importance because Canada believes they support its claim to own the passage, which other nations, such as the US, argue is international waters.</p> <p>Then there were the recent moves by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/12/hms-terror-wreck-found-arctic-nearly-170-years-northwest-passage-attempt\">China to invest in mines in Greenland</a>, where declining ice cover is exposing vast outcrops of ores, including minerals crucial to mobile phone manufacture. Similarly, drilling companies are eyeing seabed reserves of natural gas and oil while travel companies are preparing to send huge cruise liners into the region. The first of these trips, by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/13/large-cruise-ship-voyage-arctic-ice-crystal-cruises\">the Crystal Serenity</a>, has just been completed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d3c92cb2429dc488e8259f0e54bc6f5187514a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d3c92cb2429dc488e8259f0e54bc6f5187514a3/118_291_3482_2090/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Prirazlomnaya offshore ice-resistant oil-producing platform.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Prirazlomnaya offshore ice-resistant oil-producing platform.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Enormous forces, political and commercial, are bearing down on the region although all have a common root \u2013 as was also highlighted last week. Summer sea ice, which once covered 7.5 million sq km around the north pole, this year dropped to 4.13m sq km, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/16/arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-to-second-lowest-level-ever-recorded\">its second lowest figure on record, it was announced.</a> The rate of annual change \u2013 brought about by soaring fossil fuel emissions and rises in global temperatures \u2013 is now equivalent to a loss greater than the size of Scotland.</p> <p>\u201cLoss of sea ice has local to global effects, from animals and ecosystems to encouraging further warming by exposing ocean water,\u201d said Twila Moon, at Bristol University. \u201cWe should all be shocked by the dramatic changes happening in the Arctic.\u201d</p> <p>Most scientists now expect that, at current emission rates, the Arctic will be reliably free of sea ice in the summer by the middle of the century. By \u201cfree\u201d they mean there will be less than 1m sq km of sea ice left in the Arctic, most of it packed into remote bays and channels while the central Arctic Ocean over the north pole will be completely open. And by \u201creliably\u201d, scientists mean there will have been five consecutive years with less than 1m sq km of ice by the year 2050. The first single ice-free year will come much earlier than this, however.</p> <p>\u201cThe Arctic is opening up, and all sorts of flashpoints lie ahead,\u201d said Klaus Dodds, professor of geopolitics at Royal Holloway, University of London. \u201cIf the central Arctic Ocean is freed of ice for several months a year, who will control the fishing and the dumping of waste there? The Russians have also made it clear they want to drill for oil and gas.\u201d</p> <p>This point was also stressed by Professor Chris Rapley, of University College London. \u201cAn increasingly ice-free Arctic is a geopolitical game changer,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Already there are profound changes, with invasive species pouring into the warming Arctic and threatening existing populations, according to Melanie Lancaster of WWF\u2019s Arctic programme. \u201cSpecialised Arctic species such as polar bears [are already] showing signs of stress. Conservation action is urgently needed.\u201d</p> <p>However, the Arctic, its wildlife and its four million inhabitants face a major handicap: the region\u2019s lack of centralised protection and control. The Antarctic Treaty bans all mining, oil drilling or the presence of the military and strictly monitors all environmental hazards around the south pole. By contrast, although no nation owns the north pole, the Arctic nations \u2013 Russia, Canada, the United States, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland and Denmark \u2013 have very different ideas about how to run the world\u2019s most northerly regions.</p> <p>\u201cArctic environmental protection is currently determined by individual nations, by politicians who often meet far from its borders: in Moscow, Copenhagen and Washington,\u201d said Professor Michael Byers of the University of British Columbia. \u201cThey have very different levels of commitment to protecting the environment \u2013 with Russia at the bottom and the Nordic nations at the top.\u201d</p> <p>And it is not just the Arctic nations who are eyeing up the riches around the north pole. China recently assigned itself the status of being \u201ca near-Arctic state\u201d. It views the opening Arctic seas as an opportunity to maintain its access to the world\u2019s most important resources. Some of the Earth\u2019s major stocks of fish are migrating north as the planet heats up while the Arctic\u2019s mineral resources are being exposed by retreating ice.</p> <p>\u201cThe Chinese have made no secret that they have their eyes on the Arctic\u2019s fish and minerals,\u201d said Dodds.</p> <p>This raises the question of what the Inuit and other Arctic people think about resources being exploited by others. \u201cThey are not against resource development but they do like to be consulted and involved,\u201d said Dodds. \u201cThey do not want to be cheated. However, there are often disagreements within communities about the choices they have to make. Will a mining development ruin a village\u2019s tourist potential, for example?\u201d</p> <p>Byers was cautious. \u201cI have enormous sympathy for the local peoples in the Arctic but they are few in number and have limited resources.

In 2013, Greenpeace activists attempted to scale the Prirazlomnaya drilling platform as part of a protest against Arctic oil production. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/19/greenpeace-protesters-arrested-arctic\">Russians arrested them at gunpoint</a> and charged the activists initially with piracy and later with hooliganism and only released them after two months of detention. \u201cThat is an indication of how seriously they take the Arctic,\u201d added Depledge.</p> <p>This point was backed by Dodds: \u201cThe Russians are hell bent on showing the world they mean business here.\u201d</p> <p>Could that determination lead to an outbreak of hostilities? Byers was not convinced. \u201cThe Arctic is a very expensive region in which to operate and Russia is not a wealthy country. The cost of militarising the Arctic would be prohibitive.

As Rapley stated: \u201cThe ongoing thinning [of Arctic summer sea ice] is especially significant and the implications are profound.

The changes that have occurred have been greater and faster than predicted. The planet is sending a clear message: time is running out.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Two years ago today the people of Scotland voted to remain part of the United Kingdom. David Cameron, the then prime minister, breathed a huge sigh of relief. But fast forward to 23 June, the day of the European Union referendum, and his luck finally ran out.</p> <p>Never in our peacetime history have so many dials required resetting as a consequence of a single day\u2019s events. Cameron has gone and so that task falls to Theresa May. The shift in the UK\u2019s place in the world is comparable only to the disposal of the British Empire \u2013 which took place over many years and to a timetable largely under the control of British ministers. It left remarkably few psychological scars. By comparison, 23 June was guillotine day.</p> <p>The referendum was a shock to the political system and our constitutional framework. But that framework was already shifting. Since May 2010 we have had two UK-wide referendums \u2013 on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Alternative_Vote_referendum,_2011\" title=\"\">voting system</a> and on EU membership \u2013 and a third where, although the question was limited to the voters of Scotland, the potential impact on the whole of the UK was considerable.</p> <p>We have seen the introduction of fixed-term parliaments and of police and crime commissioners. Local authorities have seen their role in education, housing and social care eroded. A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/30/osborne-launches-national-infrastructure-commission\" title=\"\">national infrastructure commission</a> has been established to speed up major projects in transport and other areas. The fabric of local accountability and control is shifting. There is talk of devolving power away from Whitehall and Westminster to local level, including further directly elected mayors.</p> <p>A lot of change and more to come, but these issues have not been shaped by any constitutional master plan. Under Cameron, they seemed to be a reactive, piecemeal process, in response to short-term political pressures.</p> <p>And what about the issues that have <em>not</em> been raised? The government\u2019s devolution concessions in Scotland have inevitably led to questions from Wales and the regions of England. While the Blair government showed its reforming credentials in devolution, limited reforms to the Lords and the introduction of a London mayor, most of England was unaffected.</p> <p>And while turnout in the EU referendum was high, turnout in elections \u2013 even general elections \u2013 is far lower than 30 years ago. When the voters do bother to vote, they are increasingly less inclined to support the two big brands at Westminster. The minor parties \u2013 the Greens, Ukip and the nationalists \u2013 are now in the ascendancy.</p> <p>Our democratic process \u2013 indeed, our democracy \u2013 is drifting. It is time to have a broader look at how we conduct the business of democratic representative government. We need to shape a system that is better understood and which commands the electorate\u2019s confidence.</p> <p>If we had been writing this article in an earlier age, the words royal commission would have appeared long before now. Forty years ago, a royal commission was the response of choice to a wide range of issues: anything from trade unions to medical education to gambling.</p> <p>But the fact that past commissions achieved less than expected does not mean we should automatically reject the idea. Indeed, they could be just the type of life raft that the new prime minister needs. We believe there is now a case for a royal commission to consider the design and operation of our democratic processes, as well as the internal relationships between the nations and regions of the UK.</p> <p>There are 10 big issues:</p> <p>\u2022 What can be done to improve the effectiveness of legislators in the House of Commons and their response to the concerns of voters?</p> <p>\u2022 What should be the future relationships between the two Houses of Parliament?</p> <p>\u2022 Is devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland working as well as it could, and how should we respond to proposals for a second Scottish referendum on independence?</p> <p>\u2022 Is there now a case for devolution to England, either to the country as a whole or to the regions? If so, in what form?</p> <p>\u2022 What changes are needed in local government? What should its role be in education, housing, transport and health (including a possible combined health and social care system)?</p> <p>\u2022 How could the structure of central government (the \u201cmachinery of government\u201d) be reshaped to make it more responsive to the needs of the population?</p> <p>\u2022 Is there a case for new arrangements to improve democratic accountability of the public bodies overseeing important local services such as NHS trusts or non-departmental public bodies \u2013 or even more direct scrutiny by parliament and its select committees?</p> <p>\u2022 Should major constitutional decisions, such as calling referendums, be removed from the pressing concerns of politicians and vested in a new independent constitutional review body, or perhaps subjected to a \u201csuper majority\u201d in parliament?</p> <p>\u2022 What could be done to increase participation in the democratic process (such as voting at the age of 16, electronic voting, elections on Sundays, polling stations at supermarkets and so on)?</p> <p>\u2022 How can we address the legitimate concerns about tax avoidance and tax havens under the British crown?</p> <p>Some of these areas have been looked at before but usually only in isolation. Few of the proposals which have emerged have made much headway. In the uncertain future we now face, it is time to look at them in the round. We need to make our systems fit and proper for the 21st century.</p> <p>The UK has long prided itself on punching above its weight in the world. The Brexit decision requires us to reconsider our position in the new global order. But first we need to look with urgency at how the mechanisms in our system work together. This requires us to focus with intensity and urgency on how we want our democratic processes to work. We are confident that the UK has the resources and the energy to do that, and that the establishment of a royal commission on the constitution would assist that process. We hope the new prime minister agrees.</p> <p><em>Alun Evans, chief executive of the British Academy, was director of the Scotland Office from 2012-2015.

  "<p>Asked by Bloomberg this month about Russian involvement in the hacking of the US Democratic national committee, Vladimir Putin issued a non-denial denial. Basically, his answer boiled down to this: whoever did it did a good thing. This response only added to the stir created by the initial accusation that Russia was behind the activities of the \u201cFancy Bears\u201d. The fear of Russia manipulating presidential elections in the world\u2019s mightiest democracy has been spreading across the United States.</p> <p>Getting to the real perpetrators of hacking attacks is notoriously difficult. Yet seen from the Kremlin hackers perform a valuable public service by revealing secrets \u2013 not to foreign intelligence services, but to the western public. The political power of these revelations was first demonstrated by WikiLeaks, which broke the confidentiality of US diplomatic cables. The effect was much enhanced by the Snowden files, which exposed, <em>inter alia</em>, US spying on other western leaders.</p> <p>Information warfare has become, alongside geo-economics (sanctions and counter-sanctions), one of the principal battlefields in the new confrontation between Russia and the west.</p> <p>Some cases look like direct tit-for-tats. The exposure of the Democratic national committee leadership secretly supporting one candidate against another and thus rigging the primary vote appears as payback for Hillary Clinton\u2019s diatribes against Russia\u2019s own flawed parliamentary elections of December 2011. The opening of World Anti-Doping Agency medical files shows that US Olympic champions did take banned drugs, while Russian athletes were banned <em>en masse</em> from participating in the Rio Games.</p> <p>However, all this is just the tip of the iceberg. It may seem that all Russia is doing is trying to get even and making its accusers appear guilty of the same crimes with which they charge Moscow. There is a big difference, though. Russian public life is permeated with cynicism. The president is a tsar. Elections are about confirming rulers in power, not changing them: \u201cYou first get into the Kremlin, and then I\u2019ll vote for you.\u201d People get rich not before they enter government service or after they leave it, but while they are in government. Law is a tool of the high and mighty. This cynicism has its limits, and the Russian people\u2019s proverbial patience may suddenly snap, but their level of tolerance is generally high. By contrast, western political systems have become used to more than a fair share of hypocrisy. Call it political correctness, or values, or ideology, but western societies are more vulnerable to the exposure of wrongdoing and abuse which is not individual but systemic, particularly when it comes to democracy.</p> <p>It is one thing for the Russian people to be told that their vote has been stolen; it is totally different for the American electorate to believe, as Donald Trump has suggested, that presidential elections can be rigged. And democracy is again becoming an issue all over the European Union and America.</p> <p>Putin certainly sees the widening gulf separating western elites from their disgruntled co-citizens, left behind in the process of globalisation and unrestrained money-making, and \u2013 insult to injury \u2013 branded \u201cdeplorable\u201d. He also notes that the triumph of democracy over communism three decades ago has led to the political systems of Europe and America essentially eschewing any meaningful competition within those systems.</p> <p>With inequality on the rise, this only leads to dissent and challenge emerging from outside the established systems and against them. As someone who is now locked in a battle with the US political establishment, he closely studies the state of his adversary and draws conclusions from it.</p> <p>One conclusion which might surprise him is the notion that he can manipulate not just European politicians but also American elections, and lead, single-handedly, a global challenge against the existing liberal democratic order. By now Putin paranoia has reached a level far above the occasional playing of the \u201cRussia card\u201d against the opponent. This betrays a degree of uncertainty among the ruling elites of the western world which one could not imagine even a few years ago. This uncertainty is not necessarily good for Russia, as the risks tend to mount, but it surely can and will be exploited in the ongoing great power struggle.</p> <p>There are many lessons to be drawn from the demise of the Soviet Union a quarter of a century ago. One is that imperial hubris is eventually punished; another is that attempts to bring a supposedly advanced political system to a nation unprepared for it usually ends in failure, and that the elites who get too far away from their public are caught up with the reality when it is already too late.</p> <p>Modern western nations are not like the USSR, but their leaders might wish to consider that, in the end, what killed the Soviet system was not Reagan\u2019s Star Wars, or even the scarcity of goods in the shops; the people in that part of the world had known worse. What actually did it was the loss of public faith in the domestic political system. So, improve or beware of exposure.</p> <p> <em>Dmitri Trenin is director of the Carnegie Moscow Center</em></p>",
  "<p>The sea ice covering the most northerly part of our planet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/16/arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-to-second-lowest-level-ever-recorded\" title=\"\">shrank last week</a> to its second lowest level on record. Once stable at around 7.5m sq km in summer, the Arctic ice cap has been dwindling for several decades and dropped to an area of 4.1m sq km a few days ago, a victim of the rising fossil-fuel emissions and increasing temperatures that now beset the Earth. At the same time, the US space agency Nasa announced that August 2016 had tied with July 2016 as the <a href=\"http://phys.org/news/2016-09-august-equals-july-hottest-month.html\" title=\"\">hottest month globally ever recorded</a>. Our world is heating up dramatically.</p> <p>As winter returns to the far north, its ice cover will slowly return, of course, though it will certainly not be restored to its former glory. The overall trend of summer Arctic sea-ice cover has been a steadily downwards one for the past 30 years, an inexorable decline that has deeply worrying implications for the region, and for the rest of the planet, as we report today. An Arctic that is regularly free of sea ice in summer \u2013 a real prospect for the middle of the century \u2013 will open up that fragile, pristine wilderness to all sorts of potential woes: overfishing; pollution related to oil drilling and mineral extraction; the eradication of indigenous species; and the destruction of native communities. In addition, with little or no ice left to reflect solar radiation back into space, and its dark waters absorbing more and more of that radiation, the Arctic will heat up even further, enhancing the global warming that has already taken a grip on the planet. As Professor Gail Whiteman, of Lancaster University, <a href=\"http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/news/forget-the-ftse-500-the-arctic-is-the-real-barometer-of-global-risk/\" title=\"\">remarked last week</a>: \u201cForget the FTSE: Arctic sea ice is the real barometer of global risk.\u201d</p> <p>Urgent action is clearly needed, a point that is not lost on international climate negotiators. In a few weeks, they are scheduled to <a href=\"http://www.cop22.ma/en\" title=\"\">assemble in Marrakech</a> in order to discuss the ratification of the Paris agreement, which was hammered out late last year and which seeks to limit the burning of fossil fuels in order to restrict carbon dioxide emissions and so limit global temperature rises to around 2C since pre-industrial times. To date, a total of 27 nations \u2013 including Brazil, China and the United States \u2013 have formally backed the plan, and a further 20 countries are expected to add their names in the next few days. Crucially, the United Kingdom has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-37272671\" title=\"\">made no commitment to back the Paris accord</a>. Yet the agreement needs the formal support of 55 nations before it can come into force.</p> <p>The fact that the Britain still refuses to put its name to the treaty is therefore deeply worrying. The government claims that it is committed, ultimately, to backing the agreement but the longer it delays, the more it is likely to lose the leadership it once commanded when it came to climate change issues. Even if Britain misses the legislative deadline set for the Marrakech meeting, an announcement now that it is committed to the Paris agreement would send a much-needed message to the world. It would let them know that the current UK government still realises the urgency of the situation and the perils that face the planet.</p> <p>The problem is not one that should be viewed as being vague and global, however. It is a precise danger and it is a local one as well. As the planet heats up, so the United Kingdom is also becoming warmer and wetter. Our eight warmest years on record have occurred from 2000 onwards, and during that time we have also experienced six of our seven wettest years. The atmosphere, as it heats up, is holding on to more and more water which it then releases as bursts of intense rainfall. This point was emphasised by the <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/news/2016/national-flood-resilience-review\" title=\"\">National Flood Resilience Review</a>, published earlier this month, which admitted that we are now facing a greater threat of flooding due to heaver rainfall and rising sea levels than ever before. Monthly rainfall totals in winter could be up to 30% higher than recent past extremes, it stated.</p> <p>Last December\u2019s record flooding \u2013 which saw 341mm of rain fall in 24 hours at Honister Pass in the Lake District, for example \u2013 is certainly likely to be surpassed in the next few years. Yet the government is so far committed to making only the most rudimentary of infrastructure improvements in order to combat the problem, and has pledged a mere \u00a312m of extra cash for anti-flooding measures. That level of response is simply insufficient.</p> <p>There is a real need now for the government to assure the public that it understands the risks we face from climate change and commit itself fully to this urgent and pressing issue.</p> <h2>CLIMATE CHANGE</h2>",
  "<p>Among my greater regrets as a parent is not learning, in time to try it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/nov/17/jamie-oliver-chilli-punishment-bad-idea\" title=\"\">Jamie Oliver\u2019s tip</a> for correcting an unruly child. \u201cI give them chillies for punishment,\u201d said the celebrity chef, campaigner and parenting guru. He was inspired after one of his many children \u2013 the total, I understand, now stands at nine or more \u2013 was disrespectful to him. \u201cShe asked for an apple. I cut it up into several pieces and I rubbed it with Scotch Bonnet and it worked a treat. She ran up to mum and said, \u2018this is peppery\u2019. I was in the corner laughing.\u201d</p> <p>Moral: always keep a good stock of Scotch Bonnet chillies in your parenting store cupboard. Or better, a range of chillies, to cater for different levels of insubordination, and for children whose sophisticated palates may require something stronger than the Scotch Bonnet\u2019s 350,000 Scoville heat units to make the mouth burn with pain. Some tiger mothers speak highly of the Carolina Reaper, at least in the run-up to exams.</p> <p>And that, to the uninitiated, is what it is to act like a parent, a practice which Oliver, with his dietician\u2019s hat on, has just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/13/jamie-oliver-theresa-may-obesity-strategy-uk\" title=\"\">recommended to Theresa May.</a> In an interview in the <em>Radio Times</em>, promoting a series called <em>Family Super Foods</em>, he proposed a link between child-rearing and improved public health decisions, Mrs May having just chosen to combat epidemic child obesity with a minor sugary drinks charge. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong\u201d, Oliver said, \u201cI\u2019m not slagging her off for the sake of it. I wanted her to act not like a politician, but a parent.\u201d</p> <p>That might be tricky, the interviewer informed Mr Oliver, in that Mrs May has no children. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that,\u201d Oliver confessed. And to be fair, the campaigner was probably busy posting inspirational, dad-and-baby selfies when the current environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, made childless-shaming a feature of the Tory leadership contest. Speaking, she emphasised, as a mother of three, Leadsom suggested that May, like her fellow non-mum, Angela Merkel, was at a tragic disadvantage. \u201cGenuinely, I feel that being a mum means you have a very real stake in the future of our country, a tangible stake.\u201d</p> <p>The fact that Oliver must also have overlooked renewed debate about the intrusive scrutiny of intangibly-staked women celebrities and politicians, following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/04/nicola-sturgeon-speaks-about-miscarriage-at-40\" title=\"\">Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s disclosures</a>, does not, of course, devalue his criticism of the food industry and its protection by the Tories. Further dilution, by May, of an already feeble obesity strategy is, as Oliver suggests, a shocker, being suspect-looking as well as backward and irresponsible, and thoroughly disheartening to anyone who believed her early rhetoric about the less privileged.</p> <p>Obesity, as Sir Harpal Kumar, Cancer Research UK\u2019s chief executive, wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/21/obesity-plan-betrays-children-preventable-cancer-nhs-industry-lobbying\" title=\"\">in the <em>Guardian</em></a>, after May made \u2013 quietly, from her holidays \u2013 her second most offensive decision after the promotion of father-of-five, Boris Johnson, \u201chas a disproportionate impact on the poorest in our society \u2026 the poorer you are, the more likely you are to be obese.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What does Oliver mean by telling May to act like a parent? Should she be advocating chilli-spiked punishments, like him?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Even so, there are enough overweight people around to indicate a measure of parental responsibility for this outcome. If parents were, really, the solution to poor dietary habits, then Oliver would not need politicians to act like parents. He confirmed it himself during his school dinners campaign of 2006, around the same time a group of Rotherham mothers had started a mercy junk food run, for children nauseated by healthy options.</p> <p>On television,<a href=\"https://www.thecaterer.com/articles/308708/jamie-oliver-criticises-parents-for-kids-disgraceful-packed-lunches\" title=\"\"> Oliver lost patience</a>. \u201cI\u2019ve spent two years being PC about parents,\u201d he said. \u201cNow is the time to say, \u2018If you\u2019re giving your young children fizzy drinks you\u2019re an arsehole, you\u2019re a tosser. If you give them bags of crisps you\u2019re an idiot. If you aren\u2019t cooking them a hot meal, sort it out.\u201d</p> <p>That this was possibly not ideal marketing, as the Oliver brand expanded from cookery books and programmes into the current \u00a3240m empire of necessarily arsehole-and-tosser-friendly goods and restaurants, with a continuing sideline in free public health advice, may partly account for his current conviction that parents enjoy a moral edge over politicians, and not only Mrs May. For although his comments about the prime minister were ignorant and poorly timed, it should be said in his defence that he is happy \u2013 with a line that promises to replace the old \u201cpukka\u201d as his catchphrase \u2013 to insult childless politicians of both sexes.</p> <p>Where <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/story/2015-10-19/jamie-oliver-cameron-needs-to-be-bold-and-brave-over-sugar-tax/\" title=\"\">reducing sugar</a> is concerned, he has argued, the state should \u201cfrankly, act like a parent\u201d. And of David Cameron\u2019s public health responsibilities, \u201cI\u2019m not really as interested in him as a politician [so much] as a father.\u201d</p> <p>The comment could hardly have been more pleasing to a politician who, from the start, adopted the young-family line of political self-promotion that has emerged since child-rearing was elevated, as Nora Ephron once put it, \u201cto a sacrament\u201d. Moments after the death of John Smith, for instance, Cherie Blair identified her children as electoral attractions with which the then single Gordon Brown could not possibly compete. \u201cWhat could be more grounding than bringing up a young family?\u201d Mrs Blair asks readers of her autobiography. Oh, I don\u2019t know. Property speculation with her style adviser\u2019s conman boyfriend? It perplexed Cherie that Brown hadn\u2019t married, even for appearances: \u201cIf he had, in my view, he would inevitably have been a more rounded person, with another dimension to his life.\u201d</p> <p>That the public benefits of the Blairs\u2019 parenting experience (including the addition of yet another dimension after Cherie neglected her \u201cequipment\u201d), are still not clear \u2013 least of all to the parents whose children were sent, by Blair, to their deaths \u2013 has yet to diminish respect for similar, imagined assets. Conversely, Nicola Sturgeon <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/04/nicola-sturgeon-speaks-about-miscarriage-at-40\" title=\"\">has felt compelled to explain</a> having no children.</p> <p>As for Leadsom, she was just exceptionally stupid in throwing down her fertility challenge, as opposed to reciting \u201cmum\u201d, and \u201cschool run\u201d, and alluding, repeatedly, to her child total.</p> <p>She might have learned, for example, from the 2015 general election, which doubled as a parent-off between Cameron, with his rueful, Nancy anecdotes, and Miliband\u2019s \u201cas the dad of two young boys\u201d. But older is good too, for anyone in the one career \u2013 assuming we exclude midwifery, fostering and the aristocracy \u2013 where reproductive fitness constitutes a qualification. In the US, Trump lines up his various dependants as if determined to prove that prolific parenting is entirely compatible with viciousness and folly.</p> <p>Even with school-run credentials, I\u2019m not sure what Oliver means by telling May to act like a parent. Should she be advocating chilli-spiked punishments, like him? Or Blair\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4600454.stm\" title=\"\">loving smack</a>\u201d? Or does he have in mind that fathomless altruism whose absence Leadsom diagnosed in the less blessed? That tangible stake she shares with fellow parents, Gove and Johnson, Hilton and Farage?

There\u2019s one over here.\u201d He bends down and prises the remains of a pheasant from the long grass. \u201cThat\u2019s a buzzard kill, you can tell by the way it\u2019s been eaten.\u201d</p> <p>Boxall is a gamekeeper, raising 10,000 pheasants a year to be killed in commercial shoots on the land he rents in Gloucestershire. This year, however, the pheasants have something other than Boxall\u2019s clients to fear: the buzzard.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s an old saying: where there\u2019s livestock, there\u2019s going to be deadstock,\u201d Boxall says. \u201cYou accept the buzzards are always going to have some, but this year was horrendous. I lost 500 pheasants at \u00a33.75 each. It cost me \u00a375 a day to pay someone to sit there all day to watch over them, basically sunbathing for two weeks, but it did keep them away.\u201d</p> <p>The buzzard\u2019s robust health \u2013 and its appetite for pheasants \u2013 has brought the protected bird of prey into the sights of the shooting industry. At the end of July, Natural England, the government agency tasked with protecting England\u2019s wildlife, issued a licence allowing a gamekeeper to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/issue-of-buzzard-licence\" title=\"\">shoot up to 10 buzzards</a> to stop them killing pheasants. Last week it announced that four more licences were under consideration. While the announcement couldn\u2019t come soon enough for Boxall, it has left many conservationists up in arms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c2ce041c145ffe77c3423b56626e98415df708a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2ce041c145ffe77c3423b56626e98415df708a1/0_0_3818_3750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gamekeeper Tim Boxall with the remains of a dead pheasant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"982\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gamekeeper Tim Boxall with the remains of a dead pheasant found next to his pen in Gloucestershire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Glaister/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf you take a buzzard out, others will move in,\u201d said the broadcaster and naturalist Chris Packham, describing Natural England\u2019s decision as a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d. \u201cAll you are doing is making a vacuum. In practical terms it\u2019s doomed to fail. In ethical terms it\u2019s abhorrent. These are native birds being killed to protect a non-native species, it\u2019s Lewis Carroll, it\u2019s insane.

In order to protect a private business concern. To protect a few of the tens of millions of non-native game birds that are released into the countryside each year.\u201d</p> <p>Gamekeepers, however, are having none of it. \u201cThe RSPB line is nonsense,\u201d said a spokesman for the <a href=\"http://www.nationalgamekeepers.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Gamekeepers\u2019 Organisation</a>. \u201cIn law it\u2019s quite clear: Natural England cannot grant a licence for any purpose that would adversely affect the sustainable status of the species concerned. There has to be a genuine need and no other satisfactory solution. Natural England cannot refuse a licence if those tests are met.\u201d</p> <p>While campaigners question the morality of the decision, they cannot question its legality. The gamekeepers\u2019 organisation backed a successful judicial review launched by a gamekeeper last year to challenge Natural England\u2019s decision to refuse him a licence to control buzzards. Under the terms of the high court ruling, Natural England must \u201cbalance the protection of wild birds against the requirement to prevent serious damage to livestock\u201d. The court further ruled that, \u201cwhere birds are either in pens or are significantly dependent on people, they are classed as livestock\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6cde85a5428a66ff6cf3792740d271778549a3a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cde85a5428a66ff6cf3792740d271778549a3a5/0_913_4912_6140/800.jpg\" alt=\"Broadcaster Chris Packham\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Broadcaster Chris Packham has described the buzzard hunting licence as a catastrophe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The buzzard, a protected bird of prey, has recovered from near extinction in the Victorian age to become one of the conservation movement\u2019s success stories. With between 57,000 and 79,000 breeding pairs in the UK, according to the <a href=\"https://www.bto.org/\" title=\"\">British Trust for Ornithology</a>, it is one of the fastest growing bird populations in the country. In support of its decision, Natural England noted that in July the trust declared that buzzards \u201care not considered to be of current conservation concern\u201d.</p> <p>An estimated 40 million non-native pheasants are released into the British countryside each year. A report for the <a href=\"https://basc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">British Association for Shooting and Conservation</a> estimated that on average between 1% and 2% of pheasant poults were killed by birds of prey.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of hyperbole and panic about this,\u201d said the gamekeepers\u2019 organisation spokesman. \u201cAll birds are protected by law. Buzzards are no different. The only difference is one of perception, that for years it\u2019s been believed that in some ways buzzards are different, that they have a separate protection. You can\u2019t go on saying that there was once a time when this [species] was scarce and using it as a reason to prevent licences.\u201d</p> <p>However, campaigners say that the legal shooting of buzzards will make it more difficult to police the illegal shooting of birds of prey. Calling the move shameful, Eduardo Gon\u00e7alves, chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.league.org.uk/\" title=\"\">League Against Cruel Sports</a>, said: \u201cAuthorising this protected raptor to be killed purely to boost the profits of private shooting interests sets a very dangerous precedent. It\u2019s difficult to see how the police can effectively tackle the illegal persecution of these birds of prey now the floodgate of government-approved exceptions to the law has opened.\u201d</p> <p>Boxall remembers when buzzards were rare. \u201cWhen I came here in 1990 you never saw buzzards,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you did you thought, bloody hell, what\u2019s that? They used to feed on carcasses, but they can\u2019t do that now because farmers aren\u2019t allowed to leave carcasses, so they turn to the next easiest thing. The next thing we\u2019ll get is red kites. They\u2019re lovely birds, but they have to eat.\u201d</p> <p>The gamekeeper pauses and cocks an ear. \u201cThat\u2019s a buzzard calling now.

  "<p>On the old hillside road linking Grasmere and Ambleside, above Windermere, stands a gate that \u201ctime out of mind\u201d, as William Wordsworth put it, has been called the Wishing Gate.</p> <p>This month, while cheering crowds below lined the route of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/03/mark-cavendish-bradley-wiggins-tour-of-britain\" title=\"\">the Tour of Britain cycle race</a>, there were few tourists who made the trip up to see this unimposing wooden gate.</p> <p>Now, in a response to the recent re-establishment of \u201cBront\u00eb Land\u201d on the other side of the Pennines, Wordsworth is leading a comeback for Cumbrian literary tourism, reminding visitors that if it was not for his work, and that of his fellow Lakeland Poets, we might never have felt so strongly about one of England\u2019s most dramatic natural landscapes.</p> <p>The Wishing Gate, alongside dozens of other locations, is a key element of a drive to revive literary tourism in the Lake District by reminding visitors of the places that inspired Wordsworth, the area\u2019s most famous son. His 1828 poem about the dreamy view from a gate on this site celebrates the superstitious human habit of making wishes. A troubled visiting \u201cworldling\u201d in search of good luck, he suggests, \u201cMight stop before this favoured scene, / At Nature\u2019s call, nor blush to lean /Upon the Wishing Gate \u2026\u201d</p> <p>To pinpoint these Wordsworthian \u201cspots in time\u201d <a href=\"http://wordsworthcountry.org.uk\" title=\"\">an online guide has been created</a> to map and explain the landmarks and vantage points that shaped some of the best-known verses in the English language. The Wordsworth Trust initiative, which boldly brings back the 19th-century promotional phrase \u201cWordsworth Country\u201d, may also help to protect and restore several of these literary landmarks.</p> <p>\u201cWe want people to think of it as Wordsworth Country again,\u201d said Paul Kleian, communications head at the trust. \u201cAfter all, it was while he was here, and living in Grasmere in particular, that he had his incredibly productive eight-year period from 1799, producing and revising works like the <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>, <em>The Recluse </em>and <em>The Prelude</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Before the romantic works of Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey had extolled the beauty of mists rolling down deserted crags, the uninhabited wildernesses of the north were widely regarded as grim.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Wordsworth came back to the Lakes to write it was at a time when the European grand tour had become rather too dangerous, due to the aftermath of revolution and the rise of Napoleon,\u201d said Kleian. \u201cThis area was suddenly the best place to come for adventure.\u201d</p> <p>The trust\u2019s new web guide puts lines of poetry alongside vintage tourist illustrations to celebrate 42 locations closely associated with the poet\u2019s works and offers tourists fresh destinations to rival his former homes, Dove Cottage and Rydal Mount, or the banks of Ullswater, where he once famously \u201cwandered lonely as a cloud\u201d and saw \u201ca host of golden daffodils\u201d.</p> <p>The app might take you, for instance, to Patterdale, where Wordsworth wrote of the \u201cwild stream Of Aira\u201d, the waterfall known as Aira Force that flows down a hidden ravine.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jan/15/after-floods-uk-tourism-lakes-york-recovery\" title=\"\">Unwanted cascades of water have been a big problem for the area</a> in recent months and, while extensive repair work continues after last winter\u2019s floods, yet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/03/national-trust-lake-district-borrowdale-sheep-farm-sale-fight\" title=\"\">another heritage battle raged last month</a> over whether the Lake District\u2019s rural scenery should be held in static preservation for the nation, or farmed by local&#xa0;people.</p> <p>For the team at the Wordsworth Trust, however, the most important issue is the preservation of public access to places that influenced the poet. Their latest tourist push does, all the same, coincide with final efforts to put together a case for World Heritage status for the region in 2017 and with preparations for Wordsworth\u2019s 250th birthday celebrations in 2020, which are being supported by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/03/william-wordsworths-daffodils-cottage-set-for-5m-improvement-grant\" title=\"\">a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of almost \u00a35m</a>.</p> <p>Wordsworth, whose parents had both died by the time he was a teenager, was born in Cockermouth in 1770 and went to boarding school in Hawkshead. After university in Cambridge, he toured revolutionary Europe and then set up home briefly in the West Country with his sister Dorothy, where he met Coleridge, his collaborator on their early popular volume, the <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>.</p> <p>On a walking tour back in his native Lake District, Wordsworth stumbled across a former pub in Grasmere, which, renamed Dove Cottage, became a home for him, his sister, his wife Mary Hutchinson, and their children. The neighbouring building now houses the Wordsworth Trust and original manuscripts including Dorothy\u2019s pivotal journal, a record of their many walks.</p> <p>All the key Wordsworth buildings appear on the app, but the emphasis is on the landscape and the poems.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the details are still disputed,\u201d said Jeff Cowton, the longstanding curator at the Wordsworth Trust, \u201cbut we welcome the debate. The old tour guides sometimes get it wrong. People in Hawkshead tend to believe the childhood boat-stealing incident recalled in <em>The Prelude </em>happened at neighbouring Esthwaite Water, but since Wordsworth writes that he did not know the lake well, it may well have been Ullswater.\u201d (\u201cOne summer evening (led by her) I found / A little boat tied to a willow tree / Within a rocky cove, its usual home. / Straight I unloosed her chain, and stepping in / Pushed from the shore \u2026\u201d)</p> <p>Cowton admits there is similar disagreement about the \u201cfamous brook\u201d mentioned in the same poem. Once an \u201cunruly child of mountain birth\u201d it has been \u201cboxed\u201d by the town and \u201cStripped of his voice and left to dimple down\u201d. It is normally thought to be in Flag Street, Hawkshead, near Wordsworth\u2019s lodgings, but Cowton suspects it was in the next village, Colthouse, where the young Wordsworth also stayed.</p> <p>Visitors to Dove Cottage this autumn can see entertaining evidence of the poet\u2019s impact on British tourism in a special exhibition. It charts the growing interest in the scenery of the Lakes and in the Romantic sensibility. From 1820 Wordsworth was esteemed enough for tourists to come to the area armed with books of his poetry. The brazen even knocked on his door.</p> <p>After his death in 1850 a popular guidebook, <em>Through Wordsworth Country</em>, was published and over the next 80 years this term, alongside \u201cWordsworthshire\u201d, was commonly used on railway posters and road signs and in travel brochures. But in 1973 when the names of Cumberland and Westmorland were finally superseded by Cumbria, all the old signs were taken down. So the trust is keen to hear from anyone who has a surviving example.</p> <p>If the campaign to reignite the Wordsworth flame ahead of 2020 succeeds, the \u201cmoss-grown bar\u201d of Wordsworth\u2019s Wishing Gate may soon be crowded with \u201cstrangers from afar\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8fb606096bdb3634875d5c375f6c987b0bda69fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fb606096bdb3634875d5c375f6c987b0bda69fb/0_441_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A view over Windermere in autumn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A view over Windermere in autumn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Burton/Getty Images/Robert Harding World Imagery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>SOURCES OF INSPIRATION</h2> <p><strong>Esthwaite Water</strong><br><strong>Wordsworth went to school in Hawkshead near this lake and went there before lessons:</strong> \u201cMorning walks/Were early before the hours of school/I travelled round our little lake, five miles/Of pleasant wandering.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Windermere</strong><br><strong>The lake appears often in his work.

It has become clear that many people did not vote on the substantive issue of the referendum but rather sought to show their contempt for the political ruling class, thus the senseless result.</p> <p>To have a referendum in a democracy, there must be a well-educated electorate; that, all too evidently, was not the case. Many people simply had no clue how laws are invoked within the EU structure.

  "<p>Ever since the internet went mainstream in the 1990s people wondered about how it would affect democratic politics. In seeking an answer to the question, we made the mistake that people have traditionally made when thinking about new communications technology: we overestimated the short-term impacts while grievously underestimating the longer-term ones.</p> <p>The first-order effects appeared in 2004 when Howard Dean, then governor of Vermont, entered the Democratic primaries to seek the party\u2019s nomination for president. What made his campaign distinctive was that he used the internet for fundraising. Instead of the traditional method of tapping wealthy donors, Dean and his online guru, Larry Biddle, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Dean_presidential_campaign,_2004\">turned to the internet </a>and raised about $50m, mostly in the form of small individual donations from 350,000 supporters. By the standards of the time, it was an eye-opening achievement.</p> <p>In the event, Dean\u2019s campaign imploded when he made an over-excited speech after coming third in the Iowa caucuses \u2013 the so-called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeZGePI62rU&amp;feature=youtu.be\">\u201cDean scream\u201d</a> which, according to the conventional wisdom of the day, showed that he was too unstable a character to be commander-in-chief. Looked at in the light of the Trump campaign, this is truly weird, for compared with the current Republican candidate, Dean looks like a combination of Spinoza and St Francis of Assisi.</p> <p>But the lessons of Dean\u2019s approach to fundraising were not lost on later contenders, particularly Barack Obama, who put together a team of tech whizzes drawn from the big internet companies and deployed all the black arts of surveillance capitalism to target voters, motivate supporters and get out the vote \u2013 on two occasions, 2008 and 2012.</p> <p>These initiatives were first-order effects because they were predictable: they merely harnessed the obvious affordances of online technology \u2013 the ability to communicate efficiently with a large number of people, solicit and process donations, disseminate campaign messages and so on. They changed the way campaigns were conducted but they did not change the nature of politics.</p> <p>The second-order effects of the internet \u2013 the technology\u2019s ability to mobilise and coordinate large-scale collective action \u2013 were first seen in late 2010 when the Arab Spring kicked off. As Helen Margetts of the Oxford Internet Institute and her colleagues argue in their book <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2cdnjAm\"><em>Political Turbulence: How Social Media Shape Collective Action</em></a>, the internet did what it had done in every area of commercial life, namely lower the transaction costs of doing something \u2013 in this case engaging in political activity. This is creating, Margetts and her colleagues argue, a new kind of \u201cturbulent\u201d, fast-moving, unpredictable politics.</p> <p>Six years on, the Trump campaign has demonstrated quite how turbulent, fast-moving and unpredictable politics has become. We have seen how the internet (in the shape of social media) has become a powerful enabler of \u201cpost-truth\u201d politics \u2013 defined by <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21706525-politicians-have-always-lied-does-it-matter-if-they-leave-truth-behind-entirely-art\">the<em> Economist</em></a> as \u201ca reliance on assertions that \u2018feel true\u2019 but have no basis in fact\u201d. Trump\u2019s brazenness is not punished, but taken as evidence of his willingness to stand up to despicable elites.</p> <p>\u201cDid you know,\u201d asks Zeynep Tufekci in the <em>New York Times</em>, \u201cthat Hillary Clinton has a body double? She was that blond woman waving at reporters in front of Chelsea Clinton\u2019s apartment a few hours after Mrs Clinton felt unwell and left the September 11 commemoration at ground zero. Did you also hear that Mrs Clinton has Parkinson\u2019s disease? Her coughing fits prove it, as does her latest bout of illness. She has epilepsy, as well as advancing dementia. She has managed to hide all these illnesses through almost a year and a half of a gruelling campaign because the man the world thinks is the head of her secret service detail is actually her hypnotist. He\u2019s also a medical doctor.\u201d</p> <p>This is the kind of stuff that Professor Tufekci, an academic who has been studying the content of social media conversations about the US election, has picked up online. In an earlier media ecology, one dominated by the editorial gatekeepers of newspaper editors and TV news anchors, this kind of conspiratorial fantasising would never have seen the light of day. But now what the comedian Stephen Colbert calls \u201ctruthiness\u201d \u2013 ideas that \u201cfeel right\u201d or \u201cshould be true\u201d \u2013 passes as fact on social media. The days when Daniel Patrick Moynihan could say that \u201ceveryone is entitled to his own opinions, but not to his own facts\u201d are gone. And the internet is largely responsible for their passing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa445b6306cb55a8de247ca8589b53c3d6c8dfd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa445b6306cb55a8de247ca8589b53c3d6c8dfd1/0_193_4800_2881/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump is a genius at exploiting social media to spread ideas that \u2018feel right\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump is a genius at exploiting social media to spread ideas that \u2018feel right\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jose Luis Magana/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In some ways, this was predictable, especially given that <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/07/trump-time-capsule-62-a-man-who-can-be-baited-with-a-tweet/493631/\">Trump turned out to be a genius</a> at harnessing the affordances of Twitter: 140 characters is the perfect length for truthiness \u2013 just enough to make a baseless insinuation. But what makes this election campaign really distinctive is the way in which the intrinsic insecurity of network technology has begun to play a significant role. The United States has a long history of interfering in other states\u2019 elections but this is the first time it has had to contemplate the possibility that a hostile state might be interfering with its own electoral processes.</p> <p>It started in April with the hacking of the Democratic national committee\u2019s computer systems. The intruders stole <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/07/heres-know-russia-dnc-hack/\">private emails</a>, opposition research (including the DNC manual on how to deal with Trump in the general election), and campaign correspondence. In the run-up to the DNC national convention, WikiLeaks obligingly put nearly 20,000 of those private emails online, revealing embarrassing details of the Democratic party\u2019s inner workings \u2013 including correspondence which made it clear how opposed its officials were to Hillary Clinton\u2019s rival, Bernie Sanders. These revelations made a predictable impact on the convention, where Sanders\u2019s supporters were mightily disaffected.</p> <p>Although it is often difficult to attribute responsibility for hacking, in this case it was rapidly established that the hackers were working for not one but two of the <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/all-signs-point-to-russia-being-behind-the-dnc-hack\">Russian government\u2019s intelligence services</a> (and, ironically, that neither knew of the other\u2019s activities). From this basic fact came a frantic outbreak of speculation and conspiracy theorising. Were the breaks just examples of Putin\u2019s geeks doing what geeks do when they have free rein? Or were they part of a concerted campaign to undermine Clinton (who takes a conventional establishment line on Putin\u2019s Crimean adventure) and boost Trump \u2013 who has made no secret of his admiration for the Russian leader? The pot was further stirred by Trump himself when, at a press conference in Florida, he urged Russia to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/donald-trump-russia-hillary-clinton-emails-dnc-hack\">hack into and release Clinton\u2019s emails</a> from the personal server she used while she was secretary of state. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening,\u201d he said, \u201cI hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.\u201d</p> <p>Pause for a moment to contemplate this: a candidate for the US presidency is urging a foreign adversary to break into his opponent\u2019s email. And this in a country in which \u201cnational security\u201d has quasi-religious status. The episode demonstrates how far Trump\u2019s mastery of Twitter has enabled him to move the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window\">\u201cOverton window\u201d</a> \u2013 the range of ideas that are deemed permissible in public discourse.</p> <p>But the audacity of the Russian hacks has introduced an unprecedented level of unease into the election campaign. Ironically, Trump himself started it with continual assertions that if he were defeated it would be because the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/09/15/donald-trump-says-the-election-will-be-rigged-half-of-his-supporters-seem-inclined-to-agree/?utm_term=.109dace951fd\">election was \u201crigged\u201d</a> by \u201ccrooked Hillary\u201d and her satraps \u2013 a proposition apparently believed by nearly half of his supporters. But, as it happens, one doesn\u2019t have to be paranoid to worry about the integrity of US presidential election returns. In the old, analogue, days the concern was about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_election_recount\">\u201changing chads\u201d</a>; now it is about the integrity of digital infrastructure. Security experts have been warning for years about the chronic <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/08/2016-elections-russia-hack-how-to-hack-an-election-in-seven-minutes-214144\">insecurity of American voting machines</a> \u2013 which, as one professor put it, \u201cbarely work in a <em>friendly</em> environment\u201d. And last month the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/fbi-states-voting-systems-digital-assualt-227523\">FBI issued an unprecedented nationwide alert</a> after voter databases in Arizona and Illinois were hacked and their data stolen by as-yet-unidentified hackers.</p> <p>So one of the strange outcomes of this weird election campaign is that we are finally beginning to get an idea of the long-term effects of the internet on our politics. It has been obvious for some time that social media were moving us in the direction of a post-truth polity. The rise of Donald Trump (and Brexit) suggests that we have arrived at that particular destination. What\u2019s more worrying, though, is the prospect that the technology\u2019s intrinsic insecurity could undermine one of the fundamental principles of liberal democracy, namely faith in the integrity of the electoral system. If people start to believe that elections are \u2013 or may be \u2013 rigged, then the democratic game is over. \u201cThe only thing we have to fear,\u201d said Franklin Roosevelt, \u201cis fear itself.\u201d Which is why we should be concerned by what\u2019s been happening this year.</p> <p><em>John Naughton is co-director (with David Runciman) of the technology and democracy project at Cambridge University</em></p>",
  "<p>It might appear the contrast between the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/06/black-lives-matter-protesters-occupy-london-city-airport-runway\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matters</a> protesters who closed London City airport runway, and the junior doctors leading their colleagues into 15 days of strike action, could not be starker. The former are a small band of radical environmentalists, drawn from the nation\u2019s organic farms and houseboats, zipping across the Thames to save the world\u2019s black people from climate change. The latter are a group of professionals who work long hours in the service of the NHS, galvanised into striking by the imposition of a contract that they see as unfair.</p> <p>But, barely visible beneath the noisy anger , runs a common thread. Both claim to represent the interests of large groups of people, endowing their action with a moral legitimacy it wouldn\u2019t otherwise have. But both protests have been captured by a small group looking to advance their own agendas.</p> <p>In the case of Black Lives Matters, this is quite obvious. It is hard to take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/06/climate-change-racist-crisis-london-city-airport-black-lives-matter\" title=\"\">their claim</a> that they are a black-led movement at face value when the City airport protesters were overwhelmingly white and middle-class. They were protesting about climate change, austerity, the migrant crisis: a range of issues they describe as \u201cracialised\u201d because they disproportionately affect black people.</p> <p>The problem is that these are, of course, politically contested issues that black people have different views on: a fact that sits uncomfortably and paternalistically with the implication that anyone not supporting them is not truly anti-racist. Little wonder then that long-standing black activists such as Stafford Scott and Lee Jasper have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/06/nine-black-lives-matter-protesters-arrested-amid-city-airport-travel-chaos/\" title=\"\">criticised the group\u2019s actions</a> in the strongest term.</p> <p>The junior doctors\u2019 strike is more complex, but similar issues lurk beneath the surface. Back in May, the government and the British Medical Association agreed a compromise contract \u2013 after eight days of Acas negotiations \u2013 that BMA leaders described as safe and fair. Yet they then announced the most extreme strike action the NHS has ever faced. Leaked WhatsApp conversations between BMA committee members suggest that what started as a contractual dispute has morphed into a broader political fight designed to cause maximum pain for the government. Strike action has become associated with political concerns about NHS privatisation and funding.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Irresponsible collective action makes the lives of people trying to create social change in constructive ways difficult</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The public would be justified in asking why BMA leaders think they have the right have to call 15 days of strike action, causing huge risk and suffering to patients, in order to further an ill-defined campaign to \u201csave the NHS\u201d from a democratically elected government. Junior doctors would be justified in asking how the BMA can claim it represents the political views of its entire membership. Many are furious it has not balloted members on the latest strike proposals.</p> <p>There is an historic queasiness on the left about questioning ill-conceived protests that undermine rather than further positive social change. Collective action is part of the left\u2019s birthright. That solidarity, one of the left\u2019s hallowed principles, has created a moral imperative to support all forms of collective action regardless of the consequences.</p> <p>Take the miners\u2019 strike: the NUM\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/arthurscargill\" title=\"\">Arthur Scargill</a> made little secret that his objective was to bring down the Thatcher government. He led his members to strike despite not commanding a majority of their support, and shunned more constructive approaches to saving jobs other unions have taken over the years. Yet he faced little public condemnation from Neil Kinnock despite<a href=\"http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/i-felt-helpless-during-miners-7891594]\" title=\"\"> the then Labour leader\u2019s private belief </a>that Scargill\u2019s approach was disastrous.</p> <p>Eight years on from the financial crisis, the right has been forced to accept that capitalism manifests itself in responsible and irresponsible ways: this was the dominant theme of Theresa May\u2019s first speech as prime minister. Is it time for the left to similarly confront the reality that collective action can take responsible and irresponsible forms?</p> <p>Irresponsible collective action has warning signs that should make the left wary before it unconditionally offers solidarity. It is often characterised by leaders who pile in multiple and contested political issues while claiming to speak on behalf of politically diverse groups. It lacks clear objectives despite causing significant disruption and harm. And it tends to be characterised by the absolute moral certainty of those taking part, preventing them from engaging with reasonable but difficult questions about their motivations, meaning they fail to hold themselves accountable for the harm their actions may create.</p> <p>The left has a responsibility to question such action because it undermines responsible forms of collective action and social protest. It makes the lives of people trying to create social change in more constructive and representative ways difficult.</p> <p>The BMA is not just leading action that will cause suffering for vulnerable people, it is handing the political right ammunition against the right to take industrial action, recklessly putting it at risk for those who need it to secure improvements in exploitative working conditions \u2013 for example workers at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\" title=\"\">Sports Direct</a> who were not even paid the minimum wage.</p> <p>The campaign against Sports Direct is the antithesis of the airport protest and the doctor strikes: an example of the power of responsible collective action. It has brought together a grassroots campaign, led by the union Unite, parliamentary action by opposition MPs, and investigative journalism that has forced the company to take action.</p> <p>At a time when globalisation and technological progress are concentrating economic power, the left\u2019s commitment to collective action has never been more critical. Movements of citizens, consumers and workers have huge potential in the battle to better hold global corporates and governments to account. But solidarity for collective action has too often been unconditional, in a way that echoes the right\u2019s fervent belief in the 1980s that the private sector could do no wrong.</p> <p>There is now broad political support for the idea it is right to question the cowboys of the business world that make it harder for responsible businesses to succeed. Perhaps we will only ever realise the power of collective action if the left can ditch its queasiness about questioning the cowboys of social protest.</p>",
  "<p>One of Britain\u2019s most prestigious law firms has banned the use of \u201cDear sirs\u201d from all of its legal documents and communications, apparently the first of the \u201cmagic circle\u201d of top City legal companies to do so.</p> <p>Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer has stopped using the phrase from this weekend. In the UK the firm will now address all communications to \u201cDear Sir or Madam\u201d, while in the US all correspondence will start with \u201cDear Ladies and Gentlemen\u201d. Equivalents in Cantonese, Mandarin and European languages have also been agreed across Freshfields\u2019 global network.</p> <p>The firm implemented the change after one of its London associates researched legal documents from the last 10 initial public offerings of private company shares. It found 81 law firms and banks exclusively used \u201cDear Sirs\u201d on letters and communications during the process. Freshfields\u2019 joint managing partner Chris Pugh said: \u201cIt\u2019s a relatively small change, but it\u2019s a significant point and you notice that when everyone immediately accepts that the change needs to happen.\u201d\u201cI hope it will shed light on other things that we might inadvertently be doing that risk alienating people we communicate with - not only people at Freshfields but clients and other professionals as well.\u201d</p> <p>Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, the UK\u2019s largest charity for women\u2019s rights, said the change was long overdue. \u201cIt\u2019s to be welcomed, but it is pretty basic stuff which we should all be doing really. I still get referred to as \u2018Mr Sam Smethers\u2019 by the media, despite being the chief executive of a women\u2019s charity. We have to think about the language we use as it reveals the assumptions and decisions being made. Even parliament continues to use \u2018he\u2019 in legislation, the assumption being that that will refer to everyone. We should be looking at gender neutral language for our legislation too.\u201d</p> <p>Law firm Withers said the male address was \u201caccepted standard\u201d. A spokesman said: \u201cIt very much depends on who we\u2019re writing to. If they are an individual then it depends on their gender and title. If it\u2019s an organisation, then we currently use \u2018Dear Sirs\u2019 as that remains the accepted standard. There is currently no formal plan to change this, but it is an area we\u2019re happy to explore.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Nick Clegg holds out hope that the Liberal Democrats could play a role in a progressive cross-party government within a few years as he predicts that chaotic Brexit negotiations will gradually destroy support for Theresa May\u2019s government.</p> <p>Speaking before the Lib Dem conference, which opened in Brighton on Saturday, the former party leader and deputy prime minister said that, while the landscape might look bleak for Lib Dems, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2015/may/08/liberal-democrats-snp-scotland-video-analysis\" title=\"\">just eight MPs</a>, they should not think they will necessarily \u201cbe out in the wilderness for a generation\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/12/politics-between-extremes-nick-clegg-review\">Politics: Between the Extremes by Nick Clegg \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cPolitics is so volatile these days and this government is so rudderless when it comes to Brexit negotiations that Liberal Democrats should not dismiss the possibility that we might once again need to play a role in putting the country first sooner than people think,\u201d he told the&#xa0;<em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>Clegg\u2019s conference message to the faithful is that if their party, working together with progressive elements of Labour, the SNP, the Greens and even some on the left of the Conservatives, can offer alternative visions to young people and policy ideas on how to address issues such as intergenerational unfairness, the environment, constitutional reform and Britain\u2019s place in the world, then public support will develop for something other than uninterrupted, Brexit-dominated Tory rule.</p> <p>Brexit, says Clegg, will \u201cparalyse the government over the next few years\u201d as ministers discover they cannot \u201chave their cake and eat it\u201d by negotiating favourable trade arrangements with the EU without bowing to its rules.</p> <p>The likely result, he says, will be that the Conservatives, urged on by their members and the rightwing press, will force May into a \u201cpanic Brexit\u201d \u2013 a hard Brexit that will involve the UK turning its back entirely on Europe \u2013 before the next election in 2020, which will severely damage the country.</p> <p>\u201cI think at that point, particularly if investors start taking fright, and it starts dawning on people that the government does not have a road map, I think that then the public appetite for other parties to provide an alternative will grow.</p> <p>\u201cIt does not necessarily need to be a new amalgam party overnight. It could be. If that gridlock were to lead to a real sense of drift and malaise, it could be a government of national unity of some description, where parties of different persuasions say they will act together for a period of time, in order to get the country out of the corner the Tories have got it into.\u201d</p> <p>Rather than being dead in the water after five years in coalition with the Conservatives and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2015/may/08/liberal-democrats-snp-scotland-video-analysis\" title=\"\">the resulting mauling</a> by voters at last year\u2019s election, Clegg insisted that the Lib Dems were in some ways in better shape than the deeply divided Labour party. Labour, he argued, had yet to accept \u201cthat it will never be able to govern on its own again\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to get bigger and we are getting bigger,\u201d he said. \u201cEven at the nadir of our fortunes [at the last election], 2.5&#xa0;million voted for us \u2013 it is a million more than voted for the SNP. It is just because of our crackers electoral system that they get 56 seats and we get eight. We are winning byelections.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cOf course there is a future. There is a huge amount of energy in the country, there is a search for progressive, thoughtful, compassionate, internationalist politics. That energy will go somewhere. It doesn\u2019t dissipate. Any country in my view that takes a massive decision about its own future such as that to leave the EU against the explicit stated wishes of those who will inhabit that future \u2013 in other words, the young \u2013 is taking a huge wrong turn in the road. They did vote in this referendum in very large numbers. It is their future which we have told them they cannot have. That is a powerful source of energy.\u201d</p> <p>Opening the conference, Clegg\u2019s successor as leader, Tim Farron, defended his Christian beliefs, saying he did not understand why some people found his continued refusal to say whether he believes gay sex is sinful a concern. \u201cI think people look at my liberalism, my desire to support people\u2019s rights to make whatever choices they want, and I kind of also expect in the same way people \u2013 maybe it\u2019s a naive expectation \u2013 to respect my beliefs as a Christian,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>Two of the highest-level global summits ever convened on refugees and mass migration take place in New York this week: one by the United Nations and the other by the White House. This should be the reform moment when the world comes together to update a broken system that is struggling to meet contemporary displacement challenges. But a combination of inter-agency turf wars and government foot-dragging make this unlikely.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/17/world-will-not-face-up-to-refugee-crisis-un-obama\">Why won\u2019t the world tackle the refugee crisis?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tomorrow\u2019s UN meeting will focus more on abstract principles of commitment than concrete practice. A conference originally conceived with the intention of addressing the situation of Syrian refugees and the Mediterranean morphed into a negotiation of two \u201cGlobal Compacts\u201d: one on refugees and one on migration. But even these have collapsed in negotiations, such that the final declaration now reveals only vague principles, denuded of substance by spoiler governments.</p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s Obama-led Leaders\u2019 Summit is about pledging. Unable to elicit additional resettlement places from Congress, the administration has focused on playing an international convening goal. It has sought commitments in three areas: additional humanitarian assistance, more resettlement places, and a focus on jobs and education. But with states experiencing donor fatigue, significant new pledges seem improbable.</p> <p>The tragedy is that these meetings have become irresponsibly removed from the real challenges on the ground. They will do little to directly address systematic non-compliance with refugee law in Europe or Australia, to ensure that refugees stuck in camps are not indefinitely trapped in limbo, to address the plight of millions of urban refugees, or to define a response to the millions of people who will be displaced by factors such as climate change that fall outside the existing refugee framework.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Today people are mainly fleeing fragile states characterised by mass violence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The summits have largely bypassed the biggest and most urgent questions relating to institutional reform. There is widespread acknowledgement that the system is broken and yet no appetite to fix it. In 1971 the international monetary system reached its crisis moment and reformed; 2016 should be that moment for refugees. Change is needed because the refugee system was created in the early cold war largely to meet US interests in avoiding the return of displaced Germans to the communist bloc. And yet, in a radically changed world, this time-warped framework is still expected to apply.</p> <p>The basic idea in the 1951 Refugee Convention \u2013 that refugees should not be returned to serious harm \u2013 remains as relevant today as ever. However, its focus on refugees as people fleeing \u201cpersecution\u201d has become antiquated. Today people are mainly fleeing fragile states characterised by mass violence. While courts have sometimes managed to shoehorn contemporary displacement into outdated language, the result is arbitrary exclusions and erratic responses: in 2014 recognition rates for Eritrean asylum seekers ranged from 26% in France to 100% in Sweden. Meanwhile for many years Germany would not recognise Somali refugees because the harm they experienced was from non-state actors rather than a persecuting government.</p> <p>Organisational reform is also off the table. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) does what it does very well: humanitarian aid and camp management, and legal advice to states. But these are no longer the primary things a UN refugee agency needs to be doing. The tools needed today are political engagement, development and economics, and the ability to work in urban environments. The disjuncture is exemplified by the stark reality that the overwhelming majority of Syrian refugees receive no assistance whatsoever from UNHCR or its partners. A UN refugee agency remains indispensable but donor states should be asking for an updated model.</p> <p>On the ground, the default model is one of humanitarian assistance in camps. But too many refugees in camps get stuck there for decades, where they usually have no right to work. 56% of the world\u2019s refugees are in protracted situations, having been in exile for at least 5 years. Refuge needs to be reconceived as at least as much about development as about humanitarianism. It needs to offer jobs and education to the nearly 90% of the world\u2019s refugees who are in developing countries, including the majority who are now in cities.</p> <p>Tragically, a vision for legal, organisational and operational reform will not feature on the agenda this week. Addressing these issues is the key to finding sustainable solutions not only to the Syrian crisis but also inevitable future movements.</p> <p>But there may still be hope. In order to save face, the UN conveners will now use 19 September to launch an ongoing two-year intergovernmental process. At the margins of the formal meetings, governments, businesses and civil society have mobilised to launch a range of exciting initiatives.

Last week, though, they signed the Hurricanes\u2019 full-back Jason Woodward, who will arrive from the Super Rugby franchise at the beginning of November on a two-year deal.</p> <p>The 26-year old also plays on the wing, starting there in the 20-3 victory over the Lions in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/06/hurricanes-claim-maiden-super-rugby-title-with-victory-over-lions\" title=\"\">last month\u2019s 2016 Super Rugby final</a>. He studied at Hartpury College near Gloucester and is qualified to play for England. \u201cWe first looked to bring him over two years ago when he was at the Rebels but he went to the Hurricanes,\u201d says Robinson. \u201cHe is a player of quality who finished the Super Rugby season strongly. He can play in two positions, he is really talented and he is qualified to play for England. He ticks all the boxes and it is great that he wants to join us. As a big lad who is strong in the air, he will suit the conditions here and the way the game is played in the Premiership.\u201d</p> <p>Woodward played at full-back for the Rebels against the Lions in 2013. The side was captained that day by the former Bath and Wales No8 Gareth Delve, who told Bristol not to waste any time in signing him. He will be part of a back division that includes the experienced internationals Gavin Henson and David Lemi, who both miss the trip to Wasps through injury, Tom Varndell and Tusi Pisi.</p> <p>\u201cWinning the Super Rugby title was a fitting way to sign off with the Hurricanes and I am excited about testing myself in the top flight of England,\u201d says Woodward. \u201cI felt it was the right time to experience playing in a new environment and Bristol is the right fit for me, a great club with a big supporter base in a city that is passionate about rugby.\u201d</p> <p>Woodward\u2019s first match is likely to be at Bath in the West Country derby on 18 November.

Or, for that matter, in the hi-tech glass and chrome season ticket reservations centre in the Westfield shopping mall next to the Olympic Park where West Ham\u2019s new 57,000-seat stadium nestles. Their move to what we must now call London Stadium (at least until a much-delayed naming rights deal is announced) is a dream that is threatening to turn into a nightmare.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/13/west-ham-olympic-stadium-radio-system-met-police\">London Stadium owners working with Met police to oversee West Ham games</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is unlikely David Gold, the club\u2019s co-owner who has sworn until he is claret and blue in the face that the move is not a prelude to cashing out, enjoyed his 80th birthday much. Not only did he see West Ham, so fluid and thrilling last season in those intense night matches when they bid farewell to Upton Park, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/west-ham-united-watford-premier-league-match-report\">throw away a 2-0 lead against Watford</a> but the issues that had been bubbling away with the stadium move burst into the open.</p> <p>As a minority of West Ham fans fought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/west-ham-watford-london-stadium-supporters-violence\">with each other and Watford supporters</a>, leading to 20 being banned on Friday, others shook their heads at what they saw around them. Nor would the soundtrack have been exactly that Gold dreamed of when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/14/west-ham-deal-century-olympic-stadium\">the protracted, controversial battle for the \u00a3701m Olympic Stadium</a> was finally won following a succession of legal tussles and political bungles.</p> <p>\u201cStand up if you love West Ham,\u201d chanted some fans; \u201cWhere were you at Upton Park?\u201d sang others, as frustration with a dream seemingly turning sour before their eyes became ugly.</p> <p>Some current and former stewards, with decades of experience at Upton Park between them, and who spoken to the <em>Observer</em> last week, have variously described the situation as a scandal and an accident waiting to happen.</p> <p>The clashes between West Ham fans have been styled by some as a showdown between new football and old football, the prawn sandwich brigade pitched against those who favour a pie, a pint and some industrial-strength language. That is a grave oversimplification. Many of those most troubled by the move were longstanding season ticket holders at Upton Park.</p> <p>Similarly, others have tried to boil a complex situation down to a face-off between those who want to stand and those who do not. But the safe standing issue is a separate debate, albeit one whose time appears to be coming amid positive noises from the new FA chairman, Greg Clarke. Had the so-called \u201cmigration\u201d been better handled, the issue of persistent standing would not have turned into quite such an early flashpoint.</p> <p>For all that, there is an undeniable feeling that, if the situation is not resolved by the time West Ham play Southampton next Saturday, the entire rationale for the move is in danger of being undermined. Things like the new club crest incorporating the word London, the decision to swap <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/26/farewell-west-hams-old-ground-and-a-piece-of-my-family-history\">Ken\u2019s Cafe</a> and market stalls for upmarket eateries and a huge new megastore sometimes feel like a stark experiment on a grand scale.</p> <p>To some, it seemed West Ham were too eager to cast off the past, that the stage-managed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/10/goodbye-bash-upton-park-west-ham-united-manchester-united\">farewell to the Boleyn Ground</a> was an attempt to draw a definitive line under the east London club as it was. Such arguments would have likely remained a low-key undertow to the move had things gone better. As it is, they will fester and grow if the situation is not addressed.</p> <p>Since the Watford game, meetings have taken place <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/12/west-ham-united-fans-want-action-london-stadium-segregation-problems-police-presence\">between the club and the stadium operators, LS185</a>, set up by Vinci, which has a 25-year contract to run the stadium. \u201cThere is a lot of testosterone flying about, it\u2019s an awful relationship,\u201d said one well-placed source. All sides are insistent that money is not an issue when it comes to fan safety and it would do them a disservice to suggest otherwise. But it cannot be denied that the fractious relationship between the stadium operators (and the London Legacy Development Corporation/Newham \u201cspecial purpose vehicle\u201d that sits above them) has contributed to the current situation.</p> <p>Tensions that built throughout negotiations over the tenancy agreement, which resulted in West Ham paying \u00a32.5m a year for the stadium, have led to a far from straightforward working relationship. West Ham seem aggrieved that they were not consulted more fully about how their new home would be run. One of the more surprising lines of defence from the stadium owners was that many other sporting events have been held at the stadium \u2013 as though a one-off motor racing exhibition or a Rugby World Cup match is in any way analogous to the prospect of West Ham facing Tottenham or Chelsea.</p> <p>Under the deal LS185 is responsible for all matchday costs, including stewarding and policing. With Brady having struck a characteristically hard bargain, there is an underlying irritation at being blamed for the latest problems.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/17/west-bromwich-albion-west-ham-premier-league-match-report\">Nacer Chadli\u2019s double helps West Brom romp to 4-2 win over West Ham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is plenty of blame to go around. While the club and the stadium owners have tried to play the situation down, the most troubling views have come from the 140 Upton Park stewards who made the move with the club. Already, 40 are said to have quit. Their tale is a sorry one. They claim that they have not been listened to and that while at Upton Park stewards were stationed in the same place and built up a rapport with fans, learning to quell trouble before it started; at the London Stadium they have been shunted around to different spots.</p> <p>Anecdotal evidence tells of home and away fans mixing freely on their way into the stadium, of minimal searches taking place, of the automatic turnstiles not distinguishing between adult and concession tickets, of fans buying cut-price season tickets to sell on, of fans sitting in seats that are not their own. Somewhere along the way the migration of season ticket holders from Upton Park, and the addition of up to 20,000 more into the mix, has been mishandled.</p> <p>So those in the self-styled \u201cchav corner\u201d \u2013 a rowdy bunch at the intersection of the Trevor Brooking and West Stands at Upton Park \u2013 were told they would be relocated to a similarly atmospheric part of the new ground only to find they have effectively been told to sit down and shut up.</p> <p>Conversely, those who wanted a family-friendly environment were told that the entire upper tier was designed to be welcoming to them.</p> <p>One of the biggest mysteries of the game of blame and counter\u2013blame played out over the past week is the case of the incredible reappearing family section. Under Premier League rules, clubs are required to have an official family section. West Ham say that two blocks in the Bobby Moore Upper that house season ticket holders moved from the family area in Upton Park fulfil that criteria.</p> <p>But many fans who have contacted <em>the Observer</em> say they specifically asked if there was a family section and were told there was not.</p> <p>West Ham are trying to move on to the front foot and have insisted on a police presence within the ground. They will hold a meeting with fans after the Southampton match, have moved more than 250 dissatisfied with their new seats and are insistent that the issues will come to be seen as teething problems as the season progresses.</p> <p>The danger for the West Ham board and for Brady personally, is that a painful few weeks will set the tone for the entire season. That part of a fanbase who had largely been convinced of the need to move to the new stadium as part of a vision to turn West Ham into one of London\u2019s biggest clubs is already wondering whether they have been mis-sold.</p> <p>On his Twitter feed Gold has swung between defiance \u2013 \u201cIt is a different stadium and we love our new home. It takes time to adjust\u201d \u2013 and railing against those who criticise. One fan who accused him of selling the club\u2019s soul was told that they had just moved into a \u201cnew iconic stadium\u201d and to \u201cpull yourself together\u201d and go for a \u201clie down\u201d.</p> <p>For the owners and for Brady, this has become personal. If they are to rescue the bold move on which they have staked their reputations and the future of the club, they will have to move fast.</p>",

Now some of its tenants claim it is \u201ceroding national heritage\u201d by pricing out local people in favour of tourists.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/teenage-farmer-national-trust-lake-district-land-george-purcell-thorneythwaite\">Teenage farmer attacks National Trust over Lake District land purchase</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s been an increase in National Trust tenanted properties being turned into holiday lets. It is of great concern because every home that is turned into holiday accommodation is one less home for a local person in a rural community,\u201d said Joanna Leighton, co-chair of the Tenants\u2019 Association of the National Trust (Tant), which represents about 10,000 tenants.</p> <p>\u201cIn many cases local people find its properties unaffordable, meaning they are only a viable option for wealthier tenants, who use them as second homes. This risks reducing our rural communities to ghost towns for many months of the year, eroding our national heritage.</p> <p>\u201cLosing good tenants damages communities irrevocably and takes away the very fabric of village and country life, the particular thing folk coming to National Trust estates expect to see. Ghosts may have appeal in old castles but ghost villages are bare, cold and lifeless.\u201d</p> <p>Robin Kisby, a former RSPB officer, and his wife Nicola have lived in Cotehele, near Saltash in Cornwall, as National Trust tenants for 14 years. \u201cThis has been our home for so long we can identify most of the birds here individually,\u201d Kisby said. \u201cWhere on earth would we go?\u201d</p> <p>In July 2015, the charity served the Kisbys with a Section 21 notice, sometimes known as a no-fault eviction, which they have been fighting ever since.</p> <p>Robin Kisby believes the eviction is linked to his complaints that repair work had not been done \u2013 he says that, for several years, the farmyard has flooded with water contaminated by manure \u2013 and their reluctance to accept a rent rise.</p> <p>\u201cI am sure it wants this property back to refurbish it to a high standard and let it at a vastly higher rent, or as a holiday home,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of our problem is that it recently secured a massive rent on a similar luxuriously renovated farmhouse property less than a mile away.\u201d</p> <p>That property, the Malt House, was the home of a National Trust employee for 20 years, but he moved out during the same period that it was asking for rent increases. His former home, a 19th-century three-bedroom cottage with its own battlements, is now let to holidaymakers for about \u00a31,200 a week following extensive renovations.</p> <p>When asked about the Malt House, the National Trust said that it had been reserved for a staff member who had to live on the Cotehele estate for security reasons. It had decided that this was no longer necessary, and the property was not suitable for a domestic let.</p> <p>The problem, according to another Cotehele tenant, Kate Maciver-Redwood, is that the National Trust has failed to maintain its properties properly, which causes ill-feeling among the tenants. Her family runs Haye Farm, and she says it has taken three years for the local surveyor, who is responsible for maintaining the rented cottages, to arrange repairs. The Maciver-Redwoods have to pay half the cost, but have no control over the work.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been seven-and-a-half years since the windows were painted and if they\u2019d been properly maintained they wouldn\u2019t need to be replaced,\u201d she said. \u201cNow they\u2019re almost falling out.\u201d</p> <p>She said they had spent \u201ctens of thousands of pounds\u201d installing a new kitchen and repairing the floor after regular flooding. When they first moved into Haye Farm, the farmhouse was full of chickens because the door had been left open.\u201cThey put our rent up 30% two years ago. I said \u2018If this helps you crack on, then we\u2019ll go ahead with it.\u2019 How stupid and naive were we?\u201d</p> <p>Tenants in Cornwall are not the only ones who are unhappy. Last year, the villagers of Low Newton-by-the-Sea in Northumberland complained when the National Trust refused to re-let a seaside cottage when it became vacant and instead turned it into a holiday let.</p> <p>The village of Blickling in Norfolk has five holiday lets out of 17 National Trust properties. The population declined from 136 to 113 between 2001 and 2011, according to the latest census.</p> <p>According to the charity\u2019s housing policy, its aims include helping to meet \u201cidentified social housing needs where we are a significant housing provider\u201d, and it also talks of selecting tenants with skills to help with its work and favouring people who make a contribution to the community.</p> <p>Yet that policy does not seem to be being followed, said Robin Kisby: \u201cIt talks about \u2018tenant custodians\u2019, but really it seems to be about making money.\u201d</p> <p>The National Trust made \u00a344m from tenants last year, a rise of 39% since the 2008 global financial crisis, while wages have remained broadly static. It makes another \u00a310m from holiday cottages, and has added about 100 to its portfolio in the past 10 years. In 2006, it was advertising its \u201cunique collection of over 320 properties\u201d; now it is offering 418.</p> <p>A National Trust spokeswoman said: \u201cWe don\u2019t have a policy of turning domestic rentals into holiday cottages. The number of holiday cottages has increased very modestly over recent years, by around five a year. That\u2019s a rise of 0.3% as a proportion of our overall rented housing stock.\u201d</p> <p>And holiday cottages were not always created from tenanted properties \u2013 sometimes they came from other farm buildings or operational buildings that were not residential. She said that two holiday lets in Yorkshire had recently been transformed into permanent rentals, and that in 2015, 64% of tenants who responded were \u201csatisfied with us as landlords\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe take our responsibilities for houses we rent out very seriously, which is why we are spending more than \u00a325m this year on annual maintenance and refurbishment. We\u2019ve never invested more than we do now.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>An amateur archaeologist has tracked down hundreds of prehistoric rock engravings in Scotland in what has been described as a \u201cphenomenal\u201d contribution to the understanding of Britain\u2019s earliest artworks.</p> <p>Walking in all weathers once or twice a week, George Currie, 66, a musician by trade, has located more than 670 Neolithic and Bronze Age carvings over the past 15 years. He told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cIt was ridiculous \u2026 I got tired of recording the stuff. I\u2019ve never come across quite so much.\u201d</p> <p>There are many more to be found, he believes. Describing the thrill of uncovering ancient artworks that no one has seen for thousands of years, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s quite a privilege.\u201d</p> <p>Currie\u2019s discoveries will be included in the biggest research project into British prehistoric rock art, a five-year, \u00a31m study starting next year. The project will be hosted by Historic Environment Scotland (HES) under the leadership of Dr Tertia Barnett, an honorary fellow of the University of Edinburgh. Rock art is \u201crelatively undervalued and little known\u201d, she said. \u201cThis project is very exciting.\u201d</p> <p>More than 6,000 prehistoric carved rocks are recorded across Britain, of which some 2,500 are in Scotland. Most have patterns based on cup marks \u2013 circular depressions in the surface, often surrounded by concentric rings, with lines or grooves that extend from them \u2013 and are thought to date from 4000 to 2000BC.</p> <p>Their original purpose and significance remain a mystery. Among other theories, academics have speculated that they may be territorial markers, fertility symbols, astronomical signs, or simply prehistoric doodles.</p> <p>The designs and symbols appear to have been shared across Europe, Barnett said. \u201cThe cup-and-ring symbol, almost a universal symbol, is found in almost every country \u2013 France, northern Spain, Switzerland, northern Italy, Sardinia, Scandinavia. It seems that we were all in contact in pre-EU days, which is a nice thought.\u201d She praises Currie\u2019s solo efforts as a contribution \u201cto scholarship, protection and conservation\u201d.</p> <p>A semi-retired musician and teacher of guitar, bass and musical theory, Currie used to play with a band, Darts, that had chart success in the 1970s. He lives in Dundee, where he taught in a local college. \u201cThe course stopped. I didn\u2019t fully retire, [but] it did give me more time to pursue this.\u201d</p> <p>Although archaeology was a long-held interest, his devotion to rock art began after he uncovered an unrecorded example two metres from a known site: \u201cI suddenly realised that all these things hadn\u2019t been recorded and hadn\u2019t been discovered \u2026 I made a determined effort to find some more.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8acdf1ae54f2fc2aca007657679f6c7f701abe20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8acdf1ae54f2fc2aca007657679f6c7f701abe20/193_706_1045_1044/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Currie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Currie was formerly lead guitarist in 1970s band Darts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: george currie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He travels regularly to Perthshire, which is particularly fertile terrain. He uses a camera, a compass and GPS to pinpoint sites on \u201cwild, empty moorland, with nothing distinguishable for hundreds of metres\u201d.</p> <p>Bad weather is no deterrent, he said. \u201cIn many respects, winter is the best time because the sun is lower in the sky and the light produces more shadows. That makes it easier to see rock art. It\u2019s possible to look at a surface at midday in summer and you won\u2019t see anything. You look at the same surface at 10am on a winter\u2019s morning and, all of a sudden, you\u2019re seeing something that\u2019s entirely different.\u201d</p> <p>Some art is concealed by grass or moss, as with his most recent finds this summer. Most are out in the open, he said.</p> <p>\u201cCaves are few and far between, even in the Scottish hills. It\u2019s always a bit of a puzzle why one [rock] should be chosen over another.</p> <p>\u201cYou might imagine that a smooth surface would be ideal to make an engraving, but very often it\u2019s rough surfaces&#xa0;\u2026 Sometimes the markings actually use the contours, cracks and fissures as part of the ornamentation. It\u2019s almost as if the engraver is working with the material and that\u2019s really influencing their decisions.\u201d</p> <p>The HES research project, with funding from the Arts and Humanities Research Council, will include Edinburgh University, Glasgow School of Art and Kilmartin Museum in Argyll, an area with particularly elaborate rock art.</p> <p>Barnett said: \u201cThis is a really exciting opportunity to revisit rock art that we already know about and potentially to discover new sites and new understandings.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Member states are already competing among themselves to have British-based EU agencies and research centres relocated to their countries following the Brexit vote, a former president of the European commission has disclosed.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/mar/24/eu.politics1\" title=\"\">Romano Prodi</a>, who led the commission between 1999 and 2004, told the <em>Observer</em> that EU negotiators were being put under pressure to make decisions on transferring key centres, which are both major employers and hubs of expertise. He revealed details of the behind-the-scenes manoeuvres as the leaders of two major organisations voiced their fears over the future.</p> <p>The European medicines agency\u2019s executive director, Guido Rasi, has written to former health minister Norman Lamb about his \u201cconcerns\u201d over the \u201crepercussions of so-called Brexit on science and medical research\u201d. He added that his agency\u2019s future \u2013 and that of his 890 employees \u2013 was in the balance and depended \u201con the future relationship between the UK and the EU\u201d.</p> <p>Professor Ian Chapman, the newly appointed chief executive of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/24/nuclear-fusion-needs-a-wright-brothers-moment-says-firm-closing-on-the-target\" title=\"\">UK nuclear fusion programme</a> at the Culham centre in Oxfordshire, which hosts the EU\u2019s flagship research project called the Joint European Torus \u2013 the largest magnetic fusion experiment in the world \u2013 said that, while the commission had been \u201cpositive\u201d in talks about the medium term, there was a lack of clarity over the future. \u201cWe are worried about what Brexit means,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cWe just have to get on and continue to do business until the UK government gives any clarity about what their position is and what is actually happening. We are awaiting that.\u201d</p> <p>Prodi, a two-time Italian prime minister, said that he knew the commission negotiators, led by former French government minister Michel Barnier, \u201cvery well\u201d and that he was aware that the lobbying to steal away the agencies from British shores had begun.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody fights now to have the headquarters of the agencies that are now in the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are a negotiator you have people pushing you. The governments, Italian, French. The cities are pushing you, saying: \u2018my city is the best for pharmaceuticals in the world\u2019. Britain is leaving a big heritage.\u201d</p> <p>Lamb, a minister until last year, said that the development would be a \u201chammer blow\u201d for British jobs and research. \u201cWhile the divided Tory government struggles to find a workable plan for Brexit, other European countries are already fighting over the spoils,\u201d he said. \u201cBritain\u2019s thriving pharmaceutical industry would be dealt a hammer blow through the loss of the European medicines agency, which is crucial for attracting foreign investment. Theresa May must clarify how she will secure vital economic interests and give the British people a say over the final Brexit deal.\u201d</p> <p>Prodi said he believed the European commission would be tough on the UK in its negotiations, but called for May to trigger article 50 as soon as possible. \u201cThe situation is very clear. Brexit is Brexit, as your prime minister has told us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it is both in the British interest and even more in the European interest to clarify the situation soon. The uncertainty is the biggest danger to Europe, to Britain and to all of us.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happens to the research groups, to the students? There is a question mark. And it is not in the interest of the UK to have a question mark.</p> <p>\u201cThey [the commission negotiators] understand that the institution to which they belong will be totally destroyed with uncertainty. From the commission point of view, they are obliged to be less generous, to be not generous.\u201d</p> <p>Prodi, a former professor of economics, said he believed that trade between Britain and the EU member states would not be greatly affected by the Brexit vote, but he warned of a hit to foreign direct investment in the UK. \u201cWhen it comes to the new headquarters of non-European countries \u2013 Chinese companies for their European branch, for example \u2013 a decreasing number of them will choose Britain,\u201d he said. \u201cIn industry or manufacturing, the new decision will in some way have less preference for the UK.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a question mark over the City. My opinion is that the City will lose a small part of it, but that it is powerful because of its skills, not because it belongs to the market. So I don\u2019t think there will be an earthquake in the City. You could lose some headquarters. They could go to Amsterdam or something of this type. But London will maintain the skills, and that\u2019s more important in financial services.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley once promised to finish off JD Sports, but now finds himself being trounced by his rival.</p> <p>JD Sports, the self-styled King of Trainers, is not only valued at a cool \u00a31.1bn more than the Newcastle United owner\u2019s chain, but last week revealed its sales and profits growth were a well-shod leap ahead of the rest of the UK fashion market.</p> <p>While other clothing retailers have spent the last two years moaning about unsuitable weather and claiming that shoppers are more interested in holidays and gadgets than the latest fashion, JD has powered on. Sales at stores open more than a year rose 10% in the six months to the end of July.</p> <p>Even executive chairman Peter Cowgill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/13/jd-sports-66-percent-profits\" title=\"\">sounded surprised by the group\u2019s 66% rise in underlying profits</a>, revealed on Tuesday, saying they \u201cexceeded reasonable expectations.\u201d</p> <p>But the performance should not be a shock. The sportswear market is generally less weather-dependent than the rest of the clothing market and JD is at the centre of the catwalk-led \u201cathleisure\u201d trend for sportswear as fashion.</p> <p>Major brands such as Nike and Adidas have been expanding their ranges to include the kind of sportswear <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/12/growing-trend-for-athleisure-fashion-sees-lululemons-fortunes-rise\" title=\"\">meant to be worn outside the gym</a>. Celebrities such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/apr/12/beyonce-ivy-park-sportswear-sexy-fitness-bodycon-fashion-gym-friendly\" title=\"\">Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 whose athleisure line, Ivy Park</a>, is sold in JD \u2013 have given a boost to the trend, which is drawing more women into sport stores.</p> <p>Sales in JD\u2019s womenswear are soaring, having traditionally made up less than 30% of the chain\u2019s sales compared with 60% for the whole UK clothing market.</p> <p>Of course trends come and go, so there is some debate whether JD\u2019s mini-boom will drop off once young people move on to something new. Cowgill argues: \u201cWe can never predict the future but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a trend. I think it\u2019s a culture, a lifestyle situation. Not long ago you couldn\u2019t go into a bar with trainers on: now it is more acceptable.\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019s not only bars.

This market is highly branded, whereas mainstream fashion is very own-label. People want the credibility of a brand and JD has built a business on that.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, Sports Direct has also benefited from that trend, but to a lesser extent, as JD has a much stronger relationships with the key brands. This gives it access to more exclusive products, and launches of sought-after new designs.</p> <p>Cowgill says fostering those relationships through investment in the look and ambience of stores has been key to keeping such brands on board.</p> <p>Kate Calvert, an analyst at JD\u2019s house broker Investec, says: \u201cSports Direct has had quite a turbulent time with the two major suppliers, Nike and Adidas \u2013 they\u2019re always falling in and out of love with each other.\u201d In that environment, JD has been able to get access to premium products at premium prices, insulating it from some of the wider market deflation.</p> <p>Sports Direct has cottoned on to this and is trying to woo the brands back with investment in stores, alongside efforts to tackle the employment and governance practices that have drawn so much bad publicity. Fiona Paton, an analyst at Verdict Retail, says: \u201c[JD] has benefited from Sports Direct\u2019s mass of bad publicity and the distractions that has caused its senior management.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, this will not go on indefinitely, and Sports Direct has announced plans to target more premium brands with investment in its Flannels fascia, so JD Sports is likely to face tougher competition in the near future.\u201d</p> <p>Cowgill counters: \u201cAll our competitors worry us. We\u2019ve got to keep an eye on various parts of the market.\u201d He adds with a smile about Sports Direct: \u201cIt remains to be seen if they get their act together. We try to avoid being in direct competition. We see the market as huge enough for the two of us.\u201d</p> <p>That market increasingly includes Europe, where JD is expanding its main chain in France, Spain, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark and, most recently, Portugal. It also owns Sprinter in Spain, Chausport in France and has taken its trendy Size? footwear chain into five countries over the channel. Further afield, it has bought outlets in Malaysia and Australia. Revenues are up 38% in Europe and 14% elsewhere, although the profitability of these operations is not yet clear.</p> <p>Last week, Cowgill was in a bullish mood. \u201cWe never rest on our laurels and we are gutted if there\u2019s even a day when our numbers are negative. We drive as hard as we possibly can.\u201d It could be a speech from a professional sportsman.</p>",
  "<p>Red velvet curtains hung on the windows and painted cherubs played on the ceiling as Jim Ratcliffe accepted the 2016 ICIS Kavaler Award at the Metropolitan Club in New York last week.</p> <p>The British billionaire is the first foreigner to be awarded the honour, given by leaders in the chemical industry. It comes as Ineos, the chemicals company he founded, plans to bring fracking \u2013 the controversial oil and gas extraction process \u2013 back to the UK.</p> <p>Ineos is planning as many as 30 applications for fracking sites in the UK within the next year. As part of its campaign to win over critics, Ineos invited journalists to tour fracking sites in Pennsylvania operated by Consol, a Pittsburgh-based producer of natural gas and coal and, supposedly, an example of why fracking will be good for the UK.</p> <p>What\u2019s in store for the UK can be seen about an hour southwest of Pittsburgh, in township of Switzerland, Ohio, where a rig stands near a farm. The well is in its earliest stages: drilling goes on 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Sitting in a big armchair surrounded by screens, \u201cT-Ball\u201d, a burly 6ft drill operator, works 12-hour shifts, controlling the drilling like a video game. He does this for two-week stints. At night, another person takes over \u2013 also working a 12-hour shift.</p> <p>Ineos estimates that it will be at least five years before any of its UK wells are actually producing shale gas.</p> <p>Fracking will be good for Britain, according to Ineos, making it more independent and creating jobs. By 2018-19, about 69% of UK gas will be imported.</p> <p>Fracking, Ineos says, would help the UK become less dependent on other nations and would supplement dwindling North Sea resources. A 2014 Ernst &amp; Young report predicts that fracking could create more than 64,000 jobs.</p> <p>It has certainly been a boon to the US jobs market \u2013 albeit one with a sting in its tail. A National Bureau of Economic Research study published last year found that, between 2005 and 2012, the fracking boom added as many as <a href=\"http://www.dartmouth.edu/~mansur/papers/feyrer_mansur_sacerdote_frackingjobs.html\">640,000 jobs</a> in the US in the energy industry and related services. But boom turned to bust as oversupply led to tumbling oil prices, stalled production and layoffs. Since 2014, the US energy and mining sectors have shed more than 223,000 jobs.</p> <p>Despite the appeal of energy independence and possibility of thousands of new jobs, many UK residents remain opposed to fracking due to concerns over environmental damage, climate change and the possibility of tremors.</p> <p>In the process of fracking, water, sand and chemicals are forced into the ground under high pressure to extract natural gas. Earth tremors have been linked to disposal wells \u2013 where excess water from drilling is injected back into ground \u2013 created during the process.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fc14210fdfac7f47f326023c193bfa1b0d93664\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fc14210fdfac7f47f326023c193bfa1b0d93664/0_151_5632_3379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Ratcliffe of Ineos.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jim Ratcliffe of Ineos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There has been no fracking in the UK since 2011, when Cuadrilla Resources\u2019 operations were said to be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/02/fracking-cause-lancashire-quakes\">\u201chighly probable\u201d cause</a> of two earth tremors in northwest England. The moratorium on fracking was lifted in May 2013, but no fracking well proposals were actually approved until earlier this year, when North Yorkshire county council gave the go-ahead to an application by Third Energy.</p> <p>\u201cDrilling does not cause earthquakes,\u201d said Tim Dugan, chief operating officer of Consol. According to Dugan, seismic testing has improved over the years and data shows faultlines that could potentially cause tremors, allowing drillers to avoid them.</p> <p>But the consequences of unfettered fracking are clear in the US. A study by the US Geological Survey showed that increased fluid pressure in geological fault zones from disposal wells has increased earthquake vulnerability in a some states. As a result, parts of Oklahoma and Kansas now face earthquake risks on a par with California.</p> <p>Ineos insists that fracking in the UK will be different. For one, the technology has come a long way over the past decade. As the US fracking industry has matured, lessons were learned, making it easier to replicate best practices on fracking sites in the UK.</p> <p>To ease the inconvenience of light, noise and traffic during drilling, Ineos has also pledged 6% of its profits to the UK communities where it will frack.</p> <p>But fracking in the UK still faces stiff opposition from communities where drilling is planned, and from environmental campaigners.</p> <p>There is no way fracking can be done responsibly, \u201cno matter what regulations are proposed\u201d, according to John Detwiler of <a href=\"http://marcellusprotest.org/\">the Marcellus Protest</a> coalition, an environmental pressure group in Pennsylvania. He said many company-sponsored fact-finding trips to Pennsylvania were \u201cmerely window-dressing for decisions being made in back rooms\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNaturally, the drillers, and the government officials whose election campaigns they\u2019ve sponsored, can be expected to put on a good show for invited visitors, but the truth is that fracking has not been a success in Pennsylvania,\u201d he said.</p>",

All told, they overwhelmed the visitors. <br></p> <p>So after threatening for so long this season, Adelaide\u2019s campaign is over at least a week earlier than what they would have considered satisfactory. For the victors, they return to the biggest venue of them all for a Friday night preliminary final against Geelong. </p> <p>And with that, I bid you farewell.

  "<p>Barack Obama is expected to make a final decision next month on possible cuts to the US nuclear arsenal, in an attempt to consolidate his legacy as a disarmer before leaving office.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/west-failing-deliver-nuclear-deal-promises-iran-vice-president-ali-akbar-salehi\">West failing to deliver nuclear-deal promises, says Iran vice president</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Options on the table include reducing the number of deployed strategic warheads, slimming down the reserve stockpile, cutting military stores of fissile material available for making new warheads, and putting off some modernisation plans, including the a controversial air force programme for developing an air-launched cruise missile. </p> <p>The president is due to consult his principal national security officials in October on which, if any, of the options are still feasible in the time left before he leaves office.</p> <p>Some more radical options, like changing the US nuclear posture to rule out first use of nuclear arms in a conflict and taking some of the nation\u2019s intercontinental ballistic missiles off hair-trigger alert, have faced such strong opposition from allies abroad and the Pentagon that they are no longer being seriously considered. </p> <p>\u201cWe have paid a lot of attention throughout the administration,\u201d an administration official said, pointing to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2015/feb/05/in-the-us-russian-relationship-something-nuclear-that-works\">New Start Treaty</a> with Russia in 2010, changes to US nuclear posture the same year that ruled out strikes on non-nuclear states, work on improving the security of nuclear stockpiles around the world, and last year\u2019s agreement limiting the scope of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/west-failing-deliver-nuclear-deal-promises-iran-vice-president-ali-akbar-salehi\">Iran\u2019s nuclear programme</a>. </p> <p>Unable to persuade the Senate to reconsider ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the White House has backed a United Nations security council resolution, due to be passed on Thursday, that reaffirms member states\u2019 commitment not to conduct explosive nuclear testing. The administration official said there might be more steps to come before Obama leaves office in January.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a whole lot of other steps the administration is looking at, and right now it is an open book as to what will be decided,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Nuclear disarmament was one of the signature ambitions of Obama\u2019s first months in office. In a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-barack-obama-prague-delivered\">speech in Prague in April 2009</a>, he pledged US commitment \u201cto seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons\u201d. However, he approaches the end of his eight years in office having made <a href=\"https://fas.org/blogs/security/2016/05/hiroshima-stockpile/\">fewer reductions</a> to the US arsenal than any president since the end of the cold war.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He has good a record on the nuclear issue but it probably falls short of his own hopes for progress</p> <footer> <cite>Robert Einhorn, former state adviser</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Furthermore, part of the price of persuading the Senate to accept the New Start Treaty was agreeing to a modernisation programme of air, land and sea delivery systems, as well as warheads, that is expected to bring the cost of the US deterrent to $1tn over 30 years. </p> <p>Robert Einhorn, the state department\u2019s special adviser on non-proliferation and disarmament from 2009-13, argues that Obama did the best he could in difficult circumstances. </p> <p>\u201cHe has good a record on the nuclear issue but it probably falls short of his own hopes for progress,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/experts/robert-einhorn/\">Einhorn</a>, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cHe was operating in an environment that was not at all conducive. Unfortunately the whole Prague agenda has become so politicised there is little room for manoeuvre and you have an international climate that is not terribly conducive.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe US has been prepared to reduce our deployed stockpile a third below New Start. Russia has said it has zero interest.\u201d</p> <p>Disarmament advocates like <a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/about/dkimball\">Daryl Kimball</a>, executive director of the Arms Control Association, say unfavourable circumstances at home and abroad are only a partial excuse. </p> <p>\u201cObama has missed multiple opportunities to realise lasting change in nuclear weapons policy,\u201d Kimball said. \u201cHe has adjusted but not transformed the issue. Part of that is a failure of leadership and imagination. He now has a disappointing legacy.\u201d</p> <p> However, Kimball said it was not too late to improve that legacy, even in the last months of the Obama presidency.</p> <p>The most far-reaching option still under active consideration is a one-third cut to the US deployed strategic arsenal, from the 1,550 warheads agreed with Moscow in the New Start Treaty to just over 1,000. Obama offered to make the reduction in a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/19/remarks-president-obama-brandenburg-gate-berlin-germany\">2013 speech in Berlin</a>, on condition Russia did the same. But Vladimir Putin has shown little interest in disarmament, instead emphasising his country\u2019s nuclear might.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What Obama could and should do now is act on our own determination on what it is that we need</p> <footer> <cite>Daryl Kimball, Arms Control Association</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Berlin offer was based on a US assessment that it could reduce its nuclear missile arsenal by a third and still \u201cmaintain a strong and credible strategic deterrent\u201d. On the basis of that assessment, disarmers inside and outside the administration have argued that Washington should make the cut unilaterally for cost-saving reasons and to make a more convincing argument to non-weapons states that the US is sticking to its side of the bargain in the Non-Proliferation Treaty. </p> <p>\u201cWhat Obama could and should do now is act on our own determination on what it is that we need, and that we\u2019re not going to tie our budget decisions and arsenal to Russia\u2019s decisions,\u201d Kimball said, pointing out that both presidents Bush made unilateral reductions to US nuclear force levels without being blocked by Congress. However, the current Obama proposal is strongly opposed by the Department of Defense, which is concerned it would send a message of weakness to Moscow. </p> <p>\u201cThere would have been a small chance of that before, but what happened in Crimea and the Donbass wiped that off the table,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/experts/steven-pifer/\">Steven Pifer</a>, a former senior state department official deeply involved in past relations with Moscow and arms control. </p> <p>More politically palatable options on the table are a reduction to the \u201chedge\u201d stockpile of <a href=\"https://fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces/\">more than 2,500 reserve</a> warheads and military stores of hundreds of tons of plutonium and highly enriched uranium (HEU) held for the production of future warheads. Both are widely considered being surplus to requirements.</p> <p>In a 2013 Nuclear Employment Strategy document, it was decided that the warheads held in reserve as a hedge against technical failures in deployed weapons could also serve as a hedge against geopolitical surprises, rather than having two separate reserves. However, the consequent cut to the stockpile has not yet been made.</p> <p>\u201cI think there\u2019s a chance they will announce a reduction of the hedge,\u201d said <a href=\"https://fas.org/expert/hans-kristensen/\">Hans Kristensen</a>, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists. \u201cBut they would in any case not cut the whole hedge, perhaps about 50% of it.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/sgs/faculty-staff/zia-mian/\">Zia Mian</a>, from the programme on science and global security at Princeton University, said fissile material stocks could also be cut. They are now believed to constitute 243 tons of HEU and 38 tons of plutonium.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf say, a typical US warhead has 25kg of HEU and 4kg of plutnium, then if the US were to reduce to 1,000 operational warheads (as Obama says they can) and say 1,000 reserve warheads, it would need only 50 tons of HEU and eight tons of plutonium for its nuclear arsenal and the rest could be declared excess,\u201d Mian said.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/sep/13/us-nuclear-bombers-fly-over-korean-peninsula-in-joint-exercises-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/52z8v\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2714283\"            data-video-name=\"US nuclear bombers fly over Korean peninsula in joint exercises \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d7b3a6e4b08465d45001da\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/13/160913SouthKoreaBombers1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/13/160913SouthKoreaBombers1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/13/160913SouthKoreaBombers1_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/sep/13/us-nuclear-bombers-fly-over-korean-peninsula-in-joint-exercises-video\">US nuclear bombers fly over Korean peninsula in joint exercises</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>A further option known to be under consideration would be delaying some of the ambitious nuclear modernisation programmes that are still in their very early stages. A planned air force fleet of nuclear-capable B-21 stealth bombers <a href=\"http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/blog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=2299\">is priced at $80bn</a>, while proposed nuclear long-range stand-off cruise missiles are estimated to cost $30bn. </p> <p>Critics have said it is unclear how such weapons <a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/USNuclearModernization\">will be funded</a> when the major expenditure is due in the 2020s, and that each makes the other redundant. The cruise missiles have been described as potentially destabilising because they can be launched without warning and are impossible to distinguish from their conventional counterparts. </p> <p>\u201cIf you now have the B-21 coming online able to penetrate enemy defences, why do you need a cruise missile, and if the B-21 is not going to penetrate, why is it being developed? The military is asking for things it may not need,\u201d Pifer said. </p> <p>\u201cI would like to see them cancel the cruise missile. It would be a useful change, but I just can\u2019t see them doing it in the last few months of the administration.\u201d </p> <p>Even staunch arms control advocates such as <a href=\"http://www.ploughshares.org/about-us/staff-board/joseph-cirincione\">Joseph Cirincione</a> of the Ploughshares Fund said the administration may have left it too late to make meaningful changes.</p> <p>\u201cThey took their eye off the ball,\u201d Cirincione said. \u201cIf last year they wanted to do some of these things, it would have been easier. Now it\u2019s not outside elements that are the only problem, but the politics during the presidential election. I would be surprised if they did anything controversial.\u201d </p>",

I didn\u2019t know much about Iceland,\u201d he concedes, but after a public interview he did with the novelist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ben-okri\">Ben Okri</a> this summer, he was handed a great stack of tomes and has been going through them. \u201cIt\u2019s an old book about the lores of Iceland, and its development on Danish-based Christianity, and the levels of slavery and indebtedness of small farmers in Iceland. I\u2019ve only got 100 pages in, so we\u2019re around the late 18th century.\u201d</p> <p>Politicians usually confect answers about their cultural input to suggest some untapped creativity, or a hip alter ego. Often the plan unravels. In 2006 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/sep/24/uk.arts\">Gordon Brown said he loved the Arctic Monkeys</a>, only to prove incapable of naming a single song. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/mar/18/popandrock.politicsandthearts\">David Cameron claimed the Jam\u2019s Eton Rifles was his favourite song</a>, only to have Paul Weller retort, \u201cWhich part of it didn\u2019t he get? It wasn\u2019t intended as a fucking jolly drinking song for the cadet corps.\u201d</p> <p>But, for better or worse, Corbyn isn\u2019t like other politicians. He might have said he was reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/elena-ferrante\">Elena Ferrante</a>\u2019s novels, to suggest he was in touch with his feminine side, or a book of world war two poetry to connect with older voters (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\">Theresa May</a> has an enormous 105-point lead in favourability among the UK\u2019s eldest voters). Instead, Corbyn just tells you what he\u2019s actually reading. If it sounds weird or boring or both, so be it. He couldn\u2019t be less calculated.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Communication is everything. Could we do things differently? Probably. It\u2019s something I want to develop</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Given the performative element to modern political leadership, this does, of course, present a potential liability. Asked if he would use nuclear weapons, Corbyn has said simply: \u201cNo.\u201d (He might have said: \u201cThe whole point is that if you have them you\u2019ll never use them, but I think the money would be better spent elsewhere.\u201d) Asked before the referendum how passionate he was about the EU on a scale of one to 10, he said, \u201cSeven, seven and a half.\u201d (He might have said: \u201cMy passion for staying in is a 10. But there are things we can and should improve.\u201d) The problem, his critics say, isn\u2019t just that he won\u2019t play the game; it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t even know the rules.</p> <p>For many of his supporters, this is part of the appeal. They are fed up with the game. For them, his ability to speak his mind unselfconsciously, to be guided by conviction rather than pollsters and spin doctors, gives him an air of authenticity they feel has been lost. Last month I watched Corbyn address a packed auditorium in Chelmsford. \u201cI love acting,\u201d he told the crowd, to laughter and applause. \u201cThat\u2019s why I go to the theatre, because I really enjoy drama. But when I\u2019m in parliament I want to see political representation on behalf of ordinary people, not drama.\u201d</p> <p>Over a cup of tea a few days later, I ask if he entirely rejects the notion that there are certain ways a leader has to perform. \u201cI don\u2019t reject it outright. I\u2019m trying to remould it, because communication is everything. If you can\u2019t communicate your views, you\u2019re not getting anywhere. Could we do things differently? Probably. It\u2019s something I want to develop.\u201d</p> <p>But he is confident when connecting with voters on a personal level. As we walk through his constituency, he chats to a kebab shop owner he knows by name. A few minutes later, he is confronted by a young man on the street.</p> <p>\u201cYo! Corbyn, man. Why you pull us out the EU?\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn stops. \u201cI didn\u2019t, actually. I wanted to stay in and reform it. I think there were some problems with it, but I wanted to stay in and fix them.\u201d</p> <p>A little further on, another man approaches. He\u2019s a musician and remembers a time when Corbyn advocated for his band. The area is gentrifying and space is tight; Corbyn helped negotiate with a local landlord to make a room available for them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71d1e1b38e6effc332ac2a0c05c7c893b08e959a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71d1e1b38e6effc332ac2a0c05c7c893b08e959a/0_84_1647_988/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Corbyn with Angela Eagle and Andy Burnham in the House of Commons in February\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Angela Eagle and Andy Burnham in the House of Commons in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pixel8000</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The public is something Corbyn clearly feels a part of, not a place he goes for votes and events. \u201cI\u2019m very keen on not spending all my time in Westminster,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are any number of meetings you can endlessly have, so I have quite a tough rule that, from Thursday onwards, I\u2019m around the country. And at least one full day a week, I\u2019m here in the constituency. I\u2019ve observed many Labour MPs and leaders over the years who, without really thinking about it, become cut off. You are offered all sorts of opportunities to be separate from the rest of the population, and it can all be very enticing and quite nice. But in reality, it can be very dangerous, because you can be completely removed from the people who put you there in the first place. It\u2019s not an easy balance.\u201d</p> <p>He has found the shift in pace and profile over the past year a challenge. \u201cYou suddenly realise you\u2019re under scrutiny the whole time. You find yourself being cautious about random conversations on the street, because you don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going.\u201d Pointing to Alvarez, he says: \u201cWe were in Fort William, having two days off, eating chips in a restaurant, and suddenly it appears in the Sunday Times.\u201d What was the story? \u201cThat I was having chips in a restaurant in Fort William!\u201d He laughs. \u201cAs though I was not somehow doing my job properly.\u201d</p> <p>But this is still the part of the job Corbyn does well, meeting supporters and constituents: he has an easy, unaffected manner that escapes many politicians. Of all the gaffes there have been and will, no doubt, continue to be, Corbyn seems unlikely to ensnare himself in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/28/gordon-brown-gillian-duffy-transcript\">Gillian Duffy \u201cbigoted woman\u201d</a> moment. He does retail politics well: one person, one conversation, one handshake. The bigger issue is whether he can do wholesale.</p> <p>***</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5950a1857e99e5c0fcbd7d4920a95a352ebfc497\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5950a1857e99e5c0fcbd7d4920a95a352ebfc497/188_348_3849_4410/873.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"873\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harry Borden/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clearly Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s appeal goes beyond Finsbury Park. Over the past couple of months, I have attended three leadership campaign meetings. This year\u2019s events have been bigger than the last. There were a thousand at the Hilton in Brighton, with a further 500 outside whom Corbyn addressed in the drizzle; a capacity crowd of around 500 in Chelmsford civic theatre, a town that has had a Tory MP since 1950; a similar number in the Caird Hall complex in Dundee, where Labour has been eclipsed by the SNP.</p> <p>Meetings aren\u2019t movements. Nor are they necessarily indicators of potential electoral success. But they are not nothing, either. Across the western world, membership of political parties, interest in politics in general and voter turnout in particular are in decline. So when a man rejected by almost all his parliamentary colleagues, leading a party that last year suffered its second election defeat in a row, is packing out venues across the country, it\u2019s noteworthy.</p> <p>These big meetings are where Corbyn draws much of his political energy. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty unprecedented,\u201d he tells me when we meet in London. \u201cIt\u2019s never happened in my lifetime and I\u2019ve been in the Labour party since I was 16. And they are not all Labour supporters. In Cornwall, we did a headcount and only half were, but they came \u2013 so there is an appeal.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The PLP don\u2019t want Corbyn to succeed. I was loyal through Brown and Blair. Why can\u2019t they be loyal through this?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These are campaign rallies only in the loosest sense of the word. From the stage, people are asked to join the phone bank; some come wearing Corbyn T-shirts. But in the rallies I went to, the Labour leader never once asked for anyone\u2019s vote. Of more than a dozen speakers, only one, in Dundee \u2013 who gave a laundry list as to why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/owen-smith\">Owen Smith</a> was unsuitable to lead a progressive movement \u2013 raised the subject of Corbyn\u2019s challenger. Nobody I interviewed in the audience mentioned Smith, either. It wasn\u2019t that they were studiously refusing to talk about him; he just wasn\u2019t on their radar.</p> <p>At least one speaker will point out, more in sorrow than in anger, that they had a meeting just like this last year to elect Corbyn; now they have to do it again. His supporters tell me how disappointed they are that the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) cannot accept the decision, and complain about the way the media has treated him. \u201cThe PLP don\u2019t want him to succeed,\u201d says Anne Pissaridou, a Labour member all her life and until recently a local councillor in Brighton; she lost her seat to the Tories by a couple of hundred votes last year. \u201cI stuck it out through Brown and Blair, and was loyal. I don\u2019t know why they can\u2019t be loyal through this.\u201d</p> <p>Each rally has its own flavour. In Brighton, where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/15/labour-suspends-brighton-branch-amid-accusations-of-improper-ballot\">the local party was suspended</a> in July over allegations of abusive behaviour and an improper ballot (those at the rally insist the only thing irregular about the ballot was that so many people turned up, they couldn\u2019t fit them all into the venue), they dwell on democracy; in Chelmsford, the audience cheer a demand for a better rural bus service; in Dundee, a speaker warns of the perils of nationalism north and south of the border.</p> <p>But while Corbyn\u2019s speech varies slightly, his role is always the same. He is introduced to a standing ovation. Dressed in slacks, tieless shirt and sandals I assumed were Clarks, but Alvarez tells me are from Mexico, Corbyn has the beard of a professor and the pate of a friar. Bookish and ascetic, aesthetically and stylistically he owes more to Labour\u2019s methodist wing than to its union origins.</p> <p>Oratory is not Corbyn\u2019s strong suit; he employs not a single metaphor. His voice rises and falls to its own logic, but its cadence seems to bear little relation to what he is saying. He often emphasises the word <em>is</em>, as though the verb <em>to be</em> is his point: \u201cHousing <em>is</em> the most important issue.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14b52105844cb0bfc7f1264f76c465ae612716e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14b52105844cb0bfc7f1264f76c465ae612716e9/0_135_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Corbyn supporters at a leadership rally in London in August\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters at a leadership rally in London in August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah Mckay</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By this stage in the campaign, he has spoken at more than 30 rallies, giving more or less the same speech. You\u2019d think he\u2019d have it down by now, but he fluffs his lines a few times every night. There are awkward moments where the crowd aren\u2019t sure if he\u2019s finished his point, or is about to move on, and will either clap in the wrong place or watch him end his point in silence. Still, when he finishes there is another standing ovation. People have not come to be entertained; they have come to be reassured that the language of public ownership, redistribution, of caring and support, has not been retired from the public sphere: to have a basic sense of decency reflected back to them through their politics.</p> <p>His supporters have been derided as \u201cCorbynistas\u201d, conjuring the image of pamphleteers and paper-sellers, ideologues and didacts \u2013 unbiddable devotees to Jude the Apostle, the patron saint of lost causes. But while there is a hard core of fanatics on social media, one struggles to find an archetypal \u201cCorbynista\u201d at any of these rallies. The people I spoke to were far more varied and less easy to caricature. There was the self-employed craftswoman who voted for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/andyburnham\">Andy Burnham</a> in the last leadership election; Pissaridou, who voted for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/yvette-cooper\">Yvette Cooper</a> (\u201cI was torn, but I regretted it. I think he has the policies we\u2019ve wanted for a long time\u201d); and Simon, the Dundee brewer who backed the SNP at the last general election. \u201cIf Corbyn had been leader, I would have voted Labour,\u201d he says. \u201cI still don\u2019t think Labour stands a chance in Scotland at the moment. But they could do eventually, with someone like him.\u201d Others in Dundee felt that the lure of the SNP would soon fade.</p> <p>Some, like James Ellis, a former Green member in Brighton, joined Labour after the general election in 2015. \u201cLabour was opening up,\u201d he says, \u201cand I needed to be in it, so I was really happy when Jeremy decided to stand.\u201d Others, like Bruce Whitehead, a former journalist and freelance musician from Edinburgh, joined Labour from the small hard left party <a href=\"http://leftunity.org/\">Left Unity</a>, the day after Corbyn won the leadership. (The day after I spoke to him, Whitehead received a message from the Labour party that he would be purged, citing social media insisting he is still a member of Left Unity; he is appealing.)</p> <p>Everyone has their own wishlist of what they want Corbyn to do with his mandate. \u201cI\u2019d like him to articulate a simple, concise vision that will attract people who aren\u2019t political nerds like me,\u201d Pissaridou says. \u201cHe needs to speak to those 52% of people who voted for Brexit,\u201d Ellis says. Emerging from Corbyn\u2019s rally in Dundee, Danny McDonald was disappointed that he hadn\u2019t given a clearer idea of how he\u2019d fund his policies.</p> <p>The rallies may be big, but ideologically they are tame. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders</a> was running for the Democratic nomination in the US, he railed against billionaires, bankers and corporations. Corbyn talks about renationalising the railways, building more houses and reaching out to people with mental health problems. There is no talk of neoliberal globalisation, quoting of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Antonio-Gramsci\">Gramsci</a>, or appeals for intersectional thinking. In Dundee, a band sang the Internationale and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwbzxemJZIc\">There Is Power In A Union</a>, and socialism was mentioned several times. That was as radical as it got. In Chelmsford, Anna Wallbank, a primary school teacher, told me: \u201cIf someone better came along, I\u2019d vote for them.\u201d</p> <p>***</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People said: \u2018You must make plans for when you win.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Don\u2019t talk about it.\u2019 I thought it was tempting fate</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When Jeremy Corbyn decided to stand as leader in summer 2015, he didn\u2019t think he would win. Indeed, the fear was that his defeat would reveal just how small the left in the party really was. Older leftwing candidates such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-mcdonnell\">John McDonnell</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/diane-abbott\">Diane Abbott</a> had already stood, while younger MPs were considered too inexperienced. He was an accidental candidate.</p> <p>\u201cEverything sort of took off,\u201d he says now. \u201cI was straight into hustings. Like, the next day. And that week I was on the road travelling. We didn\u2019t have a campaign. We didn\u2019t have an organisation. We didn\u2019t have any money. All we had was my credit card. That lasted about a week. Then we started raising money. We got a loan from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/unite\">Unite</a>. John McDonnell took over as chair of the campaign. Then we started appointing people and getting a campaign together. Time for reflection was very limited because from the moment I was nominated I was on a train.\u201d</p> <p>More unions came on board. The rallies got bigger. The polling numbers soared. What had been unthinkable became first possible, then likely and finally inevitable. But for all the energy and endorsements, one of the last people to realise Corbyn might win was Corbyn himself. \u201cI was still not convinced by the end of August. I would go into the office and they would say: \u2018Look, Jeremy, you have to make plans for when you win.\u2019 And I said, \u2018I\u2019m not even going there. Please don\u2019t talk about it.\u2019 I thought it was tempting fate.\u201d</p> <p>Anyone who thinks the year that followed has been about the failings and foibles of one man simply hasn\u2019t been paying attention. Corbyn emerged from a volatile and fractured political moment, both nationally and globally, a moment accentuated by the financial crisis. In Britain, scandals over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/phone-hacking\">phone hacking</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/mps-expenses\">MPs\u2019 expenses</a> and Operation Yewtree and its consequences have left many disaffected with both the political and media establishments. Meanwhile, there is a generation that has known only austerity and war, and has a future of debt and work insecurity to look forward to. Throughout the western world, mainstream parties on left and right have lost influence as they drift to the centre, leaving space at the margins for more populist challengers.</p> <p>\u201cI feel the world as stranger to me than I ever felt before,\u201d said the renowned academic, Stuart Hall in 2007. \u201cIt\u2019s when everyone is operating in so many of the same parameters that the only debate you can have is a sort of Swiftian debate - you know, shall we eat the children now or later?\u201d</p> <p>Few people foresaw Corbyn\u2019s victory. Nobody could have guessed that a range of disparate movements around war, feminism, education, inequality would converge on the Labour party. Nobody could have guessed that this would be the moment when New Labour would lose not only its ideological appeal, but plausible advocates to carry its project forward. Nobody could have guessed that one of the least charismatic, most diffident figures of the British left would emerge as the standard-bearer for a new kind of politics, at 66. His ascendancy did not prompt a crisis in the Labour party; it illustrated it.</p> <p>Since establishments do not, by definition, radicalise themselves, Corbyn needed a plan to make his leadership work. It soon became clear he didn\u2019t have one. And since insurrectionaries don\u2019t easily give up the power they have acquired, his opponents needed a plan to remove him. It has taken the best part of a year to become clear they didn\u2019t have one, either.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7be0333cb6bb954037da6724491ad9624790733\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7be0333cb6bb954037da6724491ad9624790733/0_10_2082_1456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn with David Cameron at the state opening of parliament in May 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"699\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With David Cameron at the state opening of parliament in May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a result, for the last year Corbyn has been a political pi\u00f1ata, whacked mercilessly from all sides. Mauled by the press, maligned by his own MPs, ridiculed by the government, he has lurched from crisis to crisis and challenge to challenge, with coup threats and mass resignations alongside accusations of bullying, antisemitism and sexism.</p> <p>Corbyn insists he will do everything in his power to ensure a climate of intimidation and exclusion does not dominate. \u201cI don\u2019t do abuse, I don\u2019t do bullying and I won\u2019t tolerate it from anyone associated with my teams, supporters or anyone else,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to say to everyone in the Labour party that this is a safe place to be. I don\u2019t accept any kind of abuse or intimidation, misogyny, homophobia, racism, antisemitism or Islamophobia, and we are taking action against it as a party.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Corbyn\u2019s team feel he is being held to a different standard, pointing to how little interest the press shows in exposing racism within Tory party ranks, for example.</p> <p>But the anticipated debacle prompted by Corbyn\u2019s leadership has yet to materialise. Labour has won all four of the byelections held since he was elected, upping its share of the vote in three and dipping by just 0.3% in the other. In mayoral elections, Labour has won Bristol and London, key cities it had previously lost; in local elections, it has outpolled the Tories and retained control of key bellwether towns such as Nuneaton and Stevenage. In a poll taken shortly before the EU referendum, Labour was even with the Tories.</p> <p>But the PLP\u2019s vote of no confidence and subsequent leadership challenge, just as the Tories dusted themselves off and elected a new prime minister, have had an impact. In the most recent YouGov poll, Labour are 14 points behind. A poll last month put the new prime minister\u2019s net favourability rating at +33.6 and Corbyn\u2019s at -30.7. Given the pollsters\u2019 failure to predict the last election, his own election and Brexit, Corbyn can be forgiven for not putting too much store by such figures. Nonetheless, he has a steep hill to climb.</p> <p>Not all of the parliamentary party was rooting for him to fail. Some members, while sceptical, were prepared to try to make it work. Many criticise not his policies but his leadership style. In a <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/08/labour-mp-any-other-job-jeremy-corbyn-would-have-faced-industrial-tribunal\">New Statesman article</a> last month, Newcastle MP Chi Onwurah claimed Corbyn had appointed her shadow minister for culture and the digital economy, then given half the job to Thangam Debbonaire, MP for Bristol West, without telling either of them \u2013 only to then give that portion back to Onwurah without telling Debbonaire. \u201cNo one knew what he wanted us to do,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf this had been any of my previous employers in the public and private sectors, Jeremy might well have found himself before an industrial tribunal.\u201d (Asked for comment, a Corbyn spokesperson responded: \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon to have discussions about the delineation of these roles, but at no point was anybody sacked or singled out.\u201d)</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/heidi-alexander\">Heidi Alexander</a>, former shadow minister for health, has written that she was \u201cexcited\u201d to be given that job and tried her best: \u201cA leader who had been willing to engage, support, take difficult decisions and able to build a team might have made it work. But we didn\u2019t have one, and in Jeremy Corbyn, as much as it pains me to say it, we never will.\u201d Alexander said she was repeatedly undermined by John McDonnell. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t good enough for the leader to routinely defer to his shadow chancellor when confronted with a difficult decision \u2013 a shadow chancellor who on three separate occasions undermined my efforts to agree collective positions on health matters.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Theresa May's education bill restricts access. Now she wants to repeal our human rights act. We have to be campaigning</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But when I raise Alexander\u2019s complaints, Corbyn seems genuinely baffled. \u201cI was particularly surprised at Heidi\u2019s saying that, because Heidi and I had many discussions over the handling of the junior doctors\u2019 dispute, for example, and general health policy,\u201d he says. But you get the sense that the criticism doesn\u2019t come completely from left field. \u201cDid I defer to John McDonnell? John McDonnell is pretty clear in his views and setting them forward. I have an approach that is probably more [one] of listening and less declamatory. She took that as not showing leadership. I try to summarise conversations at the end of them and move on from there. And I hope Heidi will recognise that it\u2019s a style she might be misreading.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the infighting, Corbyn believes he has managed to shift the national conversation. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate what\u2019s happened in the past year,\u201d he says. \u201cI was elected in a very surprising set of circumstances, and we challenged fundamentally the economic agenda. Now [our] anti-austerity agenda is almost the norm. Everybody says, well, now you have to invest in the economy rather than cut. There\u2019s been a fundamental change and we will continue in that direction.\u201d</p> <p>How does he plan to do that? \u201cWe\u2019ll reach out and try to be as precise and campaigning as we can in policy areas,\u201d he says. \u201cTake housing policy. Building council housing, providing starter mortgages and regulating the private rented sector: that is something that has a lot of resonance beyond Labour voters. I will also be emphasising the contradictions in Theresa May, who stands on the steps of Downing Street like St Francis of Assisi, and then produces a higher education bill that further restricts access. Now she is proposing a British bill of rights which will repeal our human rights act.\u201d</p> <p>It is an interesting paradox that pugnacious politics should come in the form of such an unassertive man. When it comes to delivering memorable zingers against the Tories, Corbyn just doesn\u2019t have it in him. The issue isn\u2019t that he doesn\u2019t think quickly on his feet: it\u2019s that, even if he did, he wouldn\u2019t \u2013 he just thinks it\u2019s unhelpful.</p> <p>Does he plan to do prime minister\u2019s questions any differently if he wins? \u201cI find the traditional way of doing it completely off-putting. On one level, it can be quite funny. But it\u2019s remote from everybody\u2019s lives.\u201d Does he think his idea of crowdsourcing questions works? \u201cIt gets a very bad press from the Westminster media corps. Quite a lot of the parliamentary Labour party don\u2019t like it. But people I meet around the country quite frankly do like it. They say, you\u2019ve actually changed it in a good way. It makes more sense to us. So I\u2019ll develop it and work on it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not a personally combative person,\u201d he adds. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have strong political views. I obviously do. But it\u2019s not my approach, which most people find frustrating. My supporters say, \u2018You should be tougher. You should sock it to \u2019em. Get heavy.\u2019 It\u2019s not my style. I have a point of view. I try to listen a lot, and to be a representative of those who don\u2019t feel represented.\u201d</p> <p>This frustrates some of his core supporters, too. A publisher friend told me about a boozy London dinner party with a group of leftwing stalwarts, including an academic, campaign organiser and film director. They went around the table giving Corbyn marks out of 10 for his performance so far. The lowest was two; the highest seven; the mean was around three. The only thing they were agreed on was that they would all vote for him again. Having laboured so long for a left insurgency within Labour, they didn\u2019t want to hand the reins back to the Blairites. They would like to see Corbyn translate the energy and optimism of his rallies into something more effective.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"573d96ba76fc6cbb632e0f89a4c0c61540af1abb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/573d96ba76fc6cbb632e0f89a4c0c61540af1abb/164_101_3838_2640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn with Shami Chakrabarti in June 2016, at the launch of her report into antisemitism in Labour\" width=\"1000\" height=\"688\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Shami Chakrabarti in June, at the launch of her report into antisemitism in Labour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The ideological divisions in the party may be deep, Corbyn says, but that should not preclude cooperation on a range of issues. \u201cRead the diaries of certain Labour cabinet ministers: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/labourconference.labour\">Castle</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/oct/06/uk.iraq1\">Crossman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/22/tony-benn-peter-wilby-reads-diaries\">Benn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/07/politics-biography-chris-mullin\">Chris Mullin</a> and many others. All kinds of people manage to work together. Barbara Castle\u2019s 1975 social security pensions act was a great achievement, and that was done with a whole bunch of people who didn\u2019t particularly like each other, who didn\u2019t agree on most things \u2013 but it did get through. So it can be done. But it\u2019s also a question of how you take things forward. If we can be seen to be successfully attacking the Tories, as we did on academisation, then I think we will make a great deal of progress.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn has proposed investing \u00a3500bn in infrastructure and manufacturing, backed by a publicly owned national investment bank and regional banks. He wants to build at least half a million council houses, to introduce rent controls and a charter of private tenants\u2019 rights.</p> <p>What would he do differently if he had his year again? \u201cI would be better prepared for the media onslaught. I knew it was going to be difficult. But even I was surprised at the levels of refusal to engage, or to try to understand what we\u2019re trying to achieve.\u201d</p> <p>If Corbyn is re-elected next week, as seems likely, the key question is: what will change? The PLP is the same; the media is the same; the party is the same. One would hope that his detractors have a more sophisticated plan than they did last year, in which they will engage with the meaning of Corbyn\u2019s victory, if not with him. But one would also hope that he has devised a way to get from where he is \u2013 popular in the party, unpopular in the country at large, unworkable in parliament \u2013 to where he wants to be.</p> <p>Corbyn says he plans to take the lead on issues such as housing and education, with policies he thinks most of the party can rally around. But if he leads, will the party follow? \u201cI\u2019ll be saying, in a kindly way, \u2018There is an awful lot we can campaign on together. If we do that, we\u2019re going to be effective. If we don\u2019t do that, we won\u2019t.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But will that be enough? \u201cIf Labour party members and supporters re-elect me, that will be a second mandate in a year. Respect for the mandate is about respect for democracy itself.\u201d</p> <p>It sounds as if he plans to appeal to MPs\u2019 better nature, even if he may have exhausted their goodwill. \u201cI\u2019m sure they all have better natures,\u201d Corbyn says, with an impish smile. \u201cI\u2019ll rely on the best natures that can come out. A lot of people say lots of things in the heat of the moment. But of course I\u2019ve made mistakes, and of course we need to do better. We certainly can\u2019t carry on as we did.</p> <p>\u201cI will put it to them that I\u2019ve got a mandate, if I\u2019m elected. I\u2019ll put it to them that the mandate is about the policies I\u2019m trying to put forward. Not every dot and comma and crossed T, or whatever. But it is the general direction of the economy and policy. And I\u2019ll invite them to work with us. Whether they\u2019re going to love me at the end of it? I think the love may be further away.\u201d</p>",

It was a private matter. Human rights organisations said it was not a human rights issue.\u201d</p> <p>The historic <a href=\"http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/platform/\">Beijing Platform for Action</a>, agreed at the fourth world conference on women in 1995, did much to solidify the calls for change, with demands for structural change to end gender inequality. </p> <p>But the backlash against women\u2019s rights has been brutal. Religious fundamentalism and a rise of rightwing conservative groups, particularly over the past 15 years and most notably in the Middle East and Latin America, has left women fighting to retain the very ground they\u2019ve worked so hard to claim.</p> <p>The resistance from governments that would rather women stick to traditional roles in the home, producing children on demand, is all too familiar to anyone who attends the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/09/un-declaration-step-backwards-for-womens-rights-csw\">Commission on the Status of Women</a> at the UN, the annual meeting for member states to assess progress towards gender equality.</p> <p>What has become clear is that the extent of change for women is largely dependent on where they live, their class and their race. A poor woman from a rural area of Niger, for example, will be among the last to see any real gains.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"db35157080a0c8e129f05625b2a3de7ca822db15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db35157080a0c8e129f05625b2a3de7ca822db15/0_66_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Nigerien woman digs a trench to collect rainwater near the village of Tibiri in the southern Zinder region\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Nigerien woman digs a trench for rainwater.

You could also, of course, create more jobs in humanitarian aid, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s what you\u2019re after.</p> <p>We do indeed have thousands of migrants coming to Europe from sub-Saharan Africa. But creating jobs in many of these countries is hardly the answer either. Take Eritrea, for example. Here you would be better off ending their own government\u2019s policy of a job for life in the army. Most migrants from Eritrea are escaping a lifetime of forced conscription \u2013 effectively slave labour \u2013 alongside <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/africa/eritrea\">human rights abuses</a> including arbitrary arrests, torture or enforced disappearances.</p> <p>A lot of migration is coming from Europe, of course. But you\u2019ve led the Brexit campaign to make sure that stops. That will help to create a lot of job vacancies here at home, as Europeans who work in our NHS, our restaurants or our farms are forced to go home. But it won\u2019t create jobs in developing countries.</p> <p>As for other parts of your trade and job creation strategy, here are some home truths. You want to \u201cempower the poorest to work and trade their way out of poverty, not treat them as passive recipients of our support\u201d. Clearly, you\u2019ve never met a poor person. A typical person living in poverty often works from dawn to dusk, seven days a week: domestic workers, or farm labourers, for example. They don\u2019t have any help from anyone else, no pension, no education, no relief. They are hardly \u201cpassive recipients of our support\u201d. Is a job the answer? They have jobs, Priti. But they\u2019re insecure, without rights or a decent wage. What they need are stronger rights, a living wage, access to affordable health care and affordable education for their children.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72a299a2f990cdd316f2de2a67286f054d082cfa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72a299a2f990cdd316f2de2a67286f054d082cfa/0_11_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stone workers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A typical person living in poverty often works from dawn to dusk, seven days a week.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ratje</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And before you reply: \u201cThat\u2019s why we need to encourage more British trade in services like health and education\u201d let\u2019s hit that nail on the head.

Instead, it tends to line the pockets of the rich, extracting money from the local economy, increasing poverty and vulnerability in the long run. What we need is just trade, not free trade, which is a universal recipe for a race to the bottom.

  "<p>Last week was my twins\u2019 first birthday, which means, as I pointedly said to anyone who brought them presents, it was also my first anniversary of being a parent. (As a good Jewish mother, I plan to turn every event in their lives into one that\u2019s all about me. I am so looking forward to their barmitzvahs, where I will push all their friends out of the way as I run on to the dance floor screaming, \u201cReturn Of The Mack! Play it, DJ! Chooooon!\u201d)</p> <p>With only 365 days under my belt, I would not exactly call myself an expert. But given that I&#xa0;have got through a whole year without forgetting either (or both) of the babies on a bus, I have exceeded my own expectations. That\u2019s the thing about parenting: as an experience, it is a nonstop revelation. Here are some of the things I\u2019ve learned:</p> <p><strong>1</strong> It has turned me into a terrible person. Before I had kids, the deification of parents used to vaguely annoy me. You know, when people say, \u201cAs a mother, I feel things very deeply, whereas all the rest of you are heartless shitbags\u201d, or when politicians talk about \u201chard-working families\u201d, rudely excluding all the not-very-hard-working single people, as I was then.</p> <p>Now that I am a parent, I am completely baffled by talk like this, because I have never been as selfish as I am now, and I was not exactly Mother Teresa before. I would happily punch a kitten in the face if it in some way benefited my kids. I&#xa0;would feed them giant slices of the ozone layer if someone told me it was good for their cognitive function. Anyone who suggests that having kids makes you more empathetic \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/08/andrea-leadsom-suggests-she-would-make-better-pm-as-she-has-children\">as Andrea Leadsom did</a>, to no one\u2019s benefit this summer \u2013 is&#xa0;lying. Sure, I hope the planet doesn\u2019t become a giant dumpster fire, but only because I want my kids to have somewhere nice and shady for their playmat. This does not make me a superior person: it makes me a dick. Parents are the literal worst and I honestly think they should all be banned from public office and, quite possibly, life&#xa0;in general.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> All fights with your partner will now be the same fight over and over, and that fight is, \u201cI do more for the kid(s) than you and you don\u2019t give me any credit.\u201d Welcome to the next 18 years of your life!</p> <p><strong>3</strong> One of my favourite jokes from Friends (stick with me here) comes when Joey, meeting someone without a TV, asks, \u201cWhat does all your furniture point at?\u201d There is an assumption that without a child, a person\u2019s life has no focus, nothing for their furniture to point at. I am here to tell you categorically that this is nonsense, and the only people who claim otherwise are parents who want everyone\u2019s life to be as tediously repetitive as their own.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/sep/03/channing-tatum-feminist-dream-1980s-films-hadley-freeman\">Is Channing Tatum in a fish tail the feminist dream realised? The jury\u2019s out</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>4</strong> The head/heart divide is stronger than ever. When I interviewed the screenwriter <a href=\"http://gb.imdb.com/name/nm1959505/\">Diablo Cody</a> a few years ago, she told me that having a&#xa0;baby was \u201clike having your heart outside your body\u201d, and this is definitely true. But while my heart feels like it\u2019s been internally rearranged, my head feels exactly the same. Maybe some people discover sudden maturity when they have kids. I,&#xa0;on the other hand, still find childcare more boring than, say, getting stoned on a beach by myself. But if I actually went to a beach, I&#xa0;would spend 70% of my time there gazing at photos of my babies on the phone (and the other 30% spangled out of my brain). Does that count as&#xa0;maturity?</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Which has led me to wonder if maybe my own parents weren\u2019t always as happy to spend time with me as I assumed. Maybe my mother didn\u2019t want to give up every Saturday in 1989 to watch my tap dance class? Perhaps she doesn\u2019t want to provide me with free childcare while I&#xa0;write this column? Nah, that\u2019s ridiculous.</p> <p><strong>6</strong> I realise the current trend is to suggest that it is liberating, feminist even, to talk about how tiring/hard/hellish it is to be a mother. I would like to urge caution with this. Sure, talk to any friends in exactly the same position as you, but to a woman desperately trying to get pregnant your Facebook status update about frustrating sleep patterns will sound like sadness that your house is too big.</p> <p>I was in my late 30s when my babies were born, so I have seen too many friends struggle or fail to get pregnant, suffer miscarriages or stillbirths, or care for children with special needs, to ever complain about what a nightmare it is to have two healthy babies. Because that\u2019s probably the real thing I found after a year of parenting: how absurdly lucky I feel.</p>",

Whatever people say about those chapters, the book as a whole will provide a background text to the Liberal Democrat conference in Brighton this weekend, after another major setback (the Brexit vote); and we will hear a great deal more about building a cross-party platform on the left.</p> <p>Lib Dems are all optimists at heart. They have to be. But there are some rather obvious barriers to a pan-left platform at the next election: three in particular.</p> <p>First, there are no mechanisms in any of the formal party structures to organise a formal pact.

And angry purists on the left seem to hate people who think slightly differently more than they hate the other side.</p> <p>Third, and rather less obviously, the formal parties of the left \u2013 Labour, Lib Dems and Greens \u2013 have long since become bored by economics, forgetting that any winning platform must include a challenging recipe for creating prosperity.</p> <p>There never was a period in recent history when a better way of doing this was needed more, given that we are subservient to an economy devoted to funnelling money upwards to billionaires, from where it patently fails to trickle down.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Angry purists on the left seem to hate people who think slightly differently more than they hate the other side</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet the left has abandoned this agenda to the right, concentrating instead \u2013 and rather patronisingly \u2013 on welfare. Another matter entirely.</p> <p>We might address one or possibly two of these barriers before the next general election, which we have to assume will take place in 2020, but the chances of tackling all three seem pretty remote.</p> <p>But don\u2019t let\u2019s give up. There are two things we must do to bridge the chasms that divide the left. We need to so some cross-party thinking, as set out in my new book, <a href=\"http://radix.org.uk/work/death-liberal-democracy/\" title=\"\">The Death of Liberal Democracy?</a> \u2013 written with Joe Zammit-Lucia and also published in time for conference season. We can also use our political institutions to make things happen.</p> <p>That sounds obvious, but it isn\u2019t. All too often the opportunities to reach out across party lines, to cooperate to change the law in parliament and beyond, get stymied because of obscure and irritating rivalries between opposition parties \u2013 and because their priorities and strategies are different.</p> <p>Yet the government has only a slim majority. Imagine if we could agree across party lines to use parliament for shared objectives.</p> <p>We might not be able to have an impact on the big, symbolic policy areas \u2013 shifting the NHS or changing fiscal priorities \u2013 but we could do something.</p> <p>If we wanted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/25/dont-privatise-rbs-break-it-up-into-local-banks-urges-nef-thinktank\" title=\"\">break up Royal Bank of Scotland into local lending institutions</a>, we could hammer out a cross-party strategy to achieve that. If we wanted all public service contracts to be in the public domain, ending commercial confidentiality for public services, we could do that too.</p> <p>It might sound unexciting. It might stretch parliamentary conventions. There will be squabbles about who can claim the credit. But if we can achieve things together \u2013 then and only then can we be united enough to be a bit more ambitious.</p>",

And that shows what a force we are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Night Manager, Luther and Sherlock bring a slightly different perspective to drama than Americans are used to,\u201d Preston said. \u201cThey are beyond the familiar, which gives them a cutting edge, makes them intriguing and is why American audiences are enjoying them so much.\u201d</p> <p>Jen Chaney, a TV columnist for the US magazine Vulture, said US interest in British drama had peaked in the past few years.</p> <p>She said: \u201cI do think more Americans are embracing and being exposed to British television, and I think there are two reasons why: the increase in accessibility to such programmes and, to a lesser extent, the popularity of Downton Abbey. </p> <p>\u201cDownton Abbey was such a phenomenon that I do think it made some people start thinking about British television and eager to dive more deeply into it.\u201d</p> <p>Chaney said the calibre of talent in the nominated British shows spoke to a wider trend in television on both sides of the Atlantic, where television was no longer seen as a step down for actors.
