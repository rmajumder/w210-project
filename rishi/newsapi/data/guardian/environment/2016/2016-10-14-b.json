  "<h2>Economics<br></h2> <p>Heathrow airport is full to bursting. The same will soon be true of Gatwick. There has been no full-length runway built in the south-east since the 1940s. The UK\u2019s attempts to break into the big and fast-growing markets of the emerging world such as India and China will be thwarted unless it follows the lead of other European countries and upgrades its aviation infrastructure. Jobs, trade and inward investment all depend on the go-ahead for new capacity.</p> <p>That, put simply, was the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/440316/airports-commission-final-report.pdf\">conclusion of the independent airports commission chaired by Sir Howard Davies</a>. The government finds the economic arguments compelling. It will support the idea of a new runway next week and will probably come down in favour of Heathrow.</p> <p>Opponents of airport expansion in the south-east say that growth isn\u2019t everything and that once the extra pollution \u2013 from cars as well as planes \u2013 is taken into account, the new investment will do more harm than good.</p> <p>This argument is unlikely to sway Theresa May\u2019s government, which is keen post-<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> to make trade with long-haul destinations more attractive. Departure from the EU has made the development of alternative markets for exports an even stronger imperative for ministers, who are keen to show that Britain is \u201copen for business\u201d. Infrastructure is a key part of May\u2019s agenda: it is seen as a way of making the UK economy more productive.</p> <p>The decision about where to put the new runway has proved more problematical, and not just because of the opposition of Tory MPs with seats under the Heathrow flightpath. There are two factors in Gatwick\u2019s favour. Firstly, work could start there more quickly, with the diggers moving in by the end of the decade. Secondly, expansion at Gatwick would provide Heathrow with competition. Building a third runway at Heathrow is going to take longer. There will be legal challenges and a public inquiry. If the aim is speed, Gatwick is the better choice.</p> <p>Heathrow\u2019s advantage is that it is already a major hub and, according to the airports commission, better placed to expand the sort of capacity that is most needed: long-haul flights to new destinations. Davies says the benefits of Heathrow are \u201csignificantly greater, for business passengers, freight operators and the broader economy\u201d.</p> <p>With ministers keen to show that the UK can not just survive but thrive outside the EU, that judgment is likely to prove decisive. <em>Larry Elliott</em><br></p> <h2>Environment</h2> <p>Noxious air, roaring engines and a warming climate: these are the environmental issues a new runway at Heathrow has to confront.</p> <p>The Heathrow area has breached air pollution limits every year for the last decade, thanks to being nestled by the junction of the M25 and M4 motorways, as well as its its own planes and traffic. A third runway can only worsen the problem, but the airport and government are largely reliant on national policies to solve it, such as large-scale shifts to public transport and electric cars.</p> <p>The omens for success are poor: the supreme court ruled in 2015 that the government\u2019s air pollution plan was illegally poor and its new plan is being challenged on Tuesday. Campaigners also say Heathrow is sending mixed messages, by <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmselect/cmenvaud/389/389.pdf#page=18\">promising no more cars on the road</a> due to the new runway while <a href=\"http://www.heathrowappg.com/air-quality-letter-to-prime-minister/\">planning expanded roads and more car parks</a>.</p> <p>Heathrow currently complies with noise rules on its flight paths, helped by planes having become a quieter in recent years. But a new runway would expose 300,000 new people to noise, although some existing sufferers would enjoy quieter skies as a result of the changes.</p> <p>In any case, it is the frequency of the flights \u2013 every 70 seconds at peak times \u2013 that residents say most concerns them, not the noisiness of each plane. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/11/heathrow-airport-ban-night-flights-plan-third-runway\">night flight ban</a>, from 11pm to 5.30am, has been promised by Heathrow: currently 5,800 night flights a year are allowed.</p> <p>Aviation is set to contribute a quarter of of the entire nation\u2019s allowed legally carbon emissions by 2050, although the government has yet to deliver a strategy for achieving even this limit. A new runway at Heathrow would be compatible with this, but there is a catch. The go-ahead for the third runway would mean that no other airport in the country could ever expand, if the climate targets are to be met, dashing the hopes of many regional airports. <em>Damian Carrington</em> <br></p> <h2>Politics <br></h2> <p>In case they were in any doubt about the scale of the lobbying operation, politicians attending the Conservative, Labour or SNP conferences in the past month could all pop in for a cappuccino at a heavily branded Heathrow Lounge.</p> <p>Theresa May\u2019s allies like to portray her as making decisions in a sombre and businesslike way. But if the decision about how \u2013 and more importantly where \u2013 to expand airport capacity in south-east England was being taken by technocrats alone, it could have been settled decades ago. </p> <p>The Davies review on airport capacity has been gathering dust in Downing Street for more than a year because the politics of pressing ahead are so fraught. May\u2019s chancellor, Philip Hammond, believes Davies makes an unequivocal case for the economic benefits of expansion at Heathrow. And a decision now would signal that, as Hammond has repeatedly said, Britain is \u201copen for business\u201d while the pound is being pummelled on the foreign exchanges.<br></p> <p>But if May endorses Davies\u2019 conclusion, she will be picking a fight with sceptical backbenchers at a time when her party is already restive over grammar schools and Brexit.<br></p> <p>She will also have to stand firm against her foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who is vehemently opposed to expanding Heathrow, and her education secretary, Justine Greening. But if she allows her MPs a free vote, it could look indecisive \u2013 and set a dangerous precedent for the next time MPs disagree with the prime minister.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan, who backs Gatwick, will noisily oppose a third runway at Heathrow; and while Jeremy Corbyn has conceded that he won\u2019t be able to whip Labour MPs, many of whom support airport expansion, both he and the shadow chancellor John McDonnell, a west London MP, are implacably against. It will be, as one Whitehall insider groans, a \u201cmassive political headache\u201d. <em>Heather Stewart</em></p>",

His dad is dead, and his mum has taken to her bed. There\u2019s no money for shoes, dinner is dreary baked beans night after night, and he\u2019s pursued by school bullies and hated by teachers. </p> <p>\u201cI was interested in the idea of adversity because some kids have really hard lives \u2013 I\u2019ve encountered them myself along the way,\u201d Roxburgh says. \u201cI was keen on dealing with the story of a boy in very difficult circumstances who does prevail, but [for whom] the matter of prevailing is a nightmare. Artie has a horrendous adventure \u2013 you have a boy whose pet hate is even the smallest adventure, his life is hard enough as it is. The idea for the book began with that \u2013 that was the genesis.\u201d</p> <p>The story has a sort of timeless, very Australian quality about it \u2013 only a couple of mentions of mobile phones and cameras place it in the present day. Roxburgh, 54, deliberately created a world where kids are on their bikes outside, rather than inside with their devices.</p> <p>\u201cI have an uneasy relationship with technology,\u201d he says. \u201cI know there\u2019s such an abundance of it, and it\u2019s a key component in kids\u2019 lives, but I\u2019m a sceptic.\u201d</p> <p>At the age of eight, his oldest son is allowed 30 minutes a week of screen time \u2013 which seems rather on the small side.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our son became quite addicted to screens.

He gets 30 minutes a week because I have grave concerns about it. I wanted to create an analogue environment; wherever the internet lives there is no innocence.\u201d</p> <p>Roxburgh\u2019s concerns \u201care to do with the addictive nature of the internet\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe games that little kids are inoculated with are a gateway into gaming and pokies,\u201d he says. \u201cI looked at the games my little boy was using and they were essentially very primitive versions of poker machines with spinning pineapples and bits of fruit \u2013 just like the pokies.\u201d</p> <p>As for his own internet use \u2013 particularly social media \u2013 Roxburgh says less is more.</p> <p>\u201cI really resent the constant intrusion of it, and the 100%, 24/7 accessibility that people have to you. I value my quietude, solitude and time away from screens and my privacy. I do no social media. I don\u2019t understand why people would do it.\u201d</p> <p>Despite not having a rusted-on internet addiction, Roxburgh is still susceptible to distraction. Writing in the library helped, but it\u2019s meditation that Roxburgh describes as a \u201cgame changer\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m a much better person when I meditate. I really miss it when I haven\u2019t done it \u2013 with the pace and noise and madness of life. I try and do it twice a day.

According to Jacobsen, the reef\u2019s demise followed the \u201cmost catastrophic bleaching event in its history, from which it would never recover\u201d.</p> <p>Despite the rather tongue-in-cheek nature of the obituary <a href=\"http://www.spokesman.com/blogs/outdoors/2016/oct/13/great-barrier-reef-pronounced-dead-scientists/\">various news outlets</a>, including the Sun in Britain and the <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/10/14/the-great-barrier-reef-is-dead-at-25-million-years-old/\">New York Post</a> in the US, and social media users have rushed to mourn the supposed passing of the Great Barrier Reef. The ecosystem lies off the east coast of Australia and is the largest living entity on the planet.</p> <p>But scientists have stressed that while the Great Barrier Reef, like most coral structures around the world, is under severe stress, it hasn\u2019t quite snuffed it yet. </p> <p>\u201cThis is a fatalistic, doomsday approach to climate change that isn\u2019t going to engage anyone and misinforms the public,\u201d said Kim Cobb, a coral reef expert at Georgia Tech. \u201cThere will be reefs in 2050, including portions of the Great Barrier Reef, I\u2019m pretty confident of that. I\u2019m put off by pieces that say we are doomed.\u201d</p> <p>A mass bleaching event, fueled by warming oceans, has swept corals around the world but has proved most visibly destructive on the Great Barrier Reef. Almost a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/03/agencies-say-22-of-barrier-reef-coral-is-dead-correcting-misinterpretation\">quarter of the reef\u2019s coral has died off</a>, with the previously pristine areas of the ecosystem\u2019s north the worst affected.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/07/the-great-barrier-reef-a-catastrophe-laid-bare\">The Great Barrier Reef: a catastrophe laid bare</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bleaching occurs when prolonged high temperatures cause coral to expel their symbiotic algae, turning them into snow-white skeletons. Corals can recover from this but some simply die. Divers on the Great Barrier Reef have spotted large areas with degraded coral, with some reporting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/07/the-great-barrier-reef-a-catastrophe-laid-bare\">the smell of rotting, dying coral</a> when they emerge from the deep.</p> <p>While almost all parts of the Great Barrier Reef suffered bleaching, not all have died. Scientists hope that large parts of the ecosystem will recover, although the long-term warming and acidifying of the oceans pose a grave threat to reefs around the world. </p> <p>Research has shown that some corals <a href=\"http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2013/20131029_coral.html\">may be able to adapt</a> but the pace of the warming means that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/03/barrier-reef-coral-genetically-altered-in-hope-of-surviving-climate-change\">genetic engineering may be required</a> to repopulate reefs, which are critical for thousands of marine species and a drawcard for millions of tourists. </p> <p>Media coverage suggesting that the Great Barrier Reef is finished may even prove harmful. Russell Brainard, head of the coral reef ecosystem Program at Noaa\u2019s Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scientists-take-on-great-barrier-reef-obituary_us_57fff8f1e4b0162c043b068f\">told</a> the Huffington Post that some people \u201care going to take it at face value that the Great Barrier Reef is dead\u201d.</p> <p>Cobb added: \u201cI have studied corals off Christmas Island in the Pacific where 85% of them have died, it was a graveyard. But even there, I was shocked to see remarkable resilience. Amid the graveyards of the reefs there were areas that looked like nothing had happened.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a lot we can do to minimize climate change and we need to get going on that. To say reefs are finished and we can\u2019t do anything about it isn\u2019t the message we need going forward.\u201d</p>",

But, after leading through Joel Campbell, they lost their way and in front of a baying crowd there was a grim inevitability about the Swansea captain Ashley Williams\u2019s 74th-minute winner. Thierry Henry, the Arsenal legend, said he had never known the Emirates Stadium fans to be as angry and impatient.</p> <p>In the following match, Arsenal earned a fighting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/05/tottenham-hotspur-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">2-2 draw at Tottenham Hotspur</a> with 10 men and have lost only once in the league in 17 outings \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/14/arsenal-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">4-3 home defeat against Liverpool</a> on the opening day of this season.

  "<p>The new Champions Cup season needed an energetic lift-off and Glasgow delivered splendidly on the opening night at the expense of a lacklustre Leicester. Never have the Tigers felt the cold draught of northern exposure quite so keenly, conceding the most points in their 20-year European history to leave themselves in danger of an early exit from a hugely competitive Pool One.</p> <p>On the chilliest night of autumn to date the Warriors were excellent value for their bonus-point victory, driven forward by Josh Strauss and enthusiastically served on the right wing by Leonardo Sarto. Leicester, who sacked their defence coach last week and expressed pre-match misgivings about playing on artificial surfaces, had only themselves to blame and will need to improve substantially to trouble the French champions Racing Metro next weekend. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t good enough tonight and that\u2019s my responsibility,\u201d confirmed Richard Cockerill, the Tigers\u2019 director of rugby. \u201cWe\u2019re not hiding away from how poor that was. We were outplayed.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/13/european-champions-cup-2016-17-pool-by-pool-guide\">European Champions Cup 2016-17: pool-by-pool guide | Paul Rees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was the most inauspicious of starts to his Leicester career for the Australian centre Matt Toomua, who might have been sent off for a shocking tip-tackle on the Scotland fly-half Finn Russell in the opening quarter. Cockerill\u2019s side were horribly porous in the first half and were soundly beaten long before Mark Bennett and Sarto were gifted the softest of interception tries in the final quarter.</p> <p>Toomua will certainly not forget his Tigers debut. The game was only 12 minutes old when the Wallaby blatantly up-ended Russell and sparked an altercation involving all 30 players. With the sold-out crowd baying for a red card the 26-year-old was slightly fortunate to see only yellow, having lifted the fly-half\u2019s legs in the tackle and made no apparent attempt to bring him to ground safely. Only the fact Russell landed on his back rather than his head saved Toomua from an ignominious early bath.</p> <p>It just goes to show how first-night nerves can scramble the most seasoned of brains. Toomua has regularly added a touch of class to an average Wallaby side and is precisely the type of intelligent, playmaking presence at 12 his club have been missing.</p> <p>A windy Friday night beside the River Clyde, however, is not the most stress-free environment for any debutant, particularly for a new arrival who has not played since being concussed against the All Blacks in Sydney in August.</p> <p>A little extra niggle was duly generated, with Glasgow\u2019s forwards visibly roused and determined to send Leicester back to the east midlands to think again. Even before kick-off there were those connected with the Tigers who felt it had been ill-advised of Cockerill to air his preference for grass over artificial turf on the eve of the game. He was simply being honest but the risk of putting doubt into his players\u2019 minds and bolstering home morale was obvious.</p> <p>Glasgow, who had persistent problems with their traditional surface last season, would have been quietly delighted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24a04fd23465165a0e1921bd65eb97c5a7dd46d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24a04fd23465165a0e1921bd65eb97c5a7dd46d6/0_78_1680_1007/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Glasgow v Leicester\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Toomua of Leicester is sent to the sin-bin after 12 minutes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Clifton/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It did not seem to matter much initially, with Leicester\u2019s Brendan O\u2019Connor scoring from a lineout drive shortly after Ryan Wilson had been sent to the sin-bin. Being reduced to 14 men, though, did not bother the Warriors who promptly scored two tries in five minutes in Wilson\u2019s absence. First the winger Sarto found an improbable hole around the fringes before another surging sequence of attacking phases caused further defensive panic and allowed the hooker Fraser Brown to scramble over.</p> <p>By the time the scrum-half and captain Henry Pyrgos smartly nipped over for a third Glasgow try in the 32nd minute the atmosphere was momentarily akin to Parkhead or Ibrox, not a comparison made too frequently in Glasgow\u2019s European history. Owen Williams did claw three points back with his second penalty but, at 22-13 down, Tigers were in need of some serious second-half inspiration.</p> <p>Even with the wind at their backs and a slightly unpredictable French referee in charge, it never looked like materialising. One statistic suggested Leicester carried the ball 23 times for 27 metres in the first half, an equation that told its own blunt-edged story, and they were even more toothless after the break. Their defensive work around the breakdown remains a major issue and they are conceding way too many points, particularly away from home.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/14/northampton-and-alex-king-part-ways-hours-out-from-cup-opener\">Northampton and Alex King part ways day before Champions Cup opener</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The alert Russell and fleet-footed Stuart Hogg duly made them pay, with Bennett and Sarto gleefully picking off ill-advised passes to ensure a cosmopolitan scoresheet with a Kiwi, an Italian, a Scotsman and a Welshman all registering points.

  "<p>An international tribunal has dismissed a multinational mining company\u2019s demand that the government of El Salvador pay $250m (\u00a3205m) in compensation for refusing to allow it to dig for gold in the tiny Central American country where the slogan, \u201cNo to mining, yes to life\u201d has become a national rallying cry.</p> <p>The tribunal, which ruled that OceanaGold\u2019s case was without merit, also ordered the firm to pay the Salvadoran government $8m to cover the majority of the country\u2019s legal costs.</p> <p>\u201cFor the people of Cabanas who have been fighting to defend their environment, it is mission accomplished,\u201d said El Salvador\u2019s attorney general, Douglas Mel\u00e9ndez Ruiz. \u201cIt is an important step for the country to have been victorious in this lawsuit.\u201d </p> <p>While an OceanaGold statement expressed disappointment at the verdict, the outcome was celebrated by civil society groups from El Salvador to Canada, although they questioned why the ruling in a case dating back to 2009 had taken so long. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Bernardo Belloso, president of the Association for the Development of El Salvador, part of a national roundtable opposed to metallic mining, said the ruling \u201cvindicates our right to determine our own development path\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But he added: \u201cThis is a law suit that should never have been allowed.

The sum sought by the company, which was revised several times over the course of the dispute, at one point exceeded $300m \u2013 almost twice the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=CRS1\">$158m in international aid</a> that El Salvador received in 2014. </p> <p>El Salvador, where <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/country/el-salvador\">almost a third of the population lives under the national poverty line</a>, spent more than $12m on its legal defence.

For seven years, it has put a chill on policymaking that could respect the decision of Salvadorans to prohibit metal mining and protect local communities and the environment.\u201d</p> <p>Too many corporations, she added, have used the ISDS system to \u201cbully governments and undermine local opposition to mining given its devastating impacts, and this must stop\u201d.<br></p> <p>Meera Karunananthan, a water campaigner for the Council of Canadians, said the case against El Salvador should serve as a cautionary tale.</p> <p>\u201cSalvadoran movements have been pushing for bold initiatives addressing the country\u2019s environmental challenges, including a more robust water policy and a permanent ban on metal mining, but these policy proposals have been stalled under the threat of this lawsuit,\u201d she said. </p> <p>\u201cAs long as the country is forced to adhere to trade and investment rules that enabled the lawsuit in the first place, it will be extremely challenging for Salvadorans to maintain their sovereignty over environmental and social policy.\u201d<br></p> <p>Manuel P\u00e9rez-Rocha, an associate fellow of the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, said: \u201cThe fact that it took more than seven years to release the ruling, and that a country with so many economic difficulties like El Salvador has had to pay millions for its defence, is immoral and shows the complete discretion with which these tribunals sponsored by the World Bank, and its infamous ICSID arm, operate.\u201d</p> <p><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/apr/10/el-salvador-pacific-rim-assault-democratic-governance\">El Salvador groups accuse Pacific Rim of 'assault on democratic governance'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>OceanaGold said in a statement that it had inherited the dispute when it acquired Pacific Rim and had always sought an amicable resolution that \u201cwould benefit all parties\u201d.<br></p> <p>The statement added: \u201cThe company believes that a modern resource industry that operates in a safe and sustainable manner and within internationally recognised best practices has the potential to unlock a sustainable and multi-decade development opportunity for the Republic of El Salvador.

Lennon was born on the 9 October (1940) and lived at 9 Newcastle Road, Wavertree, Liverpool (three names containing nine letters, you\u2019ll note). There, he penned One After 909 and would catch the number 72 (7+2=9) bus to art school. \u201cThe number follows me around,\u201d Lennon once explained, and it certainly does seem a bit spooky that musical partner Paul McCartney\u2019s surname had nine letters and that the Beatles themselves lasted for nine years. Other instances of Beatle-related nines are too numerous to mention, but significantly, Lennon was shot dead in Manhattan (a name with nine letters) on 8 December 1980. The weirdness would end there, except time zone differences meant that in his birthplace Liverpool the date was the 9th.

Mozart, for example, was such a numerologist that he even used secret numerical codes in letters to his wife, and was another big fan of the number 3.

And like American Honey, Ford\u2019s drama aims for an unvarnished, social-realist intensity, documenting the desperate lives of a marginalised underclass. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d448e4c3fc62f3be6fb1ffdf8862fe81894feba0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d448e4c3fc62f3be6fb1ffdf8862fe81894feba0/0_0_2351_1754/1000.jpg\" alt=\"For a better life \u2026 The Grapes of Wrath, 1940.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"746\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">For a better life \u2026 The Grapes of Wrath, 1940.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there are major differences. In American Honey, for instance, there is no particular place to go. There\u2019s no fiery <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/dec/29/families-in-literature-the-joads-in-the-grapes-of-wrath-by-john-steinbeck\">Tom Joad</a> at the centre, clamouring for social change. Nor are there many obvious villains intent on bringing these 21st-century hobos to heel. Instead, they are sent bobbing through an apolitical, atomised, zero-hours environment where everybody else appears to be in pretty much the same boat. The magazine vendors aren\u2019t targeted \u2013 they\u2019re ignored, and this affords them a weightless euphoria.<br></p> <p>It is this quality, I suspect, that makes the film so special. On my first viewing, I filed it as a bizarrely joyous and exuberant picture, despite its harsh subject matter. After watching it a second time, I think it might be more complex. More likely the joy and the subject matter are indivisible, each dependent on the other. Some films come to prop up the faltering, debased notion of <a href=\"https://iantyrrell.wordpress.com/papers-and-comments/\">American exceptionalism</a>; others to expose it as a bright and shining lie. But American Honey sees the dream for what it is \u2013 a fantasy born out of hardship \u2013 and appreciates it on its own terms. Intuitively Arnold\u2019s film understands that the trip is usually more exciting than the destination, that the pursuit is invariably more authentic than the happiness at the end. Or, to put it another way, in chasing after the dream we are, in fact, already living it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1SpWZm1PLc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y1SpWZm1PLc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/y1SpWZm1PLc\">Video: watch the trailer for American Honey</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>If American Honey is fuelled by a sense of hope and possibility, Arnold believes that this is largely thanks to the cast. The majority are non-professional actors, plucked from skate-parks and Wal-Mart lots. They all came from difficult circumstances but, she insists, they all brought their own spirit, a spark of undimmed potential. \u201cSome of their lives have changed as a result of the film. Some got jobs or moved away from abusive partners. The film gave them a small sense of control of their lives.\u201d<br></p> <p>It would be nice to credit American Honey with providing the cast with the dream \u2013 or at least a convenient leg-up towards it. But that\u2019s too much the Hollywood happy ending. It doesn\u2019t account for the other pitfalls on the road, the fact that people can backslide and circumstances can change. It may even run counter to the abiding spirit of the film \u2013 which exults in the freewheeling abandon that comes from having nothing much left to lose, the thrill of whipping through the fringes of an unfamiliar city with the music up loud and the sunroof thrown back to show off the stars. All around is a humdrum nightmare of dead-end jobs and foreclosed homes, vacant lots on the endless road. But in the middle, in the moment, there\u2019s the American dream.<br></p> <ul> <li>American Honey is out now.<br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>The photograph on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/dec/01/weekend7.weekend3\">cover of Antony and the Johnsons\u2019 breakthrough album</a> I am a Bird Now is Candy Darling on Her Deathbead, 1973. The photograph Hanya Yanagihara chose for the <a href=\"http://knopfdoubleday.com/book/239717/a-little-life/\">cover of her Booker-shortlisted second novel</a> A Little Life is Orgasmic Man, 1969. Both pictures are by Peter Hujar, the photographer who lived and worked in poverty in New York until he died in 1987, aged 53, of Aids-related pneumonia. Hujar may have been a prominent figure for two decades in the small bohemian art world downtown, but his name is hardly writ large in conventional histories of photography. So why do 21st-century artists hold his work in such high regard? </p> <p>\u201cIn many ways Peter Hujar defined downtown for me,\u201d writes veteran photography critic and close friend <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/vince-aletti\">Vince Aletti</a> in his introduction to <a href=\"http://www.artbook.com/9783958291065.html\">Lost Downtown</a>, a new book of Hujar\u2019s portraits in which Aletti appears. \u201cHe went places I never dared to, and hung out with people I\u2019d only read about.\u201d Some of these people \u2013 such as drag queen and actor <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/08/obituaries/divine-transvestite-film-actor-found-dead-in-hollywood-at-42.html\">Divine</a>, artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/13/david-wojnarowicz-close-to-the-knives-a-memoir-of-disintegration-artist-aids-activist\">David Wojnarowicz</a>, writers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/dec/29/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\">Susan Sontag</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/williamburroughs\">William Burroughs</a> \u2013 feature in this book of incisive portraits, all beautifully sequenced with subtle visual correspondences.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"670aabb3b15d68e1848b9e3ef7ba85bbe65e09c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/670aabb3b15d68e1848b9e3ef7ba85bbe65e09c4/0_0_3543_3542/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fran Lebowitz at Home in Morristown 1974\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fran Lebowitz at Home in Morristown 1974.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Peter Hujar Archive, LLC; courtesy Pace MacGill Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe took me to places taking photographs where I never, ever would have gone,\u201d says celebrated writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/feb/01/public-speaking-fran-lebowitz-scorsese\">Fran Lebowitz</a>, who like Aletti was a close friend of Hujar and whose 1970s portrait also appears in Lost Downtown. \u201cI went to extremely serious, very heavy S&amp;M bars.\u201d And it didn\u2019t stop there. \u201cWest Side downtown there were these burnt-out piers. They were used by gay men to have sex in. They were pitch black inside \u2026 the environment was very rough and dangerous,\u201d she adds. \u201cPeter was physically fearless in the city, that\u2019s for sure, when there were plenty of places that were dangerous to go in New York.\u201d</p> <p>What was Hujar like? \u201cHe was charismatic and complicated and, it turned out, deeply insecure, with a damaging family history he kept mostly to himself,\u201d continues Aletti in his pithy introduction to Lost Downtown. I ask Aletti to elaborate on \u201ccharismatic\u201d. \u201cA striking, tall, good-looking man who was very engaging in company,\u201d he explains. \u201cHe was really wonderful at parties. I can\u2019t tell you the number of times that people I knew who met him for the first time would call me and say: \u2018Who was that guy? I\u2019m in love with him.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f222736b846f066b9cd2dc6d9ef2f130f141ae27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f222736b846f066b9cd2dc6d9ef2f130f141ae27/0_0_3543_3527/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Hujar, Divine 1975\" width=\"1000\" height=\"995\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Hujar, Divine 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Peter Hujar Archive, LLC; courtesy Pace MacGill Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe was famously handsome,\u201d agrees Lebowitz. \u201cI was probably the only person that Peter ever knew who wasn\u2019t in love with him. Everybody fell madly in love with Peter. <em>Everybody</em>. <em>In</em> love.\u201d</p> <p>And what about complicated? \u201cUnderneath all that was an incredible insecurity, an incredible sense of not getting where he wanted to be, and real anger at the way things were going in his life,\u201d says Aletti, who also thinks Hujar\u2019s estrangement from his family was \u201csomething from your past that continues to drain your confidence. I don\u2019t think it was present all the time, but I think in his darkest moments, it was something that shadowed him.\u201d</p> <p>But far from becoming embittered towards the world, Hujar became a father figure to younger artists such as <a href=\"http://www.garyschneider.net/index.cfm\">Gary Schneider</a>, who was an aspiring young photographer when he got to know Hujar in the early 1980s. \u201cHe was a mentor to many artists of my generation. He was 20 years our senior. People like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/23/nan-goldin-photographer-wanted-get-high-early-age\">Nan Goldin</a>, David Wojnarowicz, and [sculptor] <a href=\"http://www.pacegallery.com/artists/442/kiki-smith\">Kiki Smith</a> \u2026 He championed their work and he was very connected to them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02ef2daf33cd596b9f0186d879c41fb5283d3d32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02ef2daf33cd596b9f0186d879c41fb5283d3d32/0_0_3543_3508/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Heys in Lana Turner\u2019s Gown (I) 1979\" width=\"1000\" height=\"990\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Heys in Lana Turner\u2019s Gown (I) 1979.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Peter Hujar Archive, LLC; courtesy Pace MacGill Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a fellow photographer, Schneider sees a piercing, penetrating quality in Hujar\u2019s portraits. \u201cHis ability to connect with his subject is so powerful,\u201d he says. \u201cHow unveiled the portraits are is something I\u2019m interested in as an artist \u2026 Even though the work is very designed \u2026 there\u2019s a moment of powerful connection with his subject. And that\u2019s unusual.\u201d </p> <p>Aletti picks out a specific example of this photographic connection. \u201cHis many pictures of David Wojnarowicz,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was a real reaching out, I think, and a real loving and understanding quality in those pictures. I remember being very struck by them in the beginning because when I met David I didn\u2019t think he was particularly impressive \u2026 But when I saw Peter\u2019s pictures of him I completely understood what Peter saw in him.\u201d</p> <p>What was it like to be photographed by Hujar? \u201cI hate getting my picture taken, and I always did. But I didn\u2019t really mind it with Peter,\u201d says Lebowitz. \u201cPeter was, in a way, at his most moving when taking photographs. He was so absorbed by it. Peter was in many ways a very tortured man, and I felt like when he was taking photographs, he wasn\u2019t. I had other friends who were photographers, but not like Peter. Peter was so profoundly absorbed and engaged by it. He was never not a photographer.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0066bc29fbffb2c39429acc7b24b17a503cdabe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0066bc29fbffb2c39429acc7b24b17a503cdabe/0_0_3543_3521/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Larry Ree Backstage c. 1973\" width=\"1000\" height=\"994\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Larry Ree backstage c 1973.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Peter Hujar Archive, LLC; courtesy Pace MacGill Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It seems strange that such a talented, charming and committed photographer was not more successful during his lifetime. Schneider explains succinctly: \u201cHe certainly didn\u2019t work well with most galleries and collectors. So he kept himself in poverty,\u201d he says. \u201cHe often worked against his supporters.\u201d</p> <p>One lasting success Hujar did achieve in his lifetime was the publication of a book in 1976, <a href=\"http://peterhujararchive.com/about/\">Portraits in Life and Death</a>, long out of print. It is an unusual book: a sequence of masterly portraits of Hujar\u2019s friends and associates is followed by a set of pictures of corpses in the catacombs underneath an Italian church. Perhaps inspired by this, Sontag wrote in the book\u2019s introduction: \u201cPhotography also converts the whole world into a cemetery,\u201d prefiguring one of the key themes in French thinker Roland Barthes\u2019s seminal 1980 essay about photography, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/mar/26/roland-barthes-camera-lucida-rereading\">Camera Lucida</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ac1e7d94e86d9e29f5406d93794ad3946215fda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ac1e7d94e86d9e29f5406d93794ad3946215fda/0_0_3543_3527/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jose\u0301 Arango Backstage at the Palm Casino Revue 1974\" width=\"1000\" height=\"995\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jose\u0301 Arango Backstage at the Palm Casino Revue 1974.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Peter Hujar Archive, LLC; courtesy Pace MacGill Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hujar was also an inspiration for the younger photographers who knew him, such as Goldin and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/09/robert-mapplethorpe-photography-jack-fritscher-look-at-the-pictures\">Robert Mapplethorpe</a>, but not in a direct way. \u201cNan clearly was a friend, but her work looks nothing like Peter\u2019s,\u201d says Aletti. \u201cAnd again, Mapplethorpe\u2019s work looks nothing like Peter\u2019s for the most part. What I value in Peter\u2019s work I find absent in Mapplethorpe\u2019s, which is a kind of soulfulness, and a real desire for connection \u2026 But I think, in a way, because Peter was a cult character during his lifetime, that he didn\u2019t have much influence on his contemporaries, that I can think of. But I think he\u2019s much more understood and much more seen now, and his influence is hopefully still growing.\u201d</p> <p>This slow-burn of success explains why Hujar is gradually becoming more appreciated decades after his death. \u201cHe was kind of anti-institution, Peter. He even talked about how he would have to die for the work to become famous,\u201d says Schneider. \u201cAnd it was really true.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>They make unlikely bedfellows, the Playboy playmate and the rabbi, but they have found a common belief and mission: that pornography is harmful, and we \u2013 by which they mostly mean men \u2013 should be consuming much less of it, or at least not fuelling the demand for the viler, more degrading parts of it. </p> <p>On Saturday, Pamela Anderson, the most enduring sex symbol of recent times, and Shmuley Boteach, self-styled as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Rabbi\u201d, will <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1591269751180762/\">talk about this at the Oxford Union</a>. It follows a month of campaigning, which kicked off with <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/take-the-pledge-no-more-indulging-porn-1472684658\">an opinion piece they wrote</a> for the Wall Street Journal. </p> <p>They described porn, and its ubiquity online, as \u201ca public hazard of unprecedented seriousness\u201d that leads to the implosions of marriages, families and careers. Children, they said, are being \u201craised in an environment of wall-to-wall, digitised sexual images \u2026 [becoming] adults inured to intimacy and in need of even greater graphic stimulation. They are the crack babies of porn.\u201d</p> <p>They met when Anderson was being honoured by an organisation run by Boteach. \u201cWe celebrate and promote universal values and [people] who are attached to the state of Israel,\u201d he says, when we speak on the phone set while he and Anderson are being driven through London to <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/pamela-anderson-opens-up-sexual-9043886\">a TV studio</a>. \u201cPamela has been a very laudatory and complimentary spokesperson about Israel. We gave her an award.\u201d </p> <p>They became friends, and began talking about their feelings on relationships \u2013 and pornography\u2019s effect on them. Boteach is known in the US for his books on sex and relationships and appearances on TV. Together, they decided to launch what they are calling the \u201csensual revolution\u201d.<br></p> <p>Some may recognise Boteach. He has been criticised within the Jewish community, and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/03/04/shmuley-boteach-isnt-americas-rabbi/?utm_term=.6eac364d4b45\">by many fellow rabbis</a>, for his work on sexuality and theology alike, been investigated for the way his organisations use funds, and his seemingly immense appetite for self-promotion is not to everyone\u2019s tastes (he had his own reality show and has made numerous appearances on shows such as Oprah and Dr Oz; his book <a href=\"http://observer.com/2014/11/talking-lust-with-rabbi-boteach/\">Kosher Lust</a> was serialised in Playboy). And he has appeared at the Oxford Union before, in 2001, where he spoke alongside his friend Michael Jackson, to whom he acted as \u201cspiritual adviser\u201d. </p> <p>Anderson wasn\u2019t put off by Boteach\u2019s controversial, colourful past, she says. \u201cI love Rabbi Shmuley and everything he stands for. I\u2019ve learned a lot from him. He\u2019s very outspoken and he\u2019s in a position to do that and make powerful change. I respect him immensely.\u201d</p> <p>Since the WSJ piece, Anderson has been accused of hypocrisy, given that her entire career has been built on nude shots for Playboy, most recently in December, which was Playboy\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/11/playboy-last-nude-issue-pamela-anderson\">last issue to feature naked women</a>. \u201cPorn even killed Playboy,\u201d she says, though not everyone will weep.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6fe2e0de4eaa61d21ff938de68d50b7995ac2559\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fe2e0de4eaa61d21ff938de68d50b7995ac2559/23_127_1168_1258/928.jpg\" alt=\"Anderson and the \u2018hilariously good-looking cast\u2019 of Baywatch\" width=\"928\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anderson and the \u2018hilariously good-looking cast\u2019 of Baywatch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cine Text/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Anderson has always been clear about the distinction. According to the artist Marilyn Minter, who worked with her in 2006, she is \u201cthe opposite of Anna Nicole Smith and Marilyn Monroe \u2013 she owned her own sexual power\u201d. Anderson refuses to consider that Playboy is pornographic: \u201cI think it was titillating, innocent,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was highbrow \u2013 there was art and culture. </p> <p>\u201cWhen I went to the Playboy mansion I met great artists, intellectuals, people who were into philanthropy, art, music. I look at that as a fond memory but I understand \u2026 \u201d She pauses. \u201cThere are people who eat meat and become vegetarian \u2013 that doesn\u2019t make them hypocritical, that makes them a growing, evolving human being.\u201d </p> <p>But she says she doesn\u2019t regret her work for Playboy, because she views it as different from what is available online today. \u201cI do believe that internet porn is addictive, getting weirder and weirder, and darker, and I think it does lead to violence against women.\u201d</p> <p>Does she not think that something such as Playboy paved the way? \u201cIt might have, it opened the door, but we\u2019ve gone down this rabbit hole of dark pornography and it\u2019s getting worse and worse.\u201d Boteach joins in: \u201cSome people might try to disqualify her from this conversation, saying, \u2018You are someone who has been part of this culture and now you\u2019re criticising it\u2019, but the truth is who would know about the impact of that culture better than Pamela?\u201d</p> <p>Not that we should assume Anderson has had some kind of radical feminist epiphany (she has always refused to call herself a feminist), but she is undergoing something of a reinvention in other ways. </p> <p>Born in Canada, she was spotted at a football game in Vancouver and became the face of a beer company, before Hugh Hefner, the Playboy founder, asked her to move to LA and become a model. In 1992 she joined the hilariously good-looking cast of Baywatch, the successful show about Los Angeles County lifeguards, and Anderson became a global star. </p> <p>During the 1990s and early 2000s Anderson did a few films, but mainly appeared naked in Playboy and other men\u2019s magazines; in the tabloids she was better known for her turbulent marriages. Later, launching her own charitable foundation, she would talk about the sexual abuse she suffered as a child and young teenager.</p> <p>Now she is known as an activist as much as anything else. She has supported Peta for more than 20 years, and runs her own foundation. Presumably, like anyone hurled into celebrity at an early age, she has spent a lot of time since then figuring out how to carve something meaningful out of it. Luke Gilford, a young independent filmmaker, was struck by exactly this when he persuaded her to be in his short film, Connected, recently. </p> <p>\u201cI was interested in capturing this moment in time for her where she\u2019s this ageing sex symbol trying to find deeper meaning in her own life,\u201d he says. \u201cShe has a lot of ideas, a lot she has to say and a lot she has experienced. People don\u2019t realise how much there is to her.\u201d</p> <p>However curious her partnership with Shmuley, no one can deny that they\u2019re making their point at an opportune moment. Look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/14/donald-trump-women-misogyny-lifetime\">the tone of the US presidential campaign</a>, Anderson says. \u201cThere is this culture of men who speak this way about women.\u201d Shmuley adds: \u201cThere are men who are marinating in a culture of our portrayal of women. </p> <p>\u201cWe have to take a deeper examination of [that].\u201d Porn, he says, \u201ctrains men to see women as a means to an end. The idea of pornography is to portray women as a walking male orgasm, that women are there to stimulate men for sexual climax. This is part of addressing it. Not through censorship, but an honest conversation.\u201d</p> <p>This has become a subject Anderson feels strongly about. \u201cI think we should really look at ourselves and think is this affecting our relationships and causing a lack of intimacy? Because I\u2019m talking about having better sex, better loving relationships and more respect for women. I have two teenage sons and I want them to experience loving relationships and sensual experiences.\u201d </p> <p>In the past, she says, \u201cpeople assume, because of who I am, that I want [sex which is] wild, crazy, slapped around, called a whore. What is going on? I\u2019m here and telling people you can have beautiful, loving sex without the demeaning side of it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>I\u2019m a 34-year-old senior solutions architect at a global IT consultancy firm. This means I draw a lot of pretty pictures on whiteboards and do a lot of PowerPoint presentations. I\u2019m a former British soldier who spent five years on Her Majesty\u2019s payroll \u2013 but don\u2019t hold that against me. I joined the army after spending three years working in IT support and as a developer so, when I\u2019d done my time, coming back to that industry was the natural choice.</p> <p>To me it doesn\u2019t really feel like work, and being able to get paid to do something that you would consider a hobby is a real bonus.

In my spare time I do a lot of <a href=\"http://blog.edmorgan.info/\" title=\"\">technology blogging</a>, play the guitar, and voraciously read my way through books (sci-fi and fantasy from a fiction standpoint, and history, politics and technology from a non-fiction perspective). I am also attempting to get back in shape after too many years of idleness \u2013 unfortunately, my knees aren\u2019t what they used to be. They say the hardest thing about exercising is getting off the sofa, and I can vouch for that.</p> <p>I began reading the Guardian in my late teens. All papers have an agenda of some sorts, and the Guardian\u2019s aligns most closely with the majority of my sentiments. I am probably rare among Graun readers in that I also subscribe to the Times, because while I am very socially liberal my politics are more centrist than either of these papers, so it\u2019s nice to get a bit of balance sometimes. I really like the Guardian\u2019s investigative pieces \u2013 on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jan/28/wikileaks-julian-assange-alan-rusbridger\" title=\"\">WikiLeaks</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\" title=\"\">Panama Papers</a>, that sort of thing. The paper has brought a lot of things to light that would otherwise have stayed buried, and I applaud that. I&#xa0;also particularly enjoy its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/commentisfree\" title=\"\">opinion</a> pieces and the football coverage is excellent. Top marks to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/footballweekly\" title=\"\">Football Weekly podcast</a> crew as well.</p> <p>I follow the Twitter feed, and interact via both that, and the comment threads, though you have to be careful sometimes \u2013 that way madness lies.</p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 If you would like to be interviewed in this space, send a brief note to </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:good.to.meet.you@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>good.to.meet.you@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

From now on it\u2019s Aussie made Vegemite for me.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes there\u2019s a man \u2026 Sometimes there\u2019s a man. I can think of nothing in which the heroic self-harm of certain Brexiteers is more perfectly distilled than in Davies\u2019s political decision to eat Vegemite over Marmite. I don\u2019t think David likes Vegemite, I don\u2019t think he likes it one bit, or he\u2019d have been eating it for years. Like rugby or base speed, Vegemite isn\u2019t something you take up in your mid-40s. You picked a lane a long time ago, and that lane was Marmite.</p> <p>Last week, the British Election Study published <a href=\"http://www.britishelectionstudy.com/bes-resources/brexit-britain-british-election-study-insights-from-the-post-eu-referendum-wave-of-the-bes-internet-panel/#.WADz1DYrKrM\">fascinating post-referendum research</a> indicating that people identify more strongly as remain or leave than they do as supporters of any political party. I\u2019ve not done the deep-data study yet, but let\u2019s be clear: it\u2019s going to be even stronger, as far as Marmite or Vegemite goes.</p> <p>Furthermore, I am scientifically positive that if you\u2019d conducted a blind test and asked Davies which yeast extract he preferred, followed by \u2013 for example \u2013 which value of the pound he preferred, he\u2019d not only have been eating Marmite soldiers for ever but he\u2019d be assembling them in a little egg-side shrine to Brussels.</p> <p>But the test isn\u2019t blind, more\u2019s the pity. Consequently, Davies is going to eat Vegemite just as stubbornly as he\u2019s going to justify our journey down to dollar parity. He has proudly made eating Vegemite a political decision. Every mouthful is going to taste so good for just that reason \u2013 except it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s going to taste like Vegemite, which he must know is wrong, or certainly will do as time goes on. But after the fashion of the age, Davies is now post-fact, as far as yeast extracts are concerned.</p> <p>He can\u2019t be held responsible if this position allows for the rise of radical alternatives \u2013 the hideous spreading of Bovril, for instance, rather than the drinking of it. In fact, even down the line, when sustained experience of Vegemite becomes so inarguably unpleasant, Davies is not going to blame himself for the choice. You know who he\u2019s going to blame? Marmite, for driving him to it. Like I said, sometimes there\u2019s a man. Sometimes, there\u2019s a man \u2026 He fits right in there.</p>",

She wants Scotland to stay in the single market, even if the rest of the UK leaves as a result of Brexit, and although she reaffirmed that she believes this might result in Scotland having to hold a second independence referendum, she also spoke at some length about alternative options.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Sturgeon said she wanted to explore \u201ccreative\u201d solutions that might allow Scotland to stay in the single market, even if the rest of the UK leaves.</strong> She said she would be publishing detailed proposals soon. There were various options, she suggested.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The point I would make, and it\u2019s quite a fundamental point, is we are in unchartered territory here. Article 50 is the only rule that exists for what happens now. No country was every expected to ever want to leave the EU. So to some extent the UK as a whole is sitting with a blank sheet of paper. There is an ability to be creative, and to look at different options that respect how different parts of the UK voted. I think there are ways in which that can be done. </p> <p>I don\u2019t pretend, and I have never since the referendum pretended, that it will be straightforward or without challenges. And maybe we will find that none of these ways are possible, and that independence is the only option for Scotland to pursue. But we will try very hard to put other options on the table.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sturgeon did not give details about what these options might be. But she played down the suggestion that she might want to see a customs border go up between England and Scotland. She said the UK government was opposed to having a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and so she did not see the case for erecting one between England and Scotland. She also hinted that Iceland might be a possible model.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are options - for example the kind of option that Norway has. I was in Iceland at the weekend - [the option] that Iceland has of being in the single market but not in the European Union.</p> <p>Is that as good as full EU membership? In my view, no it\u2019s not. One of the downsides of it is that you have to abide by the rules without influencing the rules - but is it better than being outside the single market completely. Emphatically yes.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she wanted to keep Scotland in the single market.</strong> If it was not in the single market, there would be barriers to trade, she said, and that would be bad for the economy.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She said the debate about independence had changed since 2014 because Brexit had changed the balance of economic risk.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UK we voted to stay part of in 2014 is not the UK we now face the prospect of.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sturgeon said she accepted that the fall in the oil price created difficult questions for those backing Scottish independence. But she went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I absolutely accept that if Scotland is in another independence debate then there will be hard economic questions that will be asked that I and those advocating independence have a responsibility to answer.</p> <p>But this debate has changed since 2014. In 2014 those who argued against independence said it was about the economic certainty and stabililty of the UK versus the uncertainty of independence.</p> <p>What we have now in the UK, particularly if it comes out of the single market, is instability and uncertainty and lost economic growth. So this would be a debate about what gives Scotland the best prospect, not of having a magic wand about its economy, but of building the best economic future.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said the UK\u2019s budget deficit was likely to get worse because of Brexit.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it is very likely that the UK deficit is going to deteriorate because of the economic implications of Brexit.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She played down the fact that polls indicate a majority of Scots oppose independence.</strong> She said that when the last independence campaign started only 30% of Scots favoured independence, but the yes side eventually got 45% of the vote, she said.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She claimed it was \u201cinconceivable\u201d that Westminster would try to stop Scotland holding a second independence referendum if it wanted to have one. </strong>She said she had not heard Theresa May or anyone else in Westminster say they would stop Edinburgh holding a second independence referendum. </li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-14T12:25:38.772Z\">at 1.25pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-580083a7e4b047a4eaafc5a8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-14T07:30:56.084Z\">8.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I will post a summary of Sturgeon\u2019s Today interview soon.</p> <p>Here are some of the lines from some of the other interviews she has given this morning.

  "<p>As the days get shorter, I am reminded of the food we ate as children after coming home from school in the dark. My mother often made meatballs from the mince that was a stalwart of her weekly shop, and I loved to shape them for her. These days, I make larger ones than she did, mainly because it\u2019s quicker. The recipe is simple but incredibly good, packed with herbs and cheese.</p> <p>Eccles cakes are another dish I\u2019m often inspired to make after a trip home. In recent years, both <a href=\"https://www.stjohngroup.uk.com/smithfield/\">St John</a> in London and <a href=\"http://www.pumpstreetbakery.com\">Pump Street Bakery</a> in Orford, Suffolk, have reinvigorated the traditional recipe, making it even more mouth-watering. Do give them a whirl: you\u2019ll be in for a treat.</p> <h2><strong>Giant pork meatballs in tomato sauce</strong></h2> <p>I rinse the sauce off the tomatoes, to get rid of that tinny flavour, but use them just as they are, if you prefer. The shaped meatballs will benefit from 20-30 minutes in the fridge, but don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re pushed for time. Serves four.</p> <p><strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong><br><strong>3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced</strong><br><strong>3 400g cans plum tomatoes, drained</strong><br><strong>2 bay leaves</strong><br><strong>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong><br><strong>2 tbsp capers, rinsed of brine or salt</strong><br><strong>1-2 pinches brown sugar (optional)</strong></p> <p>For the meatball<br><strong>600g minced pork</strong><br><strong>2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp fresh sage leaves, finely chopped </strong><br><strong>1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves, finely chopped </strong><br><strong>1 small sprig fresh rosemary, leaves picked and finely chopped</strong><br><strong>60g fresh breadcrumbs</strong><br><strong>Zest of 1 lemon</strong><br><strong>1 heaped tbsp Dijon mustard</strong><br><strong>1 egg, beaten</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp olive oil</strong><br><strong>70g grated Parmesan</strong></p> <p>Make the tomato sauce first. Warm the oil in a deep pan on a medium-low heat, then gently fry the garlic just until it begins to colour at the edges. Add the tomatoes, breaking them up with a spoon, then stir in the bay leaves, season generously and leave to simmer gently for 45 minutes. Half an hour into the cooking, add the capers and taste the sauce \u2013 add a pinch or two of brown sugar, if you think it needs it, and a few tablespoons of water if the sauce looks too thick and dry. By the end, it should be thick and silky.</p> <p>While the sauce is cooking, get on with the meatballs. In a bowl, combine all the ingredients except the oil and half the Parmesan, season generously, then mix with your hands until well amalgamated. Heat a little oil in a large frying pan, then saute a teaspoon of the mix until cooked and check it\u2019s seasoned sufficiently. Shape the remaining meatball mix into eight balls then, if you have time, refrigerate them for 20-30 minutes, to firm up.</p> <p>Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Pour the remaining oil into the frying pan, heat over a medium-high flame, then lightly brown the meatballs on all sides. Transfer to a baking dish just large enough to hold them, pour on the sauce and toss gently to coat. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and bake for 20 minutes, until firm to the touch.</p> <p>Serve with wide pasta ribbons, perhaps with a rocket and parmesan salad on the side, dressed simply with extra-virgin olive oil and a squeeze of fresh lemon. Or, for a real treat, eat the meatballs on toast.</p> <h2><strong>Apple eccles cakes with apple caramel</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba658311ec47606f02870802c3a4fd447144daab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba658311ec47606f02870802c3a4fd447144daab/0_92_1881_1129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers\u2019 apple eccles cakes with apple caramel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers\u2019 apple eccles cakes with apple caramel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louise Hagger for the Guardian.

Makes about 16.</p> <p><strong>50g very soft butter, plus 1 knob extra</strong><br><strong>100g dark brown muscovado sugar</strong><br><strong>100g currants</strong><br><strong>4 eating apples, cored, peeled and coarsely grated</strong><br><strong>\u00bd tsp freshly ground nutmeg</strong><br><strong>1 tsp freshly ground allspice</strong><br><strong>A few pinches ground cinnamon</strong><br><strong>3 tbsp cider vinegar (or brandy)</strong><br><strong>2 375g blocks ready-made puff pastry, chilled</strong><br><strong>1 egg, beaten</strong><br><strong>40g caster sugar</strong></p> <p>Combine the butter, sugar, currants, apples, spices and vinegar in a bowl, leave to sit for 10 minutes, then strain through a sieve into a saucepan, squeezing out the juices. Add a pinch of salt to the apple mix. </p> <p>Heat the oven to 175C/350F/gas mark 4. Roll out the pastry to about 5mm thick and use a 10cm cookie cutter to cut out as many circles as you can (you should get about eight from each block). Spoon heaped tablespoons of apple mix into the centre of each pastry circle, then bring up the sides of the pastry over the top of the filling and pinch together the edges to seal. Flatten each cake by pressing it down firmly with a palm, turn over so the folds are at the bottom, then slash the top of each cake two or three times and brush all over with beaten egg. Put on a chilled baking tray, then put in the freezer for 30 minutes, to chill.</p> <p>You can now bag them and leave them in the freezer, to be cooked frozen whenever you want (just remove however many you want, brush again with beaten egg and cook as below, allowing a little longer in the oven because they\u2019ll be frozen solid to start with). To cook them straight away, brush with more egg, sprinkle with sugar and bake for 15 minutes, until golden and crisp. Leave the cakes to cool slightly and, while they are resting, simmer the juices for five to 10 minutes, until they\u2019ve reduced to a rich caramel. Stir in the extra knob of butter and serve with the warm cakes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/07/game-recipes-venison-buns-pigeon-lentil-mushroom-apple-thomasina-miers\">The weekend cook: Thomasina Miers\u2019 game recipes \u2013 steamed venison buns and pigeon with lentils</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>And for the rest of the week\u2026</h2> <p>I often make the meatballs in large batches, but only go as far as browning them before freezing them with their sauce in small bags, all ready to be baked straight from frozen \u2013 it\u2019s a great timesaving meal for the children.

  "<p>Brexit may have caused an anti-immigration buzz but a traveller from the continent has made the UK its new home: the viper\u2019s bugloss mason bee.</p> <p>The bee is common in the UK\u2019s European neighbours but has been discovered for the first time in this country, in a small park in Greenwich, London. </p> <p>\u201cI always have half an eye open, but I certainly didn\u2019t expect that,\u201d said David Notton, an insect expert at the Natural History Museum, who made the discovery in June. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a big bee, so, if it was new, I thought someone else would have already spotted it.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309013543_Viper%27s_Bugloss_Mason_Bee_Hoplitis_Hoplitis_adunca_new_to_Britain_Hymenoptera_Megachilidae_Megachilinae_Osmiini\">DNA tests confirmed the identity of the bee</a> - <em>Hoplitis adunca</em> - and Notton gave it a common name based on the plant it exclusively feeds on, a blue-flowering plant in the borage family called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echium_vulgare\">viper\u2019s bugloss</a>.</p> <p>Mason bees are solitary insects which nest in hollows in wood or plant stems and use mud to make walled compartments for their eggs. About 50 viper\u2019s bugloss mason bees are now in Greenwich, making use of nesting boxes in the park provided by the Land Trust.</p> <p>The viper\u2019s bugloss mason bee is an expert traveller, because it can nest in holes in vehicles and freight, and Notton said that was a likely way it had arrived in London.</p> <p>But he does not expect it to become widespread in the UK: \u201cIt needs a hot microclimate and it is at the edge of its [temperature] range\u201d in southern England. However, he said places such as Dungeness, Rye and Salisbury Plain, where viper\u2019s bugloss is common, could be settled by the bee in future.</p> <p>Notton has also recently discovered a new-to-the-UK digger wasp and spider wasp, with the academic papers confirming the finds due soon. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very good year,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The UK hosts 270 different types of bee, but only about half-a-dozen new species have been found in the last half-century. \u201cBut there are a lot of new insects turning up at the moment due to the globalisation of transport and possibly due to climate change making the UK warmer.\u201d The arrival of one unwelcome new immigrant, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/20/threat-honeybees-asian-hornet-arrival-uk-confirmed-defra-invasive-species\">Asian hornet, which preys on honeybees, was confirmed in September</a>.</p> <p>The viper\u2019s bugloss mason bee joins about 80 species of bee in the Greenwich park, but Notton said the situation is mixed for bees across Britain: \u201cSome bee species are doing OK, while others are struggling, with habitat change, climate change and pesticides all impacting the environment.\u201d</p>",

Did they mis-speak, were they misinterpreted \u2013 or was this indeed a premature outing of something that was then rapidly withdrawn?</p> <p>Sadly, it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll ever know.

All &quot;literature&quot; was originally oral. For example The Odyssey, Beowulf and The Mahabharata were sung to illiterate audiences by bards with highly trained memories....writing wasn\u2019t invented until 3000 BC. Dylan's had an impact on contemporary culture at least as great as Homer, I reckon. The effect is most obvious among other songwriters. But he has left an indelible mark on even the highest brow forms of art which is so pervasive that we can't see it clearly any longer. From my own limited reading I would argue Salman Rushdie, Thomas Pynchon, E. Annie Proulx, Martin Amis, David Foster Wallace and Cormac McCarthy all bear his stamp - just as the sponge-like Dylan has received and transmitted things from them. Someone today said imagine a gathering of survivors after McCarty's nuclear holocaust where all paper and electronic devices had gone up in smoke - they suggested people would find it easier to reconstruct Dylan songs from their memories than the output any star of contemporary &quot;literary&quot; London!</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-14T15:17:56.569Z\">at 4.17pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5800a6dae4b047a4eaafc5e8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/tobymoses\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-14T14:05:54.466Z\">3.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">An extract from Mariella Frostrup: put down the porn and explore real sex with erotica!</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>This week I commissioned an article from UK-based journalist and television presenter Mariella Frostrup on the resurgence of erotic writing. Here\u2019s an extract from her piece:</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Erotica is so different from pornography, which is almost exclusively designed to cater to men. Any relationship that existed between men and erotica dates back to the Victorian era when it was one of the few ways to access the sexy stuff. Now the tsunami of pornography has all but obliterated any particular interest the majority of men might have had in reading erotica. For women, sex is part of a whole sensory experience and I think that is less true of men. If you look at the pornography that has been designed to appeal to male viewers, particularly in the 21st century, it is very much about the physical act and very little else. That is why it is less satisfying for a lot of women.</p> <p>There\u2019s a huge difference between the perfunctory plots sometimes used in pornography and the experience of immersing yourself in a story, characters and a considered environment \u2013 all those elements of the intellectual exchange involved in reading. In pornography, the literal act is simply placed right before your eyes. It is skin deep and, increasingly in the modern world, what you\u2019re watching is the poor, dispossessed and desperate trying to earn a crust in whatever way they can. How many people who participate in porn do so because that\u2019s what they grew up wanting to do? The sex industry as a whole is a bit like the drug industry. It\u2019s an end product that involves an awful lot of misery for an awful lot of people along the way.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/porn-sex-erotica-erotic-writing\">Put down the porn and explore real sex with erotica | Mariella Frostrup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What do you think?

  "<h2>HELLO OLD FRIEND<br></h2> <p>The Fiver has simple dreams. We do not ask for much in life. A roof over our head, a pile of rags in the corner to sleep in, and a steady supply of Tin to block out the worst of the darkness. Sometimes, if we\u2019re lucky, we\u2019ll find a half-eaten sandwich in a skip for sustenance, before realising it\u2019s not in fact a skip but rather a pop-up pulled pork emporium, and a hipster wearing half a hat and an ironic Mel and Kim T-shirt holding out his tattooed hand and asking for \u00a313.50.</p> <p>Another of the simple things in life we ask for is, for a couple of days at least, to be free from the dull fridge-buzz that is discussion of England, Wayne Rooney, or England and Wayne Rooney.

For the interminable grind of international football is gone (for a bit) and the interminable grind of domestic football is here again. So what have we got in store? Well, for a start, Claudio Ranieri will briefly pause being a football manager and become a walking art exhibit, the theme being \u2018Living Well Is The Best Revenge\u2019, as he returns to Stamford Bridge as Premier League champion, contented and happy. Meanwhile, his old employers Chelsea wrestle with their confused identity, and the horrible sensation of not being able to cope without Plain Old John Terry, 76, despite their desperation to cast aside this crutch but being unable to, like Tony Soprano and Dr Melfi. Elsewhere in London Bob Bradley, a man with a stare that could slice through kevlar, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/14/swansea-city-bob-bradley-premier-league-first-american-arsenal\">takes charge of his first Swansea game</a>, at Arsenal.

Nothing fancy, just \u201cRonald says hi, and have you changed your phone number by the way because I\u2019m having trouble getting hold of you?\u201d Then in Stoke there\u2019s the Ennui Derby, as Sunderland come to town, where both David Moyes and Ailsa from Home and Away can swap stories about being canned by either side of Manchester, just to take their minds of things really. Tottenham play West Brom for the first time since <em>that</em><strong> </strong>second half at the back end of last season, when the bottom abruptly dropped out of their season and the wheels flamboyantly came off. Presumably Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s main concern is that his players have got over their PTSD from that one. And then there\u2019s Crystal Palace v West Ham, where Handsome Pards will dance around his vanquished opponent before belatedly remembering there might be a job going at the FA soon, and he could do with maintaining some dignity. Still, when you\u2019re the king, you can do what you want.</p> <p>Last but almost certainly least, Mike Phelan, bless him, has finally been told he can take his coat off and stay at Hull, safe in the knowledge that he was definitely the club\u2019s first choice and they absolutely weren\u2019t just making doubly sure they couldn\u2019t get anyone better in. He\u2019ll celebrate with a trip to the south coast, where Bournemouth will be waiting. So there we go. That should keep the darkness at bay for a couple of days. Until Monday when everyone starts talking about Rooney again. Oh god.</p> <h2>BREAKING NEWS</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/14/footballer-ched-evans-cleared-of-in-retrial\">Ched Evans has been found not guilty</a> at his retrial of raping a 19-year-old waitress in a hotel room after a drunken night out with former club-mates. Evans spent two and a half years in prison for rape but his original conviction was quashed by the appeal court following a high-profile and well-funded campaign by family and friends that included the offer of a \u00a350,000 reward for information leading to his acquittal. In a statement read outside the court by his solicitor, Evans said he was \u201coverwhelmed with relief\u201d following the verdict. He thanked his friends and family, \u201cmost notably my fiancee, Natasha, who chose, perhaps incredibly, to support me in my darkest hour\u201d. Evans stood by his lawyer shaking as the statement concluded: \u201cWhile my innocence has now been established, I wish to make it clear that I wholeheartedly apologise to anyone who might have been affected by the events of the night in question.\u201d</p> <p>The appeal was allowed after judges gave the go-ahead for two former sexual partners of the alleged victim to give explicit evidence in court about her sex life, a rare move that is being widely condemned by women\u2019s support groups and campaigners. One group, Women Against Rape (WAR), told the Guardian the decision \u201cdrove a coach and horses\u201d through legislation designed to protect victims and could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/14/campaigners-fear-evans-case-will-stop-women-reporting\">stop other abused women coming forward</a> for fear they would be quizzed about their sex lives.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cForty-eight hours between two games \u2013 how does this work?

Simply expand the World Cup finals to all 209 eligible national teams so it\u2019s really super-inclusive but remove the boring old qualification phase. The catch is that you might need to extend the tournament window from four weeks to probably around two or three years, and possibly play the tournament games on a more global basis. Although, here\u2019s a thought, to make it extra special you take the final 32 teams and make them play in a host country for a short period. In practice this bit might need more thought\u201d \u2013 James Nott.</p> <p>\u201cFar be it from me to defend the new-again manager of Derby County, but Steve McClaren didn\u2019t really drive their form over a cliff, Thelma and Louise-style (yesterday\u2019s Fiver), last time he was there. In his first season he got them to the play-off final, where they should really have beaten QPR, and the next season they missed out on the play-offs in the last match of the season (admittedly having had a less-than-perfect run-in) after which he was invited to calculate the square root of one, then do it. Mind you, if his second-coming at FC Twente is anything to go by, the same calculation is likely to be called for by the end of this season. Still, Sunderland will probably be looking for a manager by then, giving him the chance to manage a third north-east club, before completing his clean sweep at Hartlepool\u201d \u2013 Martyn Wilson.</p> <p>\u201cAll the fans on Twitter getting irate about Anthony Taylor living too close to one of the teams playing in Monday night\u2019s Liverpool v Manchester United match (yesterday\u2019s Bits and Bobs) are absolutely right to do so.

Also inscrutable, and just as terrifying, is the devious ship\u2019s computer, HAL 9000, which disobeys its orders to protect human life when it fears it might be switched off forever. </p> <p>Does Obama fear the machine hegemony?

Its vision of alien life as shiny little big-eyed celestial stick-men is so cliched as to be almost unwatchable in 2016, and it is a deeply impersonal fantasy of first contact. Obama might have picked ET \u2013 just as heart-warming but far more timeless (as the success of Netflix\u2019s Stranger Things proved recently) \u2013 instead. Spielberg\u2019s later film would be far less likely to bore his family into an early snooze on a Saturday evening, while waiting for the darned alien mothership to stop clanging out the incessant five-note sequences and show us what its occupants look like already.</p> <h2>Star Wars (George Lucas, 1977)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gvqpFbRKtQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9gvqpFbRKtQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Lucas\u2019s late 70s blockbuster is a controversial inclusion because it is really pulp-inspired space fantasy, rather than science fiction. Obama chose this one \u201cbecause it was fun and revolutionized special effects\u201d \u2013 but might there also be parallels between the movie\u2019s hero, Luke Skywalker, and the president himself? Both rose from humble beginnings in provincial backwaters (though Tatooine does not look a whole lot like Hawaii) to become the great hope of their respective organisations. Both also built up a habit of winning, though despite what certain rightwing syndicated radio hosts might privately believe, only one is capable of sinister mind control.</p> <h2>Star Trek The Original Series <strong>(1966-69)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8bY619HLQc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/k8bY619HLQc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Another fruit of Apollo-era optimism, Gene Roddenberry\u2019s space saga was chosen by Obama because it \u201cwasn\u2019t actually about technology.

William Shatner\u2019s famous embrace with Nichelle Nichols was also one of the first instances of a white man kissing an African American woman on US TV, a moment we can imagine registering with a president who has broken down a few barriers himself.</p> <h2>The Martian (Ridley Scott, 2015)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej3ioOneTy8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ej3ioOneTy8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Chosen because it \u201cshows humans as problem solvers\u201d, according to the president. As a keen reader of Emerson\u2019s 1841 essay Self Reliance, Obama will surely have appreciated the story of an ingeniously practical astronaut who survives for years on the red planet by growing potatoes lovingly incubated in his own faeces. And after several periods during his eight years in office when the president\u2019s political ambitions were stymied by the glacial pace of government machinery, he will no doubt have found himself nodding approvingly at the stolid heroism of a man who (despite being left for dead millions of miles from the nearest human being) simply knuckled down and got on with the job.</p> <h2>The Matrix (<strong>Lana and Lilly </strong>Wachowski, 1999) </h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKQi3bBA1y8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vKQi3bBA1y8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>A topical one, this, with the concept that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/11/simulated-world-elon-musk-the-matrix\">we might all be living in an incredibly complex simulation</a> finding genuine traction in some corners of the scientific community. Obama chose the Wachowskis\u2019 cerebellum-twisting techno-fantasy \u201cbecause it asks basic questions about our reality \u2013 and looks very cool\u201d.

They were handed over to the government at a remote location in northern Nigeria.</p> <p> Boko Haram has waged a violent insurgency in the north of Africa\u2019s most populous nation for seven years. </p> <p>The kidnapping of the girls brought the group international infamy and led to the global campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2014/may/09/bringbackourgirls-power-of-social-media\">#BringBackOurGirls</a>, which featured public figures including the US first lady, Michelle Obama.</p> <p>Officials have confirmed that the Swiss government provided mediators during negotiations, while the International Committee of the Red Cross provided medical assistance during the transfer of the girls.</p> <p> Security experts say it is unlikely the girls would have been released by the group, which has split into two major factions, without a \u201csignificant incentive\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cffcc702fd88770f59710e05b0a848d5202dca3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cffcc702fd88770f59710e05b0a848d5202dca3/0_129_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A demonstration calling on the Nigerian government to rescue the Chibok girls.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A demonstration calling on the Nigerian government to rescue the Chibok girls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olamikan Gbemiga/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> A Nigerian hostage negotiator not involved in Thursday\u2019s release told the Associated Press a \u201chandsome ransom\u201d worth millions of dollars was paid by Switzerland\u2019s government on behalf of Nigerian authorities.</p> <p> Military officers initially told the Guardian the 21 girls were swapped for four detained Boko Haram leaders. Those statements were later denied by civilian officials. </p> <p> Yemi Osinbajo, the vice-president of Nigeria,<a href=\"http://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2016/10/14/in-a-cash-for-girls-deal-govt-celebrates-return-of-21-chibok-girls/\"> told reporters </a>there had been no exchange, although he did not comment on the reports of a ransom. \u201cAbsolutely, there was no exchange of any kind,\u201d Osinbajo said.</p> <p>However, he did not rule out such exchanges in the future, saying the government would \u201cconsider all options available\u201d and that he was confident there would be further releases soon \u201cusing exactly the same kind of negotiations and the same template\u201d.</p> <p> At least two previous rounds of negotiations to free the Chibok girls have failed, <a href=\"http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/212732-untold-story-deal-yielded-rescue-21-chibok-girls.html\">reportedly due to Boko Haram\u2019s demands for huge sums of money </a>and the opposition of Nigeria\u2019s military to any deal. </p> <p> Splits within the movement have also proved an obstacle to any deal. In recent months, Boko Haram has fractured into two, possibly three factions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/06/isis-al-qaida-turf-wars-africa-may-push-fragile-states-to-breaking-point\">over the issue of links with Islamic State</a>.</p> <p> Isis, of which the Nigerian group is still theoretically an affiliate, announced last month that Abu Musab al-Barnawi was Boko Haram\u2019s new leader, replacing the erratic Abubakar Shekau. The decision may have been prompted by Shekau\u2019s use of female suicide bombers and targeting of Muslims.</p> <p>However, it is Shekau who is holding the Chibok girls. A video released of some of the girls in August seemed to have come from Shekau\u2019s camp somewhere in the remote Sambisa forest, in Borno state in north-eastern Nigeria. It showed about 50 of the girls and included a demand for the release of imprisoned militants in exchange for them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f07ff65c19f5eaff2c4008040fa323cb50e5f35d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f07ff65c19f5eaff2c4008040fa323cb50e5f35d/42_0_1098_659/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Video posted by Boko Haram shows a masked man talking to dozens of girls the group said were from Chibok.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Video posted by Boko Haram shows a masked man talking to dozens of girls the group said were from Chibok.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shekau is thought to be short of manpower, funds, ammunition and other vital supplies.</p> <p> Ryan Cummings, a security analyst in South Africa, said it was very unlikely Boko Haram would have released any hostages without a significant reward. \u201cWhy hold the girls for two years and then release them for nothing? It simply doesn\u2019t make sense \u2026 and is totally contrary to what we know about the group,\u201d Cummings said.</p> <p> There is evidence the Nigerian government and Boko Haram have conducted previous prisoner exchanges. In the initial stages of the insurgency the group swapped captured military personnel for its own combatants or family members seized by the Nigerian army.</p> <p> There have also been a series of kidnappings of westerners in Nigeria, some by extremists, resolved when, it is believed, significant ransom payments were paid by western governments.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the region, kidnapping for ransom has generated huge funds for militant groups such as al-Qaida in the Maghreb. </p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know the details yet but a series of such deals could have the potential to regenerate the group,\u201d said Cummings. </p> <p> Few details have emerged of the ordeal of the abducted girls, many of whom are believed to have been taken as wives by extremists and systematically raped. Others have reportedly been forced to carry out demanding physical tasks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba1a49ed1c4af6bb8a7771a9e23f1276227e9574\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba1a49ed1c4af6bb8a7771a9e23f1276227e9574/0_79_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Nigerian president, Muhammadu Buhari, vowed to crush Boko Haram within a year of his taking power.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Nigerian president, Muhammadu Buhari, vowed to crush Boko Haram within a year of his taking power.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: POOL/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>About 190 girls from Chibok are still held by the militants.

  "<p>You can just imagine the looks on Warner Bros executives\u2019 faces when JK Rowling presented them with the curate\u2019s egg that is Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Yes, she would deliver more stories set in the wizarding world of Harry Potter for a new trilogy of movies. No, there would be no more adventures for Harry himself, nor Ron, nor Hermione (at least on the big screen). Indeed, the new stories would not even be set in the UK, a location that always seemed perfect for Rowling\u2019s very British blend of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/enid-blyton\">Blytonesque</a> boarding school whimsy and darkling magical intrigue. </p> <p>The biggest takeaway from last night\u2019s global Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them fan event \u2013 more than a dozen cities around the world vying to outscream each other in a satellite-linked outpouring of devotion to a movie no one has seen yet \u2013 might just be that the Boy Who Lived was not, after all, the star of the show. Looking around in the auditorium of the plush Cineworld Empire Imax in Leicester Square, it\u2019s apparent that pretty much nobody is dressed up as Potter. But there are witchy flappers \u2013 in tribute to the new film\u2019s setting 1920s New York \u2013 zillions of Newt Scamanders (Eddie Redmayne\u2019s nerdy, bright-eyed oddball hero and owner of the titular monsters) and even a few dressed up as Jacob Kowalski, the portly \u201cNo-Maj\u201d (the American version of the Muggle) played by Dan Fogler.</p> <p>And when the author \u2013 and debut screenwriter \u2013 suddenly joins Redmayne, pals Katherine Waterston (Porpentina) and Alison Sudol (Queenie) and Fogler on stage, everything comes into focus. Rowling, not Potter, is the star, and she\u2019s built up such a remarkable repository of trust with her fans that they are ready and willing to lap up everything she sends their way. I think they\u2019re probably right to be confident.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6599a4ea17b39c29c5b6539b1559efa3c0b59d58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6599a4ea17b39c29c5b6539b1559efa3c0b59d58/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eddie Redmayne \u2013 AKA Newt Scamander \u2013 attends the fan event.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eddie Redmayne \u2013 AKA Newt Scamander \u2013 attends the fan event.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian West/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There may have been wobbles along the way \u2013 including the rather embarrassing moment when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/09/jk-rowling-under-fire-for-appropriating-navajo-tradition-history-of-magic-in-north-america-pottermore\">the British author found herself accused of cultural appropriation by a blogger on Native American culture</a> \u2013 but Rowling\u2019s attention to detail in the buildup to Fantastic Beasts\u2019 release has gone way beyond Hollywood\u2019s usual standards. Her Pottermore site is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/08/jk-rowling-casts-fresh-spells-in-new-stories-for-pottermore\">filled with original writing</a> on the North American wizarding world, its native beasties, peculiar witchy culture and history of conflict between the magical and non-magical populations. This feeds into belief that Scamander\u2019s story is not merely a money-spinning contrivance for Warner Bros to continue a series that stands behind the Marvel superhero films as the second highest-grossing franchise of all time. Rather, the feeling is that this is a bona fide JK Rowling creation to rival her Potter work, and, crucially, one written directly for the screen.</p> <p>Waterston suggested the writer\u2019s eye for detail ran through every aspect of Fantastic Beasts\u2019 production, even down to the key magical trio\u2019s choice of wands.</p> <p>\u201cThey were so genuinely interested in what each of us had to say,\u201d she gushed. \u201cI got an email with five options for a wand. I picked the one I wanted, but it was too light, so they went back, fixed it. I thought, my God, I\u2019ll have a banana split! It\u2019s extremely rare to get that detail in a movie of this scale.\u201d</p> <p>Keeping this focus on the finer points of wizarding aesthetics will be key if Fantastic Beasts is to survive what looks set to be a rapid expansion in scope. Rowling revealed the saga will now stretch to at least five movies \u2013 Potter made it to eight, lest we forget \u2013 with each instalment likely to see Newt visiting a new major city. The prospect of a glimpse into magical culture around the globe is certainly tantalising, and suggests the new saga may eventually move beyond Rowling\u2019s previous series in terms of scale.</p> <p>The franchise is also due to see the return of a young Albus Dumbledore, and there will be a prominent role in the films for his great rival and one-time friend, Gellert Grindelwald. The latter\u2019s presence looks like it will be clearly felt in Fantastic Beasts, though perhaps as the kind of background threat that Voldemort presented in the early Potter books and movies.</p> <p>\u201cWe do mention Dumbledore in this movie, and he features a little bit in a wonderful scene between Colin [Farrell] and Eddie [Redmayne],\u201d teased director David Yates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3596bc8c5fbbc056ec4e521948ad4df882440c19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3596bc8c5fbbc056ec4e521948ad4df882440c19/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Redmayne in Fantastic Beasts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Redmayne in Fantastic Beasts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jaap Buitendijk/2016 Warner Bros/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile Farrell, who plays high-ranking <a href=\"http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Auror\">auror</a> and director of US magical security Percival Graves, dropped the biggest hint yet that his character might have Death Eater-style prejudice towards the non-magical population. \u201cIf there is a superior race, it\u2019s not the No-Majs in his mind,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The event climaxed with attendees being shown the first 10 minutes of the movie itself. It opens with an operatic, Potter-style montage of newspaper headlines, detailing Grindelwald\u2019s attacks in Europe and the growing threat to North America\u2019s magical population from Samantha Morton\u2019s grim-browed Mary Lou and her witch-hating Second Salemers. Scamander himself is barely mentioned, but we\u2019re soon on to the arrival of Redmayne\u2019s charming, eccentric \u201cmagizoologist\u201d in New York, looking the very definition of young fogey chic, with briefcase, waistcoat, bow tie and long coat, a touch of Tom Baker-era Doctor Who about him. Suffice to say it\u2019s not long before the beasts are starting to escape \u2013 the platypus-like Niffler, with a love for shiny things, is the first to venture out of Newt\u2019s Tardis-like briefcase.</p> <p>Will Rowling really be able to stretch the saga to five movies? Fantastic Beasts\u2019 structural furniture already looks more tricky than that of the Potter films, which simply set up Voldemort\u2019s nemesis for a new adventure in every school year. Surely Scamander won\u2019t lose all his monsters every time he turns up somewhere new? As a creative device that could get pretty old pretty quickly.</p> <p>But in a Hollywood beset by weak sequels, remakes and failing cinematic universes, Rowling\u2019s presence is a comforting one. She cares about these characters, their motivations, their backgrounds, the worlds in which they live. She is unlikely to be told what to do by meddling studio execs, and this time around there are no troublesome books to be adapted, no details to be dispensed with to fit running times, and no deeply green young actors heroically doing their best in almost impossible circumstances.</p> <p>All the indications so far are that Rowling\u2019s fans are probably right to be excited about the prospect of more quirky high adventure in the rapidly expanding Potterverse. The magic might just be back. </p>",

  "<p>Many of the areas that have been recently marked as potential sites for fracking are rich in wildlife that perform crucial functions from pollination to decomposition, researchers have found.</p> <p>Scientists say that almost two-thirds of the areas that have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/17/fracking-uk-government-hands-out-new-licences\">labelled as suitable for shale gas extraction</a> have levels of biodiversity equal to or above the national average, according to a new analysis of records collected from across the country.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of the areas that have opened up to shale gas licensing actually harbour much higher than average levels of biodiversity,\u201d said Tom Oliver, of University of Reading who is a senior author of the <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.12784/abstract\">study</a> in the Journal of Applied Ecology. \u201cWe only have one natural heritage and we have to protect it and so using these data to highlight those very valuable sites and to facilitate their protection is hopefully a useful thing to do.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/13/british-public-support-for-fracking-sinks-to-lowest-ever-level\">British public support for fracking sinks to lowest ever level</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The study, which analysed previously collected records of more than 5,500 species, including those of birds, plants and butterflies, found that 65.3% of proposed areas that have been designated suitable for fracking have levels of biodiversity equal to or above the national average, including parts of Lancashire and South Wales.</p> <p>After dividing Britain up into squares, measuring 10km by 10km, the records, which were made by volunteers between 1970 and 2013, were assessed, taking into account the climate and geology of the area, as well as variations in the thoroughness of the recordings, thereby allowing different locations to be given a rating for their biodiversity, and compared to each other. The results are available to explore in an interactive <a href=\"https://eip.ceh.ac.uk/apps/ecostatus/\">digital map</a>.</p> <p>The scientists say the approach offers a new, fine-grained approach to looking at biodiversity across Britain. That, adds Oliver, will help, \u201cto inform the location of large infrastructure projects or ecological restoration work\u201d.</p> <p>The study also looked at how biodiversity had changed over time, focussing on changes between two time periods, 1970-1990 and 2000-2013. While in many areas the decline in the presence of protected species mirrored that of biodiversity more widely, in others that was not the case.</p> <p>\u201cThat wider biodiversity is still really important for a whole range of functions \u2013 pollination and pest control and decomposition \u2013 and also just the species that people really value seeing in the environment,\u201d said Oliver. \u201c[Priority species] are often used as indicators in these environmental assessments and we\u2019re showing that actually our new method allows us to incorporate a whole suite of other species, thousands of more common species, which are just as important really.\u201d</p> <p>The RSPB welcomed the research.<strong> </strong> \u201cThis is an important piece of research that uses the UKs wealth of biodiversity data collected by volunteers to add to our understanding of the risks that come with fracking.\u201d said Abi Bunker, the RSPB\u2019s head of policy and advocacy.<strong> \u201c</strong>The RSPB has long been concerned that fracking could pose risks to wildlife, and that\u2019s why we campaigned for and welcomed a Government ban on fracking in Sites of Special Scientific Interest and other designated areas in England and Wales. However, this new evidence shows that fracking could still put sensitive wildlife and habitats at risk and that stronger regulation is needed before fracking goes ahead.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson from the<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy\"> Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy said</a>: \u201cWe have more than 50 years of drilling experience in the UK and one of the best records in the world for economic development while protecting our environment and the public.</p> <p>\u201cAny company that wants to carry out fracking must conduct an assessment of the impact on the environment and habitats, and earlier this year we brought in extra protections so that fracking could not take place in a number of protected areas that are home to wildlife.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Clayton Kershaw is the greatest pitcher of his time so why wouldn\u2019t he want to finish one of the greatest playoff games in recent memory?</p> <p>He stood in the Los Angeles Dodgers dugout in the eighth inning of Thursday\u2019s already draining Game 5 of a draining National League Division Series against Washington and wondered how possibly the team\u2019s closer Kenley Jansen could pitch three innings when he was accustomed to only throwing one. He had made 211 pitches in the previous seven days, just weeks after returning from a back injury that once threatened to end his season. In Tuesday\u2019s Game 4 he had pitched seven innings. If there was one certainty in Game 5, it was that he wouldn\u2019t be a part of it.</p> <p>And so of course he was.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/14/clayton-kershaw-dodgers-beat-nationals-mlb\">Clayton Kershaw gets first major league save as Dodgers clinch spot in NLCS</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There will be no sane explanation for how the Dodgers won their NLDS series with the Nationals with a 4-3 victory in Game 5 to book a date with the Chicago Cubs. Such an attempt would be folly. No one can have a reasonable justification for Jansen throwing more pitches than he has in his career as he got the Dodgers out of a seventh-inning jam, heaved through the eighth and then into the ninth with a fastball that was dying in the roar of more than 40,000 desperate Nationals fans. And who dare suggest Kershaw, making $35m a year, would risk everything for the night\u2019s final two outs? But thats\u2019s why he\u2019s the game\u2019s greatest pitcher and why Thursday\u2019s Game 5 was one of the best playoff games we will ever see.</p> <p>\u201cAt times you think what more can (Kershaw) do to wow you and there it is,\u201d Dodgers catcher Yasmani Grandal said.</p> <p>Grandal stood in a puddle of champagne and beer in the visitors\u2019 clubhouse and laughed. Around him liquor dripped from the ceiling and Kershaw was still being embraced by joyous teammates almost an hour after the game.</p> <p>\u201cIt kind of shows you who he is,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Early Thursday afternoon Dodgers president Andrew Friedman had discussed with manager Dave Roberts and other team executives the many scenarios that could happen that night. None of them included Kershaw pitching. That much was sure. LA was out of serviceable starting pitchers, their bullpen was strained and they hadn\u2019t figured out a way to stop the Nats\u2019 top hitter, Daniel Murphy. But never did they dare consider using Kershaw on Thursday. They weren\u2019t that foolish. Nobody would risk the franchise\u2019s future on the last game of a first-round playoff series.</p> <p>Then the game started and things went bad. Starting pitcher Rich Hill couldn\u2019t finish the third. Relievers came and relievers went. Jansen came into the game into an endless seventh during which the Dodgers took a 4-1 lead and immediately saw it cut to 4-3 on a Chris Heisey pinch-hit home run. He groaned through the seventh and headed out for the eighth. This is when Kershaw approached Dodgers pitching coach Rick Honeycutt in the dugout and asked: \u201cIs the plan to pitch Kenley for three innings?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the plan,\u201d Honeycutt said.</p> <p>\u201cI can go,\u201d Kershaw said, explaining that his arm and back felt strong and he normally threw on the side two days after pitching anyway.</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Honeycutt replied.</p> <p>Kershaw stalked over to manager Dave Roberts. Honeycutt could see the two men talking: Kershaw pleading, Roberts shaking his head. Even from a distance Honeycutt could read the manager\u2019s lips: \u201cNo, no, no!\u201d Still Kershaw didn\u2019t listen. He left the dugout, went to the clubhouse, changed into spikes, stretched and came back to the bench. He went to Roberts again, who could see Jansen laboring on his way to an outlandish 51 pitches. The Nats\u2019 best hitters were coming up in the ninth and the game\u2019s top pitcher was begging to finish them off. What could he say? He sent Kershaw to the bullpen with the mandate that if Murphy (the inning\u2019s fourth hitter) came up, Kershaw was going in.</p> <p>At the time, Jansen thought he was going to have to pitch all three innings. He would later say he wasn\u2019t tired but his vicious cut fastball was losing velocity. He was fading. He walked through the dugout and into the tunnel toward the clubhouse where Grandal had been sitting for more than an hour, after leaving the game, afraid that doing so would jinx the team. Jansen looked at a television and was stunned to see Kershaw warming up.</p> <p>\u201cI was like: \u2018Am I dreaming?\u2019\u201d he said after the game.</p> <p>No, it was real. Clayton Kershaw \u2013 he of the three Cy Young Awards and a herniated disk in his back \u2013 was firing fastballs in the Dodgers\u2019 bullpen.</p> <p>\u201cI knew he had my back,\u201d Jansen said.</p> <p>After the game Kershaw would say never was sure he\u2019d get into the game. Watching from the stands, Friedman was certain Roberts was using the game\u2019s top pitcher as a decoy. But after Jansen got the first batter in the ninth, he walked Bryce Harper and Jayson Werth to bring up Murphy. Roberts climbed from the dugout and called for Kershaw. Nowhere did it occur to Kershaw he was doing something dumb, that he was not only straining his back he was taking himself from the running to pitch Game 1 of the National League Championship Series in Chicago should the Dodgers win. His lone thought was: \u201cI sure hope I get (Murphy) out.\u201d</p> <p>Murphy popped out to second on Kershaw\u2019s second pitch. Pinch hitter Wilmer Dilfo was overwhelmed by two fastballs, a slider and a curve, striking out to end the game. Kershaw leaped in the air and the Dodgers players buried him on the mound. Kershaw\u2019s postseason struggles are well-known, though also overblown. He has a 4.79 ERA in 16 playoff games but many of those runs were actually allowed by relievers who couldn\u2019t finish teams off. It was such failures earlier this week that led to Jansen trying to pitch three innings and Kershaw having to get the final two outs.</p> <p>\u201cThat was a little off-script,\u201d Friedman later joked about Kersahaw\u2019s being in Thursday\u2019s game.</p> <p>But on a team that plays just a few miles from Hollywood, it was exactly the rewrite the Dodgers needed. They have won four straight National League West titles and until Thursday they had just one series win to show for it. They celebrated the Game 5 victory like the end of a World Series because in a way it was. Beating the Cubs seems a like a longshot given the disarray of LA\u2019s starting rotation and the fact Jansen pitched more than two innings Thursday. Kershaw bailed them out. Jansen against Murphy would have been a bad matchup. Not the way Jansen was going. Only Kershaw could have saved them.</p> <p>Then he did.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m really tired,\u201d Jansen said after the game dropping to the floor of a hallway near the clubhouse.</p> <p>The Dodgers needed Kershaw to do the unimaginable. He pitched for the third time in seven days. He got the Dodgers to the Cubs. They can figure out the rotation at some point. He had to get them to the weekend and he did it when no one expected it. He pitched when he shouldn\u2019t have, risking everything and then he won. That\u2019s why he\u2019s the greatest pitcher of his time.</p>",

Having insisted his goalkeepers are not on trial at Anfield, and the potential ramifications of demoting a young player without good cause, Klopp must be inclined to keep faith as he builds for the present and future.</p> <p>Liverpool\u2019s manager has no reservations over Karius\u2019s temperament or pedigree, as evidenced by one of the most important selection calls of his 12-month tenure. \u201cHe was a really strong Bundesliga goalkeeper, that means a lot,\u201d Klopp has explained. \u201cGermany is a goalkeeper country. We have no issue with goalkeepers. The best keeper plays at Bayern Munich and is German. We always had good ones, maybe not always the best in the world but good ones. The mentality is we like this job. The kids like to wear gloves. It\u2019s good to be in goal for a Bundesliga team.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>High-profile mistakes against the club\u2019s fierce rivals are not easily forgotten</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Karius was ever-present as Mainz finished an impressive sixth in the Bundesliga last season, his third as the club\u2019s first-choice goalkeeper. Only the top three \u2013 Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen \u2013 conceded fewer goals than Mainz\u2019s 42 and, in a poll conducted among his fellow professionals, Liverpool\u2019s recruit was voted second best in the division behind the formidable Manuel Neuer. Not one of Karius\u2019s 93 appearances for Mainz, however, carried the same level of scrutiny or global fascination as a fourth competitive outing for Liverpool will do on Monday.</p> <p>Liverpool v United represents a test of nerve as well as ability and, as Jerzy Dudek and David James can testify, high-profile mistakes against the club\u2019s fierce rivals are not easily forgotten. That said, a goalkeeper\u2019s debut in the fixture is not always an accurate gauge of the career to come. Massimo Taibi was the man of the match on his first appearance for United, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/sep/11/newsstory.sport6\" title=\"\">a 3-2 win at Anfield in September 1999</a>.</p> <p>However, Karius demonstrated strength of character long before Klopp signed him to exert overdue pressure on, and replace, Mignolet. The former Stuttgart youth-team goalkeeper had to overcome a problematic start at Mainz before establishing himself as the No1 at the age of 20. \u201cI saw his way,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cHe had a bad start at Mainz, when no one wanted him, to become an outstanding goalkeeper.\u201d</p> <p>The Biberach-born goalkeeper spent two years at Manchester City\u2019s academy \u2013 he remains friends with Mario Balotelli from their time together at the Etihad \u2013 before choosing to leave in pursuit of first-team football at Klopp\u2019s old club. A single-minded approach to his career was evident again in the summer when he rejected an invitation to represent his country at the Olympics to press his claims at Anfield instead. Innate self-confidence was also on display when he sat down with journalists at Melwood shortly after signing a five-year contract with Liverpool. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t come here just to sit on the bench,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a keeper who hasn\u2019t shown his ability. I know I am a good goalkeeper and I\u2019ve shown that a lot.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c19ebe24dabb542075e4d8c02168c638fbde059\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c19ebe24dabb542075e4d8c02168c638fbde059/184_70_6270_3763/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester United's Massimo Taibi keeps out another effort by Liverpool in 1999.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Massimo Taibi was man of the match against Liverpool in 1999 but his Manchester United career then petered out.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Noble/PA Archive/PA Photos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thanks to Liverpool\u2019s fine form \u2013 and Swansea\u2019s woeful finishing at the Liberty Stadium a fortnight ago \u2013 Karius has had little opportunity to show the credentials that ousted Mignolet from the No1 spot, despite the Belgium international\u2019s impressive reaction to the improved competition.

Hull and Swansea scored from corners that Liverpool failed to clear at the first attempt and their susceptibility at set pieces will not be lost on Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in his preparations for Anfield. The flaw was in Liverpool\u2019s defence before the change of goalkeeper and, as Klopp is fond of saying, it takes a series of lapses for the opposition to have a clear sight of goal rather than one individual error.</p> <p>As with David de Gea and so many goalkeeping imports before him, Karius needs time to adapt to the occasional aerial assault and, more importantly, the physical demands of the Premier League. It can be an arduous, painful process but, as far as Klopp is concerned, his compatriot has had the best grounding.</p>",

But something has changed again. Last week, the tape of his conversation with Billy Bush brought them front and centre in the American conversation; this week, further testimony from two women who spoke to the New York Times, alleging that his claims back then were more than mere words, have ensured that the spotlight will not shift. His unguarded phrase, \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d, has stuck because it chimed with the testimony of Jill Harth, and so many other women who have spoken out about their experience with Trump. As a former Miss Utah, Temple Taggart, put it to the New York Times when remembering how he had introduced himself by kissing her on the lips: \u201cIt was like, \u2018Thank you.\u2019 Now no one can say I made this up,\u201d she said. In this context, the stories of the women who spoke up about Trump have taken on fresh weight: now undeniable as a map to his values and treatment of women for more than 40 years.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Jill Harth was not the only woman who got in touch with me about Trump this year. Kari Wells, a former model and Bravo actor, described her own experience with Trump\u2019s sexual entitlement back in December 1992 when she was modelling in Aspen, Colorado, at the Ritz Carlton hotel and the Little Nell Hotels doing various fashion shows.</p> <p>Trump was dating a girlfriend of hers at the time, the model Kelly Ann Sabatasso, so she was friendly in passing when she saw him. \u201cI kept running into him and her at the different hotels and at the fashion shows,\u201d she said. \u201cHe asked me what time I was doing the show until, and I just thought it was polite conversation, so I told him it ended around 6pm. He asked if I would like to come up to his room as Kelly was coming over and he thought that the three of us could have some fun together. He pushed his room key forward on the table for me to pick up.\u201d At the time Wells was in her early 20s; the age difference, as well as the abruptness of his proposition, shocked her. She quickly made up an excuse, but she kept thinking about the exchange. \u201cWhat gave him a right to ask me such a thing? Just because I had been polite and friendly towards him, and the fact that I was a model?\u201d </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-trump-miss-piggy-latino-campaign-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/55vjz\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2756157\"            data-video-name=\"Former Miss Universe Alicia Machado on Trump: 'I know what he can do' - video\"            data-video-provider=\"The Guardian\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ea8d3fe4b091b7fa2b5a86\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572839&amp;format=video/mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572839&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572839&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572839&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572839&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-trump-miss-piggy-latino-campaign-video\">Former Miss Universe Alicia Machado on Trump: \u2018I know what he can do\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In the case of Alicia Machado, whom I interviewed in Los Angeles where she now lives, it would ironically be the widely available video footage of the humiliation he subjected her to after the 1996 Miss Universe gained a modest amount of weight that would devastate Trump. Venezuela-born Machado became an American citizen this year with the express purpose of voting against him. And in an hour-long interview, interrupted only by a phone call from her mother, Machado described the infamous incident in which Trump turned a forced workout into a press event \u2013 \u201cI was in some gym in New York like a mouse,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton\">she said</a>. \u201cLook at that mouse: how she run, how she jump, how she make exercise. Like that. In that moment is when \u2026 problems come to me and start.\u201d Machado subsequently suffered from anorexia and bulimia.</p> <p>A week later, Hillary Clinton would tell Machado\u2019s story on the debate stage, blasting out a media package to back it up afterwards. It was a devastating moment for Trump, not just on the debate floor, but in the week that followed, with Trump tweeting out defensive comments about Machado\u2019s non-existent \u201csex tape\u201d, part of a larger effort by him and his campaign surrogates to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/30/alicia-machado-donald-trump-backlash-smear\">tar her character</a> with claims irrelevant to the issue at hand; her readily verifiable account of her experience with Trump.</p> <p>Machado had the evidence to prove her case against Trump, from video to a dossier of press clippings, precisely because Trump had wanted to document the moment. The trouble for Trump was, in the intervening 20 years the context changed and society had progressed. He, meanwhile, had not.</p> <p>It\u2019s one thing for Clinton to do things like call Trump a bully or even for his biographers to do so \u2013 as practically every one of them will. It\u2019s another to see it and feel it viscerally, as we can in Machado\u2019s story. And hers was not even the most compelling story I heard on Trump\u2019s bullying. That dubious distinction belongs to former beauty queen Sheena Monnin, sued by Trump for $10m when she made a negative comment on Facebook about his pageant. She had thrown a stone in his eye and now Trump was coming down on her with Goliath force.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dc8c5f4f7d91b3c25edb50ebc7602dc6c20675a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc8c5f4f7d91b3c25edb50ebc7602dc6c20675a3/0_292_5684_3410/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sheena Monnin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sheena Monnin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sheena Monnin./Sheena Monnin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere was no way I could have afforded to pay that off and frankly, he had to have known that,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/sheena-monnin-donald-trump-miss-usa-lawsuit\">she told the Guardian this summer</a>. In a more rational world, Monnin would not have spent years locked in legal battle with a man worth many billions more than she\u2019ll ever see in her lifetime for what amounted to a slight on Facebook; but in telling her story years later, as an increasing number of women are stepping forward to do, she found a measure of vindication and dignity.</p> <p>It is perhaps unsurprising that an exploration of how Trump got to this point takes you right back to his mother. Mary Trump, her son explained in The Art Of The Deal, was an unmatchable ideal. \u201cPart of the problem I\u2019ve had with women has been in having to compare them to my incredible mother, Mary Trump,\u201d he wrote (or his ghost did). \u201cMy mother is smart as hell.\u201d</p> <p>At the New York Military Academy, where he had been sent after an incident involving switchblade knives, he quickly developed the measure of success that would persist. He was seen with beautiful women on his arm so often he was voted ladies\u2019 man of his class. And as he grew up, Trump never lost his adolescent way of seeing women as trophies \u2013 or of measuring himself in the world.</p> <p>When he met his first wife Ivana Trump, a Czech American socialite skier whom he married in 1977, Trump recalled being impressed by more than her looks. \u201cGood looks had been my top \u2013 and sometimes, to be honest, my only \u2013 priority in my man-about-town days,\u201d he recalled in Trump: Surviving at the Top. \u201cIvana was gorgeous, but she was also ambitious and intelligent. When I introduced her to friends and associates, I said, \u2018Believe me. This one\u2019s different.\u2019 Everyone knew what I meant, and I think everyone sensed that I found the combination of beauty and brains almost unbelievable.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/trumps-misogyny-problem-how-donald-has-repeatedly-targeted-women\">Donald's misogyny problem: How Trump has repeatedly targeted women</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Astonished as he was, his marriage to Ivana lasted over a decade, long enough to have three children. When his wife\u2019s ambition started to grate, and rumours of his philandering persisted, he moved on to Marla Maples \u2013 \u201cnice tits, no brains\u201d, as he would later sum her up. Ivana, in a sworn deposition from the time, pointed not just to these infidelities but also to her own violent rape, following a fight. She has since softened her stance on the story she gave under oath, telling one biographer she didn\u2019t mean rape in the \u201cliteral\u201d sense, and is now bound from discussing it by a non-disclosure agreement. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s tabloid life was never even put on hold when he took up with Marla \u2013 Jill Harth\u2019s allegations occurred after he had taken up with Maples. They married in 1993, but the relationship was never strong and the rumours of affairs never quieted. Six years and one daughter \u2013 Tiffany Trump \u2013 later, Maples would become his new ex-wife. Trump blamed Marla, not himself for the destruction of their marriage, as he had blamed Ivana before her. He accused her of not making him dinner in a timely manner, and not being supportive enough of his long hours at work, but when it came to giving her emotional support all consideration went out the window: \u201cOne thing I have learned: There is high maintenance. There is low maintenance. I want no maintenance,\u201d he wrote in The Art Of The Comeback</p> <p>That much at least has not changed. Now on his third marriage to Melania Trump, 24 years his junior, he still brags about never changing diapers. </p> <p>***</p> <p>Alongside that marital history, and the litany of other charges against him, the stories of Machado, the fat-shamed beauty queen struggling with body image, Monnin, the bullied defendant fighting Trump\u2019s machine, and Harth, the sexually assaulted woman who thought she was launching a business proposition, paint the picture of a domineering man. But all three women chafed at the notion of being defined by him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7bca6c4ac79618d110ea5dc0beab301041705d1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bca6c4ac79618d110ea5dc0beab301041705d1c/0_75_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women protest against Donald Trump near the Trump International Hotel in New York on Wednesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women protest against Donald Trump near the Trump International Hotel in New York on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to say his name,\u201d Machado told me, when prompted at one point to indicate she was talking about Trump.

She wants me to know who she is now, not just who she was then.</p> <p>Mostly though, like every woman I interviewed, she wanted her story to be about her.</p> <p>Each woman came to me for different reasons: Harth was sick of hearing Trump tell her story; Monnin, who recently published a self-help book, wanted to help other bullying victims; Machado wanted to make sure her abuser wasn\u2019t the next president.</p> <p>But none of them wanted to talk about Trump. They did it because they felt that they had to, or someone else would. One surprising legacy of Trump\u2019s campaign is that, as he falls in the polls, it is women, perhaps recognising something of their own life experiences in what happened to these three, who look poised to rise up and denounce him and the strain of political misogyny he represents.<strong> </strong></p> <p>As the writer Rebecca Traister asks: \u201cWhich is worse, threatening to grab someone by the pussy or forcing someone to carry and give birth to a baby that is the result of rape? Which is worse: Popping a Tic Tac in preparation for forced extramarital kissing with a stranger or actively discouraging women\u2019s full participation in the workforce?

  "<p>I\u2019m old enough to remember John Major\u2019s government like it was yesterday. I watched the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/31/haunted-ghosts-major-maastricht\">Maastricht debates</a>, and I\u2019m prepared to admit I even read the treaty. I remember the troubles that John Major had navigating debates over Europe, and that one of his achievements, despite all those difficulties, was securing the location of the <a href=\"http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/\">European Medicines Agency (EMA)</a> in the UK.</p> <p>Twenty years on, that success is being put at risk by another Conservative prime minister. Major complained about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk\">\u201cthe bastards\u201d on his own side</a> \u2013 now they\u2019re running the show. Earlier this week, <a href=\"https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/25386/daniel_zeichner/cambridge\">I led a debate in Westminster on the future of the EMA</a> because we need to know about the government\u2019s plans for medicines regulation following Brexit.</p> <p>While the EMA wasn\u2019t spoken about much during the EU referendum campaign, the NHS certainly was, and the UK\u2019s relationship with the EMA is absolutely crucial to the NHS. Strangely enough, no minister from the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-exiting-the-european-union\">Department for Exiting the EU</a> was available for the debate \u2013 a health minister was left to field the questions.</p> <p>For two decades, <a href=\"http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CDP-2016-0173/CDP-2016-0173.pdf\">the EMA has overseen medicines regulation across Europe</a>. Responsible for the scientific evaluation of human and veterinary medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies, it grants marketing authorisations across the 28 EU member states, as well as the countries of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). </p> <p>The EMA is tasked with ensuring that all medicines available on the EU market are safe, effective and of high quality. It also works to harmonise the approach of national regulatory bodies \u2013 like the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency\">Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)</a>. Located in London\u2019s Canary Wharf, with around 900 highly-skilled staff, the EMA serves a market of over 500 million people across the EU, accounting for 25 per cent of all global pharmaceutical sales. On its own, the UK accounts for just 3 per cent.</p> <p>Last week, the chancellor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/03/the-guardian-view-on-philip-hammonds-conference-speech-missed-opportunity-for-a-new-strategy\">Philip Hammond said that no one voted for Brexit to make us poorer</a>. Yet the impact of Brexit on the EMA could do just that. As Theresa May herself said in July, \u201cIt is hard to think of an industry of greater strategic importance to Britain than its pharmaceutical industry.\u201d In 2015, the UK pharmaceutical industry was worth \u00a312.7 billion. A quarter of the world\u2019s top prescription medicines <a href=\"http://www.abpi.org.uk/our-work/uk-eu-life-sciences-transition-programme/Documents/UK-EU-Steering-Group-Report.pdf\">were discovered and developed in the UK</a>. </p> <p>And the pharmaceutical industry is the backbone of the broader life sciences sector, which has a turnover of more than \u00a360bn a year. In 2014, <a href=\"http://www.abpi.org.uk/our-work/uk-eu-life-sciences-transition-programme/Documents/UK-EU-Steering-Group-Report.pdf\">it invested \u00a34bn in research and development</a>, more than any other sector, and it employs 220,000 people. In my constituency of Cambridge alone, <a href=\"https://www.cam.ac.uk/system/files/innovation_in_numbers_1.pdf\">there are over 160 life sciences companies</a>, reinforcing the local knowledge economy and contributing outside of the region as well. Indeed, <a href=\"http://www.cambridgeahead.co.uk/the-case-for-cambridge/ \">Cambridge is one of just a handful of UK cities making a net contribution to HM Treasury</a>, thanks in no small part to its vibrant life sciences. Under Brexit, this is now at risk.</p> <p>A hard Brexit would see the UK out of the single market and the European Economic Area. So for pharmaceuticals and life sciences, what would change? First, industry experts suggest we could see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/23/brexit-longer-waiting-times-for-new-medicines-drugs-medical-devices-warn-experts\">delays to the approval of new medicines</a>. In Canada and Australia, where drugs are regulated nationally, new medicines come to market between six months and a year later than in the EU. </p> <p>So if pharmaceutical companies have to apply separately to the UK\u2019s MHRA to supply a drug in the UK, we could see patients denied faster access to new medicines. The MHRA may struggle to cope with the additional burden, leading to a slower, less efficient system. Pharmaceutical companies may forego the smaller UK market in favour of the much larger EU market. And smaller companies, often developing pioneering treatments, may not have the capacity to file multiple applications at once.</p> <p>Second, there is likely to be a physical change. The EMA\u2019s headquarters is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/17/eu-countries-rush-steal-uk-based-research-projects\">expected to move elsewhere</a>. Several EU member states have reportedly thrown their hats in the ring to host it \u2013 including Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Sweden and Spain. This may create a knock-on effect on future investment and relocation decisions by global and European pharmaceutical companies, further chipping away at the UK economy. </p> <p>Finally, losing the EMA could lead to a significant brain drain. Not only would we potentially lose the 900 people currently employed by the agency, but we could lose experienced people working elsewhere in the pharmaceutical industry. For instance, any company that sells into the European Economic Area must have a \u201cqualified person for pharmacovigilance\u201d (QPPV), as well as a deputy. There are currently 1,299 QPPVs in the UK who would either have to leave the UK or lose their role. </p> <p>Negotiations are of course ongoing, but it is crucial the government gets this right. We need to secure the closest possible relationship between the EMA and the MHRA, and their continued regulatory cooperation, because ensuring swift access to the newest treatments is essential to public health. We need the UK\u2019s pharmaceutical industry to remain strong to deliver jobs and economic benefits across the country, and to stimulate companies researching revolutionary treatments. Get this wrong and treatments will slow down, drug prices will go up \u2013 and our NHS will foot the bill. </p> <p><em>Daniel Zeichner </em><em>is MP for Cambridge.

The championship clashes take place in Abkhazia, a breakaway region of Georgia loyal to Vladimir Putin.

  "<p>The comt\u00e9 cheese souffle encapsulates my region, my terroir, my home \u2013 it is the defining dish of the whole region of Franche-Comt\u00e9.</p> <p>When I was a child, we\u2019d take our two-litre pot to fetch fresh milk from the fromagerie, an immense room tiled with white and furnished with huge copper vats. The taste of sweet fresh milk is an enduring memory, as is that of the comt\u00e9 being made. I loved watching the fromagers \u2013 cheesemakers \u2013 in their white plastic aprons, scooping milk solids from the bottom of this six-metre wide vat \u2013 about 300 litres of milk \u2013 and lifting out the curd with a mousseline net, maybe 150kg of it. They\u2019d divide the curd on to huge wheels of wood then press it. It was mesmerising.</p> <p>Comt\u00e9 is used in hundreds of Franche-Comtois recipes \u2013 raclette, quenelles \u2026 and this souffle, which was always one of my mother\u2019s staples. I come from a working-class family. My mother made delicious food in vast quantities \u2013 she had five kids to feed! Meat only twice a week, lots of pulses, and lots of cheese.</p> <p>We usually ate in the kitchen, except for Sundays when the whole clan would descend and we\u2019d all eat in the dining room. It was very regimented \u2013 French children were highly disciplined at the table. My dad was in charge \u2013 we\u2019d wait for him. There\u2019d be a big 2kg loaf of bread that only he could serve, because he had earned it. Before slicing it, he\u2019d do a cross on the bottom of the bread \u2013 a nice way to show his respect.</p> <p>More than just food, my childhood gave me a complete philosophy about eating. We had a relatively small garden, which I was always weeding, watering or tidying, while my friends were playing football! I didn\u2019t hold it close to my heart then, but now I know it\u2019s where I learned everything about varietals. My mother would never just say \u201cget me some potatoes\u201d. We\u2019d go foraging in the forest for berries, mushrooms and wild asparagus, which gave me an understanding of seasonality, of variety, of food being so much more than simply sustenance. It was about being connected to both family and the environment. It was about authenticity.</p> <h2><strong>Souffle franc-comtois</strong></h2> <p>The souffle base can be prepared a day in advance and kept in the fridge, the surface covered with buttered greaseproof paper to avoid crusting. You need to have everyone seated and ready to eat when you take the dish from the oven \u2013 even a perfectly cooked souffle will stay inflated for only around 5 minutes. Montgomery cheddar or gruyere could be substituted for the comt\u00e9. You might like to put a layer of cooked Swiss chard, leeks or Belgian endive into the bottom of the dish.</p> <p><strong>Serves 6</strong><br>20g unsalted butter, melted<br>20g dried coarse breadcrumbs<br>7 organic/free-range medium egg whites (210g)<br>4 drops of lemon juice<br>20g comt\u00e9 cheese, finely grated</p> <p><strong> For the base</strong><br>50g unsalted butter<br>50g plain flour<br>300ml whole milk, hot<br>160g comt\u00e9 cheese, finely grated<br>20g dijon mustard<br>3 organic/free-rangemedium egg yolks (60g)<br>Salt and white pepper</p> <p><strong> For the sauce</strong><br>150ml double cream<br>70g comt\u00e9 cheese, grated<br>1 tsp dijon mustard<br>A pinch of white pepper<br>1 tbsp <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirsch\">kirsch</a></p> <p>1 Preheat the oven to 170C/335F/gas mark 3\u00bd and put a baking tray (or stone) on the middle shelf to heat up; a baking stone, if you have one, would be even better. Meanwhile, using a pastry brush, brush a large round or oval earthenware dish with a thin, even layer of melted butter and coat with the dried breadcrumbs. This coating will help the souffle to rise evenly in the oven and give it a beautiful crust. Set aside.</p> <p>2 For the souffle base, melt the butter in a large saucepan (ideally one with rounded sides) over a medium heat. Add the flour and whisk until smooth. Cook to a nutty-coloured blond roux. Lower the heat. Whisk in the hot milk, little by little, it should be smooth. Add the grated cheese and mustard. Cook for 2\u20133 minutes, whisking now and then. Remove the pan from the heat. Let it cool a little.</p> <p>3 Add the yolks. Stir until the mixture is silky smooth. Season with a pinch of salt (only a little as the cheese is salty) and 2 pinches of white pepper. Keep warm in a hot bain-marie.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/mar/13/raymond-blanc-franche-comte-besancon-france-way-i-see-it\">Chef Raymond Blanc on his favourite home town places: Besan\u00e7on, France</a> </p> </aside>  <p>4 When you are ready to assemble and bake the souffle, whisk the egg whites with the lemon juice until soft peaks are formed.

But not at the expense of Heathrow \u2013 and not in parallel \u2013 or else, in practice, nothing will get built.\u201d</p> <p>A decision from the government on whether to build a third runway at Heathrow or a second runway at Gatwick is expected as early as next Tuesday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/airport_options-zip/giv-140650CV7byeBOAH/\" data-alt=\"Heathrow and Gatwick expansion plans\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/airport_options-zip/giv-140650CV7byeBOAH/\">Heathrow and Gatwick expansion plans</a> </figure>  <p>While no date has been confirmed, a cabinet subcommittee led by the prime minister, Theresa May, is widely believed to be meeting on 18 October to finally respond to the commission\u2019s report. The commission, led by Sir Howard Davies, was established under the coalition government more than four years ago, and gave a \u201cclear and unanimous\u201d verdict in favour of building a third Heathrow runway soon after the last election.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The runway would cost an estimated \u00a317.6bn, plus at least \u00a35bn to constuct new road and rail links outside the perimeter, the funding for which remains unresolved. The airport hopes it could build its runway by 2025.</p> <p>However, ministers have since almost entirely referred to Davies\u2019s shortlist, delivered in 2013, which included a \u00a37.1bn second runway at Gatwick airport as well as the Heathrow hub scheme, an alternative \u00a313.5bn proposal for Heathrow to expand an existing runway.</p> <p>Last week, Heathrow was boosted by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/10/heathrow-third-runway-expansion-scottish-government\">memorandum of understanding signed with the Scottish government</a>, which gave its backing to the third runway plan in return for guarantees over flights. </p> <p>But while the west London hub has the backing of trade unions, business, airlines and many MPs around Britain from all parties, expansion has proved politically toxic in London, with MPs in nearby seats \u2013 including cabinet ministers such as Justine Greening and May herself \u2013 representing constituents who are vehemently opposed to a new runway. </p> <p>That led to Gatwick returning to the frame, with the West Sussex airport consistently stressing that Heathrow was politically undeliverable. </p> <p>Any decision next week may prove only the start of a new battle. Legal challenges from nearby councils and environmental groups are expected, as well as protests. Many in the government are believed to think, like Osborne, that there is an urgency to expand, especially post-Brexit. But a consultation will follow that could highlight unresolved concerns over air quality, flight paths, surface access costs and night flights.</p> <p>Gatwick has said it will stand by even if Heathrow gets the go-ahead, in expectation that plans for a new runway may once again collapse before spades are in the ground.</p> <p> </p>",
  "<p>Getting the balance right between old and new values can be an academic minefield. Discussions about cultural appropriation and apologism have become frequent and charged, with little agreement over how best to represent certain parts of history. But colonialism is intrinsically political and personal \u2013 its roots are buried deep in communities \u2013 so getting our approach to studying it right really matters. </p> <p>How should we use source material from Britain\u2019s colonial past? The language we use, and how we choose to represent things, can help us break away from a narrow-minded view of empire. Colonial history provides the basis for much of today\u2019s inequalities, so it\u2019s only right that we avoid the same assumptions as contemporary imperialists. Too often, empire is presented as some sort of faultless railway-producing machine. We should demand better, more inclusive, more nuanced history.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Colonialism created \u200b\u200bnarratives that were far more complex than sources tell us</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In my own MA dissertation, on western and local medicine in the African colonies, I wanted to break down the assumption that Africa is a singular \u2013 culturally and politically homogenous. This blanket way of describing Africa is rooted in how British colonialists envisioned the continent, as a playground in which to run experiments. But, actually, each colony varied greatly, in structure, social traditions and religious affiliations, as well as their level of engagement with the empire itself. Africa is not a country, but if you look at colonial sources together, it\u2019s difficult to not come away with that sense of homogeneity. </p> <p>It\u2019s not an old or irrelevant problem either \u2013 this flawed perception continues. Just this month, Boris Johnson mistakenly <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-africa-country-conservative-tory-conference-speech-foreign-secretary-a7341936.html\">referred to Africa as \u201cthat country\u201d</a>. So, as students, how do we avoid falling into this trap?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"93b000b73b6eb0461ec74171751d7e02c49c38d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93b000b73b6eb0461ec74171751d7e02c49c38d5/532_121_1974_2468/800.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson referred to Africa as \u201cthat country\u201d in a speech at Conservative Party conference.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson referred to Africa as \u2018that country\u2019 in a speech at Conservative Party conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Jackson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s good practice to know the conditions that created certain situations,\u201d says history student Francesco Paolo Cioffo. His research into criminal gangs, known as \u201cthugees\u201d, in colonial India uncovered a stark example of how history can be skewed when sources aren\u2019t approached with scepticism. \u201cColonial sources indicated that empire got rid of the thuggees,\u201d Cioffo explains. \u201cBut now it\u2019s been argued that it was an exaggerated crisis to justify more action in the Raj.\u201d Colonialism created narratives that were far more complex than sources tell us. \u201cWe cannot read a piece of writing and immediately believe it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Of course, primary source materials are central to studying colonialism, but students should try reading as many interpretations of a period as possible when forming an argument. The same goes for other subjects that touch on the issue, whether it\u2019s politics, art, literature, or something else. Don\u2019t accept what might seem the most obvious way forward. Challenging the biases of British colonialism is both academic and current \u2013 consider the present to put things into perspective and get a sense of the longer history. </p> <p>Problematic and racist language is pretty much integral to a lot of colonial sources. Racial hierarchy was one of the pillars of Britain\u2019s empire, so it can\u2019t really be escaped. Yet it can\u2019t simply be dismissed as \u201coutdated\u201d, because racism is, unfortunately, not just a thing of the past. Nor should it be ignored. We should be wary of the more subtle ways it can materialise in source material and also about how it may influence the language in our own work. Even though you can\u2019t change the source, you can change your own language and approach to them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Problematic and\u200b racist language \u200b\u200bis pretty much integral to a lot of colonial sources. It can\u2019t really be escaped</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For some students, studying colonial history is a personal political matter. Fatima Rajina, a PhD student studying British Bangladeshi Muslims, says she \u201cbecame fed up of hearing white academics studying south Asian communities.\u201d She explains: \u201cVery rarely did we hear narratives collected by an \u2018insider\u2019. I felt it is time insiders are also given the opportunity to share insights available to them; to collect narratives and share them. It\u2019s important that not only do we challenge history but also play a part in knowledge production, which has been almost exclusively produced by white folks.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"44bee9effe8a658180e0465b39629d90b9fe2a0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44bee9effe8a658180e0465b39629d90b9fe2a0c/0_0_2875_3860/745.jpg\" alt=\"1892 Punch cartoon depicting British colonialist Cecil Rhodes striding across Africa, \u201cfrom Cape Town to Cairo\u201d, with a telegraph wire.\" width=\"745\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Punch cartoon from 1892 depicting British colonialist Cecil Rhodes striding across Africa, \u2018from Cape Town to Cairo\u2019, with a telegraph wire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Print Collector/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In my own studies, I\u2019ve researched the Indian Partition, in part to understand some of the divisions which still haunt my community. However, if I hadn\u2019t had personal access to the sources myself, I could have very easily believed that religion was the sole cause of division. In reality, Britain\u2019s failure at the close of imperial India to mediate a border that worked between the various factions and to consider local tensions has contributed to persistent issues. A more narrow-minded view might blame the communities themselves, like we see in some colonial material. So when the limitations of colonial sources filter down into public life, it\u2019s even more important that source material is properly interrogated and discussed. </p> <p>But breaking away from a narrow-minded Eurocentric vision of history is not just about scrutinising sources; universities should also encourage more world history. The empire brought Brits into contact with people all over the world and created a myriad of relationships. A Eurocentric education doesn\u2019t reflect the world we live in. More needs to be done to address the country\u2019s global past, because it filters through to so many present issues to do with race, wealth and power. And if students are not exposed to colonial source material (or material from other parts of the world), it it could be harder to challenge biases and recognise where they come from.</p> <p>This is not about apologism; it\u2019s about understanding the broader picture and our responsibility to portray Britain\u2019s colonial history in full. We need to make more of an effort to challenge and avoid the pitfalls of past narratives, which are deeply intertwined with the present, and challenge our own biases.<br></p> <p><strong>Keep up with the latest on Guardian Students: follow us on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnstudents\">@GdnStudents</a> \u2013 and <a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/students/\">become a member</a> to receive exclusive benefits and our weekly newsletter.</strong></p>",

On a muggy, overcast May morning, Khaled Musher, 38, defender and team captain, is travelling from Irbil to his ancestral village for the first time in weeks. It is on the road to Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second city, held by Isis since June 2014 and now the target of an offensive by pro-government forces and the peshmerga, the armed forces of Iraqi Kurdistan. As Irbil disappears into the distance, military checkpoints and arid scrubland open on to rolling hills ringed by mountain silhouettes. Musher points to a lone peak a short drive away. \u201cBehind that is Mosul,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Musher fits the footballer stereotype \u2013 rich and narcissistic. The youngest of nine brothers and six sisters, he was his late father\u2019s favourite son. Handsome and well-groomed, wearing designer jeans and a fake Armani T-shirt, Musher spends the car journey glued to Facebook on his phone and making hushed calls to friends.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a6575bc105acccae0547a8e3e493ddc119dafc6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a6575bc105acccae0547a8e3e493ddc119dafc6/0_0_1346_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kurdistan football team captain Khaled Musher, holding a football\" width=\"1000\" height=\"802\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kurdistan captain Khaled Musher.

Musher sits next to his brother as Agha takes centre stage. \u201cOur father loved Khaled a lot. Khaled was, as they say, \u2018the last grape of the bunch\u2019. Our father didn\u2019t pressure him to study, which is unfortunate. But maybe that was Khaled\u2019s fate: he loves football more than his life,\u201d Agha says.</p> <p>Surrounded by elders, Agha is clad in a traditional turban and baggy trousers, with a dagger tucked into a large sash at the waist. The men chat among themselves, their wives and sisters hidden away in the kitchen. Inside the house a television set in the corner shows chaotic scenes in Baghdad where protesters have stormed the city\u2019s fortified green zone and overrun parliament. Several of Musher\u2019s brothers, cousins and uncles are directly engaged in the fight against Isis, on the frontlines and in command posts. \u201cThe situation is very frightening,\u201d he says. \u201cYour heart isn\u2019t at ease \u2013 they are there and we are here. War can change in an instant. God forbid something could happen. But if we\u2019re needed, we will join them.\u201d</p> <p>The Kurds\u2019 hopes for independence are fuel for Musher. \u201cBecause we live in a really bad situation here and have been oppressed all our lives, our dream today is very big.

He is the squad\u2019s hulking, warrior-like goalkeeper. Over lunch at his spacious home in an upmarket Irbil neighbourhood, he talks about his sadness at being unable to play in Fifa. \u201cAll my life, I\u2019ve wanted to go to the World Cup and wrap my country\u2019s flag around my shoulders.\u201d</p> <p>A natural leader, Mohsin is one of the most engaging and impressive members of the team. When he was three, his father was conscripted by Iraq\u2019s armed forces to fight against Iran, but was captured and spent more than a decade in a Tehrani prison, mistreated and tortured.</p> <p>Mohsin gave up his studies to help his mother support his siblings. \u201cWhen I started as a goalkeeper, my mother would sew gloves for me with material from wetsuits. I would add an Adidas, Nike or Eurosport logo,\u201d he says, showing us his mother\u2019s old sewing machine in his sitting room. \u201cMy mother put aside her life, her interests.

He rushed home to find a crowd of neighbours, threw himself at his father and kissed him. The man remained impassive: \u201cHe didn\u2019t know I was his son, so I just sat next to him.\u201d His father eventually realised and turned to hug him, tears streaming down his face. \u201cHe had changed a lot,\u201d Mohsin says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have the same bright eyes.\u201d These experiences made him a better team member, he says: \u201cSince my childhood, I have been instilled with the mindset that I can shoulder responsibility and lead people.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s time for training. Mohsin changes into his kit, kisses his two toddler daughters on the head and says goodbye to his wife. Turning up some kitsch pop music, he pulls out of the neighbourhood in his white, soft-top Ford Mustang and speeds down a baking-hot highway towards the training grounds on the other side of the city.</p> <p>By 4pm, all the players have arrived \u2013 mostly in big, brash SUVs. The stadium is a somewhat dejected sports complex with broken plastic chairs in the stands and smashed windows at the rear. But the turf is green and healthy, jarringly at odds with the surrounding dusty streets and industrial estate. The men warm up with a game halfway between volleyball and football before they gather round the coach, Khasraw Gurun. The 54-year-old former player commands their respect, his stern face belying a quick wit and paternal warmth. As a young man he was forcibly conscripted under Saddam Hussein, and tortured for playing football while absent without leave.</p> <p>He watches as the players split into groups to work on specific skills: dribbling, tackling, headers. The nearby battlefront is the \u201cbest psychological motivation\u201d for the players, Gurun explains. \u201cWe tell them, \u2018The peshmerga are fighting out there so you need to perform on the field.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90cd7d872e1f6a33816ceca44e35c8e38f30f9b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90cd7d872e1f6a33816ceca44e35c8e38f30f9b9/0_0_1381_1177/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarhank Mohsin, goalkeeper and vice-captain of the Kurdistan football team, training in Irbil.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"852\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kurdistan goalkeeper/vice-captain Sarhank Mohsin.

The men\u2019s confidence is high and their camaraderie strong. But cliques emerge, largely formed along provincial lines. Those from Duhok who speak the Kurdish Badini dialect stick together; those from Irbil do not mingle with players from Sulaymaniyah or Kirkuk. Regional divisions run deep, broadly splitting the north-west, which backs the ruling <a href=\"http://www.kdp.se/\">Kurdistan Democratic Party </a>(KDP), from the south-eastern strongholds of the <a href=\"http://www.pukpb.org/english/\">Patriotic Union of Kurdistan</a> (PUK).</p> <p>There are many who even believe Iraq itself no longer qualifies as a true nation-state, riven as it is by conflict, sectarian divide and competing areas controlled by Baghdad, Irbil and Isis. \u201cIt is obvious to all of us that Iraq is a made-up country,\u201d says Mohsin, the goalkeeper, dismissively.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The day of departure for the tournament arrives. Following a scuffle of selfies on the runway at Irbil, the players board the charter flight. In an act of lighthearted subversion, one tapes the Kurdistan flag on to the outside of the Fly Baghdad aircraft.</p> <p>At the front sits coach Gurun. He was once a midfielder for the main club in Sulaymaniyah, then a hotbed of Kurdish resistance against Saddam. \u201cIf there was a game in our stadium, his troops would come and end it,\u201d he says. One day, soldiers stormed the ground and erected three wooden posts on the pitch. \u201cThe next day,\u201d Gurun added, \u201cthey brought in three people and executed them by firing squad.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1071d58258110e4577316f1bb8ba96be91d49d59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1071d58258110e4577316f1bb8ba96be91d49d59/0_0_5413_3609/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Kurdistan football team with coach Khasraw Gurun\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Kurdistan team with coach Khasraw Gurun.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Max Avdeev</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the relentless Iran-Iraq war in the 80s, Gurun was conscripted, then later jailed for desertion. \u201cThere was no bathroom and we were treated like animals,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were beaten when taken outside, beaten when brought back to the cells.\u201d</p> <p>Sport served as a kind of therapy. \u201cWhen you play football, you forget about your daily life and the pain in your past. Football gives you two hours of happiness. People don\u2019t care what political party you belong to or which religion you are. Football unites all people.\u201d</p> <p>On the flight, the players peer out over a hot, unforgiving desert. Within an hour, the Iraqi Kurdistan delegation touches down in Sochi, southern Russia, to board a bus for Sukhumi, the sleepy capital of Abkhazia. After a slow, tedious wait at the de facto border (one guard tells me it is the first time he has ever seen an Iraqi passport, let alone 43) the team travels past snow-capped mountains, swaths of lush green forest and the overgrown ruins of a past, forgotten conflict.</p> <p>Abkhazia was once a balmy, palm-fringed resort for the Soviet elite and remains a distinct cultural region within the Caucasus. Georgia, the Ottomans, the Russian Empire and the Soviets have all claimed it as their own. Few countries recognise the independence of this obscure yet beautiful statelet, which is propped up by Moscow, loyal to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin\">Vladimir Putin</a>, and home to 240,000 people.</p> <p>For the next week, the Kurds are based at hotel Aitar, a shabby, Soviet-era complex on Sukhumi\u2019s southern outskirts, alongside other teams and bewildered groups of Russian tourists. The morning after the team arrive, they wake to see the Koreans performing tai chi beneath the conifers and palms. Later the Western Armenia squad descend on the courtyard, with speakers blaring French hip-hop and Armenian folk, as they link arms and dance around the fountain. The younger Chagossians flirt with the local girls assigned to steward the teams; the Kurds retire to their rooms, glued to Facebook and Instagram in between turning towards Mecca for their daily prayers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"542da7baaacff6bf3d0b0f8e4d231cc68c22fa8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/542da7baaacff6bf3d0b0f8e4d231cc68c22fa8e/0_313_4699_2820/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Locals on the beach at Gagra, Abkhazia, who charge tourists to be photographed with animals\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the beach at Gagra, locals charge tourists to be photographed with animals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Max Avdeev</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 12 teams are largely amateur, yet they represent tens of millions of stateless people across three continents. For many, the tournament is a podium from which to present themselves to the world. Compared with the global behemoth of Fifa, the turnover of the <a href=\"http://www.conifa.org/en/\">Confederation of Independent Football Associations</a> (Conifa) makes it a minnow. Set up by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/conifapresident\">Per-Anders Blind</a>, a reindeer rancher and former referee from Sweden, and <a href=\"http://www.conifa.org/en/dt_team/030-sascha-duerkop/\">Sascha D\u00fcerkop</a>, a German doctoral student in mathematics, it is a non-government organisation that raises funds from annual membership fees, donations (around \u00a372,000 since its foundation), sponsorship (approximately \u00a3900 per year) and pay-per-view online streaming. Headquartered in Lule\u00e5, a remote coastal town in northern Sweden, the confederation states that its objectives are to strengthen people and identity, respect differences, and contribute to world peace.</p> <p>Conifa still manages to rattle some cages. The organisation\u2019s decision to hold the tournament in Abkhazia has angered Georgia, which regards the former as its de jure territory. The competition\u2019s operational costs were shouldered by Abkhazia which, given the territory\u2019s status as a client state of Russia, means that Moscow money is likely to have subsidised the jamboree. Meanwhile, the Isle of Man has been forced to withdraw as the UK government advises against travel to Abkhazia; and the side representing <a href=\"http://www.conifa.org/en/members/romani-people/\">Romani</a> people had to pull out due to \u201cunexpected issues with the travel documents\u201d, according to D\u00fcerkop. Eyebrows were raised by the recent addition of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republics, two separatist enclaves at the centre of Russia\u2019s grinding conflict against Ukraine and regularly accused of appalling human rights abuses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a817ae7b73e4a3b9407fbe6fde24727e89c49c89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a817ae7b73e4a3b9407fbe6fde24727e89c49c89/0_0_5461_3641/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Somaliland football team players in Abkhazia  for the alternative World Cup\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Somaliland players relaxing in Abkhazia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Max Avdeev</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Sukhumi, a few hours before the opening ceremony, Blind, Conifa\u2019s softly-spoken president (and himself a member of the Sami ethnic group), is addressing a small gathering of local and foreign press. \u201cConifa doesn\u2019t care about politics. Our mission is to show the world that even if we come from different cultures and different histories, we are one people on this planet,\u201d Blind says. \u201cPoliticians are trying to build borders between people. Our mission is to tear these down. From my point of view, Conifa is a peace project.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>On a warm, clear night in late May, the tournament\u2019s opening ceremony at the 4,300-seat Dinamo stadium starts: a vibrant, near-psychedelic trip of whirling dancers, singing, drumming and a mock battle between armour-clad soldiers. Each team parades around the pitch, proudly bearing their flags to the applauding crowd; it\u2019s a surreal, joyous occasion that offers a semblance of statehood. The stands are packed with locals.</p> <p>Over the coming days, Kurdistan\u2019s matches take place at Dinamo\u2019s modern arena near the burned-out shell of a towering government building, gutted during the fall of Sukhumi in 1993. While evening matches draw the biggest crowds, the Kurds\u2019 games take place in the afternoon before a thin throng of locals, from veterans of the region\u2019s wars throughout the 90s to packs of teenagers on the hunt for selfies with foreign players.</p> <p>Just above the team\u2019s dugout, a small, diehard core of Kurdish supporters invoke the spirit of the peshmerga to rally the Kurdistan team to victory, shouting, \u201cYalla peshmerga! Yalla sherakan!\u201d (\u201cGo peshmerga! Go lions!\u201d) Kurdistan land comfortable 3-0 wins against United Koreans in Japan and <a href=\"http://www.conifa.org/en/members/szekely-land/\">Sz\u00e9kley Land</a> (a Hungarian-speaking enclave of Romania). After each game, they return to the hotel by bus, belting out peshmerga victory songs.</p> <p>But the quarter-final against <a href=\"http://www.conifa.org/en/members/padania/\">Padania</a> ratchets up the pressure. Kurdistan have lost to them before and are anxious about the rematch. These Italians, from a northern area with a latent independent movement, outsize the Kurds, with a cocksure air and a \u201cnational anthem\u201d of head-banging punk rock. (They qualified after the Romani side developed its visa issues.) The match goes to penalties. One Kurd misses a crucial strike, an Italian slots in the ball with ease, and a devastated Kurdistan team retires to the locker room. Their tournament is over.</p> <p>Several days later, Abkhazia and Panjab meet in the dramatic final. The stadium is teeming, packed beyond capacity, spectators scrambling up its outer walls to steal a view. The game goes to extra time, then another nerve-racking penalty shootout. Abkhazia score the championship\u2019s winning goal. The delirious home fans burst on to the pitch and raise their local heroes above their shoulders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edb52300ee3589878975e117dedba6589b22871d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edb52300ee3589878975e117dedba6589b22871d/0_0_4000_1978/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abkhazia football team\u2019s Shabat Logua celebrates his team\u2019s victory over Panjab in the alternative World Cup final\" width=\"1000\" height=\"495\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abkhazia\u2019s Shabat Logua celebrates his team\u2019s victory over Panjab in the final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pete Kiehart</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The night after the final, Kanabi, the president of the KFA, gathers the dejected delegation at the hotel. He offers neither sympathy nor platitudes. Instead, the scowling boss unleashes a barrage of blame, highlighting faultlines in the squad and, in turn, Kurdistan itself. \u201cIf you\u2019re from Duhok, Kalar, Zakho, Irbil, please don\u2019t say, \u2018This player scored\u2019 or, \u2018That player didn\u2019t score,\u2019\u201d he orders the footballers, some of whom have already vented frustrations against team-mates on social media. The tirade lasts more than 30 minutes as the players sit in a sullen, awkward silence. \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed, aren\u2019t you embarrassed? How will you face people when you go home?\u201d he thunders. \u201cYou come in the name of a country where people are fighting and dying, and you play like this? Inshallah, for the sake of Prophet Muhammad, I hope you\u2019ll never wear a football kit again.\u201d<br></p> <p>Mohsin, the goalie, addresses the team in a more constructive tone. \u201cIf we analyse why we failed, we\u2019ll learn how to succeed.\u201d He concludes with an image that is as much about Kurdish society as it is their team. \u201cIf we liken a club to a wooden boat, the planks are the players. If there\u2019s no unity, and there are gaps between the players, water will flood in and we all will sink.\u201d</p> <p>The flight back to Irbil is a sober affair.</p> <p>The tournament is lost, the team humiliated. Soon, they will be disbanded. Gurun will lose his job, and Kanabi will hand in a letter of resignation (which KFA executives will refuse to accept). But Conifa has allowed them to wrap their flag around their shoulders at a World Cup, and to see life beyond a homeland whose edges have unravelled with war. The team remain blindly optimistic about independence, but evidence points otherwise: Iraqi Kurdistan\u2019s political elite are as factional as the football team.</p> <p>When the plane lands, the team keep their goodbyes brief, splinter into smaller cliques and return to their families dispersed across their nationless homeland. Mohsin, reunited with his wife and two little girls, is in reflective mood: \u201cI am like a fish in a pond who thinks that the entire world is that pond. But when it is put in the sea, it realises there is a whole world out there.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2016/oct/14/desert-fire-the-world-cup-rebels-of-kurdistan-video\">Watch Desert Fire, a new Guardian documentary about the Kurdistan team by Sebastien Rabas and Jack Losh</a></p>",
  "<p>Next month it will be the third anniversary of the publication of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/25/rbs-accused-business-profits-regulators\">my report</a> into banks\u2019 treatment of small and medium sized businesses. The main findings of my report related to the Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s turnaround division, global restructuring group (GRG). For those not familiar with the <a href=\"http://www.tomlinsonreport.com/docs/tomlinsonReport.pdf\">Tomlinson report</a>, I concluded that GRG was not only preventing customers from returning to health but were taking excessive fees and getting hold of businesses\u2019 assets in the process. [The bank has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/27/rbs-chief-mcewan-denies-profiteering\">denied these allegations</a>]. </p> <p>Earlier this week, BuzzFeed News and BBC Newsnight released shocking <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/heidiblake/dash-for-cash?utm_term=.kdr66zwp5#.bdQyygpDR\">leaked documents</a> that appear to provide proof to back up my findings. When Heidi Blake, a tenacious reporter from BuzzFeed News, first approached me with the documents I was hit by a mix of emotion \u2013 was I surprised by the content of the documentation? No. Was I surprised to see it in a written form after three years of denials from the bank? Yes.</p> <p>The files were perplexing in the simplicity of what they showed. Dated 2011, 2012 and 2013 and in the possession of the bank\u2019s top executive team, these files marked \u201csecret\u201d included policy and procedural statements about the purpose of GRG which demonstrated that the bank\u2019s top concern was to recover its position by taking excessive fees and interest; taking possession of assets/equity stakes and reducing the number of risk-weighted assets on RBS\u2019s books. </p> <p>Page after page of documentation boasts about the \u201cvalue added\u201d to the bank\u2019s balance sheet through GRG and the \u00a31.2bn of profit it gained from interest and fees. Despite RBS claiming GRG \u201csuccessfully restructured thousands of SMEs\u201d, the files showed just how few businesses actually returned to \u201chealthy\u201d and even when they did, the documents indicated it would be with higher fees and less assets in the long term. Possibly even different business owners.</p> <p>In contrast to their previous statements, RBS\u2019s Jon Pain (chief conduct and regulatory affairs officer) now <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3127472-RBS-response.html\">concedes that GRG had two purposes</a>: \u201cRBS has been very clear that GRG\u2019s role was to protect the bank\u2019s position, where possible by working with distressed businesses to return them to financial health\u201d. In other words: return businesses to health only if it was in the bank\u2019s interest. There is still no acknowledgement by the bank of the conflict of interest this lack of transparency presents. [RBS admits \u201cin the aftermath of the financial crisis ... we let some of our SME customers down\u201d, but <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3127472-RBS-response.html#document/p1/a321192\">denies it deliberately caused viable businesses to fail</a> and that it \u201cinappropriately targeted such businesses to transfer them to GRG or drove them to insolvency\u201d.]</p> <p>We can all agree that 2008-09 was a very different time and the banks had over lent, and needed to sort out their balance sheets. There is therefore nothing wrong in principle with the bank wanting to protect its position and \u201cget out\u201d of businesses it no longer wanted to support. GRG, however, went too far. </p> <p>As BuzzFeed News says: \u201cRBS systematically crushed British businesses for profit\u201d. The bank told the customer that GRG was taking over their relationship management to turn the business round, but then aimed to recover the bank\u2019s position through fees and property acquisitions. This is the crux of it. The bank may have had the right to pull a loan, even when the breach is only technical, but what GRG did was to tell the business it was there to help while gaining as much \u201cupside\u201d as it could before a formal administration process. </p> <p>The pressure is now on for the Financial Conduct Authority to publish its report. It has been three years and it has surely had access to this information so why the reticence to publish? The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/tomwarren/keep-it-confidential?utm_term=.ppojj52ab#.lhyee6v5M\">next instalment of the story</a> was released by BuzzFeed News on Wednesday, which suggests that governmental interference may play a part in this never-ending saga.</p> <p>We need to stop and collect ourselves about what is important here. People have lost jobs and businesses closed as a result of GRG, impacting on our economy. Enough damage has been done and it is now time that RBS admits its faults, puts its hands up and compensates those businesses for their losses so our SME sector can be reinvigorated to continue propelling our economic growth.</p> <p>An apology would be nice too\u2026</p> <p><em>Lawrence Tomlinson is</em><em> author of the Tomlinson report and</em><em> a former adviser to Vince Cable</em><em>. </em><em>He was e</em><em>ntrepreneur in residence at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills in 2013.</em></p> <p><strong>Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/small-business/\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.</strong></p>",
  "<p>David Lodge, who this year turned 81, is having a late look round his estate. In 2015 he published a memoir covering the first 40 years of his life, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/16/quite-a-good-time-to-be-born-by-david-lodge-review\" title=\"\"><em>Quite a Good Time&#xa0;to Be Born</em></a>, and now he\u2019s swept together half a dozen short stories written between 1955 and the early 90s and added a couple of more recent pieces, so that his admirers can form a view of his short fiction alongside the novels and literary criticism on which his reputation rests.</p> <p>Actually his most die-hard fans have been able to do this for a while, since the older stories collected here were widely published across mainland Europe in translation during the mid 90s, and in the UK in a limited edition by the Bridgewater Press in 1998. It seems likely that things might have stayed like that, had the French edition of the book not provoked an unexpected reaction in a reader. Philippine Hamen, a furniture designer, was so taken by the story \u201cThe Man Who Wouldn\u2019t Get Up\u201d that she designed a&#xa0;hybrid piece \u201cthat would allow the narrator to virtually stay in bed while being able to still work\u201d. Lodge, when he heard about it, was delighted and <a href=\"https://ikon-gallery.org/event/for-the-man-who-wouldnt-get-up-homage-to-david-lodge/\" title=\"\">brought it to the attention of the Ikon Gallery in Birmingham</a>, of which he and his wife are patrons. When Lodge\u2019s&#xa0;agent heard about this, he in turn suggested the present book to&#xa0;Vintage.</p> <p>All of which amounts to something like a short story itself, with its own amusing charm. In the main part of the&#xa0;book, however, things are less responsive to life\u2019s twists and turns. This is not quite to suggest that Lodge keeps an iron grip on his imagination. But it is to say that his short fictions are very modest in scope \u2013 despite the rather grandiose allusions he makes in an afterword, regarding their \u201cinter-textuality\u201d. They all have an easily comprehended narrative structure, an&#xa0;affably middle-brow tone, an uncomplicated sense of their time and&#xa0;place, and a clear moral (if not quite moralising) and intellectual framework. And&#xa0;they are all, in one way or another,&#xa0;about the same thing. Namely,&#xa0;the way in which people discover and react to the limitations that govern their lives.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/20/lost-in-a-pyramid-andrew-smith-mummy-stories-louisa-m-alcott-conan-doyle-shelf-life-rachel-cooke\">Tales from the tomb</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the title story the narrator, George, is depressed by \u201cthe combined weight of dissatisfaction with his environment and despair of ever significantly improving it\u201d, so rebelliously refuses to get out of bed. Implausibly enough, this makes him a minor celebrity in the wider world (a TV crew films him, as a result of which he gets a \u201cdeluge\u201d of mail: really?). At first his wife resents him, then respects him \u201cmore than ever before\u201d. But neither is&#xa0;any kind of cure for his mood. Although the first version of the story (Lodge tells us in the afterword) ended with the revelation that George\u2019s bed-lying was \u201cjust a dream\u201d, in this final version death comes to George \u201cin the form of the drab physical environment with which he had begun his withdrawal from life\u201d.</p> <p>The limits described in this story, in other words, are determined by things-as-they-are: by having to live in real time, surrounded by reality\u2019s hard truths. More partial and therefore slighter versions of the same point occur in the next two stories. One features a small boy who discovers that&#xa0;providence does not always produce reliable rewards, and the other&#xa0;offers a little parable of \u201chow capitalism exploits the workers\u201d.</p> <p>In the remaining six stories, Lodge applies his law of limitation to the relations between men and women. In settings which range from Ibiza in 1955 to a dramatic monologue that updates Browning\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/43768\" title=\"\">\u201cMy Last Duchess\u201d</a> , we meet a cast of men who are generally clumsy in their innocence, rigid in their assumptions, and prurient in their tastes (we get to hear about an awful lot of \u201cboobs\u201d). Much the same goes for the women, who are prissy, know-all, inept, bossy, money-grubbing and selfish. Emma, the bride-to-be in the final and most recent story in the book, \u201cA Wedding to Remember\u201d, is all these together. After rolling out plans for an extravagant wedding to a man too gutless to resist her, and then discovering he\u2019s unfaithful and no longer wants to get married, she hooks up instead with a \u201cconceptual poet\u201d whose masterwork is \u201ca transcription of the satnav instructions for a journey from Land\u2019s End to John O\u2019Groats\u201d.</p> <p>Limits, again. Emma can\u2019t accept the frustration of her plans, and adapts them to survive, just as the heroes and heroines of the previous couple-stories also adapt to survive \u2013 and might therefore seem to be models of empowerment. Yet the mood and message of the stories has very little to do with liberation. On the contrary, even when they are preoccupied by the change in sexual mores that occurred in the 60s, as many of them are, Lodge\u2019s characters seem unable to escape a blighted Larkinland where everyone is more or less deceived. Their language retains the beige tint of the mid-century. Their grasp of selfhood is never firm or convincing. It means the book as a whole has a distinctly old-fashioned feel, but also contains an element of bleakness that never goes out of date.</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;<em>The Man Who Wouldn\u2019t Get Up and Other Stories</em>&#xa0;is published by Vintage.

  "<p>Paul Nash is arguably the greatest war artist Britain has produced. The works that first earned him real renown,<em> We Are Making a New World</em> and <em>The Menin Road</em>, are iconic images of the trenches: with their splintered tree stumps and lumpy mud seas, they shockingly captured the annihilation of nature at bomb-blasted Ypres and Passchendaele. Nash found a new style of art to represent a new horror. Two and half decades later, more esteemed than ever and a war artist once again, he painted the unforgettable ocean graveyard of crashed German planes, <em>Totes Meer</em>.</p> <p>Nash is also one of the most interesting British landscape painters of the 20th century, much loved for his pictures that divine the \u201cspirit\u201d of Avebury, Wittenham Clumps and other English places with which he felt a strong, almost mystical, connection. His work <em>Wood on the Downs</em> (1929), a study of beech trees and chalklands, has been subject to constant reproduction since first exhibited, and its popularity is unsurprising: it is a hugely pleasing coming together of Englishness and modernistic art. His pictures found a refreshing, contemporary way to express a deeply felt communion with the English countryside \u2013 trees, paths, birds, hills.</p> <p>Nash\u2019s transformations of reality were the product of a visionary sensibility that harked back to William Blake and Samuel Palmer; he searched for inner meanings in the landscape, what he called the \u201cthings behind\u201d. Yet he also was constantly on the lookout, as he said, for \u201ca different angle of vision\u201d, and as such was alert to the new movements transforming art on the continent, including abstraction and surrealism. His solutions to the problem of how to represent the forms and patterns of nature changed throughout his career. One thing stayed the same, however: his pictures are strange, unsettling and rather melancholy, and are so appealing precisely <em>because</em> of their strangeness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ceb9922b42c83567eec48a51282d1dad9911cee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ceb9922b42c83567eec48a51282d1dad9911cee/0_0_2097_1595/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Nash\u2019s Wood on the Downs (1930).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"761\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Nash\u2019s Wood on the Downs (1930).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aberdeen Art Gallery &amp; Museums Collections</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is impossible to consider Nash without the influence on him of modernism, which began as early as the 1917-18 war pictures with the zig-zag vorticism of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/21/brilliance-artists-david-haycock-review\">Christopher Nevinson</a> \u2013 geometric planes and night skies sliced by searchlight beams. Nash\u2019s engagement with abstraction and surrealism took different routes through the late 1920s and 30s \u2013 in the exceptional <em>Winter Sea</em>, for example, begun in the mid-20s in Dymchurch, Kent, where moonlit waves become recessive straight lines and firm-edged blocks of colour.</p> <p>The dreamscapes of Magritte and De Chirico redirected his 1930s work \u2013 <em><a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/nash-blue-house-on-the-shore-n05048\">Blue House on the Shore</a></em> is lovely and disquieting, seemingly conjured in a reverie; while one oil, <em>Nocturnal Landscape</em>, seemed so Freudian that Nash said its interpretation would offer \u201cjam for the psycho boys\u201d. <em>Equivalents of the Megaliths</em> is different again, a meeting of deep history and maths: the standing stones at Avebury are reimagined as solid, abstract forms \u2013 cylinders, a girder and a white gridded screen \u2013 set down in a Wiltshire cornfield.</p> <p>While critics have recognised this engagement with modernism, many have preferred to dwell on Nash as a painter with a personal response to landscape, and to emphasise that his version of continental experimentalism was thoroughly domesticated. Several of the newspaper reviews of the last major <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-liverpool/exhibition/paul-nash\">Nash exhibition, at Tate Liverpool in 2003</a>, were typical in suggesting that he is best seen as part of an English tradition, that his efforts at surrealism are clunky (a Betjemanesque version of Magritte), and that the cubism he practised was merely a decorative, salon variety. His interest in abstraction and surrealism was not at his core, it has been argued, and such borrowed styles conflicted with his native gift.</p> <p>The exhibition about to open at Tate Britain challenges this head on. With over 160 works (the biggest show since the 1975 Tate retrospective), it is large enough to accommodate any interpretation of Nash, but it underlines his importance as a pioneering figure of the British avant garde. Here he is not only a romantic individual communing with the land, but a highly varied artist at the centre of networks of experimental creators. According to the curator Emma Chambers, the goal \u201cis not simply to move consideration of his art beyond the war work, but also to show aspects of his work beyond landscape. In the 1930s, still life, surrealism, found objects are all areas that Nash explored, and this is also a moment when he expanded his use of media into photography, collage and assemblage.\u201d The effect is to round out a major artist and make him even more beguiling.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Unsettling and melancholy, Nash\u2019s pictures are so appealing precisely because of their strangeness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In his writings of the late 1920s and early 30s, Chambers points out, Nash attacked the insularity of British art, and robustly defended abstraction; he was clearly on the side of the experimenters. Looking for new inspiration, he castigated what he called the \u201csafety first\u201d tendency of domestic art; the French, on the other hand, had \u201creached out, they have real mental daring\u201d. Over a decade, he responded with vigour to the ideas of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/pablo-picasso\">Picasso</a>, Cocteau, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/ernst\">Ernst</a> and other leading continental figures.</p> <p>Three episodes in his career are given special consideration in the new Tate show. In 1933, Nash helped found Unit One, a group that included the artists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/ben-nicholson\">Ben Nicholson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/henry-moore\">Henry Moore</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/barbara-hepworth\">Barbara Hepworth</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/nov/18/edward-burra-transgressive-painter\">Edward Burra</a> and the modernist architect Wells Coates. Announcing its creation, Nash wrote that \u201cUnit One may be said to stand for the expression of a truly contemporary spirit\u201d; an exhibition toured the country over the next couple of years. A room at the Tate brings together works from the Unit One artists, and showcases their catalogue. Though it remains difficult now to apprehend just how embattled they felt \u2013 what outliers they were in the English art world of the 1930s \u2013 this is a valuable attempt to relive what Chambers calls \u201can important moment\u201d for Nash, \u201cstaking out a place for modernist art in an unsympathetic environment\u201d.</p> <p>Three years later, Nash was an organiser of the International Surrealist Exhibition in London, which featured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/dali\">Dal\u00ed</a>, Andr\u00e9 Breton and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/joan-miro\">Mir\u00f3</a>, and caused something of a stir. One article dubbed Nash \u201cEnglish surrealist-in-chief\u201d. The Tate gives this episode some prominence too, and includes treatises on surrealism published at the time, as well as a number of Nash\u2019s paintings that were on display to the thousands of intrigued visitors in 1936. In one of these, <em>Harbour and Room</em>, a Magrittian meditation on sleep, dreams and death, a ship sails into an interior space and water laps towards a fireplace and mirrored wall. Outside meets inside, and it is odd indeed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05029a08034a7922562508f86905f8fa4f4ee450\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05029a08034a7922562508f86905f8fa4f4ee450/0_0_5398_4478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nash\u2019s Event on the Downs (1934).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"830\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nash\u2019s Event on the Downs (1934).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Government Art Collection, UK</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nash had a passionate affair in the mid-1930s with the surrealist artist Eileen Agar; together they looked about them, in town and country, for suggestive shapes and juxtapositions. The Tate presents a number of her photographs and objects (rocks, shells, wood, bones) alongside those of Nash, not least to highlight the variety of the nature art he was making \u2013 partly thanks to her. Found objects played a central role in many of his best-known surrealist works, for instance in <em>Event on the Downs</em> the gnarly tree stump and giant tennis ball in front of the white cliffs of the Dorset coast \u2013 where Nash and Agar first met.</p> <p>Asked to identify two significant lesser-known works in the Tate show, Chambers first identifies the urban still life <em><a href=\"http://artuk.org/discover/artworks/dead-spring-70498\">Dead Spring</a></em> from 1929, which depicts a dead pot plant and set of drawing instruments on the window sill of Nash\u2019s London flat overlooking an empty St Pancras advertising hoarding. This is the \u201cobserved reality\u201d, but the canvas is also a working through of cubist ideas of overlapping planes and multiple viewpoints.</p> <p>Chambers\u2019s second choice is the amusing <em>Forest</em> (1936-7), a surrealist wooden relief \u201cmade from glove stretchers slotted into a wooden backing; the stretchers metamorphose into tree forms while continuing to suggest hands\u201d. The work reflects Nash\u2019s interest in Ernst, who also metamorphosed landscapes and natural objects into \u201cstrange and contradictory states\u201d.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Nash\u2019s official identification with the surrealist movement was short-lived, though its ideas lasted longer. That it spoke to him at all was no doubt because he always had a kind of surrealist sensibility, one that emerged in his earliest paintings (\u201cSurrealism found me,\u201d he later claimed). From the beginning, after a mentor advised him to \u201cgo in for Nature\u201d, his work had a metaphorical quality, with things standing in for or implying something else (\u201cI have tried \u2026 to paint trees as though they were human beings,\u201d he said).</p> <p>The first room of the Tate exhibition has a dozen or so of the delightfully spooky ink and watercolour works that the young Nash made in 1911-13, and the lines of continuity between, say, <em>The</em> <em>Pyramids in the Sea</em> and his later work are clear to see. Here already is a kind of tension of opposites: a peculiar meeting of geometry and stormy waves, it shows the influence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/william-blake\">Blake</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/wbyeats\">Yeats</a> and symbolism; Nash at the time described the eclipsed moonlight as \u201cuncanny\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c738c298c70f309e537ebbe24a07a2606855759\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c738c298c70f309e537ebbe24a07a2606855759/0_0_1536_1070/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nash\u2019s Equivalents for the Megaliths (1935).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"697\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nash\u2019s Equivalents for the Megaliths (1935).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Nash/\u00a9Tate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then came the war, which was slow to affect him, but when it did caused emotional devastation. The Tate show doesn\u2019t include many of his wartime works but has several of the most important ones; it is a testament to their power that they remain disturbing despite their familiarity. When 25-year-old Lieutenant Nash first arrived at the Ypres trenches in the spring of 1917 he wrote home expressing something like ecstasy. As an artist drawn to new ways of seeing nature and landscape, the battlefields offered a strange vision \u2013 \u201cwonderful ruinous forms\u201d. And in fields pocked with shell holes, with trees torn to shreds and reeking of poison gas, flowers bloomed everywhere: \u201cThis place is just joyous, the dandelions are bright gold over the parapet.\u201d</p> <p>Late in May, he fell heavily, broke a rib and was sent home. Just a few days later, his unit was engaged in an offensive and was almost wiped out; he knew how lucky he had been. When he returned to Flanders in the aftermath of Passchendaele, this time as an official war artist, he no longer found any trace of beauty or rejuvenation. That was when he wrote the haunting, often quoted letter to his wife, Margaret, that is on display at the Tate:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2016/may/27/black-dog-the-dreams-of-paul-nash-dave-mckean\">Black Dog: Dave McKean delves into the dreams of war artist Paul Nash \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I have seen the most frightful nightmare of a country more conceived by Dante or Poe than by nature, unspeakable, utterly indescribable \u2026 Sunset and sunrise are blasphemous, they are mockeries to man \u2026 The rain drives on, the stinking mud becomes more evilly yellow \u2026 the black dying trees ooze and sweat and the shells never cease \u2026 I am no longer an artist interested and curious, I am a messenger \u2026 Feeble, inarticulate, will be my message, but it will have a bitter truth, and may it burn their lousy souls.</p> <p>The years after the Armistice were difficult; Nash was, in his own description, a \u201cwar artist without a war\u201d; he suffered a nervous collapse, and was visited by terrible images; poison gas had damaged his lungs. What\u2019s more, he had money worries and enemies in the art world. With the exception of the angular bleakness of <em>The Shore </em>and other Dymchurch paintings, along with his illustrations for an edition of Genesis, his work during much of the 1920s indicates he took a long time to recuperate.</p> <p>Late in the decade he started to respond to a new visual stimulus, as exhibitions of avant-garde international art began to be staged in London. His imagination was set free once more. A man who had a fervent attachment to the English land but never a settled home, he lived in various locations \u2013 Iden, Rye, Swanage, Hampstead \u2013 finding particular places that spoke to him and new ways of representing them. Even after his most obvious surrealist phase was over, he continued to think about \u201cobjects as personages\u201d, for instance in his late-1930s photos of animal-like fallen trees, which he called \u2018\u201cmonsters\u201d. During his life he identified different kinds of monsters, from rusted anchors to Dorset dinosaurs to bomber planes; it was another way of rendering the English pastoral uncanny.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"671ad591a28d0241a54446cc52fedf43d9d176f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/671ad591a28d0241a54446cc52fedf43d9d176f1/0_105_2953_1772/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flight of the Magnolia (1944) by Paul Nash.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flight of the Magnolia (1944) by Paul Nash.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Tate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The disorientations of surrealism also prepared him for painting the wreckage of shot-down German planes when another war arrived in 1939 and he was attached to the RAF and Air Ministry. The Tate exhibition includes photos he took of the twisted metal carcasses of wrecked enemy aircraft at a vast dump at Cowley, near Oxford. These fed directly into <em>Totes Meer</em>, and are of more interest than Nash\u2019s more naturalistic and propagandist pictures of planes. The set piece <em>Battle of Britain</em>, with its swooping vapour trails against vivid blue, and <em>Battle of Germany</em>, with its fiery explosion-red sky and huge moon, are among his late masterpieces, though given their subject matter they seem to offer almost too much beauty.</p> <p>Nash painted right up to his death in 1946, and the work in the final room of this marvellous show is bold and surprising, and certainly visionary \u2013 how else to describe a huge sunflower head spinning down a hill, or a great magnolia flying in the sky? He had been ill for a while, and the \u201caerial flowers\u201d were a presentiment of death, though the sun paintings refer to eternal cycles of nature and rebirth. These late pictures are less cerebral, and have an air about them of letting go; the brushwork is freer too. The direct influence of modernism was now in the past, but he was caught up, as ever, in looking at the world and seeing patterns and mysterious \u201cthings behind\u201d. An artist both full of wonder and wonderful, knowing the end was near, painted pictures that were stranger than ever.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Paul Nash</em> opens at Tate Britain, London SW1, on 26 October. <a href=\"http://tate.org.uk/visit/tate-britain\">tate.org.uk/visit/tate-britain</a>.</p>",
  "<p>There was a surprise slowdown in Britain\u2019s construction industry in August, although statisticians played down any link between the dip and Brexit jitters.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/constructionindustry/bulletins/constructionoutputingreatbritain/aug2016\">construction output had fallen by 1.5% in August</a>, after a rise of 0.5% in July. That defied expectations of a small increase of 0.2% in a Reuters poll of economists and will add to fears the sector acted as a drag on overall economic growth in the third quarter. </p> <p>The ONS cautioned that monthly data could be choppy and noted that the drop in construction in August had been driven by a 5.1% fall in infrastructure output. That subsector of the construction industry covers big projects such as windfarms, roads, railways and nuclear plants and its output data can be volatile. Infrastructure output rose by 6.1% in July.</p> <p>\u201cConstruction output has fallen back quite sharply in recent months and contracted by 1.5% in August. As the fall this month is led by infrastructure, it seems unlikely that post-referendum uncertainties are having an impact,\u201d said the ONS\u2019s senior statistician, Kate Davies. \u201cMonthly construction data can be quite erratic, so we would warn against trying to read too much into one set of figures.\u201d</p> <p>Looking at the underlying pattern of construction, which makes up 6% of the economy, output decreased by 1.3% in the three months to August from the previous quarter. In year-on-year terms, August\u2019s output was up just 0.2%.</p> <p>Survey responses from construction firms in September pointed to conditions in the industry stabilising but it still looked vulnerable, said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, which publishes polls on the industry. Its <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/construction-sector-housebuilding-post-referendum-slump-brexit-vote\">latest report on construction suggested the sector bounced back from a post-referendum slump last month</a> after a surge in housebuilding.</p> <p>Williamson said: \u201cUK construction activity fell sharply in August, putting the sector on course for its worst quarter in four years and at risk of heading back into recession.</p> <p>\u201cSurvey data provides a ray of hope, suggesting conditions may have stabilised in September, but it\u2019s clear that the sector remains under pressure from widespread uncertainty about the economic outlook and that growth has, at the very least, consequently slowed considerably since earlier in the year.\u201d</p> <p>There are hopes that measures in Philip Hammond\u2019s autumn statement next month, such as a possible push on housebuilding, could bolster the construction sector.</p> <p>But Scott Bowman, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the environment was generally tough for construction firms. \u201cConstruction\u2019s fortunes are unlikely to improve much in coming quarters as the Brexit vote weighs on the sector,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe do think the leave vote will have more of an impact on the sector in the coming quarters \u2013 due to the large-scale, irreversible nature of many projects. What\u2019s more, recent reports suggest that the labour shortages that have been weighing on the sector are still firmly in place.\u201d</p> <p>The figures follow news last week of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/07/uk-industrial-output-manufacturing-trade-deficit-office-national-statistics\">a fall in industrial output in August</a> and a widening in Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world. That data broke a run of upbeat reports on the UK\u2019s post-referendum economy. </p> <p>The mixed outlook, and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/10/pound-continues-to-fall-against-dollar-and-euro-amid-hard-brexit-fears\">the pound\u2019s dramatic slump on worries over a potentially damaging hard Brexit deal</a>, leave the Bank of England in a difficult position as it decides whether to cut interest rates further next month. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">Official borrowing costs were trimmed to a record low of 0.25% in August</a> and policymakers have hinted they could be cut further, to about 0.1%, before the end of the year.</p>",
  "<p>Lav Diaz\u2019s The Woman Who Left is a vast, dark behemoth of mystery and anguish, as forbidding as a starless night sky. This is the film that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/10/the-woman-who-left-wins-venice-film-festival-as-nocturnal-animals-runnerup\">won Diaz the Golden Lion</a> at this year\u2019s Venice film festival and took the Filipino director\u2019s global reputation to a new level. Running as it does at a mere three-and-three-quarter hours, it is a squib compared to his other works, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/19/coming-to-a-cinema-eight-hour-film-lunch-break-philippines\">eight-hour</a> A Lullaby to the Sorrowful Mystery, which he premiered at Berlin in February. <br></p> <p>Its forbidding sombreness makes it a challenge until the viewer recalibrates their expectations of rhythm and tempo; you must readjust to something slower even than the walking pace of conventional social realism. Diaz works on the movie equivalent of geological time. His movie has no closeups \u2013 there is just one medium shot of his heroine \u2013 and it is strange to come to the end of such a long movie with only a hazy idea, or none at all, of what the characters actually look like. It is in austere monochrome, made even more daunting by Diaz\u2019s love of darkness in all senses \u2013 his unhurried, unlit sequences are something to compare with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/17/pedro-costa-director-horse-money-cavalo-dinheiro-gil-scott-heron-interview\">Pedro Costa\u2019s sepulchral images</a> of Fontainhas in Lisbon or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/07/stray-dogs-review-tsai-ming-liang-uncompromising\">Tsai Ming-liang</a>\u2019s street scenes.

His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jul/17/norte-end-history-film-you-should-watch-video\">Norte, the End of History</a> was freely adapted from Dostoevsky\u2019s Crime and Punishment. The Woman Who Left is inspired by (rather than strictly adapted from) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/leonikolaevichtolstoy\">Tolstoy</a>\u2019s short story <a href=\"http://www.online-literature.com/tolstoy/2061/\">God Sees the Truth, But Waits</a>. (By the end, it reminded me more of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_Sergius\">Father Sergius</a>.) </p> <p>In Tolstoy\u2019s story, a merchant grows old in prison, having been wrongly convicted of murder as a young man; a middle-aged criminal arrives, boasting of his life of wrongdoing, and from the details, the old man realises that he is the actual culprit. </p> <p>Diaz takes the idea on from its endpoint: it is 1997, radio news reports announce it to be the era of the Hong Kong handover and the deaths of Princess Diana and Mother Teresa. There is poverty, crime, kidnappings. (It is not mentioned, but this is when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/rodrigo-duterte\">Rodrigo Duterte</a> was beginning his tough-guy political career in the Philippines.) <br></p> <p>Horacia (Charo Santos-Concio) has served 30 years for a murder she didn\u2019t commit. Then the actual culprit \u2013 who was Horacia\u2019s friend \u2013 commits suicide in prison, leaving behind a confession, revealing that Horacia\u2019s ex-boyfriend Rodrigo Trinidad (Michael de Mesa), now a wealthy gangster, was behind it all, and had her framed. </p> <p>Horacia, institutionalised and having long since lost touch with anyone on the outside, is briskly released.

So she sells her modest property and heads for the big city where Rodrigo is in the habit of attending mass in the cathedral \u2013 and she buys a gun. A hunchbacked vendor of <em>balots</em>, bird embryos sold in their shells as street food, tells her about the rich criminal classes swaggering around among the poor. A lonely woman with mental difficulties befriends her and shows her the cathedral. We appear to be inching, slowly, towards payback.</p> <p>Then a kind of miracle happens: Horacia befriends a transgender prostitute called Hollanda (John Lloyd Cruz) who has been badly beaten up. Looking after this poor soul becomes her new mission \u2013 and she realises that this has allowed her to rediscover a moral meaning to her life.</p> <p>The themes of God and judgment are all around. The <em>balot</em> seller tells Horacia that he believes God has cured his sick child. She has many conversations with him in the fathomless darkness.

Now, I had to reveal my secret. </p> <p>I\u2019m a strong, black, ex-military man from Chicago, a city that\u2019s seen 560 murders <a href=\"https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/2016-chicago-murders\">so far</a> this year. Coming from that community, where masculinity and violence are celebrated \u2013 where any sign of weakness is punished with fists or knives \u2013 I would\u2019ve been attacked for my fear. But for most of my life, I was afraid of the dark.</p> <p>In relationships, I\u2019d cradle my lovers in a delicate but firm cuddle until they went to sleep, acting as their protector when I was the one who needed protection. I\u2019d slip off into my living room, or theirs, and sleep with the lights on, professing that I must have dozed off while watching TV, cleaning the kitchen, looking for loose change. </p> <p>This was a much more awkward excuse if I slept at the woman\u2019s apartment. Back then, I didn\u2019t think it was a problem. I hadn\u2019t consistently slept in the dark since before I was eight. It was my normal.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you, a toddler?\u201d My older brother poked fun at the little light plugged into the wall. It had the cutest baby blue color shielding its glare. Though only eight, I felt younger, smaller, more defenseless. We lived in arguably the most dangerous projects of Chicago\u2019s South Side, the Robert Taylor Homes. Knifings, shootings and rapes could clearly be heard outside my window. Didn\u2019t he understand why I couldn\u2019t be in darkness?</p> <p>I grappled with how to respond. \u201cJust wanted to see how the room looked.

I\u2019d litter the floor of my apartment with objects, then \u201cforget\u201d they were there, in order to corroborate this myth.</p> <p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s smart,\u201d a friend remarked, with a smirk. \u201cSure you\u2019re not scared of the dark?\u201d We both laughed, him harder than me.</p> <p>Joining the navy, I wagered my phobia wouldn\u2019t be an issue.

I\u2019d never felt so overwhelmed.</p> <p>As usual, I panicked at night. But now I also jumped whenever shadows eclipsed me. I\u2019d bypass dimly lit corridors and stairwells. Black cars passing me produced lasting, electric chills.

  "<p><a href=\"http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0333.1\">A new study</a> has just appeared in the <a href=\"http://journals.ametsoc.org/toc/clim/current\">Journal of Climate</a> which deals with an issue commonly raised by those who deny that human-caused climate change is a serious risk. As I have written many times, we know humans are causing the Earth\u2019s climate to change. We know this for many reasons. <br></p> <p>First, we know that certain gases trap heat; this fact is indisputable. Second, we know that humans have significantly increased the amount of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. Again, this is indisputable. Third, we know the Earth is warming (again indisputable). We know the Earth warms because we are actually measuring the warming rate in multiple different ways. Those measurements are in good agreement with each other.</p> <p>Of course there is other evidence too. For instance, ice loss across the globe is widespread: in the Arctic, the Antarctic ice shelves, Greenland, and from land glaciers. Sea levels are rising as warm water expands in volume and as melt waters flow into the ocean. We are also seeing changes of weather patterns and climatic zones shift. The point is, there is a whole body of evidence that proves the climate is changing and the change is caused largely by human emissions of greenhouse gases. </p> <p>Over the years, contrarians have looked for evidence that the climate either isn\u2019t changing or the change is not as fast as predicted. Their findings have often been used in the media to suggest that human-caused climate change was not something to worry about. But we\u2019ve seen, over and over and over again, that these contrarian arguments don\u2019t hold up. <br></p> <p>Repeatedly, mainstream scientists have taken these claims seriously and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/apr/11/climate-change-research-quality-imbalance\">discovered they were just plain wrong</a>. In some cases, the contrarians have made simple arithmetic errors (like mixing up a negative and positive sign in their equations), while in others, they have made more fundamental errors. But regardless, they have been wrong time after time. But whenever they are found to be wrong, they just go and find some new piece of evidence that once again calls into doubt our understanding of the human-climate link. <br></p> <p>One contrarian argument has appeared repeatedly over the past few years, even at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/18/ted-cruz-fact-check-which-temperature-data-are-the-best\">a hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce</a> held by Ted Cruz in 2015. The claim was by well-known contrarian <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/John_Christy_blog.htm\">John Christy</a>. Christy claimed that the mid-troposphere temperatures (temperatures in approximately the middle of the atmosphere) are rising three times faster in climate models when compared with measurements. Another related claim is that there has been no statistically significant warming in the troposphere (lower part of the atmosphere) for 18 years. <br></p> <p>Now, both of these facts, even if they were true, would not prove much. We know the Earth is warming because of measurements in oceans, underground, and at the Earth\u2019s surface. But it would open a question as to why the atmosphere is behaving differently.</p> <p>The recent paper just published looked at these two claims. The authors found errors in the analysis that, when corrected, debunked the contrarian claims. Let me explain some of the science. </p> <p>First, these atmospheric temperatures are measured by satellites which can \u201csee\u201d the temperature of gases in the atmosphere. It works differently from a thermometer but regardless, such measurements are possible. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/18/ted-cruz-fact-check-which-temperature-data-are-the-best\">These measurements have a lot of uncertainty</a>. <br></p> <p>First of all, as the Earth warms from greenhouse gases, the upper part of the atmosphere should cool down. A simplistic but appropriate description is that greenhouse gases hold the heat down toward the Earth, making the upper atmosphere cooler. Since the satellites see both the upper and lower parts of the atmosphere, the cooling upper region may contaminate the measurements of the warming lower part of the atmosphere.</p> <p>A second source of uncertainty is that the satellites themselves are not perfect. When satellites are launched, they orbit the Earth for a number of years until they are replaced by new satellites. The data, which goes back to 1979, is actually stitched together from multiple satellites in sequence. No two satellites are completely identical \u2013 sort of like no two thermometers will give exactly the same temperature. These differences have to be rectified and are another source of error.</p> <p>Additionally, the satellites change while they are in orbit, in particular they lose altitude and their orbiting time drifts (the time they pass certain global locations drifts later and later in the day). Both of these facts contaminate the measurements and must be accounted for. There are other accuracy issues as well that space doesn\u2019t permit discussion, but you get the point.</p> <p>So, this recent paper did a few things. First, they took the contrarian argument that the mid-troposphere temperatures have been rising at only 1/3 the rate predicted by models. They found that Christy\u2019s team neglected the contamination of the cooling in the upper stratosphere. When they applied this correction, they found that Christy\u2019s claim was incorrect. Differences between modeled and observed warming rates were much smaller, and had known explanations. <br></p> <p>Next, the authors asked whether it is true that there has been no warming in the lower atmosphere (troposphere) in the past 18 years. They found that for five of the six groups that provide satellite temperature analysis, this claim was also incorrect.</p> <p>Finally, they asked whether it is true that the temperature changes in different layers of the atmosphere are in disagreement in models and measurements. Their result is that when temperature changes in different layers of the atmosphere are compared, one of three satellite records is in close agreement with the climate models. <br></p> <p>While this paper largely debunks the most current contrarian mainstay, it doesn\u2019t answer all of our questions. For instance, exactly how accurate are these satellite measurements and how can they be made better? Do the models capture all of the thermal processes which are occurring, especially in the middle and upper layer of the atmosphere? Why does there appear to be a small difference in the satellites and the model predictions in the middle of the atmosphere? Is this difference important? </p> <p>These questions can be answered, but a prerequisite is a continuation of high-quality data from satellites. This means a continued commitment to launching new measurement satellites as the current fleet ages.</p>",

Meaningful representation of young people, beyond the photo ops, still leaves much to be desired within the system. But during Ban\u2019s term important steps were accomplished, such as establishing the position of the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/youthenvoy/\">UN secretary general\u2019s envoy on youth</a>, and security council <a href=\"http://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sc12149.doc.htm\">resolution 2250</a> on youth, peace and security. </p> <p>What impressed me the most was hearing Ban speak in his home country during the <a href=\"http://outreach.un.org/ngorelations/conference/\">66th UN Department of Public Information/NGO conference</a>, in Gyeongju in South Korea. He was not afraid to address controversial societal issues such as LGBT rights, which he said he wanted to be part of his legacy along with youth empowerment. While he might have had a tough time at first stepping out of the charismatic shadow of his predecessor, Kofi Annan, I am grateful for everything Ban has achieved in his quiet but decisive way.

Yet there is one metric by which we should measure his performance, because it forms the historical bedrock on which the UN was built \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/17/un-united-nations-peacekeepers-rwanda-bosnia\">its response to the slaughter of innocent civilians</a>.</p> <p>While the UN could, and very likely should, be criticised for its lack of meaningful intervention in times of conflict (look no further than Syria today) it is perhaps even more shocking when this intervention fails to protect those who need it most.

Yet, when placed in the context of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1995/jul/12/warcrimes.balkans\">massacres at Srebrenica</a> and in Darfur, it becomes part of a gruesome pattern of systemic failure at the UN. It is a pattern that was sustained under Ban\u2019s stewardship, emerging again in the war crimes in Sri Lanka, in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/26/head-un-mission-central-african-republic-pledges-end-troop-abuses-minusca-parfait-onanga-anyanga\">abuses by UN peacekeepers in Central African Republic</a>, and in the re-emergence of hostilities only months ago in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/06/un-peacekeepers-refused-to-help-south-sudan-rebels-raped-aid-workers-report\">South Sudan</a>.</p> <p>Will Ban be remembered for this? It is hard to say. What is perhaps most disheartening is that, in this regard, his UN is virtually indistinguishable from Annan\u2019s, from Boutros Boutros-Ghali\u2019s. While the UN may have been under new management during Ban\u2019s term as secretary general, it was certainly business as usual.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Eimhin O\u2019Reilly, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland</strong><br></li> </ul> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/feb/09/ban-ki-moon-world-un-humanitarian-summit-conflict-leadership\">Ban Ki-moon: \u2018Close the gap between the world that is and the world that should be\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>He promoted equal rights</h2> <p>Throughout Ban Ki-moon\u2019s 10-year term, the South Korean has been subject to many criticisms. But there have also been a significant number of successes. While it is true that the UN has suffered in many aspects, in particular relating to its lack of involvement in the Syrian civil war, Ban has triumphed in areas such as his role as a supporter of LGBT rights (especially notable given South Korea\u2019s less than welcoming stance on homosexuals). He has also presented <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/12/last-generation-tackle-climate-change-un-international-community\">strong opinions on climate change</a>, an increasingly important problem. Perhaps the most important issue he has tackled is women\u2019s rights. Gender equality has been a concern for decades and, once appointed as UN secretary general, Ban not only pioneered the creation of <a href=\"http://www.unwomen.org/en/about-us/about-un-women\">UN Women</a>, but also increased the number of women employed by the UN. This was a very important step in the quest for equal rights, not only throughout the world, but also within the UN itself. We cannot lay the blame for the organisation\u2019s recent failures solely on one man, nor can we attribute to him all its accomplishments. We can, however, appreciate what he has done in trying to improve the world in which we live. <br></p> <ul> <li><strong>Sofia Srdanovic, gap-year student, UK</strong> </li> </ul>",
  "<p>When I published my novel, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/fishermen.html\"><em>The Fishermen</em></a>, last year, one of the most common \u2013 and most surprising \u2013 questions I received was about my intended audience. This question, I came to discover, is frequently asked of writers who have a similar provenance to mine. In the past few years, writers have responded in various ways. One reaction comes from a group of writers \u2013 including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/04/taiye-selasi-stop-pigeonholing-african-writers\">Taiye Selasi</a> \u2013 who have sought to nix the idea of the \u201cAfrican\u201d writer\u2019s identity. Others, many of whom live in Africa, have argued that the solution is to play up their identity to an extreme \u2013 seeking to be read chiefly <em>because</em> of their origin rather than in spite of it.</p> <p>In a recent article, Nigerian writer Eghosa Imaseun argued that provincial writing is always political, objecting to the way things are explained unnecessarily for international audiences. For example: \u201cIf you write \u2018He dipped his hand into the <em>eba</em>\u2019, a phrase will follow to explain that <em>eba</em> is \u2018that yellow globular mashed potato clone made from Cassava chippings\u2019.\u201d His frustration is evident: \u201cYou\u2019re like, \u2018Arrghhh, don\u2019t explain it, they can Google it!\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/16/chigozie-obioma-booker-nominee-haunted-student-years-northern-cyprus\">Chigozie Obioma: the ghosts of my student years in northern Cyprus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Contrast this with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/wolesoyinka\">Wole Soyinka</a>, writing in the introduction to his new translation of Yoruba novelist DO Fagunwa\u2019s work. Soyinka describes how he translated the phrase \u201c<em>Mo nmi ho bi agiliti</em>\u201d as \u201cmy breath came in rapid bloats like the hawing of a toad\u201d. This aroused a protest from a Yoruba critic who complained about Soyinka\u2019s choice, noting that <em>agiliti</em> is a lizard not a toad. Soyinka concedes the point, but asserts:</p> <p>But neither toad nor lizard is the object of action or interest to the hero Akaraogun or his creator Fagunwa at this point of narration. Fagunwa\u2019s concern is to convey the vivid sense of event, and a translator must select equivalents for mere auxiliaries where these serve the essential purpose better than the precise original. In what I mentally refer to as the \u201centhusiastic\u201d passages of his writing, the essence of Fagunwa is the fusion of sound and action. To preserve the movement and fluidity of this association seems to be the best approach for keeping faith with the author\u2019s style and sensibility.</p> <p>To me this is, in many ways, a precise thesis on creative writing, a rephrasing of the most cardinal of all writing rules: show don\u2019t tell. When we compare Soyinka\u2019s view with Imaseun\u2019s argument, we see glaring disparities. Writers who are most concerned with provincialism \u2013 with pleasing a particular base of readers \u2013 are probably not concerned with conveying \u201cthe vivid sense of event\u201d. Such a writer will almost always falter in his writing, and yield, more often than not, to telling rather than showing.</p> <p>Suppose the African author wants to write about the <em>molue</em>, the iconic Lagos bus, and simply refers to it mid-sentence. He might praise himself, or be praised by defenders of this kind of politicised provincialism, for having been brave or authentic. But what does a reader see? Just a bus. There is no doubt that a reader who lives in Lagos might be at an advantage. But if a writer describes it as \u201ca beat-up squeaking yellow-painted bus with a constant metallic rattle\u201d, everyone, including the Lagos reader, will have a clear image of such a bus, as it has been rendered in vivid detail. All readers \u2013 Ibekwe in Lagos, Ataman in Kayseri, Lars in Bremen, Abhinav in Assam, or Jane in Ann Arbor \u2014 will see and hear this bus and capture it in their minds. I\u2019m not convinced that this can be achieved by merely using the word \u201cmolue\u201d. </p> <p>What is more baffling is that not even the defenders of provincialism believe they would be able to convey such a vivid sense of something by simply mentioning it without describing it to the reader. Imaseun provides an answer: \u201cGoogle it.\u201d Thus, a writer, in the name of political defiance, has abstained from his duty and tasked the reader with research. In an age when we complain of short attention spans and books compete with variegated media, some contemporary writers compel their readers to be distracted. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"80b3a062fe3e74efc744c36e3e7823b45d82d67a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80b3a062fe3e74efc744c36e3e7823b45d82d67a/1446_0_3072_3840/800.jpg\" alt=\"Chigozie Obioma\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chigozie Obioma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even if we assume that everyone reading our books will have access to Google at the time they read, one could still argue that if a reader looks up <em>molue</em>, they may not get the picture of a <em>molue</em> bus in all its eccentricity. The description of a <em>molue</em> cannot be complete until there has been a description of its unique sound. For this, the reader might need to consult YouTube as well. The writer\u2019s work, which should have been self-sufficient, would have failed in this most important of missions. It would have been aided by the work of another artist \u2013 a photographer, or a blogger, or a cinematographer. But if the writer had chosen to simply describe the bus, every one of the writer\u2019s readers \u2014 Ibekwe, Ataman, Lars, Abhinav, Jane \u2013 would see, feel and hear the <em>molue</em>, and so would Chinaza in Lagos, even if it pricks his ego that the account does not defer only to him. But that would not, should not, matter. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Labels are of little consequence to my work: I could be an\u00a0Igbo writer, a Nigerian writer, or\u00a0Nebraskan</p> <footer> <cite>Chigozie Obioma</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Labels are meaningless or of little consequence to my work. I could be an Igbo writer, a west African writer, a Nigerian writer, a black writer, or even a Nebraskan writer. But suppose I\u2019m asked to select a particular audience and write for them as some writers claim they do. Then who will this audience be? Will it be the people of Nigeria? If so, why? Why am I thinking in terms of national borders? Do I even believe they exist? Nigeria, to me, is a foreign idea, which, as I have consistently maintained, needs to be rethought. Can one pick and choose what one wants to accept from the fallout of colonisation?</p> <p>Even if I choose to say that I write for Nigerians, this term is too encompassing to reach down to everyone. Can I claim that my grandmother would know what a <em>molue</em> is? I doubt if she does. If I say that I write for Igbo readers, this audience still does not include everyone, for even within that tribe, there are a lot of differences in dialects. And, then, why write in English, if my work is for the Igbo people? Why not write in Igbo? Suppose I choose to write in Igbo for the people of Umuahia in eastern Nigeria, will that suffice? Because then, I gain my granny as an audience. How then can I comfortably define my provincial base? Bear in mind, also, that I was not born in Igboland, but in Akure where another language, Yoruba, is spoken. So, how might I feel about leaving out the people of Akure by selecting a provincial base? Does it feel right? I think not. And to succeed, one must make the best and right decision in all circumstances, for \u201cwriting is decision-making\u201d, as the American writer Steve Almond once said.</p> <p>An American writer writing about New York need not think about provinciality, and is less constrained by such encumbrances simply because most people know what and where New York is. As a child of nine, I\u2019d learned all the 50 states in the US and their capitals by heart. I can guarantee that unless the child is born to a Nigerian immigrant family, you will not find an American child with any geographic knowledge about Akure. Akure is simply, in a global context, unimportant. In truth, most Americans know close to nothing about Nigeria, but no Nigerian, even in the remotest of villages, can make a similar claim about the US. Thus, because of the obscurity of the nation, it would be foolhardy to set your book in Lohum, or Tse-Agberagba, with no explanation of its geography, and dare your American or Serbian reader to consult Google. Even most people in Abuja or Lagos do not know where those places are.</p> <p>By the time I had finished a first draft of <em>The Fishermen</em>, I had moved to the United States. I began to wonder how the book would be received in this age of societal prickliness, of adopting the position of the marginalised as the most gracious vantage, and in which it takes so little to offend people. In writing about a madman, would I be accused of stigmatising mental illness? If people in the west were going to read the book, would they be turned off by the familial \u201cviolence\u201d? How about women \u2013 might most western women not worry that the subservient position of the mother in the novel is misogynist? And, as for Nigerians who have a national culture that somehow prohibits or sneers at any negative portrayal or criticism of their country to outsiders (As an Igbo proverb puts it: \u201cWe do not speak ill of our father\u2019s farm to a stranger\u201d), how would they receive my argument that Nigeria has failed? The list was endless.</p> <p>In the end, I asked myself, what is true about what I know? What is honest? Isn\u2019t the familiar \u201cviolence\u201d of corporal punishment a norm in Nigeria? Why, then, should I be afraid to capture it so? Wouldn\u2019t it be false to do otherwise? If I know of women, most women of my childhood, who are wholly subservient to their husbands, why then should I worry about offending western women? And if I believe that, when compared with other countries with similar resources, Nigeria has failed, why should I be concerned that some Nigerians think otherwise? I came to the conclusion that I should not care about any of these potential concerns. I should write only what seems to me to be honest, and aim to craft a novel with the grace of the novels I admire. To me, this should be the aim of great fiction. To do otherwise is to negate the very nature of literature.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/29/jalada-africa-short-story-ngugi-wa-thiongo-translated-over-30-languages-publication\">Short story by Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o translated into over 30 languages in one publication</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Activist intrusion into the writer\u2019s imagination always interferes with literary truth. I believe that fiction, with its untrammelled nature, speaks to no one, and by so doing, speaks to all. It must transcend boundaries, time and space, like Eleanor Catton\u2019s <em>The Luminaries</em>, Ben Okri\u2019s <em>The Famished Road</em>, or Arundhati Roy\u2019s <em>The God of Small Things</em>. In these books, these writers produce images of worlds rendered in the most vivid of details that become recognisable to any percipient reader no matter where they live, have lived, or what their level of geographical exposure. A memorable chapter in Roy\u2019s novel begins with this astonishingly detailed description of \u201cMay in Ayemenem\u201d:</p> <p>May in Ayemenem is a hot, brooding month. The days are long and humid. The river shrinks and black crows gorge on bright mangoes in still, dustgreen trees. Red bananas ripen. Jackfruits burst. Dissolute bluebottles hum vacuously in the fruity air. Then they stun themselves against clear windowpanes and die, fatly baffled in the sun. The nights are clear, but suffused with sloth and sullen expectation \u2026</p> <p>A provincialist might ask, does someone in Ayemenem not know this is how the weather and seasons are? Why then does Roy need to tell us? She must be aiming it at a western audience. Yet she has artistically magnified the ordinary to anyone who lives in Ayemenem or Kerala. She has transformed the ordinary into art. The Ayemenem she describes is now both a real and a fictional place. Through this duality of vision, Roy achieves the height of her craft. This is what an African writer who is constrained by a demand for provincialism prevents himself from achieving.<br></p> <p>Matthew Arnold, in his seminal essay \u201cThe Literary Influence of Academies\u201d, referred to provincial prose as \u201csecond-rate\u201d. A work tending towards provincial prose is defective, he said, and work done after writers have transcended provinciality is \u201cclassical; and that is the only work, which in the long run, can stand\u201d. The non-western writer whose work exudes provincialism for the mere sake of protest rather than some artistic impulse is a radical without a cause.</p> <p>\u2022 Chigozie Obioma\u2019s <em>The Fishermen</em>, now out in paperback, is published by ONE.</p>",

  "<p>Four RAF Typhoon fighter jets will arrive in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan\">Japan</a> next week to take part in their first-ever drill with the Japanese air self-defence force, as the countries deepen their security ties amid heightened tension over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/us-will-sharpen-military-edge-in-asia-pacific-says-pentagon-chief\">Chinese military activity</a> in the East and South China seas.<br></p> <p>While British and Japanese officials insist the joint exercise, which begins at Misawa airbase in north-east Japan next Friday, is not intended to send a message to Beijing, Britain has joined Japanese warnings against any attempt by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a> to restrict air or sea travel in the region. </p> <p>\u201cThe purpose of this exercise is to enhance tactical skills of Japan air self-defence force unit and strengthen Japan-UK defence cooperation. We have no specific country or region in our mind,\u201d Japan\u2019s defence ministry told the Guardian.</p> <p>Japan and Britain have \u201cshared fundamental values\u201d and \u201ccommon strategic objectives to maintain the rules-based international order\u201d, the ministry added, using language Japan has often used in pressuring Chinese ships and aircraft to refrain from entering waters and airspace near the disputed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/senkaku-islands\">Senkakus</a>, a group of islands in the East China Sea that are administered by Japan but also claimed by China, where they are known as the Diaoyu.</p> <p>\u201cDespite its decision to leave the European Union, Japan expects the UK to continue to contribute to world peace and stability as a global power.\u201d</p> <p>The Typhoons will leave Japan for Osan airbase near Seoul to take part in their first joint drill \u2013 called Invincible Shield \u2013 with fighter pilots from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/south-korea\">South Korea</a> and the US.

The exercise will also be the first time pilots from Japan\u2019s air self-defence force have flown alongside those from another country apart from the US.</p> <p>The joint drill at Misawa, which ends in early November, was agreed during security talks between the British foreign and defence secretaries and their Japanese counterparts during talks in Tokyo in January.</p> <p>The four fighters are being accompanied on the long journey from RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland by Voyager tanker aircraft, C-17 Globemaster and C-130J Hercules transport aircraft, and 170 RAF support personnel.</p> <p>Brig Gen Yoshiyuki Sugiyama, the air self-defence force\u2019s chief of staff, told reporters that Japan wanted to \u201cenhance its interoperability with the British air force\u201d through the drill.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s defence secretary, Michael Fallon, said: \u201cJapan is our closest security partner in Asia and I want to significantly deepen defence cooperation between our two nations.\u201d</p> <p>Japan\u2019s defence ministry recently requested a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/31/japan-defence-ministry-record-budget-counter-chinese-north-korea-nuclear-threat\">record 5.17tn yen (\u00a340bn) budget</a> to counter growing Chinese military activity near the islands. Tokyo has also voiced support for the south-east Asian countries protesting against China\u2019s controversial artificial island building campaign in disputed areas of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/south-china-sea\">South China Sea</a>.</p> <p>\u201cBritain is concerned about the general security environment in Asia rather than specifically the East and South China Sea issues,\u201d said Tetsuo Kotani, a senior fellow at the Japan Institute of International Affairs, adding that partnership with Japan was the best way to demonstrate its commitment to the region. \u201cThis is more of a \u2018show the flag\u2019 operation by the UK,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Wing Commander Roger Elliott, who will take part in the drills, described the deployment as \u201cthe most ambitious ever involving the Typhoon force, and probably the most ambitious deployment the air force has done to the far east\u201d.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s ambassador to Japan, Tim Hitchens, said: \u201cWe want to continue to further deepen and broaden UK-Japan defence cooperation in the coming years.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Sony\u2019s PlayStation VR headset launches this week, offering a more affordable and intuitive introduction to the concept than the likes of the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. All you need is a PlayStation 4, a PlayStation Camera \u2013 and the \u00a3350 headset itself of course.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve taken the plunge into virtual gaming, here are the nine games we\u2019d recommend trying first.</p> <h2>Rez Infinite (Enhance Games, \u00a325)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b791627c9e2fd61a030d9f696c0b6ee8fc59fdd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b791627c9e2fd61a030d9f696c0b6ee8fc59fdd9/18_0_600_360/500.jpg\" alt=\"Rez Infinite\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rave flyers and ancient architecture \u2026 Rez Infinite.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Enhance</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The reboot of Tetsuya Mizuguchi\u2019s cult rhythm shooter Rez may deliver familiar content, but its a tremendous fit for VR. The on-rails, sonic journey through a world built from rave flyers and ancient architecture is a wonder to explore via a headset, and delightfully reminiscent of the VR vision the 1990s promised, and promptly failed to deliver. </p> <h2>Tumble VR (Supermassive Games, \u00a38)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"660581177a3b25389fe426454612b94e6ceb8630\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/660581177a3b25389fe426454612b94e6ceb8630/319_0_7196_4320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tumble VR\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Understated gem \u2026 Tumble VR.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supermassive Games</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If Sony\u2019s headset brings an understated gem to the table, it is surely Tumble VR. This simple puzzle game sees players piling up blocks to meet various goals, whether reaching for height, deflecting lasers or building round obstacles. The pleasure is in the highly tactile nature of selecting and placing blocks, making it feel very much like a simulated form of Jenga. Atypically meditative in contrast to its launch lineup stable mates, Tumble VR is as rewarding as it is modest. </p> <h2>EVE Valkyrie (CCP, \u00a355)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a5aa4fb8ec0e5d67c9b0d5feb9df3934de8b27c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a5aa4fb8ec0e5d67c9b0d5feb9df3934de8b27c/60_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"EVE Valkyrie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dogfighting in space \u2026 EVE Valkyrie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CCP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since the prototype Oculus Rift rekindled affection for VR, the traditional 3D space shooter has enjoyed a return to prominence. The reason? Glancing around and out your cockpit as you dogfight in the stars is a beguiling notion, and as there\u2019s no character movement, it\u2019s much easier on those who have limited space or are prone to motion sickness. In practice, everything works rather well, and while Valkyrie isn\u2019t perfect, it hammers home a VR fantasy many have waited a considerable time to experience: shooting aliens from inside a cool spacecraft. </p> <h2>Batman: Arkham VR (Warner Bros, \u00a316)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a9081eca3fa15deafde3b2c4561b3871d4f0aa3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a9081eca3fa15deafde3b2c4561b3871d4f0aa3/0_0_588_353/500.jpg\" alt=\"Batman Arkham VR\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dark Knight as detective \u2026 Batman Arkham VR.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Devoted to the Dark Knight\u2019s role as detective, Batman: Arkham VR highlights the fact that virtual reality can be at its strongest when shunning action. Here the emphasis is on a series of scenes where the Caped Crusader gathers clues and solves crimes. Rocksteady\u2019s game may be too fleeting for some, but it offers an astounding sense of presence \u2013 that feeling you really are inhabiting its world. And seeing yourself reflected in a mirror wearing the bat suit is an extraordinary moment.</p> <h2>Super Hypercube (Kokoromi, \u00a325)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9720cfdb60e51d791a0d78de5e8cff169bcf13ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9720cfdb60e51d791a0d78de5e8cff169bcf13ae/0_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tetris on acid \u2026 Super Hypercube\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Super Hypercube.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kokoromi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Best described as a cross between Tetris and Super Hexagon, Kokoromi\u2019s trippy, first-person puzzler has players reorganising clusters of blocks in order to navigate a series of approaching walls \u2013 each with a specifically shaped gap to slip through. The virtual reality element is subtly used, allowing clusters to be viewed from all angles, and the minimalist, hyper-colourful design makes for a highly sensual environment. This is a beautifully constructed score chaser.</p> <h2>Thumper (Drool, \u00a316)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97ab2436c8f3a03b33883ac9d88f7a122c619c77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97ab2436c8f3a03b33883ac9d88f7a122c619c77/27_0_938_563/500.jpg\" alt=\"Thumper\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cosmic obstacle course \u2026 Thumper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drool</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Billed as a rhythm violence game, Thumper is a sort of cosmic obstacle course swirling through a bullet hell shooter. The simple controls have you piloting a metallic beetle along a galactic track, hitting buttons to take corners, leap over barriers and fire missiles, all to a driving electronic beat. Designed by ex-members of the Harmonix team (makers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/06/rock-band-guitar-hero-music-games-returning\">Guitar Hero and Rock Band</a>), it\u2019s a visually astonishing test of timing and coordination.</p> <h2>Job Simulator (Owlchemy Labs, \u00a324)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b50b28e8acf72ec30ba7f905689a5f9b840203c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b50b28e8acf72ec30ba7f905689a5f9b840203c/0_0_1499_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Job Simulator\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boisterous anti-realism \u2026 Job Simulator.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Owlchemy Labs</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Transporting players to a cartoonish realm, Job simulator demonstrates VR\u2019s capacity to host a new form of comedy. This is a game that \u2013 through anarchic simulations of careers from chef to office worker \u2013 offers a boisterous anti-realism. It perhaps makes a strength of unruly interaction, but is delightfully silly, and perfect for introducing friends to VR. </p> <h2>PlayStation VR Worlds (Sony, \u00a325)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7183d7fd60789a9fbf828ef288c319d074ef4e14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7183d7fd60789a9fbf828ef288c319d074ef4e14/480_183_3294_1977/1000.jpg\" alt=\"London Heist\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mini-gangland drama \u2026 London Heist.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sony</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This collection of short VR experiences, developed by Sony\u2019s in-house studios give a polished and varied introduction to the technology. London Heist is a mini-gangland drama with some truly astonishing moments of embodiment, while Ocean Descent is a picturesque diving experience, and Street Luge is an interesting urban racer with a quite dizzying sense of speed. Another launch title that\u2019s great for showing off the headset to curious friends and neighbours.</p> <h2>Headmaster (Frame Interactive, \u00a316)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54f0b97550423e805d0409c39ae0680a145b3b3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54f0b97550423e805d0409c39ae0680a145b3b3f/50_0_938_563/500.jpg\" alt=\"Headmaster\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Football heading sim \u2026 Headmaster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frame Interactive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Developed during a virtual reality game jam co-sponsored by Valve, the comedic influence of the Portal developer is clear in this football heading sim. Set in a sort of sporting prison camp players have to successfully complete a series of heading tests, using just the requisite body movement to control the ball into a variety of tests and targets. It\u2019s weird, funny, challenging and compelling, the lack of handheld controls adding to the easy, intuitive feel. An offbeat take on the sports sim that really makes the best of the hardware.</p>",
  "<p>After a day of extraordinary statements \u2013 attacking women who have accused him of sexual assault, and invoking shocking antisemitic tropes \u2013 Donald Trump exercised what might be seen as a rare degree of restraint.<br></p> <p>Speaking to a Cincinnati arena filled with roughly 15,000 people on Thursday night, he merely insulted the state\u2019s Republican governor, mocked Hillary Clinton\u2019s health and watched as his supporters treated the press with the same affection that lions in the Coliseum treated Christians.</p> <p>Earlier, in the first full day after Trump faced a barrage of accusations of groping and sexual misconduct from nearly a dozen women, the Republican nominee went on the offensive. At a rally in West Palm Beach, Florida, he suggested that he would never have sexually assaulted one woman who came forward \u2013 because she was unattractive. </p> <p>\u201cTake a look.

He described the women who alleged sexual assault against him as \u201chorrible people, they\u2019re horrible horrible liars\u201d. Trump insisted that the press as a whole was \u201cfalse and slanderous in every respect\u201d and said \u201cthe depths of their immorality is absolutely unlimited\u201d.</p> <p>The outbursts came less than a week after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-forced-into-apology-as-sex-boast-tape-horrifies-republicans\">a leaked tape was revealed</a> of Trump bragging about grabbing women \u201cby the pussy\u201d and enthusing: \u201cWhen you are a star they let you do anything.\u201d</p> <p>At the same rally Trump also warned darkly about Clinton meeting \u201cin secret with international banks to plot the destruction of US sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers\u201d.</p> <p>Jonathan Greenblatt, the head of the Anti Defamation League, promptly denounced the statement, which bore similarities to antisemitic tropes like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion\">Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a>:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JGreenblattADL/status/786672319452291074\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TeamTrump\">@TeamTrump</a> should avoid rhetoric&amp;tropes that historically have been used ag.

The Trump campaign has not responded to multiple requests for clarification from the Guardian.<br></p> <p>By the end of the day \u2013 and yet another devastating news cycle for his campaign \u2013 Trump finally arrived in Cincinnati for a rally in a packed arena.</p> <p>The Republican nominee yet again mocked Hillary Clinton\u2019s health, insisting she did not have the strength to deal with China \u2013 \u201cIf she goes down in Tiananmen Square they\u2019ll just leave her there.\u201d</p> <p>He also took an indirect swipe at the Ohio governor, John Kasich. \u201cI would have honored my pledge but some people lost so badly they couldn\u2019t,\u201d Trump said, referring to the non-binding pledge that RNC chair Reince Priebus encouraged all GOP candidates to sign in 2015, in order to thwart a Trump third-party candidacy.</p> <p>Trump later renounced the pledge, saying in March 2016 \u201cwe\u2019ll see who [the nominee] is\u201d and complaining that he hadn\u2019t been treated fairly. Kasich, who was the last candidate to stay in the race against Trump, has said he will not vote for either the Republican nominee or Hillary Clinton in November.</p> <p>The Cincinatti rally was marked by unprecedented hostility from the crowd towards the press. Although Trump supporters have long disdained the media and faced the press pen to lambast reporters during Trump\u2019s speech, this time the traveling press were booed and jeered for minutes after their arrival.</p> <p>The only positive feelings towards any of the press were expressed when a single Trump supporter cheered praise for a reporter for InfoWars \u2013 a fringe rightwing website that traffics in conspiracy theories including the claim that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are literally demons.</p> <p>Clinton, on a fundraising trip to the west coast, said that Trump\u2019s behavior had driven her to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/clinton-california-calls-landslide-victory-trump-bigotry-bullying\">looking at pictures of cats</a> on the internet as a diversion.</p> <p>\u201cIt makes you want to turn off the news.

Iran\u2019s participation is in doubt, possibly as a result of the dire state of its relations with Saudi Arabia. </p> <p>Kerry will brief the UK, French and German governments in London on Sunday, on his way back from Switzerland. </p> <p>The ministers go into the Lausanne meeting with low expectations, diplomats said. The best of the likely outcomes would be a humanitarian pause in the bombing of eastern Aleppo for two or three days to allow some basic humanitarian supplies to reach the embattled rebel-held districts, home to 275,000 people. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/ground-down-by-savagery-the-agony-of-aleppo\">Ground down by savagery \u2013 the agony of Aleppo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The US state department said Kerry would also use the meeting in Lausanne for side meetings on the mounting civilian death toll from the conflict in Yemen, and in particular the Saudi investigation into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/08/saudi-led-coalition-airstrike-hit-yemen-funeral-officials-say\">coalition bombing of a funeral hall</a> in Sana\u2019a on Saturday. Human Rights Watch said the bomb used in the airstrike, which killed more than 140 people, was made in the US.</p> <p>Officials in Washington are downbeat about the chances that such short truces in Syria, even if agreed, will ever be implemented. One European diplomat said Moscow was in no mood for compromise because it felt a military victory was possible. </p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t care whatever we say about humanitarian law. Obviously they believe that they can win, that the Syrians can win on the ground. They believe Aleppo can fall,\u201d the diplomat said. </p> <p>Lavrov said he wanted a smaller meeting in Lausanne to allow for \u201cbusinesslike\u201d discussions among countries with direct influence on the course of the conflict, rather than the much larger forum of the International Syria Support Group. </p> <p>Kerry\u2019s flight to Switzerland comes only 12 days after he called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/03/us-russia-syria-bombing-campaign-aleppo\">an end to bilateral talks</a> with Russia on the Syrian conflict. The state department said it never excluded the possibility of meeting Lavrov in multilateral settings but nevertheless Kerry arrives in Lausanne with little leverage, having admitted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/01/syria-strikes-audio-john-kerry-russia-warns-us\">to Syrian opposition leaders</a> and allied diplomats that he lost the argument inside the administration for a tougher position towards Russia and its Syrian government ally. </p> <p>The administration review began with a meeting of top national security and foreign policy officials on 7 October, after it was clear that US-Russian talks on a ceasefire had entirely collapsed. <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-options-exclusiv-idUSKCN12D2B2\">According to Reuters</a>, a second high-level meeting will be held on Friday. </p> <p>Military options will be included in the review as a matter of course, but any policy likely to bring US and Russian forces into head-on confrontation will almost certainly be discounted. The administration does not see the outcome of the struggle between the Assad regime and the armed opposition as a matter of direct national security. It ranks protecting the US and its allies from terrorism as its first priority in Syria, followed by the destruction or degradation of Islamic State and al-Qaida networks. Supporting the coming offensives on the Isis hubs of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria rank higher on the list of priorities than humanitarian relief and the political transition in Syria, according to officials who have been briefed on the policy review.</p> <p>The most likely outcome of the review is thought to be a new set of sanctions aimed at individuals, ministries and military units deemed to be responsible for the use of bunker-buster and incendiary bombs on residential areas, and the targeting of medical facilities. </p> <p>However the EU is unlikely to follow the US lead on new sanctions. The renewal of existing sanctions on Russia for its encroachment on Ukraine is due in December and is in doubt at a time when Russian counter-sanctions are affecting some EU member states after an already poor year for agriculture.</p> <p>\u201cNew sanctions? I really don\u2019t feel it on the European side,\u201d the European diplomat said. </p> <p>The belief in some western capitals that eastern Aleppo will fall by the end of the year was challenged by Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington. Lister said the densely populated area could only be captured by ground troops and the Syrian army was too demoralised and disorganised to carry out the offensive, leaving Russia, Iran and the Assad regime to rely on Hezbollah and other Shia militias to do the job.</p> <p>\u201cEastern Aleppo is an intensely urban combat environment and if there\u2019s one thing we know about these militia forces, it\u2019s that they have a poor track record of offensive urban warfare operations,\u201d Lister said.</p> <p>\u201cThe key here is how heavily Hezbollah is involved on the ground, as they\u2019re perhaps the only force that has truly demonstrated a capacity for success in urban fighting. The opposition has also planned a substantial counter-offensive on pro-regime lines south-west of the city, as well as other offensives in Hama and Latakia which would seek to draw regime resources away from any Aleppo operation.\u201d</p> <p>Lister added: \u201cUltimately, the opposition\u2019s key strengths are its knowledge of eastern Aleppo\u2019s terrain and the regime\u2019s substantial manpower shortage. There\u2019s little doubt that Aleppo will eventually fall should current events continue as they are, but I wouldn\u2019t bet on the battle for the city being quite as quick or easy as the prevailing narrative currently suggests.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<h2>1) Arsenal face Bradley bow looking to build on late escape </h2> <p>Everything about Arsenal\u2019s performance at Burnley screamed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/02/arsenal-arsene-wenger-20th-anniversary-burnley-mustafi\">late Wenger era</a>. Manchester City\u2019s defeat at Tottenham gave them the opportunity to make a statement and as such the pressure was on; the game was tricky but hardly impossible. They delivered a performance devoid of intensity, purpose and conviction. Only Alexis S\u00e1nchez appeared not to deem the indignity of effort beneath him. Then, in the final seconds, everything changed, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Laurent Koscielny contriving the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/02/burnley-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">most glorious finish imaginable</a>. </p> <p>None of this necessarily means anything because every season, Arsenal find a new rhythm for a familiar riff. But recent signs are encouraging, and a visit from Swansea is precisely what they need next. Its significance is symbolic as well as routine because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/02/arsenal-swansea-city-premier-league-match-report\">this was a game they botched last season</a> amid rancour and recrimination, that confirmed another year without a league title. This time, Swansea arrive at the Emirates in a state of flux, following the unfathomable folly of appointing an experienced international manager instead of a novice. Never has ambition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/09/ryan-giggs-swansea-interview-ambitions\">been so severely lacking</a>. Bob Bradley will make a difference \u2013 he will certainly make them tougher \u2013 but not immediately. So, Arsenal have a chance to force home the impact of that late winner and, while a win will do, they need to win wellto show the country that this time they really do mean it. <strong>DH</strong></p> <ul> <li><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/13/olivier-giroud-backed-arsene-wenger-arsenal\">Wenger: I can rely on Giroud in big games</a></em></li> <li><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/13/arsene-wenger-england-manager-backs-gareth-southgate\">Wenger backs Southgate for permanent England role</a></em></li> <li><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/10/leicester-riyad-mahrez-arsenal-interest\">Mahrez: Arsenal were interested in signing me</a></em></li> </ul>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/14/bob-bradley-prepares-to-make-premier-league-debut-with-swansea-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/57dqf\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2805180\"            data-video-name=\"Bob Bradley prepares to make Premier League debut with Swansea \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"PLP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5800a584e4b01ffb8ffcb8d3\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/14/161014bradley_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/14/161014bradley.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/14/161014bradley_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/14/bob-bradley-prepares-to-make-premier-league-debut-with-swansea-video\">Bob Bradley prepares to make Premier League debut with Swansea</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>2) Moses mishap could make room for F\u00e0bregas</h2> <p>After making <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/02/chelsea-antonio-conte-victor-moses-hull\">his first Chelsea start</a> in more than three years just before the international break, Victor Moses faces the prospect of being denied two in a row, even if the Nigerian FA has questions about the severity of his injury. If Moses is unavailable for Saturday\u2019s visit of Leicester City to Stamford Bridge, Antonio Conte may opt to abandon the 3-4-3 formation that he tested successfully at Hull City, where Moses excelled as a left wing-back. That might just open a route back into the starting lineup for Cesc F\u00e0bregas. His sparkling display against Leicester <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/20/leicester-city-chelsea-efl-cup-third-round-match-report\">during the League Cup win at the King Power</a> last month earned a first Premier League start of the season four days later, but he was swept away during Chelsea\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/24/arsenal-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">abject defeat by Arsenal</a>, and omitted from the team who won at Hull. Conte has probably already made up his mind about F\u00e0bregas, who is unlikely to get many more chances to change it.

Under Mauricio Pochettino, they have become reliable and predictable, but in the best possible way. Regardless of who plays, there will be exuberance, intensity and creativity. But there is still a doubt as to whether such an energetic way of playing can be sustained through a season, all the more given Spurs\u2019 Champions League obligations. There must be a temptation for Pochettino to rest players this weekend, given he faces a Tuesday trip to Leverkusen and a November comprised of three London derbies and two more European ties. The problem is that West Brom are difficult to beat, particularly at the Hawthorns and, though Spurs now have greater strength in depth, Pochettino is as reliant upon his best players as any manager.

No problem. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/03/pochettino-guardiola-eriksen-spurs-manchester-city\">Spurs did expose City</a> \u2013 to limited extent, but nonetheless. They are not the unbeatable, impregnable force that had been suggested, and have flaws that cannot be obscured by tactical genius: their defence is suspect and their midfield is nowhere excellent enough to monopolise possession such that it becomes irrelevant. As such, any team prepared to go at them will cause them problems and Everton are certainly capable of doing that. Ronald Koeman has organised their defence remarkably quickly \u2013 only Spurs have conceded fewer \u2013 and the protection <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/23/everton-idrissa-gueye-i-am-a-perfectionist\">afforded it by Idrissa Gueye</a> gives the rest of the side licence to attack. If Romelu Lukaku has a good day, he is a handful for any defence \u2013 likewise Ross Barkley \u2013 while the pace and enterprise of Yannick Bolasie and S\u00e9amus Coleman will compromise the midfield overloads of which Pep Guardiola is so fond. Alternatively, City will just wipe the floor with them. <strong>DH</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/13/ronald-koeman-republic-of-ireland-james-mccarthy-everton-martin-oneill\"><em>Koeman claims Republic of Ireland exertions are \u2018killing\u2019 McCarthy</em></a></li> <li><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/kevin-de-bruyne-has-chance-of-playing-for-manchester-city-against-everton\">De Bruyne could make Manchester City return against Everton</a></em></li> <li><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/everton-oumar-niasse-ronald-koeman-roberto-martinez\">Oumar Niasse: \u2018It\u2019s really sad.

But for all the noise about his side\u2019s new home, Slaven Bilic\u2019s biggest problem so far this season has been injuries. Andy Carroll, Gokhan Tore, Sam Byram, Arthur Masuaku, Diafra Sakho and Andr\u00e9 Ayew are all unavailable, though the return of Aaron Cresswell will solve a left-back issue that has caused problems in attack as well as defence. </p> <p>At Selhurst Park they will find a Palace side in excellent form, <em>kvelling</em> after three wins from four, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/18/crystal-palace-stoke-city-premier-league-match-report\">Andros Townsend</a> and Christian Benteke already nicely integrated into the starting XI. West Ham have struggled in midfield, on the wings and in attack \u2013 but most of all defensively. They will need to be focused and organised, because Palace will not hang about while they play themselves in. And it is not just Townsend and Benteke of whom they need to beware \u2013 the roaming pace, trickery and drive of Jason Puncheon and Wilfried Zaha completes an attacking quartet good enough to bother teams far better than West Ham.

The club\u2019s money may come from outside the UK, but its identity most certainly does not. With Walter Mazzari <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/19/walter-mazzarri-praised-for-instilling-winning-mentality-at-watford-juan-camilo-zuniga\">still getting to know his players</a> and experimenting with various formations and combinations, performances have fluctuated. Watford played well in defeat against Chelsea, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/18/watford-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">beat Manchester United handsomely</a> and won at West Ham, but also lost badly to Burnley and Arsenal. In so doing, they have scored more goals than every side between ninth and 20th in the table, and fewer than only four, with the form of Troy Deeney and \u00c9tienne Capoue of particular influence. If those two play well again this weekend then Middlesbrough, whose only league win of the season came against Sunderland, will be in all sorts of trouble. <strong>DH</strong></p> <ul> <li><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/when-saturday-comes-blog/2016/oct/11/working-football-clubs-coventry-city-crystal-palace\">What two interns learned from working at football clubs 15 years apart</a></em></li> <li><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/13/atlantic-league-good-european-club-football\">Would an Atlantic League be good for European club football?</a></em></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e460315475e692a3539477efe99ed2c5aaf8bd2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e460315475e692a3539477efe99ed2c5aaf8bd2e/0_171_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u00c9tienne Capoue has thrived in a more advanced role, scoring four league goals already this season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u00c9tienne Capoue has thrived in a more advanced role, scoring four league goals already this season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah McKay/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>8) Reorganised Burnley face big test at Saints</h2> <p>Sean Dyche has deviated from his habitual 4-4-2 in recent weeks and the change has paid dividends, allowing Burnley to gain more control in midfield by deploying Steven Defour, Jeff Hendrick and George Boyd together. Burnley are likely to stick with that plan for Sunday\u2019s trip to St Mary\u2019s, especially with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/23/burnley-andre-gray-four-match-ban-twitter\">Andre Gray still suspended</a>.

But they have yet to face a side with the attacking verve and variety of Manchester United, which may test the top half\u2019s most porous defence.Liverpool have the advantage of a manager now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/07/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-energy-giver\">more than a year into his reign</a>, his side grooved into a system while United still seek one, more reliant on moments and individuals.

  "<p>Do you look at other people\u2019s lives and compare them to your own? Does this make you question whether you are smart, fit or happy enough? </p> <p>If so, then you may be a perfectionist. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/22/am-i-a-perfectionist-google\">Writing for the Guardian earlier this year</a>, clinical psychologist Linda Blair described a perfectionist as a person:<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/22/am-i-a-perfectionist-google\"> </a>\u201cwho strives for flawlessness, for a perfect creation, outcome or performance ... They find it difficult to delegate, even if that means neglecting their health, relationships and wellbeing in pursuit of a \u2018perfect\u2019 outcome.\u201d</p> <p>According to some studies, this is something that <a href=\"http://time.com/70558/its-not-you-its-science-how-perfectionism-holds-women-back/\">largely affects </a>women. A US survey <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8072739.stm\">in 2009 </a> found that women are also more likely than men to experience feelings of inadequacy at home and at work, and a larger proportion felt they failed to meet their own high standards.</p> <p>These insecurities are well-documented in the world of work: in 2011, the Institute of Leadership and Management found<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/05/the-confidence-gap/359815/\"> half of female managers, compared with fewer than a third of the male ones, reported self-doubt in their performance</a>. An internal survey of women working at Hewlett-Packard also found women applied for a promotion only when they <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified\">met 100% of the qualifications. Men applied when they met just 50%</a>. <br></p> <p>The desire to be perfect seems to influence thinking from a young age: research by <a href=\"https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/\">Girlguiding UK</a> found that a quarter of seven- to 10-year-old girls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/04/girls-as-young-as-7-feel-pressure-to-be-pretty-body-confidence-girlguiding-study-reveals\">felt the need to be perfect</a>. </p> <p>Perfectionism can have serious implications: it\u2019s been linked to <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/crazy-life/201201/the-vicious-triangle-perfectionism-anxiety-depression\">anxiety and depression</a>, and the health and happiness of young women is a growing concern. In fact a NHS study found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/29/self-harm-ptsd-and-mental-illness-soaring-among-young-women-in-england-survey\">28.2% of 16- to 24-year-olds</a> have a mental health condition, with one in four women aged 16 to 24 experiencing anxiety, depression, panic disorder, phobia or obsessive compulsive disorder.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/29/self-harm-ptsd-and-mental-illness-soaring-among-young-women-in-england-survey\">Mental illness soars among young women in England \u2013 survey</a> </p> </aside>  <p></p> <p>We decided to explore this topic with our readers, asking for young women\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/01/young-women-pressure-perfect-education-looks-work-relationships-social-media\">experiences and stories of perfectionism</a>. We received 134 responses \u2013 with an average age of 25. For a lot of young women who contacted us, body image was a huge preoccupation and many said they felt undervalued unless they met society\u2019s expectations of beauty. The pressure to be perfect also extended to the workplace, withmany respondents talking about feeling inadequate at their jobs or experiencing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome\">impostor syndrome</a>. They also complained of feeling the pressure to have it all: juggling being a mother with career and other personal pressures.</p> <p>Social media has a big role to play in influencing women\u2019s outlook on this issue. Miranda, 18, from Cambridge summed this up: \u201cI certainly feel the pressure to be perfect and it has got to the point where it\u2019s damaging my health. Social media is the main culprit. I had to delete my Instagram account because it would actually make me cry. I am a mature person with a firm grip on reality, but I have so many peers whose lives seem so perfect and sociable that it left me feeling worthless and lonely.\u201d<br></p> <p>The impact of all this pressure on women\u2019s mental health and wellbeing was notable, with many experiencing anxiety, eating disorders and depression. We approached five women to find out more. Here are their stories:</p> <h2>Chardine Taylor-Stone, 31, who works in the arts in London</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05f632f08e7dc7954deec3883ab82222a2b30301\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05f632f08e7dc7954deec3883ab82222a2b30301/0_408_5976_3584/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chardine Taylor-Stone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The pressure to be perfect feels heightened to me as a black woman.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a child I felt pressure to be a certain kind of perfect, so I wanted to look pretty and nice while my male cousins were running riot, that sort of nonsense. I wanted to marry a man and get a job.<strong> </strong>Now I am an adult my aspirations have changed and I am a lot more confident about who I am. I\u2019ve broken out of those narrow expectations, but I still feel a lot of pressure in terms of my career.</p> <p>I am one of few black working-class women<strong> </strong>in my industry,<strong> </strong>which is dominated by white men. Most of the black women I see in the arts are personal assistants;<strong> </strong>none of them are working in a position that gives them autonomy \u2013 although they usually end up running a lot of things anyway.</p> <p>I definitely have impostor syndrome; that\u2019s defined as self-doubt and a sense of intellectual fraudulence that<strong> </strong>overrides any feelings of success. I didn\u2019t have this so much before, when I was working in call centres, but I feel it now in a predominantly upper-middle-class environment. It\u2019s weird being the only person of colour or the only one with a certain accent \u2013 it makes you feel as though you shouldn\u2019t<strong> </strong>be there. I sometimes suffer so much anxiety about sending an email, worrying about whether I will phrase it correctly. It\u2019s silly because I\u2019ve done well and proven myself, I have my own flat and a good job, yet that doesn\u2019t feel good enough.</p> <p>The pressure to be perfect feels heightened to me as a black woman because my mum always told me I would have to work harder than a white person to get ahead. It is true but it\u2019s a self-defeating aspiration.</p> <p>Perfection, or what society deems perfect, is not attainable for everyone, but it feels even further away for a woman of colour. The image of perfection is a certain physical type: a skinny woman with blond hair etc. Those things are not even half attainable to you, and you sometimes feel you were born imperfect.</p> <h2>Salma Al-Hassan, 18, student at Warwick University, from Oxford</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fb541dcb703a9b51cdbef77fc74cc3eb3e34932\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fb541dcb703a9b51cdbef77fc74cc3eb3e34932/140_248_1773_1376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Salma Al-Hassan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"776\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I wish I could be more relaxed about how I look.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Salma Al-Hassan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I feel the need to look perfect all the time. I am not sure where this obsession comes from but social media definitely makes it worse.</p> <p>I got Instagram when I was 14 and growing up with it has really affected me. I spend ages scrolling through the site and seeing images of women with perfect hair and makeup, thinking I should look like them \u2013 even though a lot of the time the pictures have been altered. I have always felt self-conscious about my hair because it wasn\u2019t long and straight like the girls I saw online. I would see all my friends with their silky long hair, so easy to brush, and think: \u201cI want that.\u201d I got hair extensions to make my hair longer, which cost a lot but now I am trying to love my natural afro hair again. I want to embrace my natural curl.</p> <p>Social media also brings the pressure of getting lots of likes; a lot of people post at \u201cprime time\u201d, which is about 5pm, when everyone is online. I know friends who will say: \u201cIf I don\u2019t get 40 likes I am deleting the picture.\u201d I\u2019m not majorly worried about this, although I have deleted photos before, but afterwards thought: \u201cThat was stupid and I shouldn\u2019t care what other people think.\u201d</p> <p>Another source of pressure for me, personally, comes from the fact that the media has become obsessed with a particular aesthetic for mixed-race and black women. We are only deemed attractive if we have tiny waists and large hips and lips. Over the past few months I have started to become very self-conscious about my lips, which are not as full and beautiful as other black women\u2019s. I don\u2019t have plans to get plastic surgery, but if I did get anything done it would be lip fillers because it just seems to be a fashion thing now \u2013 lot of celebrities get it done.</p> <p>I wish I could be more relaxed about how I look: I am getting better gradually but I still always try to look good, and always put on makeup. While nowadays there is definitely a much more diverse idea of what beauty is, there are still stupid stereotypes which people are stuck in, myself included. There is still a long way to go for women to accept themselves for who they are.</p> <h2>Anna Robertshaw, 37, a yoga teacher from Tunbridge Wells<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3e73107a1b396900492b6f33f2fce2b568aa12c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3e73107a1b396900492b6f33f2fce2b568aa12c/259_67_2446_1468/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Robertshaw\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018From the outside my life looked great, but inside I was struggling.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Robertshaw</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My early 20s were a bit of a whirl. I got pregnant with my eldest at 23, which was wonderful; at the time I was still together with my husband,<strong> </strong>who was my childhood sweetheart. After our son was born we set up home in Tunbridge Wells and I quit my job to become a full-time mother. My husband had a wonderful and well-paid job and so we moved into a beautiful home, and it wasn\u2019t long before my second son came along. Then, when he was five months old, I got pregnant with my third boy.</p> <p>From the outside my life looked great, but inside I was struggling. I felt a lot of pressure to be a perfect mum, and this got worse when my boys started school. I couldn\u2019t help but compare myself to other mothers, and to think their children were really polite and wellbehaved. I felt lost and had no confidence in my ability to raise my boys in a way that was right for me.</p> <p>Depression and anxiety came on thick and fast. I was prescribed antidepressants, but I soon realised they were not for me. I remember sitting out in the garden, feeling so detached from my boys. It was like I was looking at them through a screen. I stopped medication and sought other means of help, eventually finding homeopathy and yoga.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/29/young-women-ptsd-mental-health\">This is modern Britain \u2013 no wonder young women have PTSD | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My life took a different course after this, and I separated from my husband. Part of my recovery was letting things go, and starting to take charge of my life and think about what was right for me. For so long, I had fitted into everyone else\u2019s idea of who I should be, and I was so afraid of breaking that image, but it was making me miserable. </p> <p>With age comes wisdom and now I am happy with my new partner and my life in general. I am much less harsh on myself and have realised everything cannot be perfect all the time. </p> <p>The biggest lesson for me, in terms of losing the urge to try to be perfect, was becoming a mum: it taught me that it\u2019s not all about me, it\u2019s all about them. Kids have their own views and sometimes speak more truth than grownups. They also taught me that I couldn\u2019t possibly maintain a tidy, clean house all the time and neither could I maintain my body shape or appearance because of the effect being pregnant for years has had on them.</p> <p>My advice to young people today would be to find a hobby or passion that brings you joy and don\u2019t compare yourself to others. Sometimes it\u2019s our biggest failures that teach us the most valuable lessons and letting things fall apart isn\u2019t the end of the world \u2013 it\u2019s a chance to rebuild it.</p> <h2>Lotta Sampson-Stone, 22, a student and single mother from Plymouth<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7db8a87a19b8c545c3f0456060b0cc11b6806641\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7db8a87a19b8c545c3f0456060b0cc11b6806641/0_66_638_638/500.jpg\" alt=\"Lotta Sampson-Stone\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Being a mum, in particular, is a lot of pressure.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lotta Sampson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I am quite critical of myself as a single parent.

I did not want it to impact on how I viewed my life with my daughter and what I could and could not provide for her. The best thing I can give her is a mum who\u2019s totally happy and present in the here and now \u2013 she doesn\u2019t care that her mum isn\u2019t a size six or that the flat gets cluttered..<strong> </strong></p> <p>I hope my daughter won\u2019t grow up as insecure as me.

In March 2015, local authorities posted notices in the stairwells that the building was condemned.</p> <p>Cracking and collapsing structures are a growing problem in cities like Norilsk \u2013 a nickel-producing centre of 177,000 people located 180 miles above the Arctic Circle \u2013 as climate change thaws the perennially frozen soil and increases precipitation.

Soil temperatures in Norilsk increased by almost 1C between 1999 and 2013.</p> <p>The term permafrost is somewhat a misnomer: while deeper soil remains frozen year-round, the \u201cactive layer\u201d of soil extending several feet below the surface thaws each summer. It thaws unevenly, contorting and warping buildings. To avoid this, in the 1960s builders of apartment blocks in Norilsk began drilling holes up to 100-ft deep and pouring reinforced concrete piles that stuck into the permanently frozen soil below. The piles also lifted each building off the ground, allowing air circulation to cool the soil and preventing further thawing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>More than 100,000 people are living in buildings in \u201ccritical condition\u201d across Russia\u2019s far north</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Engineers didn\u2019t think the soil could start warming so much, however. <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/10/12/125005/meta;jsessionid=988198CE07A3443E077F281ED3228354.c2.iopscience.cld.iop.org#erl521538f4\">Data</a> from a Norilsk monitoring station showed the active layer has been thawing earlier and its thickness has increased from three feet to five feet. In addition, climate change has increased precipitation, adding more moisture to the soil that freezes and expands, gradually crumbling the concrete piles. More snow covers the ground and further warms the permafrost.</p> <p>\u201cIn most cases the effect of climate change was not accounted for properly or at all, so the story is not about one building falling, even though there are examples of that, but about thousands of people living in buildings which have the potential to fall,\u201d says Dmitry Streletskiy, an assistant professor of geography at George Washington University.</p> <p>The problem also threatens Alaska, Canada and other northern territories, but only Russia has cities so far north. Forty percent of buildings in the coal mining city Vorkuta have been damaged, the emergencies ministry\u2019s Tereshkov says. Salekhard, Nadym and Dudinka, the port on the Yenisei River through which Norilsk Nickel ships its products, have also seen deformations, among others. More than 100,000 people are living in buildings in \u201ccritical condition\u201d across Russia\u2019s far north, Streletskiy estimates.</p> <p>At 59 Talnakhskaya Street, an 80-apartment building dating to the 1960s, the sinking corner became visible when a giant crack appeared on the side.

Although he makes an unwise reference to Harold Wilson producing \u201cimpenetrable and unreadable books\u201d about politics, it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s not in his own character to think too deeply about anything. Suspicious, he says, of anyone who flaunts their roots, he is happy nevertheless to stress that he is impeccably working class, born the son of an electrician who worked in a Nottinghamshire colliery.</p> <p>His mother died in the 1970s of cirrhosis of the liver, but he disdains to go into details about the cause of the disease. \u201cI don\u2019t like to discuss these things at length because it is unfair on my mother and gives them more emphasis than they deserve.\u201d Of his wife, Gillian, whom he met at Cambridge University, and who abandoned her own ambitions in order to be his helpmate, he remarks: \u201cIt quickly became obvious that Gillian\u2019s intention of pursuing her academic career was fairly hopeless \u2026 She had, I would plead in mitigation, always known that I was going to be a professional politician.\u201d</p> <p>Proud of what he calls his \u201cpeculiarly laid-back and stress-free personality\u201d and of having \u201cthe hide of a pachyderm\u201d, he progressed from being president of the Cambridge Union to working as a jobbing barrister in Birmingham, and thence at the age of 30 to becoming an MP. After a spell as a whip for Ted Heath\u2019s government in the early 1970s, he endured a period of opposition before what he calls \u201cmy boundless confidence in my own abilities\u201d ensured that, after the Conservatives\u2019 re-election in 1979, he achieved an 18-year run of power, smoking cigars and eating good meals at various high levels in Transport, Health, Employment, Trade, Education and the Home Office before finally becoming, in his own estimation, \u201cthe most successful Chancellor of the Exchequer since 1945\u201d.</p> <p>Throughout his service as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/margaretthatcher\">Margaret Thatcher</a>\u2019s tea trolley, he professes amazement that someone with his views was consistently given advancement by someone with hers. But Clarke\u2019s characterisation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/alan-greenspan\">Alan Greenspan</a>, the Ayn Rand-worshipping precipitator of the global financial crisis, as \u201cone of the wisest men I had ever known\u201d indicates that his self-proclaimed one-nation instincts hardly go very deep. Nor did his readiness in 1997 to run for the leadership of his party in a pact with John Redwood suggest that his differences of outlook with the swivel-eyed were as principled or profound as he pretends.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Clarke\u2019s observations about colleagues, it's impossible to disentangle failures of curiosity from failures of style</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To every job he was given by Thatcher, he brought the same prejudice and applied the same tool kit. Like his boss, he never met a trade union he didn\u2019t dislike. So any objection that a professional group \u2013 be it prison employees, nurses, teachers, rail workers, miners or, particularly, doctors \u2013 brought to any detail of any Conservative plan for privatisation or reform was automatically dismissed as the pleading of the pampered. A laughably inadequate account of the miners\u2019 strike, in which Clarke takes up the blase pose of not understanding why people want to be miners in the first place, presents the conflict purely as a strategic test of strength for the government, and without any sensitivity to the fact that it was, both culturally and industrially, the most resonant domestic disaster of the period.</p> <p>\u201cI am,\u201d Clarke says, \u201cthe least observant of men.\u201d He refuses at any point to extend sympathy to workers who need to organise in order to maintain their living standards, but he chooses, meanwhile, to insert a whingeing paragraph about how heartbreaking it was for parliamentary undersecretaries in 1979 to struggle along on a salary which is, in today\u2019s money, \u00a349,400 a year. When it comes to lavishly subsidised cartels, he is a bluff and outspoken critic of everyone\u2019s except his own.</p> <p>Clarke\u2019s observations about his colleagues are so lame that it becomes impossible to disentangle failures of curiosity and failures of style. From the moment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/john-profumo\">John Profumo</a> is dubbed a \u201ccharming and delightful man\u201d, the reader must sharpen their scythe to hack through a dense thicket of transcribed cliche. The word \u201ccongenial\u201d is beaten into the ground, repeatedly deployed to describe any fellow politician whom Clarke likes but can\u2019t be bothered to portray.</p> <p>Thatcher, you will be surprised to learn, \u201cconstantly argued with her colleagues, sometimes being unpleasant and even rude\u201d. Clarke\u2019s own relationship with \u201cthe best prime minister I ever worked with\u201d was \u201crobust\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair\">Tony Blair</a> was \u201chighly intelligent\u201d. Willie Whitelaw, on the other hand, \u201cwas not intellectually brilliant, but nor was he stupid\u201d. When Britain crashes out of the ERM in 1992, a long and pointless defence of the useless <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jul/22/conservativeparty.politics\">Norman Lamont</a> is mounted, as though it were somehow not the chancellor\u2019s own fault that his \u201ccompletely discredited\u201d government had \u201cits economic middle stump flying through the air\u201d. Lamont\u2019s refusal to resign immediately is excused on the incontestable grounds that he was Clarke\u2019s personal friend.</p> <p>A rare point of thoughtfulness comes when he regrets that his wife was far more upset by public criticism of him than he was himself. When a comedian says on the radio that among the few things making life worthwhile are \u201cbirdsong in the spring \u2026 and the prospect of seeing Kenneth Clarke going to his grave\u201d, it is Gillian who rings the BBC to complain. But at no point does Clarke de-monologue to ask himself whether the impact of his policies might have justified those attacks, which he complains were invariably \u201csavage\u201d, \u201csynthetic\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d. A similarly promising passage arising from when, as home secretary, he had bravely started to address the scandal of rising prison numbers is quickly cut short when Michael Howard takes over the post. A typical Clarkean coda adds that, in spite of Howard\u2019s law-and-order populism destroying all hope of progress, the two of them \u201cas ever, remained friends\u201d. Club before country, as they say in Westminster.</p> <p>Clarke\u2019s life in politics has been bookended by the decisions to join and then to leave the European Union. A hurried epilogue on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/13/ken-clarke-tory-constituent-brexit-eu-referendum-not-binding\">Brexit</a> is clumsy and shallow.

  "<p>There are two inescapable foods in Ethiopia, coffee and teff. While Ethiopian coffee is famous worldwide, the country\u2019s staple grain is still a stranger to western palates. But food entrepreneurs hope teff will soon be as ubiquitous in British supermarkets as it is in Addis Ababa\u2019s kitchens.</p> <p>Ethiopians have been planting teff \u2013 the base of their renowned injera bread - for more than 3,000 years. Yet for businessmen like Aleem Ahmed, this gluten-free grain, packed with amino acids, has the potential to become a lucrative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/jan/23/get-taste-for-teff-ethiopia-superfood\">superfood</a>. Companies like Ahmed\u2019s Love Grain in the US or Tobia Teff in the UK want to provide westerners with a healthier alternative to wheat while helping Ethiopian farmers thrive.</p> <p>A big caveat: exports of teff from Ethiopia were banned for almost a decade. In 2006, the government outlawed international sales of the grain for fear of suffering the same fate as Bolivia during the recent \u201cquinoa fever\u201d. After being branded a superfood, demand for this Andean grain skyrocketed, increasing its price <a href=\"http://www.responsability.com/funding/data/docs/en/14505/RESP-CaseStudy-EN-140518.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">tenfold</a> between 2009 and 2013, with some claiming this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/16/vegans-stomach-unpalatable-truth-quinoa\">affected food security in the Andes</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/jan/23/get-taste-for-teff-ethiopia-superfood\">Get a taste for teff, the Ethiopian superfood</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Ethiopia, where <a href=\"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/ethiopia_hrd_2016.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">one in ten people</a> were in need of food assistance this year, a similar spike in teff prices could have serious humanitarian consequences. Khalid Bomba, the head of the Ethiopian Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA), said that the Ethiopian government had been following the developments in Bolivia and Peru very closely. \u201cWhat happened with quinoa will not happen with teff. We just won\u2019t let it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But these fears are subsiding. Teff yields have increased by 50% in the last five years, according to the ATA, and prices have remained steady, prompting the government to partially lift the export ban. </p> <p>In the past year, export licenses have been granted to 48 commercial farmers. None of them were planting teff before, which is meant to ensure that their sales won\u2019t diminish domestic production. \u201cWe are just starting but we think teff certainly has the potential to become the next superfood,\u201d says Bomba.</p> <p>If this trial project is successful, ATA\u2019s goal is to open it up to cooperatives of smallholder farmers who are already planting teff.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8789b3c1ca08449dce451792c728c4bfcb622291\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8789b3c1ca08449dce451792c728c4bfcb622291/0_133_5130_3078/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teff\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The most important part of an Ethiopian meal is the Injerra, a sort of pancake made from teff.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The global market for teff is growing by the day.

Like quinoa, teff\u2019s low-glycemic index makes it suitable for diabetics \u2013 but the Ethiopian grain has twice the iron and three times more calcium than its Bolivian competitor. </p> <p>Based in north London, Tobia Teff has been selling teff products since 2007 and providing the National Health Service with flour and bread for patients suffering from gluten intolerance. Founded by a couple of Ethiopian origin, the company has been buying its teff from a producer in southern Spain, but recently applied to become an Ethiopian importer. \u201cEthiopians should be the ones benefiting from their staple crop,\u201d says co-owner Sophie Sirak-Kebede, \u201cit\u2019s their right, it\u2019s their history.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/24/crazy-milk-of-desert-senegal-dairy-farmers-africa\">'Crazy milk of the desert' transforming the lives of Senegal's dairy farmers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In California, Ahmed and his team at Love Grain are trying to cook teff into American staples, from pancake mix to power bars. \u201cThe key to teff going mainstream is incorporating it into products people already know,\u201d says the MIT graduate who previously worked in Ethiopia helping teff farmers increase their yields. Early next year, the startup is launching its first line of chips made using Ethiopian teff, featuring flavors like barbecue and cheese and onion.</p> <p>Increased exports could be a boon to many of the country\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4523e.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">6.2 million</a> teff farmers because international market prices are often double local ones. \u201cWorking for exporters allows us to earn more and have consistent business,\u201d says Bedlu Mengistu, a 38-year-old who grows teff in the Oromia region. His main client is Mama Fresh, a company that sells injera to countries like Canada and Sweden.</p> <p>Still, some worry that other countries will corner the teff market before Ethiopia is ready to export at a large scale. Most teff found in health food stores today comes from South Africa, Canada or India. \u201cI am really worried Ethiopia will miss the boat,\u201d says Jyothi Gaddam, whose company Neha International is one of the few allowed to sell teff abroad.</p> <p>The main roadblock to Ethiopia increasing its surplus of teff for export is a lack of mechanisation. Most of the planting, harvesting and processing of the grain is still done manually and while the ATA says it\u2019s promoting best practices and developing teff-specific machinery, farmers complain implementation has been slow. </p> <p>Exports may actually help speed up the modernisation of teff farming, says Bomba. Increased demand would encourage research while the promise of a better income could incentivise farmers to streamline their methods and invest in machinery. As for the other countries selling teff, Sirak-Kebede is not worried. \u201cEthiopian teff will be known for its quality, just like coffee,\u201d says the British entrepreneur. \u201cYou can find similar weather somewhere else, but it\u2019s the soil that makes the difference. And you can\u2019t replace the soil.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>\u2018What do you think you\u2019re on \u2013 your father\u2019s yacht?\u201d This was a common put-down in my northern childhood when anyone gave themselves airs and graces. And, for many people, the idea that sailing is the preserve of the rich and privileged persists. But a recent entrant to the sharing economy has just such people in its sights: those who\u2019ve never been on a yacht and think sailing holidays are out of their reach.</p> <p>Launched in Italy in 2015, <a href=\"https://www.antlos.com/en/\">Antlos</a> is an online marketplace that puts boat owners and holidaymakers in touch, much as Airbnb does for rooms and Uber for taxis. And, says marketing manager Lauren Schmitt, as with Airbnb, its 400 (mostly) sailing boats around (mainly) the Caribbean and Mediterranean can be rented as a whole (with skipper \u2013 people don\u2019t have to be able to sail), as a private cabin, or a berth in a shared cabin. Prices per day start at under \u00a350 a head, including meals and fuel.</p> <p>Antlos also reckons to be a boon for owners \u2013 whose perennial moan is that a boat is like a hole in the sea they pour money into. Renting out space on their vessel (listing on Antlos is free) helps with boat maintenance costs, and they get to share their passion for sailing.</p> <p>Chartering yachts online has been around almost as long as things have been bought and sold on the internet, but most of the websites are run by charter agencies, which charge commissions ranging from 15% to as much as 40%. Joining the scrum is <a href=\"https://www.zizoo.com/\">Zizoo</a>, a \u201cboat management tool\u201d launched in 2015 that claims to be the Booking.com of boats (it charges boat owners 12% commission). Antlos, however, says it cuts out these agencies (though it takes a service fee of 6-12% for each booking).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16efaa3892dfe5ad9b4fddecf2c99c497a51f393\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16efaa3892dfe5ad9b4fddecf2c99c497a51f393/0_46_1969_1181/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sunbather on beach looking at a sailboat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>To get a brief taster of the Antlos experience, my family spent a day pootling around the south-eastern-eastern tip of Sardinia on motor yacht Mattia II, with friendly skipper Danilo piloting us to quiet coves of startling blue and green water. Schmitt tells me a whole boat could be hired by a group of friends, or a family for a big birthday, and they\u2019d be able to customise the itinerary to their interests, perhaps snorkelling, rock climbing or island hopping. Some skippers include sailing tuition; others offer wellness trips, with healthy food, and yoga on deck.</p> <p>A private cabin deal would suit a couple who couldn\u2019t otherwise afford a yacht holiday, and the shared cabin idea would appeal to solo travellers or backpackers. When they\u2019re not hiring a whole boat, the customer will contact the skipper (via the site) to find out where a boat is heading in a particular week, and sign up if that appeals. And, Schmitt points out, once a booking is confirmed, the trip will happen even with no other takers \u2013 so someone paying \u00a350 a day for a berth in a shared cabin could, in theory, end up sailing off in a boat almost to themselves.</p> <p>At this time of year, there is still some availability in the southern Med, such as boat and breakfast in Corfu at \u00a329pp, but attention is switching to the Caribbean. How about a trip round Panama\u2019s San Blas islands for \u00a350 a day?</p>",

Not only are banks losing their monopoly over capital markets because of emerging options like crowdfunding, they are also losing their grip on the payments market as more alternatives emerge, partially courtesy of leading smartphone makers.</p> <p>So worried are Australia\u2019s big four banks about the potential disruption to their long-held market dominance, that all have made considerable investments into becoming more agile and developing their own customer-focused digital offerings. Throw in Telstra and Woolworths and it\u2019s clear that some of Australia\u2019s largest companies are endeavouring to think big and small at the same time.</p> <p>So what are the tools and techniques allowing small companies to punch above their weight? Forget David\u2019s sling; today\u2019s Goliaths are being challenged in almost every industry by the advent of cloud computing services and advanced customer service software. </p> <p>Take veterinary pharmaceuticals company Jurox.

  "<p>\u200bThe rally in the price of key exports such as coal and iron ore that has promised a multibillion-dollar windfall for Australia\u2019s treasurer, Scott Morrison, could be shortlived, economists have warned.</p> <p>Hopes have risen that the federal budget could benefit from as much as <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/news/economy/scott-morrison-buoyed-by-first-terms-of-trade-tailwind-in-five-years-20161013-gs1ckm?login_token=X4dLxQuwHvejgc_gATbRZlVjU3wE0zcDSF94uWR0kJooxZ1Sc6HTaP2Ag6_o1-dnqP1XJo7iGjz4OaqaDfaMnw&amp;expiry=1476403958&amp;single_use_token=ajDolyxdwMZxBvzRCDbDjCA1svyWT8yGAR6NWZU7zR324WhgtBMtUDJn6J3CsgX-e5orsGRVcl5Jj0yJ1gAbsg\">$23bn in additional tax revenues</a> from exports, thanks to higher prices, especially for coal which has more than doubled in price in the past four months.</p> <p>But Australia remains at the mercy of trends in its biggest markets China and India, and economists say it\u2019s not clear how long the rally in commodity prices will last.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2016/oct/14/we-should-be-putting-the-brake-on-the-carmichael-coalmine-not-hitting-the-accelerator\">We should be putting the brake on the Carmichael coalmine, not hitting the accelerator | Graham Readfearn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tim Buckley, from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said global demand for coal was expected to fall 2.7% in 2016 despite recent spikes in demand following surprise cuts in production in China and India\u200b, the world\u2019s two biggest importers. </p> <p>China curbed domestic coal production at the same time hydro production was falling 13% in September, pushing up reliance on coal imports. India, meanwhile, was also forced to curb production when its coal inventories spiked to 88m tonnes.</p> <p>\u201cThe price has overshot,\u201d Buckley said. \u201cBoth big importers had aberrations in September so it has pushed the price back up.\u201d \u200b </p> <p>China on Friday recorded its first rise in factory-gate prices in four years.<br></p> <p>Economists at NAB agreed with Buckley, saying \u200b the unexpectedly high settlement price for coking coal \u2013 which is used to make steel \u2013 would \u201cprovide a boost to Australia\u2019s terms of trade, nominal GDP and government revenues\u201d.<br></p> <p>The bank\u2019s chief economist, Alan Ostler, said the higher coking-coal price alone could add $12.5bn to the federal budget in the next two years and help ease the current budget shortfall of $37bn, or 2.2% of gross domestic product (GDP). </p> <p>The federal budget deficit came in $1.33bn under its end-of-August forecast thanks to stronger revenues and lower spending, figures released on Friday showed. \u200bThe budgets of states such as Queensland and New South Wales will also benefit hugely from increased royalty taxes.</p> <p>But the longer-term reality was likely to be different, Ostler said, and the rise in prices was \u201cunlikely to be sustained\u201d. The bank also believes the iron ore price will fall back from its current level of just over $55.94 a tonne \u2013 just over Morrison\u2019s budget forecast \u2013 to $44 a tonne in 2017.</p> <p>Global coal production peaked in 2014, Buckley said, and action on setting a carbon price following agreement on the Paris climate accord could continue to suppress demand.</p> <p>Despite the hopes of the federal resources minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/18/josh-frydenberg-puts-strong-moral-case-for-coal-exports-to-prevent-deaths\">Josh Frydenberg, that India would provide a burgeoning market for Australian coal </a>even if the current number-one market of China slows, Buckley said India\u2019s energy minister, Piyush Goyal, had vowed to cease all coal imports <a href=\"http://reneweconomy.com.au/2016/read-my-lips-indian-energy-minister-repeats-no-coal-imports-within-3-years-73239\">within three years</a>.</p> <p>Many doubt the prediction but Buckley said: \u201cI think he\u2019ll do it. The cost of new solar power is less than the cost of new coal \u2013 4.5 rupees per kilowatt hour (US$0.67) compared with 6 rupees for imported coal. </p> <p>\u201cSolar has dropped in price way faster than anyone said it would. It is 40% cheaper than it was 18 months ago.\u201d \u200b</p>",
  "<p>Trade unions are preparing to ramp up their efforts to persuade Labour MPs to back expansion at Heathrow airport, putting them at odds with senior party figures including Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>Community, the union that represents iron and steel workers, wrote to all Labour MPs on Thursday calling on them to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/10/theresa-may-local-council-to-spend-50000-fight-heathrow-runway-maidenhead\">back the expansion</a> if it is approved by the prime minister, Theresa May, next week.</p> <p>However, figures at the top of the party remain strongly opposed to expansion on environmental grounds, including Corbyn and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, whose Hayes and Harlington constituency includes the airport. </p> <p>In his letter, which was also sent to all MPs in the all-party parliamentary group on steel, Community\u2019s general secretary, Roy Rickhuss, wrote: \u201cSteel needs to be put at the heart of the government\u2019s new industrial strategy, and trade unions need to be a key part of this. For the benefit of the UK steel industry, and the British economy, there must be sustained investment in major private infrastructure projects.\u201d</p> <p>A third runway, Rickhuss said, could \u201ckickstart a pipeline of high profile work that keeps contracts coming in, and keeps jobs and families secure. We urge you to lend your voice to back Heathrow expansion.\u201d</p> <p>Two of the country\u2019s largest unions, Unite and the GMB, have also lobbied Labour MPs to vote though the expansion. Mick Rix, the GMB\u2019s national officer for transport and distribution, said the union had also written to Labour MPs to promote Heathrow expansion. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve written to Labour MPs on numerous occasions making clear our longstanding support for Heathrow expansion and setting out the clear-cut case,\u201d Rix said. \u201cOur union\u2019s policy is crystal clear and we\u2019ve been campaigning on it for the best part of a decade. Long-awaited approval of Heathrow expansion would mean a vote in favour of jobs and a desperately needed boost for the UK economy.\u201d </p> <p>Unite, Britain\u2019s largest union and a key backer of Corbyn, has also long supported expansion and recently launched its own Unite4Heathrow website and Twitter account.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian during the Labour conference, Corbyn said he had never been a supporter because of the issues of noise and pollution across west London. </p> <p>However, the Labour leader has hinted he would be prepared to consider a free vote on the issue. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve discovered is whipping Labour <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/10/labour-mps-clash-with-corbyn-over-brexit-and-sacking-of-chief-whip\">when Labour doesn\u2019t want to be whipped</a> is not an easy thing to do,\u201d he said.</p> <p>McDonnell has been one of the most vociferous campaigners against expansion, both as a constituency MP and as shadow chancellor, arguing that the air in his area is \u201cbeing poisoned by Heathrow airport ... They are the issues that I think will prevent the third runway going ahead.\u201d </p> <p>Several other unions are also opposed, including the UK\u2019s second biggest \u2013 Unison. RMT is also opposed and has historically called for further investment in high-speed rail connections as an alternative. </p> <p>Other local Labour MPs including Fiona Mactaggart, Steve Pound and Virendra Sharma are backers of a third runway, citing a promised boost to local employment and business opportunities. </p> <p>The most recent YouGov poll of Labour MPs showed strong support for a third runway, with 80% agreeing with the statement: \u201cHeathrow expansion is an important factor in Britain\u2019s future ability to stay connected to the world post-Brexit.\u201d</p>",

A perfectly delicious meal can be bought for just a few dollars anywhere in the world, but as a dining public we\u2019re still willing to pay hundreds of times more than that at some of the restaurant world\u2019s most coveted tables.</p> <p>The question of how much is too much to pay for dinner can really only be answered by what the market demands, and demand is seemingly insatiable. Destination restaurants are popping up everywhere, the lists and guides that direct us to them are more numerous than ever, and reservations are snapped up in seconds, months in advance.</p> <p>It\u2019s not madness, of course. Ironically, fine-dining is one of the most egalitarian luxury experiences money can buy. A few hundred dollars for the best dinners in the world is pennies compared to other parts of the luxury market.</p> <p>People pay thousands of dollars to sit in a slightly-more-comfortable plane seat for a couple of hours, tens of thousands more for handbags, and hundreds of thousands for fancy watches. The most desirable cars in the world sell for millions, and in the art world can see paintings sell into the hundreds of millions without anyone batting too much of an eyelid.</p> <p>Imagine how much it would cost to have one of the world\u2019s great artists paint you a portrait, or a chart-topping musician to perform at your wedding. Six figures? Seven? You can get fed for hours by the best chefs in the world for just three.</p> <p>The problem with food is we forget what we\u2019re paying for. We all know the cost of a chicken or a tomato in the supermarket, and when we sit down to a restaurant we expect the price of our meal to be relative to that. But the real value-proposition of a high-end restaurant isn\u2019t ingredients. It isn\u2019t even tasty food really, as perverse as that may seem.</p> <p>At a high-end restaurant you\u2019re paying for art, skill, concept, theatre and service. The meal itself is little more than a vehicle for those things.</p> <p>It might sound terribly wanky but if all you\u2019re after is good food and you\u2019re paying $500 for it, then you might not be doing it right. You could just as easily be satisfied in that regard with a $5 cheeseburger or an apple off a tree.</p> <p>In the grand scheme of what we will pay for experiences, a few hundred dollars for the services of some of the best chefs in the world, a good meal and an unforgettable experience? It\u2019s a bargain if you ask me.</p>",

  "<p>The first page of Tim Winton\u2019s new essay collection, <a href=\"https://penguin.com.au/books/the-boy-behind-the-curtain-9781926428765\">The Boy Behind the Curtain</a>, sets a disturbing scene. A 13-year-old boy stands at the window of a suburban street, behind a terylene curtain, training a rifle on passersby. </p> <p>\u201cHe was a fraught little thing,\u201d says Winton of that boy \u2013 the boy he used to be. \u201cI feel related to him but I\u2019m no longer completely him, thank god.\u201d</p> <p>The passage opens a surprisingly intimate essay about the role of guns in Australian life, setting the tone for a collection being billed as Winton\u2019s most personal yet. </p> <p>In spite of his inclination for solitude, Winton has spent much of his life in the spotlight. His first novel, An Open Swimmer, catapulted him into the public eye when it won the Vogel literary award in 1981, but it was his 1991 novel, Cloudstreet, that cemented his place in Australian letters. Winton has won the Miles Franklin award four times and been shortlisted twice for the Booker. His books have been adapted for film, TV and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/16/cloudstreet-review-opera-version-of-tim-wintons-classic-revels-in-australianisms\">even opera</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/08/island-home-tim-winton-review-love-song-to-australia\">Island Home by Tim Winton review \u2013  a love song to Australia and a cry to save it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The contradictions of having such a high-profile career while working in a quintessentially solitary artform are not lost on him. \u201cI spend all day in a room with people who don\u2019t exist, and I\u2019m not thinking about any public \u2013 but once the thing\u2019s done it goes out there and it has a public life over which I have no, or very little, control,\u201d he says.</p> <p>On one reading, the boy with the rifle lurking out of sight, watching the world go by, could be a metaphor for the life of a reclusive writer. But Winton is quick to distinguish himself from such a reading. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t like to see myself as somebody who was just cruelly observing the world behind the terylene curtain of art.\u201d </p> <p>For Winton, the perceived lives of other writers always seemed completely unrelated to his own experience. \u201cI grew up with a kind of modernist romantic idea of the writer as some kind of high priest, someone who saw themselves as separate and better, which I now find a bit repellent,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that was something that was sold to us at school and certainly at university \u2026 that writers were somehow aloof from the ordinary business of life; they didn\u2019t have to abide by the same rules as other people. The worse their behaviour off the page, the more we were supposed to cheer them on. Once I woke up to that idea as a teenager, I think I consciously resisted it.\u201d</p> <p>Winton\u2019s own background was characterised by a working class sensibility and evangelical religion. His parents converted to the Church of Christ when he was a small boy, the circumstances and his experiences of which form the basis of a number of the previously unpublished essays in The Boy Behind the Curtain.

Stones for Bread, for example, calls for a return to empathy and humanity in Australia\u2019s approach to asylum seekers. The Battle for Ningaloo Reef is a clear-eyed account of the activism that prevented a major commercial development from destroying a stretch of the Western Australian coastline. And Using the C-Word concerns that other dirty word that Winton believes we are avoiding: class. </p> <p>\u201cI think there are people talking about class but they\u2019re having to do that against the flow,\u201d Winton says. \u201cWe\u2019re living in a dispensation that is endlessly reinforcing the idea that we are not citizens but economic players. And under that dispensation it\u2019s in nobody\u2019s interest, especially those in power, to encourage or foster the idea that there\u2019s any class difference.\u201d</p> <p>The market doesn\u2019t care about people, Winton argues, and neither is there any genius in it. \u201cThere\u2019s no invisible hand,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if there is one, it\u2019s scratching its arse.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s clear to Winton that neoliberalism is failing, but not without casualties, two of which are very close to his heart: the arts and the environment. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5fd6113eff1cdf643aa5e903d3d213a5c3249fbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fd6113eff1cdf643aa5e903d3d213a5c3249fbe/0_0_2409_3685/654.jpg\" alt=\"Cover image for The Boy Behind The Curtain by Tim Winton, published by Penguin books\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cover image for The Boy Behind The Curtain by Tim Winton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penguin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPeople in the arts are basically paying the price for this new regime where we pay no tax and where we get less public service and more privatised service,\u201d he says. \u201cThe arts are last on, first off in people\u2019s minds and I think that\u2019s not just sad, it\u2019s corrosive. They\u2019re just seen as fluff, as fripperies, as indulgence, as add-ons and luxury. And I don\u2019t think the arts are luxury; I think they\u2019re fundamental to civilisation.

  "<p>Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, has spoken of \u201ccleaning\u201d the besieged city of Aleppo, where a quarter of a million people are caught under heavy bombardment by his government\u2019s forces, and using it as a \u201cspringboard\u201d for winning the country\u2019s war.</p> <p>With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/13/boris-johnson-military-options-against-syrian-regime-being-considered\">Britain leading international outcry</a> over the regime\u2019s campaign against rebels in Aleppo and Russia\u2019s backing for it, Assad declared that victory in the strategic city would allow the Syrian army to liberate other areas of the country from \u201cterrorists\u201d.</p> <p>Speaking to Russia\u2019s Komsomolskaya Pravda, Assad said Aleppo was effectively no longer Syria\u2019s industrial capital but taking back the city would provide important political and strategic gains for his regime.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be the springboard, as a big city, to move to other areas, to liberate other areas from the terrorists. This is the importance of Aleppo now,\u201d Assad said.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to keep cleaning this area and to push the terrorists to Turkey to go back to where they come from, or to kill them. There\u2019s no other option. But Aleppo is going to be a very important springboard to do this move.\u201d</p> <p>Rescue workers have said that Syria\u2019s military backed by Russian warplanes killed more than 150 people in eastern Aleppo this week, in support of its offensive against the city. Air strikes killed 13 people on Thursday in the rebel-held Aleppo districts of al-Kalaseh, Bustan al-Qasr and al-Sakhour, according to a civil defence official.</p> <p>Rising casualties in Aleppo, where many buildings have been reduced to rubble or are lacking roofs or walls, have prompted an international outcry and a renewed diplomatic push, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/unexpected-talks-syria-moscow-switzerland-us-russia-airstrikes-aleppo\">talks between the United States and Russia</a> planned for Saturday. <br></p> <p>Syrian government forces have encircled the eastern half of Aleppo, besieging over a quarter of a million people who they say are being used as human shields by \u201cterrorists\u201d. The siege has caused an international outcry with a number of countries and groups accusing Syria and Russia of war crimes in connection with attacks on medical facilities and aid convoys.</p> <p>Amid wrangling over how an international coalition might intervene to stop the Assad regime\u2019s bombardment of Aleppo, without coming into direct conflict with Russian forces, the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said on Thursday: \u201cWe cannot just see Aleppo pulverised in this way. We have to do something \u2026 Whether that means we can get a coalition for a more kinetic action now I cannot prophesy. But what most people want to see now is a new set of options.\u201d<br></p> <p>European Union foreign ministers drafted a statement accusing Syria and its allies of violence that \u201cmay amount to war crimes\u201d. </p> <p>As the air strikes and shelling of Aleppo\u2019s east intensified after a brief period of relative calm, Syria\u2019s government approved a United Nations plan to allow aid convoys into the most besieged areas of Syria, with the exception of Aleppo.<br></p> <p>Assad said in the Russian interview that Saudi Arabia had offered to help his government if it agreed to cut ties with Iran, one of Syria\u2019s main allies.<br></p> <p>He said the Saudis told him: \u201cIf you move away from Iran and you announce that you disconnect all kinds of relations with Iran, we\u2019re going to help you. Very simple and very straight to the point.\u201d</p> <p>Syria\u2019s civil war, now in its sixth year, has killed 300,000 people and left millions homeless while dragging in regional and global powers as well as inspiring jihadist attacks abroad.</p> <p>Assad is backed by the Russian air force, Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards and an array of Shia militias from Arab neighbours, while Sunni rebels seeking to oust him are backed by Turkey, the United States and Gulf monarchies.</p> <p>Assad also told the Russian newspaper that the country\u2019s civil war had become a conflict between Russia and the west.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we\u2019ve been seeing recently during the last few weeks, and maybe few months, is something like more than cold war,\u201d Assad said.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to call it, but it\u2019s not something that has existed recently, because I don\u2019t think that the west and especially the United States has stopped their cold war, even after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\u201d</p> <p><em>With Reuters and the Associated Press</em></p>"
