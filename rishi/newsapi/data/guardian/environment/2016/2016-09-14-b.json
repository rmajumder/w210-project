One of the male apprentices was not backward in telling her that women did not belong. \u201cHe thought women should be barefoot and pregnant and chained to the kitchen,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was what his father had taught him.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/14/greens-push-to-outlaw-all-mining-in-great-australian-bight\">Greens push to outlaw all mining in Great Australian Bight</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Down, now a safety and training officer at Bell Bay Aluminium, made it her business to beat him at every task and assessment until he was forced to revise his view.<em> </em>He eventually learned to treat her like a colleague, rather than as a \u201cgirl\u201d. </p> <p>The resources industry is the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.wgea.gov.au/wgea-newsroom/gender-equality-spotlight-mining\" rel=\"nofollow\">most</a> male-dominated sector in Australia, a fact the industry has taken steps to address in the past 10 years.

  "<p>Vulnerable victims and witnesses will no longer have to appear in court to give evidence and fare dodgers will be able to plead guilty and pay fines online under new reforms.</p> <p>The radical changes to court procedures in England and Wales are part of a \u00a31bn programme to modernise the courts announced jointly by the lord chief justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, the senior president of tribunals, Sir Ernest Ryder, and the new justice secretary, Elizabeth Truss, on Thursday.</p> <p>There have already been successful pilot programmes at Liverpool, Leeds and Kingston upon Thames crown courts that allow victims and witnesses to prerecord their cross-examinations and avoid the trauma of a live hearing. This will allow them to opt out of giving their evidence in court.</p> <p>Victims are said to have felt less under pressure in giving their accounts and witnesses were better able to recall events. Many of the cases in the pilot programme involved sexual offences. Their cross-examinations were shown to juries during the trial.</p> <p>The initiative permitting some defendants in less serious cases to plead guilty and pay their fines online is aimed at speeding up the criminal justice process and reducing the number of hearings required. Many magistrates courts are already being closed.</p> <p>The next category of minor offences to be transferred to online justice are those relating to transport fare dodging. Only those cases where people plead guilty will be dealt with online. Fines will be levied through the MoJ website.</p> <p>Defendants will be able to log on to an online system to see the evidence against them before entering a plea. If they plead guilty, they can opt in to an online system that allows them to view the penalty, accept the conviction and penalty, and pay their fine.</p> <p>It will not be the first set of offences to be transferred online. One legal system, the traffic penalty tribunal (TPT), already deals with 25,000 appeals about minor driving and parking offences online a year. It is staffed by 30 part-time adjudicators and enables complainants to upload video, voice and picture evidence.</p> <p>The TPT\u2019s pioneering service is also being adopted in a pilot programme by the social entitlement chamber, which deals with benefit disputes.</p> <p>Transferring justice online raises questions about whether and how the names of those who plead guilty will be published.

That means creating a system that is just, efficient and simple. We have the tools and the technology to cut unnecessary paperwork, to deliver swifter justice and to make the experience more straightforward.</p> <p>\u201cMost importantly these reforms will allow us to better protect victims and witnesses who can find the experience of reliving a traumatic event in court incredibly stressful.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/aug/20/liz-truss-abandons-michael-gove-plan-for-problem-solving-courts\">Liz Truss abandons Gove\u2019s plan for problem-solving courts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More than 12m pages of evidence have been put online and video-link systems have been installed in 130 crown courts.</p> <p>The MoJ will publish a joint \u201cvision paper\u201d on Thursday, entitled Transforming Our Justice System<em tabindex=\"-1\">,</em> that will include plans to scrap paper forms and \u201cgo digital\u201d in every court and tribunal in England and Wales.

  "<p>Is it still true to say you can\u2019t point to any single extreme weather event and claim you can\u2019t link it to human-caused climate change? </p> <p>Plenty of people seem to think this is still the case. But a rapidly evolving field of climate science suggests that it\u2019s not. </p> <p>Take Australia\u2019s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, for example, who was touring Tasmania after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2016/jun/06/northern-tasmania-faces-worst-flooding-in-decades-as-storm-heads-south\">devastating flooding there</a> in June.</p> <p>Turnbull pointed out that \u201clarger and more frequent storms\u201d were predicted by climate scientists, but then followed up with that stock standard caveat: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But you cannot attribute any particular storm to global warming, so let\u2019s be quite clear about that. The same scientists would agree with that point.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/14/debunking-malcolm-roberts-the-case-against-a-climate-science-denier\">Debunking Malcolm Roberts: the case against a climate science denier</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in fact, climate scientists are finding ways to examine the influence of increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere on extreme events.</p> <p>This is a field of science called attribution research. Dr Andrew King, at the University of Melbourne, has been involved with several attribution studies.</p> <p>So is it time to throw out that old stock response that you can\u2019t blame climate change for any single event? He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I would reframe the question \u2013 has climate change altered the likelihood of an event happening, like a flood in Louisiana or a heatwave in Melbourne? We can usually say with those types of events that climate change has increased the likelihood of an event happening.</p> </blockquote> <p>When extreme weather events do strike, questions about human influences are coming up more and more. Some scientists want to be able to respond quickly with more relevant answers, before the news cycle turns elsewhere.</p> <p>For example, King joined colleagues to look at the record warm sea temperatures that caused the mass bleaching of corals on the Great Barrier Reef last summer. The results were out in April while the reef\u2019s plight was still making headlines.</p> <p>\u201cWe found that the warm sea temperatures were made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/29/great-barrier-reef-bleaching-made-175-times-likelier-by-human-caused-climate-change-say-scientists\">at least 175 times more likely because of climate change</a>,\u201d King says.</p> <p>To carry out the research, King looked at two sets of climate models. One was set up to reproduce the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that we have now and the other had those human influences removed. </p> <p>In short, the models showed the kind of conditions that eventually killed about a quarter of the corals on the reef are now expected to come around once every four years. But in a world without the extra greenhouse gases, you might expect to see those ocean temperatures once every 1,000 years, if at all.</p> <p>The reef research is about to be submitted to a journal and so the results could change. But King says the methods being used had been peer-reviewed. </p> <p>King also looked at the heatwave that had world leaders sweating during the November 2014 G20 summit in Brisbane. Getting a 38C day in November was \u201cat least 44% more likely\u201d thanks to climate change, <a href=\"https://www.ametsoc.org/ams/index.cfm/publications/bulletin-of-the-american-meteorological-society-bams/explaining-extreme-events-from-a-climate-perspective/\">his study found</a>.</p> <p>From torrential downpours to record ocean temperatures, heatwaves and the monotonous breaking of monthly and yearly global temperature records, more and more studies are finding a distinct human fingerprint on events. </p> <p>There have been a bunch of attribution studies looking at heat records in Australia. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2016/feb/22/fossil-fuel-emissions-behind-australias-record-breaking-spring-heat-suggests-study\">study of its consecutive run of record warm springs in 2013 and 2014</a> found it would have been almost impossible without all that extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</p> <p>Another study <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2014/oct/03/scientists-find-human-fingerprints-all-over-australias-hottest-year-on-record\">found that without the added greenhouse gases, Australia\u2019s record hot 2013 would only have come along once every 12,000 years</a>. But now, thanks chiefly to the burning of fossil fuels since the industrial revolution, we might expect a record breaker every six years.</p> <p>Dr Sophie Lewis, at Australian National University, was involved in both those studies. She says climate attribution is a \u201cfast-evolving field\u201d thanks to quicker computers, better collaborations and established methods. </p> <p>But like King she\u2019s not a fan of simply asking if climate change \u201ccaused\u201d something, or was \u201cto blame\u201d for particular events. She says: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A better question is to ask if climate change has influenced a particular event. That\u2019s an important distinction.</p> </blockquote> <p>An example she gave is 2015 \u2013 the planet\u2019s warmest year on record that coincided with an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2014/jan/23/climate-change-global-warming-2013-warmest-years-el-nino\">El Ni\u00f1o climate system</a>.</p> <p>El Ni\u00f1os are natural events that tends to deliver hotter temperatures, but they are happening over the top of human-induced warming that pushes temperatures to record-breaking levels. Lewis says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We know that both natural and human-caused climate change have impacts on events and we don\u2019t want to lose that complexity. People do understand that the environment and the climate system are complicated.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Speed counts</h2> <p>Getting results out faster gives the media, the public and policymakers more informed answers soon after events hit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/sep/10/soil-our-best-shot-at-cooling-the-planet-might-be-right-under-our-feet\">Our best shot at cooling the planet might be right under our feet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In early August, for example, Louisiana was struck by torrential rains that caused severe flooding \u2013 killing 13 people and damaging about 60,000 homes. Less than a month later, a team of scientists concluded that human-caused climate change had <a href=\"http://www.desmogblog.com/2016/09/07/study-finds-greenhouse-gases-doubled-chances-louisiana-s-flooding-rains\">probably doubled the chances of Louisiana being hit by downpours like that</a>.</p> <p>The lead author of that study, Dr Karin van der Wiel, of Princeton University and the US government\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told me: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Extreme events have always happened and this could have happened a hundred years ago. But it would have been much more rare.</p> </blockquote> <p>Van der Wiel says researchers managed to carry out the analysis quickly because the data from the climate models was readily available and they had good had rainfall data for the area.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci-discuss.net/hess-2016-448/\">Louisiana study has been submitted to a journal</a> where the peer-review process happens out in the open so, again, the conclusions could change.</p> <p>Now, some scientists are uneasy about research being publicised before it has been through peer review, for obvious reasons. What if, for example, there\u2019s a mistake in the analysis that completely changes the conclusions?</p> <p>Both Van Der Wiel and King say they can have a degree of confidence in their results because the methods have already been tested. I\u2019ll leave you with King\u2019s thoughts on this. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As far as I see it, one purpose of event attribution is to communicate to the public and policy makers that climate change is altering how extreme events are occurring \u2013 both their frequency and how bad they are.</p> <p>That\u2019s why we\u2019re moving towards doing this work more quickly. If we can better inform the debate, then that provides some useful information that\u2019s grounded in science, when often there has been just speculation.</p> </blockquote>",

The water plant is currently not in operation. </p> <p>Flint\u2019s water supply became contaminated with lead in April 2014, when a state-appointed emergency manager running the city made a decision to switch its water source to a highly corrosive river. State environmental officials failed to require Flint to use corrosion controls to treat the water supply, thereby allowing lead to leach off pipes and flow into households across the city. </p> <p>As part of an investigation by Michigan\u2019s attorney general, Bill Schuette, nine state and local officials have been criminally charged for their role in the water crisis. The investigators have said additional individuals are expected to face charges.

  "<p>Jeremy Corbyn will use a speech in London on Thursday to announce that Labour will research the radical policy of universal basic income, which would replace means-tested benefits with a flat-rate payment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/22/silicon-valley-universal-basic-income-y-combinator\">Why Silicon Valley is embracing universal basic income</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some on the left see the idea, which would guarantee every citizen a taxpayer-funded income, as the best way to protect low-paid workers against the insecurity of today\u2019s labour market.</p> <p>Corbyn will say: \u201cTechnological changes and the so-called \u2018gig economy\u2019 can mean increased insecurity and uncertainty across our society. It is one of the reasons I am looking at policies that can help provide more security for working households.</p> <p>\u201cOne such possible answer may be the often-discussed suggestion of a universal basic income.\u201d </p> <p>He said the party would research and test the policy, which has won the backing of Labour MPs from different wings of the party, including former shadow transport minister Jonathan Reynolds. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has already said he is examining the idea, which seeks to tackle inequality.</p> <p>Corbyn, who will speak at the London headquarters of Bloomberg, the news organisation, as the hard-fought Labour leadership race enters its final days, will argue that the existing economic model fails to deliver for many in Britain. \u201cThe responsibility of government is to protect citizens from these growing uncertainties in our economy, not exacerbate them as the Conservative government have done,\u201d he will say. He will also highlight McDonnell\u2019s pledge of a \u00a3500bn boost to public investment.</p> <p>Since winning the leadership a year ago, Corbyn has repeatedly promised to rebuild Britain\u2019s economic model to make it fairer, but few details have emerged about how he would change the welfare system.</p> <p>Basic income is also regarded as a potential solution to the risk that many lower-paid workers find themselves out of a job as a growing number of tasks can be performed by robots.</p> <p>Neal Lawson of Compass, a thinktank, which has championed the idea, said: \u201cEven if the robots don\u2019t come, our labour market is so precarious that as it is, it isn\u2019t working. That\u2019s why we need basic income.\u201d</p> <p>A full-blown basic income is regarded by most economists as prohibitively expensive; but a recent Compass report on the issue argued that a transitional system could be created at an annual cost of \u00a38bn a year, which would leave many means-tested benefits in place. </p> <p>The tax-free personal allowance, currently worth \u00a311,000, would be abolished, and tax rates would rise; but every adult would receive a payment of \u00a371 a week \u2013 or \u00a351 for pensioners \u2013 and \u00a359 for children. The authors claim such a system would cut child poverty by 45%, and that 60% of those in the bottom fifth of the income distribution would gain more than 20%.</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s challenger, Owen Smith, will accuse him of putting more than half a million jobs at risk in defence, manufacturing and energy industries, in a final pitch for trade union votes in the party leadership election.</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s aim to end fossil fuel extraction and decommission Trident would risk many hundreds of thousands of jobs, Smith will argue. \u201cFor all of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s claims, his policies would put hundreds of thousands of union members\u2019 jobs at risk and lead to a devastating decline in the UK\u2019s industrial base,\u201d Smith will say on Thursday.</p> <p>The former shadow work and pensions secretary will visit defence and energy industry workers across the UK, starting in Scotland at the Rosyth Naval Dockyard, where the final assembly of the Royal Navy\u2019s two new \u00a36bn flagship aircraft carriers is taking place.</p>",

  "<p>Millennials get a lot of recognition for being <em>the</em> purpose-driven generation.</p> <p>There\u2019s no shortage of headlines about millennials \u2013 those aged 18-35 \u2013 searching for jobs that offer a strong sense of meaning, not just a paycheck. And these headlines appear to be justified. From <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/03/smallbusiness/unreasonable-institute-social-startups/\">incredible social ventures</a> like the social change volunteering organization <a href=\"https://www.dosomething.org/us\">Do Something</a> to popular startups like <a href=\"https://www.warbyparker.com/\">Warby Parker</a>, millennials are bringing purpose to the forefront of today\u2019s business culture.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/may/05/millennials-employment-employers-values-ethics-jobs\">Millennials want to work for employers committed to values and ethics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So you can imagine my surprise when a recent<a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/job-trends/purpose-at-work?src=gua\"> global survey</a> of 26,000 LinkedIn members, run with <a href=\"https://www.imperative.com/\">Imperative</a>, found millennials to be the least purpose-driven generation. The survey results show that sense of purpose deepens the further along you are in your career: 48% of baby boomers (those aged 51+) report that they prioritize purpose over pay and titles. They\u2019re followed by Gen X (aged 36-51) with 38%, and finally, millennials at 30%.</p> <p>The survey asks LinkedIn users to grade the personal importance of different employment attributes: money, purpose and status. The responses come from professionals across 40 countries, including Sweden, Russia, the United States, China and Brazil, and industries ranging from media and entertainment to manufacturing and engineering.</p> <p>The survey helped to identify people who prioritize purpose above all other employment attributes. For example: if you prioritize money or status, you can still care about purpose, but it\u2019s not the ultimate deciding factor for what work you pursue.</p> <p>Achieving a low score doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that millennials don\u2019t want meaningful work. The survey also revealed <a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/job-trends/purpose-at-work?src=gua\">74% of candidates</a> want a job where they feel like their work matters. That means both companies and employees should make creating meaningful work a priority.</p> <p>But the results fly in the face of the assumptions many, myself included, have made about the hierarchy of generations. Why are millennials not as purpose-oriented as many of us assume them to be?</p> <p>This survey suggests a big gap between what millennials deeply desire, as expressed anecdotally through the media, and what they put into practice. Two reasons might explain why. One is that millennials haven\u2019t had enough work experience to figure out what aspects of their job they find most energizing. Second, there is still work to be done on aligning a mutually beneficial relationship between employers and employees. If a company can help individuals better find purpose at work, then the organization will benefit from having more productive and successful employees.</p> <p>Age and experience seem to play critical roles in establishing an individual\u2019s view on purpose. Research by psychoanalyst Erik Erikson has found that<a href=\"http://www.learning-theories.com/eriksons-stages-of-development.html\"> young adults tend to focus</a> foremost on establishing an income and home, seeking out a life partner and potentially starting a family. As people age, they start to think more about their contribution to society. This psychological shift leads them to increasingly prioritize purpose more.</p> <p>When I was first starting work (as many millennials still are) I didn\u2019t feel that I had a choice when it came to my job. There was an overwhelming conflict of trying to find the perfect path and the need to have a job to support myself. While finding fulfilling work eluded me, I got a job where I earned good money and had promotions to work towards. I figured that was what employment was all about.</p> <p>However, my perception completely changed when I moved into a role working with nonprofits and building social innovation programs. For the first time, I felt like I was making an impact \u2013 my work mattered and made a difference well beyond my company. That feeling was invigorating and motivating, and in retrospect, changed how I went to work. I poured my heart, passion and a lot of effort into the job.</p> <p>Helping millennials figure out how to define this sense of purpose will benefit both employees and employers. In fact, my biggest takeaway from the survey results is that companies and all employees could both benefit from collectively creating a meaningful work culture. It could be as simple as identifying the best ways to use an employee\u2019s skills.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/14/lgbt-business-training-prejudice-stanford\">We need to do more to keep LGBT employees from returning to the closet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Employees who feel like their work creates positive impact are more likely to feel fulfilled, promote their company and stay on the job longer. Studies have shown that inspired employees are<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/12/engaging-your-employees-is-good-but-dont-stop-there\"> almost three times more productive</a> than dissatisfied employees. Imagine what you could do if you could triple your current workforce with inspiration, rather than more hiring.</p> <p>As an employee, how can you bring more purpose into the workplace? First off, get a better understanding of what it is. Purpose can feel vague and intangible \u2013 expanding your<a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/job-trends/purpose-at-work?src=gua\"> knowledge of how purpose shows up</a> at work can make it more actionable. What motivates you most about your work? Do you like solving big problems, or seeing the difference you make with one person? Next, think through your company\u2019s mission and vision. How does the work you\u2019re doing roll up to it?</p> <p>Once you are able to define meaningful work, you should encourage coworkers to do the same. Looking for people who have purpose figured out? Reach out to the baby boomers in your office. Set up mentorship programs that bring generations together.</p> <p>A business doesn\u2019t have to be a nonprofit or social venture to create an environment where employees feel like their work matters. The younger generation may not score high in surveys about trading higher pay for meaningful work, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t want it.</p>",

Thursday is the last possible day for a statement to parliament before the House of Commons goes into recess so that MPs can attend the autumn party conferences.</p> <p>Since the summer, No 10 has sought assurances about the security risks of Hinkley and examined the idea of separating the project from a second reactor at Bradwell, in Essex, which the Chinese hope to build independently.</p> <p>Clark told the House of Commons on Tuesday: \u201cWe are looking at all components of the deal and will make our decision before the end of the month,\u201d adding that the government saw \u201cnew nuclear\u201d as \u201can important part of a diverse energy mix that gives resilience to UK consumers\u201d.</p> <p>Hinkley would be the first new nuclear reactor built in Britain in two decades.</p> <p>The shadow energy secretary, Barry Gardiner, said he would welcome a decision to give Hinkley the go-ahead, saying: \u201cIf the secretary of state has now managed to reduce the cost to British bill payers, in line with my suggestions, I promise not to gloat. I will simply say well done for sticking up for the consumer.</p> <p>\u201cBut in return, the government must stop the dithering. Their delay has put at risk \u00a318bn of investment and jeopardised 25,000 skilled jobs in the nuclear industry, which are essential for the UK\u2019s balanced energy portfolio.\u201d</p> <p>However, environmentalists are likely to condemn the decision.

The nominal cost of construction is \u00a318bn, according to EDF.</p> <p>Beijing only agreed to fund 30% of the project on condition it would be allowed to showcase its nuclear prowess by building a Chinese-designed reactor at Bradwell in Essex. Beijing was therefore incensed by suggestions May might approve Hinkley but reserve judgment on Bradwell.</p> <p>The Chinese were brought on board as part of Osborne\u2019s effort to forge closer ties with Beijing but also because of doubts about EDF\u2019s ability to carry out the project.</p> <p>Hinkley is scheduled for completion by 2025, but many regard that timetable as unrealistic because reactors of the same design being built by EDF in Finland and France are running years behind schedule.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>",

The only effect of starting the season here in October and ending it in June would be to allow the Super Rugby tournament to be played to a conclusion, rather than hibernating during the June tour window.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/01/global-season-new-zealand-home-nations-rugby-union-the-breakdown\">Global season will only happen if New Zealand and home nations work together | Paul Rees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The major southern hemisphere unions are in broad agreement about what they want but, when the chief executives of the Six Nations unions met earlier this month to discuss the global season, various recommendations, such as becoming a summer sport and making December and January the off season, were rejected but nothing substantial was agreed, although there was consensus that the start of the Six Nations could be put back by three weeks so that the majority of matches were played after the clocks had gone forward.</p> <p>While there is an acceptance that summer tours after a World Cup place excessive demands on players by giving them a 13-month season, there is no summer tour before a World Cup. With the Lions touring every four years, no summer tour in consecutive years would mean the home unions going to the southern hemisphere on full throttle only once between World Cups. Given that tours are reciprocal, it would mean that, if home unions wanted New Zealand, South Africa, Australia and Argentina to visit Europe in the November after a World Cup, they would have to make it worth their while financially, which would leave the Celtic unions with a budget deficit they could not make up.</p> <p>Bill Beaumont and Agust\u00edn Pichot, the chairman and vice-chairman respectively of World Rugby, have been leading talks over better aligning the seasons in the hemispheres with player welfare at the heart of the push for change but, whereas unions in the south contract their leading players, in France and England clubs are the employers, giving unions here far less room to manoeuvre.</p> <p>The aim is to reduce fixtures but other than cutting three-Test series to two and ending fourth internationals, there is little scope on the international front. On the club scene, unions in Europe are looking at ways of restructuring the European Champions Cup and the Challenge Cup, which currently take up nine weekends, but they face a fight with the French and English clubs who two years ago won a long battle to assume operational command of the tournaments.</p> <p>\u201cI think they will struggle to come up with something that makes everyone happy,\u201d said Gloucester\u2019s New Zealand prop John Afoa. \u201cThe schedule in the south is already better and if summer tours are moved to July, it would mean everything there could be played in distinct blocks, as it used to be when you would have an intense Super Rugby campaign, rest up for a few weeks, and then have Tests against touring teams followed by the Rugby Championship and an end-of-season tour.</p> <p>\u201cIt amounted to two smaller seasons but in Europe it is one long, messy one and that looks like staying the same. The schedule here makes it harder for teams to travel on tour at the end of a season but having no June Tests after a World Cup would mean, as well as a loss of revenue for unions in the south, a chance to look at new talent and blood players would be lost. It will take a long time to sort all this out with so many countries and people involved and I hope the second tier nations are not forgotten. Another issue is that with guys playing so many Tests now, local competitions are becoming diluted.\u201d</p> <p>Talks so far have largely been informal, which is why there was surprise throughout the rugby world at reports that there had been agreement on aspects such as tours. The current tour schedule lasts until the end of the 2019 World Cup and it has little chance of being renewed if it means two incoming tours for the south, one in a Lions year, and three for the north in between World Cups \u2013 unless the southern hemisphere nations were given a share of the profits.</p> <p>One idea which has been kicked around is that Test matches should be played in July and August in both hemispheres with some of the proceeds pooled. It has yet to achieve lift-off, with unions here not wanting to end the November international window, although if the club season did not start until October, some players would make only one or two appearances before rejoining their countries. The debate has only just begun.</p>",

Humans enter into a new ecosystem, and the largest animals are killed off first. Marine systems have been spared up to now, because until relatively recently, humans were restricted to coastal areas and didn\u2019t have the technology to fish in the deep ocean on an industrial scale.\u201d<br></p> <p>Fellow author Douglas McCauley said large body size was often linked with the need for larger ocean spaces to range in, so an increasing trend for governments to create very large marine protected areas could hold some hope for species.</p> <p>\u201cHistorically marine protected areas have been small boutique affairs - more like the size of golf courses. In the past five years, however, the world has begun aggressively setting up very large marine protected areas. </p> <p>\u201cRecently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/26/obama-to-create-worlds-largest-protected-marine-area-off-coast-of-hawaii-papahanaumokuakea\">Obama created the world\u2019s largest protected area in Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea</a>, a protected area just over a million square kilometres in size. This is really good news as parks of this size will indeed provide meaningful protection for large vulnerable animals we highlight as being at risk.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Aditya Chakrabortty\u2019s article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/13/britain-bosses-fat-lazy-liam-fox-tories\">Britain\u2019s bosses fat and lazy? For once, Liam Fox has a point</a>, 13 September) echoes the findings of Martin Wiener who, in 1981, wrote <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/English-Culture-Decline-Industrial-1850-1980/dp/0521604796\">English Culture and the Decline of the Industrial Spirit (1981)</a>. In essence, Wiener argues that the relative decline of the UK economy over the previous century was due, in part, to the cultural values of British elites. In particular, he saw that industrial and business leaders were more concerned with aping the values of the old agrarian aristocracy. For them, success involved the acquisition of a thousand acres of land and a mansion, preferably in the Cotswolds. This they valued more than the growth of their firms by further injections of available capital.</p> <p>Whatever the strength of Wiener\u2019s analysis, it greatly impressed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/1994/dec/12/obituaries\">Keith Joseph</a> who was then secretary of state for industry in Thatcher\u2019s first cabinet. He held the view that the activities of business and industrial leaders had a more corrosive impact on the UK economy than the actions of union leaders. He recommended that all cabinet ministers should read Wiener\u2019s book and learn the lessons.</p> <p>A feature of Wiener\u2019s analysis was that although the economy was still large when measured by GDP, there was a significant decline in productivity when measured by GDP per capita. The end of the Thatcher period saw a significant decline in manufacturing output as a proportion of GDP.</p> <p>This is still the position today, even though during the referendum campaign Fox and other Brexit leaders proudly proclaimed the strength of the economy, the fifth largest in the world \u2013 a strength that they claimed will enable us to face the rigours and uncertainties of the global market.</p> <p>He either did not know, or did not wish to inform the electorate, that our economy measured by GDP per capita is placed 25th in the IMF ranking of world economies. This reflects low levels of productivity, a consequence of under-investment in the economy.</p> <p>Wiener\u2019s cultural argument is demonstrated fully in the recent case of Philip Green, who took hundreds of millions out of BHS for his private consumption.</p> <p>So why is Liam Fox now so concerned about the performance of industrial and business leaders when weeks ago he was lauding the strength of the UK economy? Is it because he now recognises our vulnerability as an isolated economy in the global marketplace and that if things go badly wrong for the economy then who is to take the blame? Fox can hardly blame the large number of workers who voted to leave. A far more acceptable scapegoat will be the fat and lazy business elite who could not be bothered to export and who anyway had voted to remain in the EU.<br><strong>Gerald Crawley</strong><br><em>St Briavels, Gloucestershire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty\u2019s criticism of Liam Fox\u2019s remarks on British bosses being fat and lazy is fine as far as it goes. But he doesn\u2019t diagnose the underlying structural cause. The British economy has long been dominated by financial markets and banks. The preeminence of London as an international financial centre has increasingly been seen in the era of globalisation, but especially since the big bang negotiated in 1983 and implemented in 1986, as the core of British economic success, punching above its weight in the world. However, as many analysts have shown \u2013 for example, Adair Turner in his groundbreaking book <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/25/between-debt-and-devil-adair-turner-review\">Between Debt and the Devil</a> \u2013 the financial services industry is concerned not with supporting the productive economy but with \u201cbidding up existing assets\u201d.</p> <p>Productive investment has slumped dramatically over the years, with profits from the origination and trading of mortgages, derivatives and other pure debt instruments underpinning the lifestyles of economic elites and undermining those of workers. The global financial crisis has merely reinforced this trend. In this environment, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/mazzucato-mariana\">Mariana Mazzucato</a> and others have argued, only a state-led industrial strategy, along with real economy-based financial regulation, can start to reorient the British economy towards regeneration and a more just distribution of rewards. Whether the May government\u2019s stress on industrial strategy will mark a sea change is of course doubtful, given the support given by both Tory and Labour governments to the financial sector over the past 30 years.<br><strong>Philip G Cerny</strong><br><em>(Professor emeritus of politics and global affairs, University of Manchester and Rutgers University) York </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><strong><em><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\">guardian.letters@theguardian.com</a></em></strong></p> <p>\u2022 The second letter above was amended on 16 September 2016 to clarify a reference to \u201cthe big bang\u201d.

Her grammar school proposals are almost as unpopular with her own party as they are with the opposition.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I went to grammar school and you went to grammar school so they must be a good idea, right?\u201d she said. Tory heads went even further down. When the personal is the only defence for a public policy, the game is up. You might as well dismantle the NHS and replace it with homeopathy on the grounds that the health secretary had once got rid of a headache by taking some Nux Vomica.

Telling the Commons she isn\u2019t going to give a running commentary on the running commentary she isn\u2019t giving about the government\u2019s lack of progress is ultimately unsustainable. Caught between the near-impossibility of Brexit and the self-inflicted injury of grammar schools, May hunched a little lower over the dispatch box, beaten and bloodied.</p> <p>Somewhere in a house near Witney, a slightly overweight 49-year-old man hauled himself off the sofa and punched the air.

There are a handful of Lagerst\u00e4tte around the world, famed for yielding remains that retain their fossilised soft tissues, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/lost-worlds/2013/jun/10/dinosaurs-fossils\">feathers</a>, fur, skin and stomach contents. The Senckenburg <em>Psittacosaurus</em> is an exceptional example, even having its cloaca preserved \u2013 the multi-purpose opening for excretion, reproduction and urination.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5f05dfa9d4c44ff43a0f351f68e91286d09117c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5f05dfa9d4c44ff43a0f351f68e91286d09117c/0_0_1362_1314/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Senckenberg Psittacosaur, showing exquisite preservation of skin pigments\" width=\"1000\" height=\"965\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Senckenberg Psittacosaur, showing exquisite preservation of skin pigments.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jakob Vinther</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Vinther is no stranger to Lagerst\u00e4tte. After extensive work on fossils from localities such as Sirius Passet in Greenland, his name has more recently become <a href=\"http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/4/5/522\">synonymous with the study of fossil pigments</a>: in ink sacs from ancient squid, and perhaps more famously in the feathers of avian dinosaurs and fossil birds from Brazil, Germany and China.</p> <p>While the exquisite patterns preserved in this specimen have been recognised before, Vinther\u2019s team is the first to approach it quantitatively. To get a clear picture of the pigments in the dinosaurs\u2019 skin, Vinther\u2019s team fired a laser at the specimen \u2013 think less death-ray and more glow-stick \u2013 to highlight fluorescent materials (calcium phosphate) remaining preserved from the animal\u2019s scales. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/lost-worlds/2013/jun/25/dinosaurs-fossils\">Under an electron microscope, they confirmed the presence of melanosomes</a>: the structures that store pigments in cells and tissues. From there it was a case of photographing the whole fossil and mapping the pigment patterns from the squished Cretaceous dinosaur on to a three-dimensional model. This is where paleoartist Robert Nicholls came in.</p> <p>Based in Bristol, <a href=\"http://paleocreations.com/\">Nicholls is well known for his vivid paleontological artwork</a>. He has worked with the BBC, National Geographic, various authors, and museums to breathe life into prehistory. His sketchbooks reveal a dark sense of humour, from sauropod necks acting as lightning rods, to dinosaurs suffering from dysentery.</p> <p>\u201cSome of my earliest memories are of drawing dinosaurs as a child, and that passion for illustrating extinct animals and environments has never left me,\u201d he tells me enthusiastically. \u201cJakob called me one morning in 2014 and asked if I was interested in reconstructing a fossil dinosaur with accurate colour patterns.

Nicholls created a steel frame and bulked it out using polystyrene and wire mesh, before sculpting the surface in clay:.\u201cThis is where the subject finally comes to life,\u201d he explains, \u201cby adding all the skin details such as scales and wrinkles, and beaks and horns.\u201d A master mould was made from this sculpture, allowing Nicholls to make fibreglass models ready to be painted. </p> <p>I asked Nicholls what makes this <em>Psittacosaurus </em>so special? \u201cThe most surprising features include an unusually large and wide head, highly pigmented clusters of scales on the shoulders, robust limbs, patagiums (skin flaps) behind the hind limbs, and a highly pigmented cloaca.\u201d These features make him confident this is the most accurate reconstruction ever produced: \u201cWhen the anatomy surprises me \u2013 it confirms that I\u2019ve followed the fossil evidence rather than any preconceived ideas of my own.\u201d</p> <p>Recent palaeontological re-examinations of the <em>Psittacosaurus</em> are more than skin deep. The dinosaur takes its name from the Psittacines, the parrots, because of its superficially parrot-like beak and skull. This is a vivid simile, but it has led some palaeontologists (and palaeoartists) down an unhelpfully literal path. In 2010 the renowned palaeontologist Paul Sereno argued that \u201cparrot-like\u201d was more than just phraseology: he suggested psittacosaurs even had the same musculature as their modern bird analogues. This was controversial because parrots have evolved unique muscles not seen in other birds, or reptiles. Could such unusual muscles have appeared in this single group of dinosaurs?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3c6371ef544b3961220d6c87c26221b64da9d35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3c6371ef544b3961220d6c87c26221b64da9d35/0_0_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Although Psittacosaurus looks parrot-like, the resemblance is misleading.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Although <em>Psittacosaurus </em>looks parrot-like, the resemblance is misleading.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicolas Asfouri/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cParrots and Psittacosaurs might look the same superficially, but the idea that they had the same muscle arrangements just seemed a little far-fetched,\u201d explained Adam Taylor, recent MSc palaeobiology graduate from the University of Bristol. Taylor\u2019s thesis on the musculature and function of <em>Psittacosaurus</em> \u2013 due to be published soon in <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1932-8494\"><em>The Anatomical Record</em></a> \u2013 is the most detailed reconstruction of this dinosaur\u2019s soft facial anatomy carried out so far. After CT-scanning and digitally reconstructing the skull, Taylor\u2019s team computer-modelled different possible arrangements of <em>Psittacosaurus</em> musculature and used an engineering method called finite element analysis (FEA) to test the bite forces and stress experienced in the skull during feeding. \u201cThe psittacosaur beak is more rounded so bite force is spread over a greater area. If this parrot-like musculature were to arise in one species, you would expect to see evidence for it elsewhere in the lineage \u2013 we don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>So, despite the name, <em>Psittacosaurus </em>was not the dazzling parrot of the Mesozoic. Indeed, Vinther\u2019s team reveals it was a creature more likely to stick to the shade. </p> <p>Usually when reconstructing an animal, paleoartists research the creature\u2019s anatomy, then the habitat it lived in, and use modern analogues to imagine likely colouration that matches the extinct animal\u2019s lifestyle. Vinther\u2019s study turns this process on its head: if you know the animal\u2019s skin patterns in great detail, what does this tell you about how it lived?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f915bb056ccc520246e4b5919ca05a74c6ee8725\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f915bb056ccc520246e4b5919ca05a74c6ee8725/0_0_4083_1184/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Countershading in gazelle and roe deer fur patterns.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"290\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Countershading in gazelle and roe deer fur patterns.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles J. Sharp/Jojo/Wikimedia/Charles J. Sharp/Jojo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Previous studies have shown that patterning on animals is tailored to their environment. Species that dwell in the open, such as gazelle on the African plains, tend to have dark backs and light bellies, with the pale colouration extending high up the body and neck. In animals that live in forested environments where light is more diffuse \u2013 such as the roe deer \u2013 only the stomach is pale, and sometimes spots or speckles on the body mimic dappled light from the canopy. This link between environment and colouration is called countershading. It helps an animal to blend into the landscape by making it appear less three-dimensional to predators. The strategy is so effective it has long been utilised by the armed forces in the development of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/feb/19/spot-the-sniper-camouflaged-art-of-disguise\">man-made camouflage</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d567d788f575cdf376ad9ec13ebe3961fe49d112\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d567d788f575cdf376ad9ec13ebe3961fe49d112/0_0_800_600/500.jpg\" alt=\"Countershading.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Countershading.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Chiswick Chap</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cColouration\u201d, says Vinther, \u201ctells us something about the dynamics between predators and their prey, among others.

  "<p>The last time Rocco Di Pietro saw <a href=\"http://www.mjleach.com/eastman.htm\">Julius Eastman</a> was on a freezing April morning in Buffalo in 1989. \u201cJulius showed up at my door,\u201d remembers Di Pietro. \u201cHe was homeless and looking for bus money to get to California. I gave him what I could, offered to make him an omelette, buy him cigarettes and drive him to the station. He was wearing this oversize jacket with all these pockets. They were stuffed with miniature scores. He pulled out this Brahms lieder, sat at my piano, and played. He was singing full-force. It was unbearable. He still had such a wonderful voice. I never saw him again. A year later I heard he was dead.\u201d </p> <p> It\u2019s an August afternoon in Columbus, Ohio, and 66-year-old teacher and composer Di Pietro is in his basement looking through old letters. We should be discussing the release of <a href=\"http://frozenreeds.com/?p=300\">Femenine</a>, a recently discovered 1974 recording by his old friend, the late composer Julius Eastman, but memories keep getting in the way. \u201cI came down this morning,\u201d says Pietro, an audible catch in his voice. \u201cI don\u2019t know why. Your phone call, maybe. And I found all these letters from Julius, and a handwritten score. And all these years I\u2019ve been telling people I don\u2019t have any.\u201d </p> <p> When Eastman died of heart failure, alone, in Millard Fillmore hospital in Buffalo, New York, on 28 May 1990, aged just 49, his work disappeared with him. A former child soprano and ballet dancer from Ithaca, New York, who studied piano and composition at Philadelphia\u2019s Curtis Institute, Eastman first came to prominence with Buffalo University\u2019s early 70s avant-garde <a href=\"http://www.semensemble.org/\">SEM Ensemble</a>, performing with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2012/nov/12/morton-feldman-contemporary-music-guide\">Morton Feldman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2012/aug/13/john-cage-contemporary-music-guide\">John Cage</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2012/may/07/guide-contemporary-music-pauline-oliveros\">Pauline Oliveros</a>. Through bravura piano and vocal recitals at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center, his reputation grew, culminating with a Grammy-nominated performance as George III on the 1973 recording of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Maxwell-Davies-Donnithornes-Maggot-Songs/dp/B000001PCI\">Peter Maxwell Davies\u2019s Eight Songs For A Mad King</a>. </p> <p> Yet, as an out gay black man working in a predominantly straight white environment, Eastman grew progressively more uncomfortable. In a pivotal SEM performance of <a href=\"http://www.rosewhitemusic.com/cage/texts/SongBooks.html\">John Cage\u2019s Song Books</a> in June 1975, with Cage present, Eastman staged a lecture on \u201ca new system of love\u201d in which he undressed a male volunteer (possibly his boyfriend), while making sexual overtures in acrobatic baritone. Cage was furious. </p> <p>\u201cJulius tried to \u2018out\u2019 Cage,\u201d Di Pietro says. \u201cHe said, I hate that Cage never speaks about sex. But he regretted it because Cage was so angry. Julius was deeply divided.\u201d</p> <p> \u201cCage thought it was a parody of him,\u201d says SEM co-founder <a href=\"http://www.semensemble.org/about/petr-kotik\">Petr Kotik</a>. \u201cIt was a huge scandal. Julius started identifying with the black community. He moved to New York in 1976, just as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2012/jul/16/pierre-boulez-contemporary-music-guide\">Pierre Boulez</a> wanted to do Mad King with him. Do you know how many doors that would have opened?\u201d </p> <p> Instead, Eastman immersed himself in Manhattan\u2019s downtown scene, collaborating with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2012/nov/19/contemporary-music-guide-meredith-monk\">Meredith Monk</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/dec/29/robert-wilson-the-art-my-generation-produced-wont-be-seen-in-50-years\">Robert Wilson </a>and, significantly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/17/arthur-russell-alexis-taylor-devandra-banhart\">Arthur Russell</a>. He conducted the orchestras for Russell\u2019s Instrumentals and Tower of Meaning.

He said, \u2018Don\u2019t you play with the Lounge Lizards? I want to meet their keyboard player.\u2019 He wanted to give me composition lessons. My first lesson was to play Satie, whilst he put on lipstick. I now wonder if that was a test, to see if it would push me away. He was saying, I have all of this knowledge I want to pass on. I still have my copy of Gymnop\u00e9dies, smeared in red. The lessons petered out [when] things became difficult for Julius.\u201d</p> <p> Around the end of 1981, Eastman was evicted from his East Village apartment due to unpaid rent. All his belongings, including his music, were abandoned on the street and, when he didn\u2019t return, taken to the city dump. Effectively homeless, still composing, Eastman became increasingly reliant on alcohol and drugs. He lived rough for a few years in Tompkins Square Park, then drifted off the map. Following his death, eight months passed before the first obituary.</p> <p> \u201cThat\u2019s the first I knew he\u2019d died,\u201d says composer <a href=\"http://www.mjleach.com/\">Mary Jane Leach</a>. \u201cI\u2019d first met him in New York, spring 1981. We all thought we were pretty hip back then, but Julius walked in off the street, dressed in leather and chains, drinking from a glass of scotch at 10 in the morning. It was like, woah!\u201d </p> <p> In 1998, Leach began teaching composition at<a href=\"https://www.calarts.edu/\"> Cal Arts</a>. Attempting to track down an Eastman piece for 10 cellos she\u2019d seen him conduct in 1981, Leach encountered a series of dead ends: \u201cIt gradually dawned on me. All his music was missing.\u201d</p> <p> As a consequence, Leach became \u201can accidental musicologist\u201d, hunting for Eastman\u2019s lost works. \u201cMy analogy is like coming across an accident,\u201d she says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t walk away and hope someone else would show up.\u201d </p> <p> First fruits came in 2005 with <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/julius-eastman-unjust-malaise-mw0001391274\">Unjust Malaise</a>, a 3CD collection centred around a January 1980 Northwestern University concert for four pianos, a trio of hour-plus post-minimalist pieces entitled Evil Nigger, Crazy Nigger and Gay Guerrilla. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxtLoItArrc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QxtLoItArrc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p> In a spoken-word introduction, Eastman equates the \u201cNigger\u201d series with \u201cthe field niggers on which the American economic system was built \u2026 that fundamental thing which eschews the superficial\u201d. Gay Guerrilla, he adds, \u201cmeans someone sacrificing his life for a point of view \u2026 [I hope] I might be one, if called upon.\u201d </p> <p>Unjust Malaise effectively rewrote the history of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/programs/specials/vote/list100.html\">post-war American New Music</a>, restoring to its narrative a gay black voice creating a liberating, high-energy form of organic minimalism.

That is why Jeremy Corbyn won today, handsomely. Theresa May may be entirely sincere in her desire to create more good schools, and her point about \u201cselection by house price\u201d is a good one, but Corbyn successfully highlighted some of the multiple flaws with her grammar policy. Where are the experts who back it? Why do FSM (free school meal) pupils in grammar-school Kent do so much worse than those in non-grammar London? Will pupils at grammar school feeder schools be guaranteed a place? How can segregation at 11 be justified? On all these questions, May couldn\u2019t provide an answer. It was easily her worst PMQs so far.</p> <p>And that\u2019s what I thought watching it in TV from my desk. Many of the journalists who tweet and report on PMQs watch it from press gallery in the chamber and they often get a different impression because they hear the actual noise levels (which can be much louder, and much more one-sided, than you would realise from just following it on TV). And they tell me what was striking was how little support May was getting from her own side. That\u2019s not because Tory MPs have suddenly gone all Corbynite; it\u2019s because many of them have serious reservations about grammar schools. On the basis of today\u2019s PMQs, and judging by what happened the last time Corbyn won a PMQs so clearly on an education matter (see<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/14/pmqs-corbyn-may-brexit-cannot-have-a-la-carte-access-to-single-market-eu-chief-says-politics-live?page=with:block-57d932e7e4b0e813b694cea5#block-57d932e7e4b0e813b694cea5\"> 12.26pm)</a>, the chances of May\u2019s plans being ditched, or having to be substantially amended, must be quite high.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T12:13:07.732Z\">at 1.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d93845e4b067ad300879bf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T11:49:34.468Z\">12.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My PMQs coverage normally leaves out <strong>Angus Robertson</strong>, the SNP leader, because he asks his questions as I\u2019m writing my snap verdict.

He asked May:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Does she agree with Mr Verhofstadt, the EU negotiator, and the Scottish government who want to protect Scotland\u2019s place in Europe?</p> </blockquote> <p>May responded by saying the Scots voted to stay in the UK two years ago.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s all very well him asking that question but only two years ago he didn\u2019t want to protect Scotland\u2019s place in the EU because he wanted Scotland to leave the Uk and on all of these questions - whether it\u2019s the q of the EU referendum, the referendum on independence on Scotland, the right honourable gentleman seems to think if he asks the same question all the time he\u2019ll get a different answer.

Again, he challenged the PM over the lack of support for the plan and, again, he won the exchange because he had the best arguments. He was not flash (he never is), but his fourth question, where he spoke passionately about how wrong it was to separate children at 11, was powerful, and it was telling that towards the end Theresa May resorted to having to change the subject. Unlike last week May restricted her jokes to her final answer, but even her pay-off soundbite did not quite work. It was premised on the idea that this might be Corbyn\u2019s last PMQs.

It is about offering ladders to everyone. He quotes someone saying there is something hopeless about grammar schools, and the idea only some pupils can benefit. It was Cameron, he says, who said this.</p> <p>May says she wants a diversity of good provision. Good school places are important. Corbyn has still not welcomed the employment figures, she say. Labour would offer more taxation for working families.</p> <p>Corbyn welcomes anyone who can get a job. But there are now almost 1m people on zero-hours contracts. She quotes Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector of schools. He said the idea the poor will benefit from grammar schools is \u201ctosh and nonsense\u201d. The Tory green paper addresses none of the problems in education, he says. Isn\u2019t this the case of a government heading backwards, to segregated schooling and second-class schooling for the many.</p> <p>May says some of Corbyn\u2019s facts were wrong. There are more teachers in schools. Corbyn has opposed all measures to improve schools, such as those on parent choice, and free schools. This may be Corbyn\u2019s last PMQs, she says. So she will recap some of the things Corbyn has introduced. He wants coal mines without mining them, submarines without weapons, and to be a leader without leading. </p> <p><strong>John Bercow </strong>intervenes. Progress has been absurdly slow, he says.</p> <p>But he will get down the list.

We don\u2019t need to and never should divide children at the age of 11. Can May confirm whether existing grammar schools will have to widen their existing admission?</p> <p>May says she wants all grammar schools to educate a wide range of pupils. She wants a good education for every child. There are 1.25m children who are in schools that are not good or outstanding. She believes in the education that is right for every child.

Can she name any educational experts that back her grammar school plans?</p> <p>May also pays tribute to the police constable stabbed. As home secretary she looked forward to going to the policy bravery awards, she says.</p> <p>On education she says 1.4m more children are in good and outstanding schools. That is because of the government\u2019s reforms, which Corbyn opposes. She wants more good school places, she says.</p> <p>Corbyn says he asked if May could name any experts who backed the policy. She could not. He quotes John, a teacher, asking why all schools cannot be funded properly. In Kent 27% of pupils on free school meals get five good GCSEs. In London it is 45%.</p> <p>May says Corbyn should stop casting his mind back to the 1950s. She will be ensuring that the government provides good school places for the 1.25m pupils in schools that are failing or that need improvement.</p> <p>In grammar schools the attainment gap is virtually zero, she says.

The committee of privileges has found that I am not guilty of contempt of parliament.</p> <p>After more than four years, the committee of privileges has thrown out the charges that I was guilty of contempt of parliament and a cover-up of phone hacking. Its findings are too little and too late, coming so long after I was vilified by MPs in a 125-page report, a televised press conference and a 90-minute House of Commons debate. </p> <p>The culture media and sport select committee reached its false findings in 2012. It posed as a quasi-judicial body with the right to impose criminal punishments, yet followed none of the usual rules of law and fair process. It carried out an amateur investigation, missed vital evidence, and some members displayed no pretence at impartiality. Even before its report was released, the committee\u2019s most vocal member, Tom Watson MP, published a book accusing me of misleading the committee. </p> <p>Today\u2019s report by the committee of privileges speaks proudly of its concern to \u201cmeet modern standards of fairness\u201d in deciding whether the culture committee had been \u201ccorrect\u201d in its findings.</p> <p>Parliament has a back-to-front idea of justice and fairness when it claims these standards after allowing the sham trial and free-for-all character assassination I experienced in 2012. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"905cddc05ab32e91cbb20125ee122f4106e9df85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/905cddc05ab32e91cbb20125ee122f4106e9df85/0_5_1950_1170/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Les Hinton giving evidence to the Commons culture committee in 2007.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Les Hinton giving evidence to the Commons culture committee in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA/PA Archive/Press Association Ima</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d91f29e4b0e813b694ce2a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T09:58:23.265Z\">10.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is my colleague<strong> Lisa Carroll\u2019</strong>s report on the privileges committee\u2019s findings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/14/news-of-the-world-executives-in-contempt-of-commons-phone-hacking-colin-myler-tom-crone\">NoW executives found in contempt of Commons over phone-hacking</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d91b27e4b0e813b694ce11\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T09:54:54.763Z\">10.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Why 'admonishment' is the only penalty Myler and Crone face - and what it means</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The privileges committee says that the House of Commons as a whole should pass a motion admonishing Colin Myler and Tom Crone because that is the only punishment available to MPs for contempt of parliament. \u201cAdmonishment\u201d is the term used by the committee. It means censure or, to put it colloquially, a severe bollocking.</p> <p>If MPs are found to have broken parliament\u2019s rules, they can be suspended. Back in the eighteenth century parliament also had the power to imprison members of the public found to be in contempt (often reporters publishing reports that offended MPs). But that power is deemed to have lapsed.</p> <p>MPs could in theory summon someone to attend the Bar of the House of Commons (the bit marking the formal entrance to the chamber, not the place where they serve drinks) to be reprimanded in person. This happened to John Junor in 1957 when he was editor of the Sunday Express. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Junor\">Junor had written an article criticising MPs for their use of petrol allowances </a>(rationing still applied) and, although he apologised for the contempt, he did so without retracting his comment.</p> <p>In today\u2019s report the privileges committee said it considered summoning Myler and Crone to the Bar of the House. But it has not recommended that step - probably because the 1957 episode was seen at the time as a bit of a farce, and something that did not reflect well on MPs. It is also not clear what would happen if someone were summoned but refused to turn up.</p> <p>Instead what will happen is that MPs will debate the motion proposed by the privileges committee.

Associated correspondence and evidence is published on the internet.</p> <p> The report follows the referral to the Committee by the House of the Eleventh Report of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee (Session 2010-12) which concluded that it has been misled by witnesses during its inquiries into phone-hacking. Based on the evidence and applying the standard of proof that the allegations must be significantly more likely than not to be true, the Committee of Privileges has found that:</p> <p> a) Mr Colin Myler misled the CMS Committee by \u201canswering questions falsely about [his] knowledge of evidence that other News of the World employees had been involved in phone\u2010hacking and other wrongdoing\u201d.</p> <p>b) Mr Tom Crone misled the CMS Committee in 2009 by giving a counter impression of the significance of confidentiality in the Gordon Taylor settlement.</p> <p>c) Tom Crone misled the CMS Committee by \u201canswering questions falsely about [his] knowledge of evidence that other News of the World employees had been involved in phone\u2010hacking and other wrongdoing\u201d.</p> <p> The Committee therefore finds Mr Myler (former editor of the News of the World) and Mr Crone (former legal manager at News International) to have been in contempt of the House.</p> <p> The Committee also found that:</p> <p> d) There is insufficient evidence to find that Tom Crone sought to mislead the CMS Committee about the commissioning of surveillance.</p> <p>e) The allegation that Les Hinton sought to mislead the CMS Committee as to the extent of the pay\u2010off to Clive Goodman and his own role in authorising the payments is not significantly more likely than not to be true.</p> <p>f) The evidence that Les Hinton misled the CMS Committee about the extent of his knowledge of allegations that phone\u2010hacking extended beyond Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire to others at the News of the World does not meet the standard of proof set for a finding of contempt.</p> <p>g) While the Culture, Media and Sport Committee was sceptical about Mr Hinton\u2019s memory, there is no evidence that he misled the Committee in relation to his role in the payment of legal fees or the fact that he authorised the payments to Mr Goodman to settle his Employment Tribunal claim.</p> <p>h) There is insufficient evidence of a breach of Parliamentary privilege on the part of NI (now News UK). NOTW was not a corporate body. As such, the Committee does not consider NI to have committed a contempt.</p> <p> The Committee recommends that the House be invited to agree a motion in the following terms:</p> <p> That this House\u2014</p> <p> i) approves the First Report from the Committee of Privileges;</p> <p> ii) having regard to the conclusions of the Committee in respect of Mr Colin Myler, considers that Mr Myler misled the Culture, Media and Sport Committee by answering questions falsely about his knowledge of evidence that other News of the World employees had been involved in phone\u2010hacking and other wrongdoing, and therefore formally admonishes him for his conduct; and</p> <p> iii) having regard to the conclusions of the Committee in respect of Mr Tom Crone, considers that Mr Crone misled the Culture, Media and Sport Committee by giving a counter\u2010impression of the significance of confidentiality in the Gordon Taylor settlement and by answering questions falsely about his knowledge of evidence that other News of the World employees had been involved in phone\u2010hacking and other wrongdoing, and therefore formally admonishes him for his conduct.</p> <p> The Committee also recommends that the Leader of the House take steps as soon as possible to address the issues identified by the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege in 2013, particularly in respect of the penal powers of the House and select committees and contempt.</p> <p> The Government is expected to find an early date for debate on the Committee\u2019s report.</p> </blockquote> <p>And this is what it means.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Two very senior former News International executives, the former News of the World editor Colin Myler and the former News International legal manager Tom Crone, have been censured for misleading MPs when they gave evidence to the phone-hacking inquiry.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>A third executive, Les Hinton, the former News International chairman, has been cleared of misleading MPs - but only because the evidence did not meet a relatively high burden of proof.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>MPs are set to pass a motion censuring Myler and Crone.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>News International \u201cas a corporate body\u201d has not been found guilty of lying.</strong></li> <li><strong>The privileges committee is calling for an investigation into what can be done to punish witnesses who lie to select committees.

For the former, cleansing is the only goal; for the latter, says Withers, washing is a preliminary ritual in a watery odyssey.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5adf4b9d02750ba12527e4422690e2e506d5e049\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5adf4b9d02750ba12527e4422690e2e506d5e049/0_48_597_399/500.jpg\" alt=\"Kengo Kuma\u2019s Kogohi Bathhouse in Japan.\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Forest fringe \u2026 Kengo Kuma\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.londondesignfestival.com/events/soak-steam-dream-reinventing-bathing-culture\">Kogohi Bathhouse</a> in Japan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roca London Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We're not sauna obsessives \u2026 but with everyone stripped of clothing, the sauna is ultimately a democratic space</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is this odyssey she hopes to take visitors on, having spent years \u201cbathing in the shadows of the great water cultures\u201d, from a Roman bath off-grid in rural Tunisia and a Japanese <em>onsen</em> where sulphurous hot springs bubble into the cold river water to Moscow\u2019s great Sandunovsk\u00fd baths, \u201cwhere the <em>banya</em> stove bellows flames like a dragon\u201d.</p> <p>Some of the most curious structures in the show come from<a href=\"http://www.h3t.cz/\"> Czech group H3T</a>, whose love of steaming goes back to their earliest projects together as students.

She added: \u201cIn recent years DfID [the UK\u2019s Department for International Development] has been a global leader in ensuring that girls and young women are protected from violence and exploitation so that they can fulfil their potential. This sort of work too is critical to achieve our aim of a just, stable and prosperous world.\u201d</p> <p>Oxley added that proof of Patel\u2019s commitment to development will become apparent later this week as a conference to announce the <a href=\"http://international.gc.ca/world-monde/campaign-campagne/gfatm-fmstp/replenishment-conference-reconstitution.aspx?lang=eng\">replenishment of the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria</a> is happening in Montreal. \u201cThe UK has historically been a big donor to the Global Fund precisely because it gets results and is constantly working to improve its impact,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look forward to seeing a strong pledge from the UK that will directly contribute to saving millions of lives and help end these epidemics for good.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/sep/05/tb-kills-three-people-every-minute-the-world-must-wake-up-to-this-pandemic\">France has pledged $1.08bn</a> (\u00a30.82bn), but the UK is yet to donate.</p> <p>\u201cUK aid is respected throughout the world as being among the most effective and most scrutinised,\u201d said Ben Jackson, chief executive of Bond, which represents NGOs in the UK. \u201cWe would welcome the opportunity to discuss with the secretary of state the ways in which aid can be delivered in the most effective way possible, to help the poorest people.\u201d</p> <p>Alex Scrivener, policy officer at Global Justice Now, hopes that Patel reconsiders her views. \u201cAid is not perfect,\u201d said Scrivener. \u201cBut that is no excuse for Priti Patel to divert money meant to help the poor into supporting multinationals in the name of free trade and the UK national interest.

Our wonderful nature is in serious trouble and it needs our help as never before. This document produces facts and figures. We are living at a time of climate change so we need to know what is happening to wildlife. It gives us a huge opportunity. I hope we can take it,\u201d said Attenborough. </p> <p>Andrea Leadsom, in one of her first speeches as environment secretary at the same event, made no reference to nature protection after Britain leaves the EU, or the birds, habitats and other directives which have been the backbone of British conservation for 40 years. </p> <p>\u201cI want a 25-year plan for the environment, a truly long-term vision that sets the direction for future policy. We will publish a framework setting out a game-changing approach,\u201d she said at the event. </p> <p>She added: \u201cFollowing our decision to leave the EU, we now have a unique opportunity to develop a set of policies tailored to the needs of the United Kingdom, our species and our habitats.\u201d </p> <p>Leadom said the report showed the scale of the challenge facing Britain\u2019s environment but said there was much to celebrate. \u201cWe have truly ambitious plans to transform our approach to the environment,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She added that government would use big data and new technology \u201cto tackle old problems in different ways\u201d.</p> <p> Conservationists said the report was shocking, showing that modern agricultural techniques had had a major, negative impact on wildlife.</p> <p>\u201cIncreasing agricultural production has fundamentally changed the countryside. The report shows that we do not have a green and pleasant land. We have little more than green concrete yet we have come to accept it,\u201d said Trevor Dines, a botanist with the NGO Plantlife. </p> <p>\u201cThe pendulum has swung too far towards production. Big agriculture has won,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But Guy Smith, National Farmers Union vice president, denied that farming was to blame for the dramatic wildlife declines recorded in the report. \u201cWhen farmers go out their front doors, and they see their farms, and they see lots of wildlife, and then they open up the newspapers and see the RSPB painting some lurid picture of a countryside with no birds, or bees, or mammals in it, they just get a bit depressed. There are many species that are not declining. All we say is, \u2018just change the record, please\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cOne thing that mystifies us about this is that there has been no intensification of agriculture in the last 25 years,\u201d he told the BBC. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/04/national-trust-calls-for-complete-reform-of-british-farm-subsidies\">National Trust calls for complete reform of British farm subsidies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Caroline Drummond, chief executive of Leaf, a pressure group linking farming with the environment, said: \u201cWhilst this data is compelling, we do not feel it represents the whole picture.

  "<p>The \u201cpresent is the key to the past\u201d is our mantra for all sorts of geological interpretation. We start to understand how the world worked in the past by observing the natural processes happening outside our window. Rocks exposed on higher land are weathered and eroded, bits of rock get transported by river systems and eventually deposited elsewhere. Different communities of plants grow in predictable ecological associations, in different environments.</p> <p>Using this approach to reconstruct a palaeoenvironment based on fossils and other sedimentary evidence from say,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/18/the-fabulous-fossils-of-messel-a-colourful-world-of-birds-and-beetles\"> 50m years ago, </a>works well. The natural world worked in more or less the same way. Go back 200m years and it\u2019s a bit trickier: flowering plants do not dominate the vegetation, and you don\u2019t have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/07/did-milk-and-fur-evolve-before-the-earliest-mammals\">mammals filling every conceivable ecological niche</a>. There\u2019s also the small matter of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/31/new-tyrannosaurus-rex-skeleton-discovered-in-usa-tufts-love-rex\">all the dinosaurs knocking around</a>. But the physical environment is the same, and you can still apply the same general ecological rules, and come out with a workable understanding of how the ecosystem would have functioned. The further back in time you go, the more difficult this gets. One reason is that, in general, the further back in time you go, the less fossil material you have and the less well preserved it is. The other important reason is that the present is not the key to the past, if the modern rules of the game haven\u2019t been established. And this is particularly true for key environmental factors affecting organisms on land, such as soil.</p> <p>The evolution of soils rarely gets a high profile (pun intended: apologies to any soil scientists who might be reading). This is despite the fact that soils literally underpin life on land. We can recognise fossil soils \u2013 paleosols \u2013 in the rock record, and see their development from early soils on a young Earth, barren rock weathered by predominantly physical processes, to the organic-rich, diverse soils we see in many parts of the planet today. Plants have played a key role in the evolution of soils by providing organic matter, but also by increasing soil stability, through their root systems.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec4c015bcf8410c7aaca17ab2de3893003e286e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec4c015bcf8410c7aaca17ab2de3893003e286e2/0_32_1144_686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A reconstruction of the first forests.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eduard Riou\u2019s reconstruction of the first forests.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eduard Riou (1838-1900) from The World Before the Deluge 1872</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first forests, about 390m years ago in the Middle Devonian, are understood to have been the drivers of increased soil stability. The appearance of trees, and the first deep roots, would certainly have had a profound effect on how soils developed, and on landscape stability. But were there earlier underground revolutions which paved the way?</p> <p>Rhizomes are branching stems which grow horizontally, either underground or just above the soil surface, and allow plants to spread vegetatively, producing a large clonal plant. It also helps the plant to cope with disruption in their environment. This is what is happening when you have a persistent patch of horsetails in your garden, no matter how viciously you weed them, or when bracken runs rampant on a hillside. Such spore-producing plants have been using this strategy for a very long time.</p> <p><em>Drepanophycus </em>was a small herbaceous plant found throughout the Devonian Period (roughly 360-420m years ago). It resembles a modern clubmoss (plants such as Selaginella), and it is thought to be an early representative of this group of spore-producing plants (also known as lycopsids). A <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/113/34/9451\">recent study by Jinzhuang Xue of Peking University and colleagues </a>described the complex rhizome and root systems of <em>Drepanophycus</em><em> </em>from the Early Devonian (about 410myears ago) in Yunnan Province of South China. They are preserved in red mudstone paleosols, within repeated sedimentary sequences formed by migrating river channels which were periodically wiped out by floodplains. The rhizomes are preserved as casts, moulds and rhizohaloes (chemically-altered zones) and show \u2018K\u2019 and\u2019H\u2019-shaped branching, which is characteristic of early lycopsids. <em>Drepanophycus </em>is thought to have grown continuously via its rhizomes, trapping fine sediment and enabling stable paleosols to develop. After floodplain events, the same clonal plant appears to recover, with vertical growth into the sedimentary layers above. The lifespan of a plant may have been centuries.</p> <p>The researchers were even able to calculate the total length of rhizomes per cubic metre of sediment, which correlates with how resistant to erosion modern soils are. The figure calculated was at the lower end of the range for modern plant roots, but may have had weak to modest effects on reducing soil erosion. Something is better than nothing! The proportion of meandering river systems (which rely upon and indicate landscape stability) increased through the Devonian Period. The invisible, underground work of rhizomatous plants such as <em>Drepanophycus</em> may have terraformed the Devonian landscape.</p>",

This will not be a trailer for clothes that will go on sale six months later, but a starting gun for a collection designed to be bought, and worn, immediately. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jun/10/paul-smith-design-museum-exhibition\">Paul Smith</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/tom-ford\">Tom Ford</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/sep/05/hilfiger-tommy-30-anniversary\">Tommy Hilfiger</a>, among others, are adopting the same model.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jul/11/new-double-role-at-burberry-may-be-better-fit-for-christopher-bailey\">Christopher Bailey</a>, who as president and chief creative officer at Burberry is at the forefront of the change, calls See Now, Buy Now \u201can ongoing evolution\u201d. The word evolution is interesting, because when the world is in a period of rapid change, Darwin\u2019s process of natural selection goes into fast forward. Take the case of the peppered moth in the Industrial Revolution. At the beginning of the 19th century, the peppered moth was light with dark spots. When the atmosphere in London became filled with soot, the white trees became darker and the lighter coloured moths were more visible to birds. Within a few decades, the moths had evolved to become darker. In the same way, in our era of technological revolution, instant gratification has become the new normal and slow-moving fashion houses look suddenly vulnerable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98f7b1f96db72315e13c299da1d4ab7fdc1286bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98f7b1f96db72315e13c299da1d4ab7fdc1286bf/0_0_2448_2331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fashion shows will no longer be teasers for products that you can buy in six months time, but instead, they will be the starting gun for selling a new collection.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"952\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fashion shows will no longer be teasers for products that you can buy in six months time, but instead, they will be the starting gun for selling a new collection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Clym Evernden</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The messy and confusing phase the fashion industry finds itself in while See Now, Buy Now is in this experimental period need not concern us here. In the end, the success or failure of the concept will be determined not by whether it is convenient for those in the industry, but whether it delivers for the consumer. At first glance, this seems a no-brainer. You see a look you want on the catwalk, you can buy it straight away. Yay! Right? Except it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that. The grand, sweeping narrative of fashion \u2013 the lyrical view, which says that we crave full skirts in times when we yearn for old-fashioned values, or that hemlines get higher when economic confidence goes up \u2013 has traditionally been a folktale woven together in the months after the catwalk season, and presented as a delicious, page-turning big reveal in magazines and shop windows at the moment those collections go on sale. If fashion is reduced to clicking-to-buy on a new pair of boots, will this romantic element be lost?</p> <p>Not necessarily. The runaway success of the box set proves that storytelling can survive \u2013 even thrive \u2013 when an audience consume episodes at their own pace. Primetime slots no longer have the significance they once did, but TV is in a golden age nonetheless. The same could prove true of fashion and catwalk shows.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like the idea of seasonal trends is antiquated already,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/21/business-of-fashion-imran-amed-blogging\">Imran Amed</a>, founder of <a href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/\">Business of Fashion</a>. The two-season model, designed around \u201cautumn/winter\u201d and \u201cspring/summer\u201d as two opposite wardrobes is outmoded in an era of air conditioning, of mass-market long-haul travel, and of a global economy. \u201cWhen we are designing a collection, we are not just creating it for people who live in one climate, one culture, or one way of thinking,\u201d Bailey says. Or as Zach Duane, CEO of Victoria Beckham, puts it, \u201cWhose autumn/winter are we talking about, anyway?\u201d</p> <p>The twice-yearly trend roundup is dead, and in its place has arrived an ongoing \u201cdigital campfire\u201d where stories are shared, embellished, made into myth. Social media has been key to this \u2013 \u201cThe reader has got used to seeing new trends every single day,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/feb/01/lorraine-candy-editor-elle\">Lorraine Candy</a>, Elle\u2019s editor-in-chief \u2013 but the rising influence of menswear within fashion has had an impact, too. Womenswear and menswear are increasingly shown together on the catwalk, with the result that an industry that was once divided into a girls\u2019 school and a boys\u2019 school, and only met at parties, is now integrated. This has brought elements of menswear culture into mainstream fashion, and in particular a more drip-feed notion of trend. As Fiona Firth, buying director at <a href=\"https://www.mrporter.com/\">Mr Porter</a>, says, \u201cMenswear is an evolution from one season to the next, so the trends follow suit, and do not change dramatically seasonally.\u201d</p> <p>See Now, Buy Now is \u201cabsolutely logical\u201d for the huge brands who can afford to make a big noise with their shows, Duane says. \u201cIf you are spending millions of pounds promoting a collection, why on earth would you be doing that six months before it hits store, when you could drive desire at the moment it goes on sale?\u201d But if those brands can utilise the new model to amplify their voice, will that be at the expense of smaller labels, whose point of view will get drowned out? And if fashion becomes more commercial at the expense of experimentation \u2013 is the consumer not, in the end, the loser? If catwalk collections are a direct showcase of, rather than a teaser for, the clothes that will go in store, then it seems logical that the catwalks will be more wearable. \u201cI am the first to raise my hand and say I don\u2019t want to watch a bunch of trenchcoats and T-shirts on the runway,\u201d Amed says. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point? But smart brands will figure out a way to make the show interesting to the audience.\u201d Candy sees a positive in catwalk shows becoming truer representations of the clothes on the shopfloor. \u201cWe always want to shoot things that will actually be in the shops, and in this system that can be a struggle. So actually, I think it\u2019s quite a good thing.\u201d</p> <p>The most immediate impact of See Now, Buy Now on fashion will be on what you see rather than on what you buy. The details of timing are, in the big picture, less significant than the fact that the catwalk-as-trade-show is almost defunct; the modern catwalk show is an event for the wider fashion audience. This can be literal \u2013 as at Givenchy\u2019s S/S 16 New York show, where 800 seats were reserved for the public \u2013 or virtual, as in the Chanel shows\u2019 visual spectaculars which are instantly magnified through Instagram to reach an audience of millions. The model that triumphs will be the one that best pleases the global fashion audience. The industry is in upheaval, but the oldest adage in business still holds. The customer is always right.</p>",

  "<p>A new school year is starting for students in some countries, but education isn\u2019t a given for all children around the world \u2013 especially girls. Some 62 million girls between ages six and 15 are missing school, according to the World Bank.<br></p> <p>In the face of such worrying statistics, global health and government leaders took action to keep girls learning in northeastern Pakistan\u2019s Punjab state. In the mid-2000s, data showed that only about one-quarter of girls enrolled in middle school. Beyond that, poor girls\u2019 educations were linked to increases in child marriage and teen pregnancy, as detailed in the book <a href=\"http://millionssaved.cgdev.org/case-studies/punjabs-female-school-stipend-program\" rel=\"nofollow\">Millions Saved: New Cases of Success in Global Health</a>.

So the Punjabi government tried a new tactic to keep girls in the classroom and away from early marriages: paying their families.</p> <p><strong>Can money fix it?</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/pakistan-womens-rights-activists-cry-fowl-girls-poultry-lessons\">Pakistan women\u2019s rights activists cry fowl over girls\u2019 poultry lessons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Punjab, leaders employed a tactic that\u2019s part of a larger global health strategy: conditional cash transfers (CCTs). Typically provided by government or nonprofit groups, CCTs give money to vulnerable people in exchange for those people taking certain actions \u2013 such as sending children to school or regularly seeing a doctor. <a href=\"http://www.icrw.org/sites/default/files/publications/IMPACCT_CCTBrief_webready.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">CCTs</a> came into practice in places like Bangladesh in the 1980s. Many developing countries, including <a href=\"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/24556/K8731.pdf?sequence=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Malawi</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/health-revolution/video/2016/jun/14/kenyan-children-oprhans-cash-transfers-vulnerable-caretaker\">Kenya</a>, have started using them, and US metropolitan areas like New York City and Memphis have also tried the transfers.</p> <p>As part of major education reforms in 2003, Pakistan introduced the Female School Stipend Program (FSSP). The program offers 600 rupees, equal to $10 (US dollars), per academic quarter for families of schoolgirls in grades 6 to 10 who lived in one of 15 target districts with low literacy rates. The girls had to attend classes at least 80% of the time to receive the stipend. By 2014, the FSSP covered 393,000 pupils. </p> <p>A cost-effective global health program like this, says George Washington University\u2019s Dr Sarah Baird, can use limited resources to drive two key benefits. First, better education means kids can seek better jobs when they leave school. Second, it improves the wider economy. \u201cYou decrease poverty now and decrease future poverty by encouraging households to invest in children,\u201d says Baird, an associate professor of global health and economics. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about keeping girls in school.\u201d</p> <p>Classroom attendance in Punjab wasn\u2019t the only issue. If any program were to work, then it would need to factor in societal barriers. There are many reasons why girls might not have gone to classes: lack of safe hygiene facilities, domestic duties, fear of violence when traveling between home and school, and the cost of books and uniforms, to name a few. In many places where education is not free or compulsory, Thompson says, parents might invest spare money in schooling for their sons rather than daughters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jun/07/child-marriage-in-nepal-a-girl-is-a-girl-not-a-wife\">Child marriage in Nepal: 'A girl is a girl, not a wife'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Baird notes that CCTs can chip away at school attendance problems, especially if barriers are multifaceted or too costly to fix directly.

  "<p>Bernie Sanders leads a chorus of prominent public figures calling for clemency, a plea agreement or, in several cases, a full pardon for the National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden.<br></p> <p>Writing in the Guardian, the runner-up in the race to become Democratic presidential candidate argues that Snowden helped to educate the American public about how the NSA violated the constitutional rights of citizens with its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded\">mass surveillance program</a>. Sanders argues that there should be some form of resolution that would acknowledge both the \u201ctroubling revelations\u201d that he had brought to light and the crime that he committed in doing so, that would \u201cspare him a long prison sentence or permanent exile\u201d. </p> <p>Sanders joins 20 other prominent public figures \u2013 from Hollywood actors and rock musicians to politicians, professors and Black Lives Matter activists \u2013 who call on Barack Obama to find some way of allowing Snowden to return home to the US from exile in Russia. The Guardian\u2019s voices are raised in the week that Oliver Stone\u2019s film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/snowden\">Snowden</a>, is released in the US and that a coalition of groups including the ACLU and Amnesty International launch a new campaign for a presidential pardon before Obama steps down. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Membership callout\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;html&gt;

They should remove the indictment, pardon him if that\u2019s the way to do it, so that he is no longer facing prison.</p> <p>The NSA and US government have revealed no evidence that the information Ed Snowden released has caused any harm. Inconvenience, yes, embarrassment certainly, but what has truly been revealed is that the NSA itself was unquestionably committing international, domestic and constitutional crimes. </p> <p>Were the government to have any evidence that Snowden revealed information that should have been protected, I think he should be judged by a jury. I was the first person to be tried for a leak under the Espionage Act, and I certainly didn\u2019t object to my case being weighed by a jury, although it never came to that. But there has to be a public interest defense, which doesn\u2019t exist in US law now.</p> <p>As things stand, I think the chance that this or any president will pardon Snowden is zero. They wouldn\u2019t dare to challenge the intelligence community that remains so hostile to him. Nor does Snowden have any chance of a fair trial under the Espionage Act, any more than I did. </p> <p>So nothing would be gained by him coming back and standing trial unless the Espionage Act were changed to permit that public interest defense. He\u2019s said to me that he\u2019s willing to come back and serve one, two or conceivably three years as a result of a plea bargain arranged beforehand, but they haven\u2019t offered him one as far as I\u2019m aware. </p> <h2>Terry Gilliam</h2> <p><strong>Film director and former Monty Python star</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60136e7fa03778ac602e758934501c8a39f2ade1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60136e7fa03778ac602e758934501c8a39f2ade1/296_166_1306_783/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Terry Gilliam\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terry Gilliam: \u2018What Edward Snowden\u2019s prize should be, I don\u2019t know, perhaps something as unglamorous and hard to display on his mantelpiece as a presidential pardon.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim P Whitby/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I think anyone helping to strengthen the workings of democracy should be rewarded.

I would not be supportive of a public interest defense, however, because the American people declare some things to be legal and some things to be illegal, and don\u2019t anoint the individual citizen to decide whether that\u2019s a good or a bad idea.</p> <p>If Snowden really claims that his actions amounted to genuine civil disobedience, he should go to some English language bookstore in Moscow and get a copy of Henry David Thoreau\u2019s Civil Disobedience. Thoreau points out clearly that civil disobedience gets its moral authority by the willingness to suffer the penalties from disobeying a law, even if you think that law is unjust.</p> <p>It would be incredibly unwise for this president to offer a pardon. President Obama and his successors are dependent on the 100,000-plus people inside the American intelligence community \u2013 the people Edward Snowden betrayed.

Are living in communities that are so over-policed they have been turned into open-air prisons?</p> <p>This is why Edward Snowden must be pardoned \u2013 because the ability of black communities to organize for our collective liberation depends, in part, on whistleblowers like him. Black movements for peace and freedom demand that out of the darkness of empire, truth-tellers emerge to sound the alarm. </p> <p>His revelations directly challenged the commonly held belief that media, phone and technology corporations must always give into state interests to target and harass the public.

Apart from exceptional circumstances, citizens have every right to know what their government is doing, in particular what it is doing to them \u2013 in the present case, as Snowden revealed to us, keeping citizens under extensive and deeply intrusive surveillance. </p> <p>No case has been made that relevant exceptional circumstances prevail. As well known, initial claims about prevention of terrorist actions collapsed under investigation, and no credible case has been made that the massive invasion of privacy, arguably in violation of constitutional rights, is warranted. Snowden made every effort to follow established procedures for bringing this crucial information to the general public. When these failed, he took the courageous and honorable step of transmitting the information through the medium of careful and highly reliable and experienced journalists, who, along with him, carefully vetted the material to ensure that no possible harm would be caused to individuals or to security. </p> <p>Citizens of the United States \u2013 and indeed the world, considering the extraordinary range of the operations that have been revealed \u2013 are very much in Snowden\u2019s debt. He should certainly not be punished in any way for the services that he has performed in the interests of democracy and civil rights. At the very least, he should be granted the full freedom to return home without fear of prosecution, and, I very much hope, to be welcomed with the respect that he richly deserves.</p> <h2>Thurston Moore</h2> <p><strong>Singer-songwriter of Sonic Youth</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a084a8518a912f6400fb72447e56d74a383cfb9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a084a8518a912f6400fb72447e56d74a383cfb9f/0_126_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"thurston moore\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thurston Moore: \u2018It has become normal to witness the uncovering of classified information over time.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From the perspective of someone born in the friendly \u201950s in the USA, it has become normal to witness the uncovering of classified information over time ...</p> <p>Living in <em>this</em> day in age one would imagine that we \u2013 so connected now \u2013 could\u2019ve found a way to share resources in a more socially responsible way.

Programs concealed from the citizenry have been declared unconstitutional by federal courts. For the first time, the country has the minimal information necessary to grapple with the benefits and dangers of a surveillance apparatus far more vast and intrusive even than the one Senator Frank Church warned 40 years ago could lead to the eradication of privacy and the imposition of tyranny.</p> <p>Surely in a democracy, the people have a right to know about the implementation of programs with risks as vast as that. Surely in a democracy, the people have a <em>need</em> to know.</p> <p>That today we do know, that today we are able to engage in this critical conversation about how properly to govern ourselves, is almost entirely due to the conscience and courage of one man: Edward Snowden.

Nothing protects us from the abuses of executive power more effectively than their exposure by individual citizens who make them public and sound the alarm. </p> <h2>David Winnick</h2> <p><strong>UK member of parliament and vice-chair of the Home Affairs Committee</strong></p> <p>From the start I thought that Edward Snowden had made a significant contribution in revealing the excesses and, in some instances, illegal surveillance carried out by US agencies.</p> <p>If not for his actions, there would not have been the tightening up of such operations and we would never have known how even leaders of various democracies, such as Chancellor Merkel, had their phones tapped by the National Security Agency.</p> <p> A half a century ago, Daniel Ellsberg was denounced in the US as a traitor for releasing the Pentagon Papers, which contained information concealed from the public about the war being waged against Vietnam. His actions have long since been vindicated, and there is a general consensus that what he did was absolutely right.

I can think of two ways to make that happen.</p> <p>First, President Obama could pardon Snowden at the end of his last term, in the way other outgoing presidents have done in the past. Second, Snowden could be awarded the Nobel peace prize, which would bestow him a certain degree of immunity in the US even if he isn\u2019t pardoned: during the cold war, for example, we saw that Soviet Union was unwilling to prosecute people who had been awarded with such an internationally recognised honour.</p> <p>The key to both of these solutions doesn\u2019t lie in our hands, but there is something we all can do. Like Oliver Stone\u2019s new film, we can try to help emphasise that there is another side to Snowden\u2019s story than the one that prevails in the US media: that this is a man with a lot of integrity, who did a great merit for the civil rights and privacy for the mankind and who knew what he was doing when making a extremely risky decision.</p> <h2>Cindy Cohn</h2> <p><strong>Executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation</strong></p> <p>Whistleblower Edward Snowden\u2019s disclosures provided powerful confirmation that the NSA was spying on the digital lives of hundreds of millions of innocent people, undermining digital security and attacking American companies. The leaks caused a sea change in policy and secrecy related to government spying that led to the first piece of legislation to rein in the NSA in over 30 years, reform to the secret Fisa court, and significant, long-overdue public releases of critical information by the government about its spying on innocent Americans as well as millions of others around the world. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His motivations ... were clearly to benefit the public and restore privacy and security to the internet.</p> <footer> <cite>Cindy Cohn</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The information he revealed was critical to starting a conversation about realigning a broken relationship between the intelligence community and the public. His motivations \u2013 and the impact of the leaks \u2013 were clearly to benefit the public and restore privacy and security to the internet.</p> <p>The heavy price that the government seeks to exact \u2013 indicting him under the Espionage Act as if he had sold secrets to an enemy with no chance of explaining the broader public benefit \u2013 is wrong. Snowden\u2019s behavior both before and after he brought this information to the media is that of a whistleblower who brought necessary public attention to a corrupt surveillance system still in need of further reform. </p> <h2>Mark Udall</h2> <p><strong>Former US senator for Colorado and member of the select committee on intelligence</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7994cbb10d50910f507355ddf4bdeef97b4ec335\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7994cbb10d50910f507355ddf4bdeef97b4ec335/0_46_3312_1987/1000.jpg\" alt=\"mark udall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Senator Mark Udall: \u2018Snowden broke an oath he willingly took to protect our national security and classified secrets.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Dempsey/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Strong oversight of our intelligence agencies is essential so the American people trust what they are doing to keep us safe.

I believe the conduct I encountered proves his contention. The individuals responsible for investigating, prosecuting and adjudicating his actions have lied in court, ignored conflicts of interest and irrevocably tainted the evidence against him.

All these initiatives have been created with minimal funding, but have required time and innovation.<br><br> Other agencies call on Nicoll, who always wears his firefighter\u2019s uniform at work, for help because, as he himself explains, the great thing about being part of the fire service is that people will trust you and let you in. \u201cI get great peace of mind from keeping people safe and I guarantee getting involved in your community will make you feel good too.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <h2>John Shaddick </h2> <p><strong>Service manager, </strong><strong>Avon and Somerset Police/Catch22</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7774742917b51ac59ea07e5c2d59acf1522d4299\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7774742917b51ac59ea07e5c2d59acf1522d4299/0_0_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Shaddick.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Shaddick.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Avon and Somerset Police</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Bright Outlook programme for which John Shaddick has been nominated started life on a single street\u201d: the notoriously crime-ridden Stapleton Road in east Bristol, where Shaddick was assigned as neighbourhood beat manager in 2014, to help change young people\u2019s lives and reduce crime and antisocial behaviour. <br></p> <p>\u201cI quickly recognised there was a massive distrust of the police and that many of the young people being drawn into gang culture were just victims of circumstance.

But three drug users who have struggled for years with their addiction and have become life-threateningly ill as a result, claim that this policy is an abuse of their human rights, and are taking the Russian state to court.</p> <p>Though opioid substitution therapy (OST) \u2013 such as methadone or buprenorphine which are commonly used to treat heroin addiction in the UK \u2013 is banned in Russia, these replacement therapies are globally recognised as one of the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/89/4/11-086850/en/\">most effective treatments of opioid addiction</a>. Russian activists Alexey Kurmanayevskiy, Irina Abdyusheva Teplinskaya and Ivan Anoshkin have exhausted all available treatments in Russia without success, and over the years of battling with their addictions, have contracted HIV (the UN estimates that <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/how-russia-became-the-new-global-leader-in-the-war-on-drugs-ungass\">half of Russia\u2019s new HIV cases last year</a> were injecting drug users). They believe that being denied this treatment <a href=\"http://www.hr-dp.org/files/2016/06/26/ICHRDP_Factsheet_May2016_FINAL1.pdf\">violates international human rights law</a> (pdf) \u2013 in particular, the prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment (article 3) and discrimination (article 14).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/mar/03/not-just-a-party-drug-no-ketamine-means-no-surgery-in-some-developing-countries\">Not just a party drug: no ketamine means no surgery in some developing countries</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In an attempt to gain access to what they see as vital and potentially life-saving healthcare, Kurmanayevskiy, Teplinskaya and Anoshkin have attempted to use Russia\u2019s domestic legal system without success. After four years of litigation and evidence collection, they have submitted their applications to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg, seeking a judgment against the legal prohibition of OST in Russia.</p> <p>Their lawyer Mikhail Golichenko says: \u201cIt\u2019s not only about oppression, it\u2019s also about the disconnect between the state\u2019s imposed values, which very often are far from reality. The fight of human rights is an important treatment for people who use drugs in itself, as many people start using drugs because they don\u2019t feel part of this society, especially in countries like Russia.\u201d</p> <p>If the applicants are successful, it will be the first legally-binding decision from the European court of human rights that recognises drug users as vulnerable people who are entitled to protection.</p> <p>Here they share their reasons for pursuing the cases:</p> <h2><strong>Alexey Kurmanayevskiy, 34</strong></h2> <p>Kurmanayevskiy is a social worker and activist.

When I went to the court to request access to OST \u2013 and when I got all my requests rejected \u2013 I realised an attempt to change the rules in Russia is not only about the access, it\u2019s about Russia\u2019s general approach to dealing with illicit drugs, as well as HIV prevention.</p> <p>I saw how human rights are diminished because of the desire to achieve the so-called drug-free world, and the ideology of drug control which obviously would never be achieved.</p> <p>Although my decision to go public about this application and my use of drugs was a risk \u2013 I was fired from my job and there were problems with my relatives \u2013 I wanted to fulfil some educational function. Many people in Russian society do not know anything about drug dependence, but the lack of social protection in Russia is the main reason why many turn to drug use, to get some relief.</p> <p>I believe another reason is the repressive drug policy that makes people who experiment with drug use permanently stuck. When the person is arrested or hooked up by the state in other ways, they are doomed to remain in this sphere because there is no mechanism to help. There is only a mechanism to oppress.

  "<p>There is an idea that all that matters in Scotland is big constitutional change and that the Scots control this process. It is a dangerous illusion.

That is 6% of what the Scottish government spends. Given the NHS and some other budgets are protected, he suggests other areas of spending could be cut by 17%. Roy speculates that the most likely place for this to happen would be the local government budget.</p> <p>The factors leading to this gloomy prediction are two-fold. The first is the continued austerity programme of the UK, which will see downward pressure on all public spending. The second is the transfer of tax-raising powers to Scotland. In the process of gaining responsibility, Holyrood has also acquired risk. With powers to raise 50% of what it spends, the Scottish government may see income fall if the economy performs badly.</p> <p>Roy reasonably attributes low economic performance in part to the Brexit vote, but that is not the only factor at play. Global sluggishness and borderline deflation are threatening many economies and Scotland is no different. Wherever you turn, there is bad economic news. In previous statements, Roy and the Fraser of Allander are clear that in the event of independence there would be a deficit of around \u00a315bn. Oil revenues have crashed, economic growth lags the rest of the UK and Scotland still runs a large public sector on relatively low taxes.</p> <p>Should Scotland opt to stay in the UK, as looks most likely, then the chances of the existing financial deal between London and Edinburgh lasting much longer look slim.

The emergence of a British nationalist government under Theresa May, seeking independence from Europe and a return to the good old days of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/07/thatcher-grammars-poison-theresa-may-tories\" title=\"\">grammar schools</a>, means it is almost inevitable there will be a fresh assault on a deal viewed by many English voters as unfair.</p> <p>There is a tendency in Scotland to swing from triumphalism to gloom in a heartbeat, yet this is not a case of \u201cwe\u2019re all doomed\u201d.

Exceptional levels of debt, demographic pressures and low growth contribute to a sense that the old model of the state is over \u2013 RIP 1945-2008. But in the need for change lies opportunity.</p> <p>If the demand for independence were about anything substantial, it surely rested on the idea that things could be done differently.

In Scotland, no such body has previously existed \u2013 the political culture of impartial expert analysis and think-tankery is in its infancy north of the border.</p> <p>What Roy is trying to do is widen the debate beyond the partisan camps of yes and no, SNP vs Tory.

In 2004, researchers at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, attempted to explain why Coca-Cola outsells Pepsi, despite Pepsi proving more popular in blind taste-tests (the famous \u201cPepsi challenge\u201d). Using MRI brain scans, they found that, in blind tests, people focused solely on flavour. However, when the subjects knew they were drinking Coke, that information triggered sophisticated brain activity involving memory.

Yet despite increased awareness, the bad-taste outfits don\u2019t go away.</p> <p>Take the group of <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2509893/York-University-students-black-offensive-Cool-Runnings-fancy-dress.html\">York students who blacked up</a> to impersonate the cast of the 1994 film Cool Runnings, for instance.

In Ohio, students at a liberal arts college complained about <a href=\"http://oberlinreview.org/9055/news/cds-appropriates-asian-dishes-students-say/\">culturally appropriative food</a>, arguing that Asian dishes such as b\u00e1nh m\u00ec and sushi were prepared so poorly that it insulted the cultures from which they originated, where food is taken seriously. Lena Dunham, a college alumna, supported the students who complained, saying their mission was \u201cright on\u201d.</p> <h2>How to decide</h2> <p>So where should students draw the line? \u201cThe important thing is to allow the groups affected by these issues to take the lead and determine themselves what they consider problematic,\u201d says Tessy Maritim, who campaigned against cultural appropriation at the University of Manchester. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many people who would turn up in racist fancy dress, but it\u2019s important to call out even just one instance to prevent normalising casual racism.\u201d</p> <p>Ibtehal Hussain, a student in London, points out that student socialising often accidentally excludes black and ethnic minority people, which compounds the issue. \u201cSocieties normally hold their socials in pubs, which can exclude Muslims who don\u2019t always feel comfortable in pubs, which means that a lot of black and brown people won\u2019t attend them,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Ball believes that appropriation isn\u2019t always bad, and cultural exchange is valuable. The Olympics is an example of cultural appropriation, she argues. But it\u2019s a question of how it is done \u2013 whether it celebrates cultures or simply makes a mockery of them. \u201cInteresting forms of cultural appropriation I\u2019ve seen include the adoption of hip-hop related clothing, jewellery and speech styles. Or, for example, the keffiyeh scarf is popular among students and that often functions as an expression of solidarity with Palestinians.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jun/18/oxford-uni-must-decolonise-its-campus-and-curriculum-say-students\">Oxford Uni must decolonise its campus and curriculum, say students</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But not everybody sees it that way. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a thin line when it comes to cultural appropriation, but it definitely stems from racism,\u201d says Shanice Dover, a recent graduate of the University of the West of England. \u201cIt\u2019s continuing this tradition of taking from people of colour and deciding what from that culture is valuable and what isn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cPeople hear the term \u2018cultural appropriation\u2019 and roll their eyes . In their minds, it\u2019s not racism because they associate racism with people like Adolf Hitler or KKK members. They think as long as they aren\u2019t being blatantly hateful like those people, there\u2019s no problem.\u201d</p> <p>So if you find yourself faced with a Mexican social and you\u2019re worried you\u2019ll get barred from the SU for wearing a sombrero, the context could be a clue. </p> <p>Take dressing up as the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, for example. \u201cThere\u2019s the potential for that to be interesting, given her take on indigenous cultural engagement at a time when that was not visible in north American culture,\u201d Ball says. But if someone were to dress up in a garish parody of Frida Kahlo, in a way that was seeking to undermine rather than appreciate, then she thinks that would be problematic. \u201cIt\u2019s a really complex, fine line.\u201d</p> <p>So as long as you\u2019re not ridiculing the culture, or claiming some sort of ownership over it, it\u2019s probably OK. But if you find yourself as part of a men\u2019s football team, staggering down the main road in Durham wearing a monobrow and a flower crown, it might be worth having a think about the events that led up to this, and reconsidering. </p> <p><strong>Keep up with the latest on Guardian Students: follow us on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnstudents\">@GdnStudents</a> \u2013 and <a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/students/\">become a member</a> to receive exclusive benefits and our weekly newsletter.</strong></p>",

That\u2019s become a more elusive goal.\u201d</p> <p>The plaintiffs include students from five of the lowest-performing schools in the city\u2019s system, which recently was overhauled before the start of the new year, after state lawmakers passed <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/cac6a5b4764540c49282c66bb7c26782/qa-michigan-passes-617-million-revamp-detroit-schools\">a $617m plan to restructure the district</a> and shed its long-term debt. Teachers this year have waged large-scale protests over the prospect of working without pay and in subpar working conditions, though officials have <a href=\"http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2016/08/29/district-school-buildings/89532882/\">recently touted improvements in building repairs</a>.</p> <p>The governor\u2019s office said it doesn\u2019t comment on pending lawsuits. A spokesperson for Detroit\u2019s school system said the district\u2019s legal team hasn\u2019t had time to review the case.</p> <p>The lawsuit describes a public school system in Detroit that has experienced a precipitous decline under state oversight. Since 1999, Michigan has implemented various measures to restructure the governance of the system, including a string of appointed emergency managers tasked with overseeing the district\u2019s finances. But in that timeframe, the lawsuit says, the state has \u201cnot addressed the root causes of its failures [with literacy] in any systematic or meaningful way\u201d.</p> <p>The lawsuit cites a list of complaints that have fostered the current environment in Detroit: the proliferation of charter schools, vast schools closures, and \u2013 as part of the overhaul this summer of the district \u2013 a new provision that authorizes the hiring of non-credentialed teachers. Insufficient staff poses additional challenges, too, the suit states.</p> <p>At one school, co-counsel Kathryn Eidmann said an eighth0grade student handled teaching a seventh- and eighth-grade math class for a month because no teacher was available \u2013 a situation reported to the legal team by \u201cnumerous\u201d teachers. And this week, Eidmann said she spoke with a student who started his school year with two classes that don\u2019t have a teacher.</p> <p>\u201cDuring that period, he sits with a substitute in the ROTC classroom,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Eidmann said the case is the first in federal court to argue there is a right to access literacy under the US constitution\u2019s 14th amendment. In 2012, the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan <a href=\"http://www.aclumich.org/article/right-read\">filed a class-action lawsuit</a> in state court on behalf of students in the city of Highland Park\u2019s school system. That suit asserted Michigan had a constitutional obligation to educate students in Highland Park, which borders Detroit. A Michigan court of appeals panel, in 2014, rejected the claims in a 2-1 vote, and the state\u2019s high court <a href=\"http://michiganradio.org/post/michigan-supreme-court-won-t-take-right-read-case-against-state-highland-park-schools\">refused to hear the case</a>.</p> <p>While the federal case over Detroit\u2019s public schools is the first to argue literacy is constitutionally protected, Eidmann said it\u2019s \u201cvery well grounded\u201d in US supreme court precedent. In the 1982 decision of Plyler v Doe, the justices struck down a Texas statute that excluded undocumented immigrant children from public education, and said a state may not \u201cdeny a discrete group of innocent children the free public education that it offers to other children residing within its borders\u201d.</p> <p>Detroit students, predominately low-income and children of color, meet the criteria of a \u201cdiscrete class\u201d, the lawsuit claims, and \u201chave been excluded from the access to literacy that public education provides to other students in the state of Michigan\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThese are schools in name only,\u201d Eidmann said, \u201cwhere students are sitting in the classrooms often with no books, often where there\u2019s no teachers, often where there\u2019s no pretense of literacy taking place. In that sense, they\u2019re being denied a basic education.\u201d</p> <p>Though Rosenbaum\u2019s other case in Highland Park failed at the state level, Tribe said the federal court system is a more appropriate vehicle to address the litany of issues cited in the lawsuit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/07/detroit-public-schools-sickout-lawmakers-plan\">How Detroit's teacher 'sickout' cast a spotlight on unsafe school conditions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s something that a life-tenured federal judge is likely to be much more comfortable with and willing to think through in great detail,\u201d Tribe said.</p> <p>Tribe also believed the lawsuit makes a sound use of the Plyler decision.</p> <p>\u201cWhether it is kids who through no fault of their own were brought to Texas as undocumented aliens at the age of two, or kids through no fault of their own were born and are growing up in Detroit,\u201d he said, \u201cthe idea that saying, by the luck of the draw, you will never be equipped by society with the tools you need to achieve something that resembles the American Dream of upward mobility, that\u2019s a fundamental departure from constitutional principle.\u201d </p> <p>The suit asks the federal court to provide relief that includes evidence-based literacy instruction in every grade level, along with addressing physical school conditions.</p> <p>The five-count complaint names Michigan\u2019s governor, Rick Snyder, as well as several state education officials, as defendants. The state department of education did not respond to a request for comment.

His job was on the line.</p> <p>He asked his main fundraiser, Kate Doner, to write him a [briefing note](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p58/a317774, \u201cGuardian\u201d) on how they could raise enough money to win the election. At 6.39am on a Wednesday, she fired off an email to Walker and his top advisers flagged \u201cred\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d she began. \u201cHere are my quick thoughts on raising money for Walker\u2019s possible recall efforts.\u201d</p> <p>Her advice was bold and to the point. \u201cCorporations,\u201d she said. \u201cGo heavy after them to give.\u201d She continued: \u201cTake Koch\u2019s money. Get on a plane to Vegas and sit down with Sheldon Adelson. Ask for $1m now.\u201d</p> <p>Her advice must have hit a sweet spot, because money was soon pouring in from big corporations and mega-wealthy individuals from across the nation. A few months after the memo, Adelson, a Las Vegas casino magnate who [Forbes estimates](http://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/gallery/sheldon-adelson) has a personal fortune of $26bn, was to [wire a donation of $200,000 for the cause.](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p132/a317501 \u201cGuardian\u201d)</p> <p>Adelson\u2019s generosity, like that of most of the other major donors solicited by Walker and crew, was made out not to the governor\u2019s own personal campaign committee but to a third-party group that did not have to disclose its donors. In the world of campaign finance, the group was known as a \u201cdark money\u201d organisation, as it was the recipient of a secret flow of funds that the public knew nothing about.</p> <p>One of the checks made out to the group, for $10,000, came from a financier called G Frederick Kasten Jr. In the subject line of the check, Kasten had written in his own hand: [\u201cBecause Scott Walker asked\u201d](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p52/a317493 \u201cGuardian\u201d).</p> <p>Because Scott Walker asked. That could stand as an elegant catchphrase for the state of democracy in the US today, where elections are lost or won as much according to candidates\u2019 ability to attract corporate cash as by the strength of their leadership or ideas.</p> <p>The phrase is to be found within a batch of 1,500 pages of leaked documents obtained by the Guardian that are being published in their entirety for the first time. The cache consists of a stack of evidence gathered by official prosecutors in Wisconsin who were conducting what was called a \u201cJohn Doe investigation\u201d into suspected campaign finance violations by Walker\u2019s campaign and its network.</p> <p>The John Doe files published today open a door onto how modern US elections operate in the wake of Citizens United, the 2010 US supreme court ruling that unleashed a flood of corporate money into the political process. They speak to the mounting sense of public unease about the cosy relationship between politicians and big business, and to the frustration of millions of Americans who feel disenfranchised by an electoral system that put the needs of corporate donors before ordinary voters.</p> <p>The theme has become a rallying cry in the US presidential election. Bernie Sanders accused politicians \u2013 not least his Democratic rival [Hillary Clinton](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/6/bernie-sanders-slams-hillary-clintons-wall-street-/) \u2013 of selling themselves to Wall Street and special interests.<br></p> <p>Donald Trump went further, brazenly using himself as an example of a billionaire who has put politicians in his pocket. \u201cWhen you give to them,\u201d [he said](http://www.vox.com/2015/8/6/9114565/donald-trump-debate-money) in a confessional tone during a televised Republican debate in the run-up to the primaries, \u201cthey do whatever the hell you want them to do.\u201d</p> <p>According to the independent monitoring group, the Center for Responsive Politics, [$2bn of corporate cash](http://www.opensecrets.org/overview/blio.php) has been lavished on the presidential race so far. It\u2019s a bewildering figure, but it only tells us so much about how the new American democracy works in practice, because so much of that largesse is shrouded in secrecy.</p> <p>Donors are often undisclosed, campaign finance laws are [notoriously complicated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/05/17/the-impossibly-complex-world-of-campaign-finance-in-1-chart/), and scrutiny by electoral authorities is rare, prosecutions even rarer. When official investigations are launched, they often flounder before reaching a conclusion and virtually never have the chance to reveal their findings to the public. </p> <p>It is into that dark and obscure post-Citizens United world that the John Doe files leaked to the Guardian land. These are the documents that some of the most powerful judges in the country tried to stop the public from ever seeing. </p> <p>In July 2015 the state\u2019s highest court, the supreme court of Wisconsin, terminated the John Doe investigation before any charges were brought. The [conservative majority of the court ruled](https://www.wicourts.gov/sc/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&amp;seqNo=144525) that the prosecutors had made a basic misreading of campaign finance law and targeted individuals who were \u201cwholly innocent of any wrongdoing\u201d. </p> <p>In a contentious twist to the ruling, the justices ordered the prosecutors to \u201cpermanently destroy all copies of information and other materials obtained through the investigation\u201d. </p> <p>This latter-day equivalent of a book burning could have condemned the John Doe investigation into permanent oblivion, leaving voters none the wiser. But at least one copy of the evidence gathered by the prosecutors survived the bonfire, and have now been leaked to the Guardian.</p> <p>Snippets of the documents have already seen the light of day, [quoted in legal filings](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/walker-wanted-funds-sent-to-wisconsin-club-for-growth-b99336519z1-272364371.html), some of which were mistakenly posted to an official website. But the Guardian\u2019s documents \u2013 consisting of email exchanges between Walker, his advisers, Republican leaders and major donors who included none other than Trump himself, together with court filings held under seal \u2013 amount to a rich chronicle of the electoral health of the United States in the wake of Citizens United.<br></p> <p>They also form the substance of a case currently before the US supreme court, which has been [petitioned](http://www.prwatch.org/files/2015-04-29_cert_petition_redacted.pdf) by the Wisconsin prosecutors in an appeal against the decision to shut down their investigation. The nation\u2019s highest judicial panel is expected to announce within days whether or not it will take the case.</p> <p>At the heart of the John Doe files is Scott Walker, the governor who shot to national prominence \u2013 a hero for conservatives, pariah for liberals \u2013 soon after taking office in February 2011 when he introduced the hyper-partisan [Act 10](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/02/wisconsin_assemblys_sneaky_mov.html). The legislation instantly made Wisconsin the battleground state in the fight between boardroom might and union muscle.</p> <p>The state capital Madison erupted in weeks of protests in which the legislative building was overrun with [thousands of protesters](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/42047717/ns/politics-more_politics/t/tens-thousands-pro-labor-rally-wisconsin/). Democratic lawmakers [fled the state](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/116381289.html) and took up residence in neighboring Illinois in a failed attempt to foil Walker\u2019s plans.<br></p> <p>In the fallout of Act 10, progressive groups retaliated by dragging Walker and several other Republicans through a series of bitter recall elections. Six GOP senators were forced to defend their seats in 2011, and Walker himself was put through the [recall furnace](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wisconsin-recall-idUSBRE82T1FV20120330) in 2012.</p> <p>Those recall elections, and the question of whether Walker flouted campaign finance regulations in order that he and other Republican politicians could stay in office and preserve their anti-union legislation, were the focus of the investigation that generated the files now leaked to the Guardian. It was run by five Wisconsin prosecutors, led by Francis Schmitz, a former federal counter-terrorism expert.</p> <p>It was known as a John Doe investigation because, much like a grand jury, its subjects were kept anonymous while officials weighed whether or not to press charges. In this case, prosecutors alleged that there was evidence to indicate that Walker and his team of advisers and associates had set up a coordinated effort with lobbyists and major donors to swing elections by secretly pouring huge amounts of corporate cash into the races. </p> <p>The money was channeled through a third-party group, the DAs alleged, in order to circumvent state and federal rules that set limits on political contributions and require them to be publicly revealed. </p> <p>The documents show the governor and his fundraising team going after, and receiving cash from, many of the most prominent rightwing donors in the country. In addition to [Adelson](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p74/a317508 \u201cGuardian\u201d), there was business magnate Carl Icahn who was [approached for $100,000](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p4/a317509 \u201cGuardian\u201d) though nothing in the files indicates that he donated; the hedge-fund billionaire Stephen Cohen, who [arranged a wire transfer of $1m](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p98/a317510 \u201cGuardian\u201d); and Home Depot co-founder Ken Langone who [gave $25,000](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p13/a317512 \u201cGuardian\u201d).</p> <p>Paul Singer, hedge-fund manager and chairman of the Manhattan Institute, also crops up in the documents. Three months before Walker\u2019s recall election, Singer attended a forum of business leaders held by the American Enterprise Institute in a luxury resort off the coast of Georgia.</p> <p>Walker was also there, arriving at the resort armed with a to-do list from his chief fundraiser Kate Doner. It bore the pithy command: [\u201cPaul Singer: Grab him\u201d.](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p93/a317513 \u201cGuardian\u201d)</p> <p>The governor presumably did as he was told. Two months later a check from Singer was [banked for $250,000](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p133/a317515 \u201cGuardian\u201d). </p> <p>What particularly caught the attention of the prosecutors was that when the money came in it did not go directly to Walker\u2019s personal campaign committee, Friends of Scott Walker. To do so would have been problematic, as any campaign committee directly linked to a candidate is limited in Wisconsin to accepting contributions of up to $43,000 that have to be fully disclosed. </p> <p>The prosecutors alleged in [court filings](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105201-2014-02-21-Schmitz-Memo.html#document/p14/a317779, \u201cGuardian\u201d) published here for the first time that Walker\u2019s campaign found a way around these restrictions by banking the corporate cash through the third-party group, Wisconsin Club for Growth. [WCfG](http://wicfg.com/) describes itself as a \u201cpro-liberty, pro-fiscal restraint\u201d organisation, sharing the same small government and anti-union ideology as Walker. It is a tax-exempt group, or 501 (c) (4), that is supposed to be primarily concerned with \u201csocial welfare\u201d rather than partisan politics and as such is not obliged to reveal its donors.</p> <p>In court submissions, the prosecutors alleged that Walker\u2019s campaign used WCfG as a shadow committee that allowed him to solicit large sums of corporate cash without scrutiny or accountability. \u201cContributions were personally solicited by Governor Scott Walker to WCfG ... in order to circumvent the reporting and contributions provisions of Wisconsin statutes,\u201d an investigator working for the [prosecutors in the John Doe investigation, Robert Stelter, alleged.](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105192-2013-08-29-Schmitz-Affidavit.html#document/p77/a317542 \u201cGuardian\u201d)</p> <p>A good example of the way things worked was the donation made by Donald Trump. On 3 April 2012, two months before the governor faced the electorate, Walker flew to New York for a rapid-fire string of fundraising meetings with big money interests.</p> <p>He travelled the length of Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, making stops at the investment bank Morgan Stanley, a hedge fund, a corporate law firm, and the residence of publishing tycoon Steve Forbes. He also [enjoyed a 45-minute audience with Trump](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p9/a317522 \u201cGuardian\u201d) in his Fifth Avenue lair.</p> <p>There is no record of the conversation between the two men. But it appears to have been a warm encounter, as the John Doe files show that Trump [wrote a check for $15,000](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p11/a317523 \u201cGuardian\u201d) on the same day. Who was the beneficiary of Trump\u2019s generosity? Wisconsin Club for Growth.</p> <p>Another example of the pattern is the casual comment Walker dropped into an email to his fundraiser dated 14 June 2011: [\u201cAlso, I got $1m from John Menard today\u201d.](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105980-Fundraising-Coordination.html#document/p8 \u201cGuardian\u201d) Eight days later [a check for $1m](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p53/a317694 \u201cGuardian\u201d) is cut on a corporate check of Menard Inc, the billionaire John Menard\u2019s home improvement chain Menards, and made out not to the governor\u2019s campaign committee but to Wisconsin Club for Growth. There the donation remained a secret until the publication of the Guardian\u2019s leaked files.</p> <p>Friends of Scott Walker, Wisconsin Club for Growth and other parties named in the John Doe investigation have all vigorously denied any legal violations. They point out that no charges have been brought against any subject of the inquiries.</p> <p>John Fadness, spokesman for the Scott Walker campaign, told the Guardian: \u201cAs widely reported two years ago, the prosecutor\u2019s attorney stated that Governor Walker was not a target. Several courts shut down the baseless investigation on multiple occasions, and there is absolutely no evidence of any wrongdoing.\u201d </p> <p>In June 2014, the special prosecutor Schmitz [said through a lawyer](http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/scott-walker-not-a-target-john-doe-special-prosecutor-says/article_9d5579ed-039d-5f22-ac98-947469c3c22d.html) that Walker was not a target of his John Doe investigation. Yet legal documents contained in the John Doe files identify as the anonymous [\u201cMovant No. 1\u201d](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105199-2014-2-21-Schmitz-Affidavit.html#document/p15 \u201cGuardian\u201d) of the investigation \u201cFriends of Scott Walker, the personal campaign committee of Scott Walker.\u201d </p> <p>David Rivkin, the attorney representing Wisconsin Club for Growth and its director Eric O\u2019Keefe, said in a statement to the Guardian: \u201cAs the Wisconsin Supreme Court explained, the John Doe prosecutors made up crimes \u2018that do not exist\u2019 under Wisconsin law in order to target \u2018citizens who were wholly innocent of any wrongdoing.\u2019 Because the U.S. Supreme Court does not review matters of state law, it should be obvious that the John Doe prosecutors\u2019 appeal is legally frivolous and just another publicity stunt intended to tarnish their targets\u2019 reputations and salvage their own.\u201d</p> <p>Further insight into the position of the subjects of the investigation \u2013 the \u201cmovants\u201d as they are technically known \u2013 is given in court papers including in the Guardian\u2019s [John Doe Files.](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105213-WICFG-Motion-Quash.html \u201cGuardian\u201d) They criticise the prosecutors for making fundamental mistakes in their reading of campaign finance law. They said that regulatory restrictions on the size and source of donations only applied to groups that were expressly advocating for or against a named political candidate.</p> <p>WCfG\u2019s director Eric O\u2019Keefe [said in an affidavit](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105216-WICFG-Quash-Aff.html \u201cGuardian\u201d) that the club\u2019s involvement had stemmed purely from its commitment to \u201cadvancing liberty and fiscal responsibility\u201d. Its role in the recall elections was \u201cto educate Wisconsin citizens ... The Club paid for advertisements that advanced its pro-liberty, fiscal responsibility, pro-Act 10 beliefs. None of the advertisements expressly urged voters to vote for or against any candidate.\u201d</p> <p>The movants also complained that in issuing over-broad subpoenas for evidence and conducting [pre-dawn raids](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/417155/wisonsins-shame-i-thought-it-was-home-invasion-david-french) on the homes of some individuals, the prosecutors strayed well beyond their legitimate powers and into the realm of governmental abuse.</p> <p>In the course of the John Doe investigation, the prosecutors obtained hundreds of emails and bank records under subpoena. An email sent by Kate Doner, Walker\u2019s fundraiser, in April 2011, summed up the strategy. She said the aim was to raise $9m in six weeks, to pay for political advertising \u2013 she called it \u201cissue advocacy efforts\u201d \u2013 in the senatorial recall races. </p> <p>Walker, she said, wants all the ads [\u201crun thru one group to ensure correct messaging\u201d,](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p33 \u201cGuardian\u201d) and that group, the governor declared, should be Wisconsin Club for Growth. \u201cThe Governor is encouraging all to invest in the Wisconsin Club for Growth [which] can accept Corporate and Personal donations without limitations and no donors disclosure.\u201d</p> <p>The email trail shows a pattern of behavior developing: Walker meets up with big corporate donors and encourages them to contribute unlimited sums of money through WCfG in secret, then shortly after the checks start to flow. In June 2011, the emails show, the governor had dinner with the CEO of the largest privately owned trucking company in the US, Schneider National, in the hope of getting him and his peers to donate $250,000. </p> <p>\u201cStress the donations to WiCFG are not disclosed and can accept Corporate donations without limits,\u201d [Walker\u2019s talking points said.](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p42/a317530 \u201cGuardian\u201d)</p> <p>Two checks are recorded in the John Doe files from Schneider, [both made out to WCfG and totalling $65,000](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105164-Corporate-Checks-Sanitized.html#document/p1 \u201cGuardian\u201d).</p> <p>The Schneider checks, like several others included in the files, were cut on corporate checks in the name of the company itself. It has long been a rule under [Wisconsin state law](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/11/XI/1112), commonly known as the \u201ccorporate ban\u201d, that corporations are not allowed to make direct political donations; they are only allowed to fund third-party groups that have to be fully independent of candidates, or spend money themselves on political TV advertising so long as the expenditure is declared.</p> <p>Some of those checks are published by the Guardian today, redacted to remove bank numbers. The Guardian has also redacted other documents in the files to remove personal information such as cellphone numbers and private home addresses. Personal email addresses have also been redacted unless they have already been put into the public domain, as in the case of Scott Walker\u2019s own [personal email address](http://watchdog.org/244820/scott-fitzgerald-john-doe-conservatives/). </p> <p>The John Doe files reveal that Walker\u2019s own advisers reached the conclusion that the large sums flowing into WCfG\u2019s coffers from corporate donors was critical to the survival of the Republican senators in their recall elections. In a memo sent to Walker shortly after the elections in August 2011, his former top campaign consultant RJ Johnson looked back on the contest and ruminated that \u201cOur efforts were run by Wisconsin Club for Growth ... who coordinated spending through 12 different groups. Most spending by other groups was directly funded by grants from the Club.\u201d</p> <p>He went on to note that WCfG \u201craised 12 million dollars and ran a soup to nuts campaign ... Polling, focus groups and message development was a collaborative effort.\u201d A mass of micro-targeted mail-outs and TV advertising that was bought with the donations had the impact that they [\u201cmoved independent swing voters to the GOP candidate\u201d.](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p56/a317535 \u201cGuardian\u201d)</p> <p>The collaboration set up in 2011 was successful in helping four of the six Republican senators fend off the recall challenge and keep their jobs \u2013 allowing them to hang onto their senate majority by one vote. Act 10 was safeguarded for the moment, and in a gesture of gratitude Walker himself was moved to ask an aide shortly after the vote: [\u201cDid I send out thank you notes to all of our c(4) donors?\u201d](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105983-2013-09-16-Exhibits-41.html#document/p129 \u201cGuardian\u201d) </p> <p>Supporters of Governor Walker and the outside groups that worked with him, including some prominent media outlets such as the [Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/hyperventilating-in-wisconsin-over-scott-walkers-fund-raising-1408920214), argue that the prosecutors were mistaken in their view that the coordinated activities amounted to a violation of campaign finance law. They point out that nobody in the governor\u2019s circle has been charged with any alleged violation relating to the recall elections, and argue that WCfG and the other outside groups engaged in advocacy over issues related to the elections, which is not subject to restrictions, as opposed to express advocacy on behalf of one political candidate or another. </p> <p>They also insist, using a complex formula related to the electoral calendar, that Walker only became an official candidate on 9 April 2012. Any actions he and his associates took before then were not subject to restrictions, [they argued](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105212-FOSW-Notice-Appear.html#document/p10, \u201cGuardian\u201d). To which the prosecutors replied that Walker\u2019s campaign committee had been frantically fundraising and coordinating long before that date.</p> <p>The John Doe files do contain some evidence that Walker\u2019s senior team attempted to maintain a firewall between candidate and outside interests after that date. On 19 April, the lead adviser to the governor\u2019s recall campaign, Keith Gilkes, replied to a group of businesses wanting to put up billboards supporting Walker\u2019s candidacy: \u201cI cannot have any comment on this \u2013 it is an [independent expenditure](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105981-Ad-Coordination.html#document/p40/a317537, \u201cGuardian\u201d) separate from the campaign.\u201d</p> <p>But the files also contain documents that show that RJ Johnson, a prominent political strategist in Wisconsin who worked closely with Walker for many years, and Johnson\u2019s business partner Deborah Jordahl, were simultaneously arranging political ad spending on TV and radio for both Walker\u2019s campaign and the outside lobbying groups. On 23 April 2012 [Johnson emailed Gilkes](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p45/a317539, \u201cGuardian\u201d) about a Walker ad that he was putting out for the recall election; a week later [Johnson and Jordahl were emailing](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105985-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT2.html#document/p47/a317540, \u201cGuardian\u201d) each other about radio ad spending on behalf of Wisconsin Club for Growth.</p> <p>That lead the special prosecutor, Francis Schmitz, to conclude that \u201ca review of email reflects that RJ Johnson ... [was involved](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105192-2013-08-29-Schmitz-Affidavit.html#document/p99/a317541, \u201cGuardian\u201d) in the media buys on behalf of Wisconsin Club for Growth and Friends of Scott Walker.\u201d</p> <p>Neither RJ Johnson nor Deborah Jordahl immediately responded to requests for comment.</p> <p>Until the US supreme court indicates later this month whether or not it will intervene in the John Doe case, the question of the legality of the Walker network and the coordination that it involved will hang in the balance. The Wisconsin supreme court was firm on the issue: in its [July 2015 ruling](https://www.wicourts.gov/sc/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&amp;amp;seqNo=144525), the court castigated Schmitz for instigating a \u201cperfect storm of wrongs that was visited upon the innocent Unnamed Movants and those who dared to associate with them.\u201d</p> <p>In colorful language, the state\u2019s highest court praised Walker, WCfG and other movants in the investigation (it didn\u2019t name them, but [their identities](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105199-2014-2-21-Schmitz-Affidavit.html#document/p15/a317721, \u201cGuardian\u201d) are self-evident from the John Doe files as \u201cbrave individuals\u201d. It said they had \u201cplayed a crucial role in presenting this court with an opportunity to re-endorse its commitment to upholding the fundamental right of each and every citizen to engage in lawful political activity and to do so free from the fear of the tyrannical retribution of arbitrary or capricious governmental prosecution.\u201d</p> <p>For good measure, the court added: \u201cLet one point be clear: our conclusion today ends this unconstitutional John Doe investigation.\u201d</p> <p>That point is certainly clear, unless the US supreme court, which has the final say in any matter of constitutional law, decides otherwise. The nation\u2019s highest court has been asked to take the prosecutors\u2019 petition by an alliance of campaign-finance monitoring groups, the Center for Media and Democracy, the Brennan Center and Common Cause.</p> <p>In their petition, the prosecutors ask the US supreme court justices to consider whether Wisconsin\u2019s top judicial panel was truly objective in reaching its decision to shut them down. \u201cIs the state as a litigant in an adversary proceeding entitled to a hearing before a panel of impartial justices, free of bias?\u201d, the prosecutors ask. </p> <p>Protecting Walker\u2019s agenda</p> <p>The John Doe files obtained by the Guardian give clues as to why the prosecutors have raised doubts about impartiality in the state courts. They suggest that two of the conservative judges on Wisconsin\u2019s top court who voted to halt the John Doe investigation may have themselves been intimately connected to the same campaigning network of rightwing politicians, lobbyists and major donors that the prosecutors were investigating.</p> <p>Take David Prosser. He was one of the four conservative judges who approved the [July 2015 ruling](https://www.wicourts.gov/sc/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&amp;amp;seqNo=144525) that terminated the John Doe investigation, sacked Schmitz from his position as special prosecutor and ordered the destruction of all the documents that had been collected (later that order was softened a little to a demand that the prosecutors hand in all the documents to the court which would keep them secret under seal). </p> <p>At precisely the same time as the six Republican senators were embroiled in their recall election, Prosser was in his own electoral fight for survival. He was up for re-election in April 2011 and facing a tough challenge from JoAnne Kloppenburg, then Wisconsin\u2019s assistant attorney general. The Prosser election and the recall election were intertwined in that Kloppenburg was attempting to turn her battle against Prosser into a [referendum on Governor Walker\u2019s](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/05/us/politics/05wisconsin.html) anti-union legislation, Act 10.</p> <p>Among the leaked John Doe files that the Wisconsin supreme court ordered to be suppressed are documents that underline how anxious Walker\u2019s circle were about the threat, as they saw it, to the court\u2019s conservative majority. In an email dated 14 December 2010, WCfG\u2019s director Eric O\u2019Keefe says he\u2019s been [in touch with Diane Hendricks](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p14/a317543, \u201cGuardian\u201d), the owner of a roofing company who Forbes describes as America\u2019s richest self-made woman with a personal fortune of $5bn. Hendricks is a well-known funder of rightwing causes and individuals, among them Scott Walker himself who she was to go on to support with [$500,000](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/in-film-walker-talks-of-divide-and-conquer-strategy-with-unions-8o57h6f-151049555.html) in 2012 for his own recall election.</p> <p>Hendricks has also popped up as part of the Donald Trump presidential campaign. Trump recently added [her to his inner team](http://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2016/08/11/trump-adds-richest-self-made-woman-diane-hendricks-to-economic-advisory-team/#29c3bf15392c) of economic advisers, having come under fire for only appointing men.</p> <p>[\u201cI have traded emails with diane hendricks,\u201d](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p14/a317543, \u201cGuardian\u201d) O\u2019Keefe says in the email. \u201cShe is concerned about the state s.

As election day approached, money from rightwing lobby groups and corporations began to pour into Wisconsin, unseen by the public, as the message got out that Prosser\u2019s salvation was a necessary step to safeguarding Walker\u2019s radical rightwing reforms and Act 10.</p> <p>An email from March 2011, just two months after Walker took office as governor and a month before Prosser was tested at the polls, makes the point. It\u2019s from Matt Seaholm, state director of Americans For Prosperity (AFP), the Tea Party-affiliated group founded and funded by the billionaire rightwing Koch brothers. </p> <p>By now the anxiety surrounding the fate of the Wisconsin supreme court judge, David Prosser, is growing more intense. \u201cThis could stop everything that Walker is trying to accomplish and [the unions] know it. Goes without saying, that would be a bad thing,\u201d [Seaholm says](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105950-Strategy-Coordination.html#document/p7/a317545, \u201cGuardian\u201d), writing to Tim Phillips, AFP\u2019s national president. </p> <p>By 20 March, two weeks before the election, worry is distilling into panic. Brian Fraley of the Wisconsin-based conservative think-tank the MacIver Institute, shoots an impassioned plea for help to what he calls his \u201cgroup\u201d of like-minded lobbying groups and individuals, forwarded to Walker\u2019s chief of staff and other top advisers in Madison.</p> <p>[\u201cDavid Prosser is in trouble,\u201d](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105957-Prosser.html#document/p6/a317546, \u201cGuardian\u201d) Fraley begins. \u201cAnd if we lose him, the Walker agenda is toast, as could be the Senate GOP majority and any successes creating a new redistricted map. That\u2019s not hyperbole.\u201d </p> <p>By the end of the bitter campaign, some $3.5m was spent by outside lobby groups channeling undisclosed corporate money to support Prosser\u2019s re-election \u2013 more than eight times the $400,000 the judge was allowed to spend himself. That included $1.5m from WCfG and its offshoot Citizens for a Strong America, and $2m from Wisconsin Manufacturers &amp; Commerce (WMC), all of it in unaccountable \u201cdark money\u201d.</p> <p>It worked. [Prosser was re-elected](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/122364728.html), with a squeaky-tight margin of just 7,000 votes and after a fraught recount. The following month, Walker boasted to the Republican kingmaker, Karl Rove, \u201cClub for Growth\u2013Wisconsin was the [key to retaining Justice Prosser](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105957-Prosser.html#document/p18/a317547, \u201cGuardian\u201d). </p> <p>Act 10 was safe.</p> <p>Both of the two outside groups that channeled the recall election money (WCfG and WMC) are named as \u201cmovants\u201d of the John Doe criminal investigation into alleged campaign finance violations that was shut down under the court ruling that Prosser, having won re-election in no small part with their help, joined. Yet when it was suggested to Prosser and a second conservative judge on the court, Justice Michael Gableman, that they should recuse themselves from deliberations in the case, they both [refused](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/david-prosser-says-he-doesnt-need-to-step-aside-in-walker-probe-b99547465z1-319731971.html).</p> <p>In their [petition](http://www.prwatch.org/files/2015-04-29_cert_petition_redacted.pdf) to the US supreme court, the prosecutors challenge that refusal, arguing that \u201cthe special prosecutor did not receive a fair and impartial hearing\u201d. The petitioners go on to discuss Prosser in detail, but the passage is so heavily redacted that their argument is obscured. [They do say](http://www.prwatch.org/files/2015-04-29_cert_petition_redacted.pdf) at one point, quoting constitutional law, that \u201cNo jurist \u2018can be a judge in his own case or be permitted to try cases where he has an interest in the outcome\u2019.\u201d </p> <p>Prosser declined to step aside citing a rule change that had been suggested and partially written by WMC itself. The change removed the obligation of supreme court judges in Wisconsin to recuse themselves in cases involving groups that had helped them secure their own elections.</p> <p>Kurt Bauer, WMC\u2019s president and CEO, declined to comment on the John Doe proceedings. But he stressed that the organization\u2019s \u201cgrassroots lobbying activities are conducted carefully within both the letter and the spirit of the state law. WMC strongly disputes any allegations of wrongdoing and will vigorously defend itself against such allegations.\u201d</p> <p>Bauer added that WMC was an independent group that was not controlled by any candidate or candidate\u2019s campaign. \u201cWMC will not allow itself to be silenced from commenting about public officials and public policy. WMC has long been a proponent of the First Amendment and has a history of fighting to protect its ability to publicly express its views. WMC maintains that commitment to protecting its right to express a point of view on public policy, public officials and candidates for office as well as protecting the confidentiality of its donors.\u201d</p> <p>In a telephone interview with the Guardian, Prosser, who retired from the state supreme court in July, said that in his view sufficient time had passed between his re-election in 2011 and the judgment in the John Doe case in 2015 for any potential conflict of interest to fade. \u201cIf this had been a year after the contributions I think I would have had to withdraw, but it was four years. There was no expectation on the part of recipient or givers that the contributions were designed to effect litigation, and so the contributions raised no questions whatsoever.\u201d</p> <p>Prosser said that at the time of his re-election he was facing hostile TV ads that falsely tried to link him to Walker\u2019s contentious anti-union legislation Act 10, while he himself was unable directly to solicit large amounts of campaign contributions under new strict fundraising limits imposed by an earlier Democratic-controlled legislature. \u201cI certainly expected Wisconsin Manufacturers &amp; Commerce sooner or later to put some money into my campaign. Of course I was going to hope that somebody would come in and defend me because I was unable to defend myself.\u201d</p> <p>But the judge stressed that the only spending involved came from \u201cthird parties in which no one on my campaign knew they were coming, didn\u2019t ask for them, and frankly if they hadn\u2019t come I would have been blown out of the water by false advertising\u201d.</p> <p>Last year Prosser issued a [12-page justification](http://media.jrn.com/documents/prosserrecusal.pdf) of his refusal to recuse himself from the John Doe case. In it, he made reference to an email from an \u201cUnnamed Petitioner\u201d that discussed raising money for a campaign \u201cto maintain the Court\u201d. The judge said the comment was \u201clittle more than evidence of the fact that some targets of the investigation ... engaged in expenditures that, under all the circumstances, were very valuable to my campaign.\u201d </p> <p>Just two weeks before writing that sentence, Judge Prosser had approved the court ruling that ordered the destruction of the John Doe files, among which was to be found the very same email to which he referred. The Guardian now publishes that [full email](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p14, \u201cGuardian\u201d) for the first time, and as a result the identity of the anonymous \u201cUnnamed Petitioner\u201d who vowed to \u201cmaintain the Court\u201d can be revealed: RJ Johnson, \u201cgeneral consultant\u201d to the governor of Wisconsin, Scott Walker.</p> <p>Why it matters</p> <p>So why should we care about today\u2019s fiendishly complicated ways of funding elections? After all, isn\u2019t it a cornerstone of American democracy that everybody should be able to express themselves, under the first amendment right of free speech, after which the American people gets to have the final say at the ballot box?</p> <p>One area of possible concern raised by the John Doe files chimes with the anger and disgruntlement of voters that Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have so powerfully articulated in the presidential race. If money channels are set up in secret to allow corporations and the super-wealthy to inject vast amounts of undisclosed cash into political races, the level playing field can be distorted to the benefit of corporate-friendly candidates and to the disadvantage of those representing ordinary voters.</p> <p>By the end of Scott Walker\u2019s recall election, some [$81m overall](http://www.wisdc.org/pr072512.php) was spent on the battle \u2013 equivalent to $23 for every registered voter in the state. The governor and other Republican groups and committees invested $58.7m, while his Democratic rival and supporters were only able to muster less than half that amount, $21.9m. </p> <p>\u201cThe sheer increased volume of corporate money that has been brought into elections in recent years may go more on one side than the other,\u201d explained Richard Briffault, a professor specialising in campaign finance law at Columbia law school. \u201cCorporations tend to lean more Republican.\u201d</p> <p>Briffault added that the proliferation in the modern era of outside \u201csocial welfare\u201d 501 (c) (4) organisations \u2013 the tax-exempt status enjoyed by Wisconsin Club for Growth \u2013 also raised the possibility that political donations would go hidden. As tax-exempt groups that are supposed not to be primarily political in their orientation, they do not have to disclose their donors.</p> <p>\u201cThat can be a very good device for hiding the participation of wealthy individuals,\u201d Briffault said.</p> <p>The other great anxiety addressed by campaign finance regulations is the potential for corruption. The US supreme court has said in rulings going back decades that the first amendment right to free speech is tempered by the need to protect against cash-for-favors. The court has repeatedly stated that elected officials must avoid not only the reality of corruption in their dealings with donors, but also any appearance of corruption, because even a suggestion that dollars might have been exchanged for political favors has the ability to undermine public faith in democracy.</p> <p>The justices use the legalistic phrase: quid pro quo. Literally that means \u201cthis for that\u201d; colloquially, it\u2019s the idea that if you scratch my back, I\u2019ll scratch yours.</p> <p>Paradoxically, one of the most robust statements made by the US supreme court justices about the dangers of real or apparent quid pro quo was made in [Citizens United](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBgsCF8enOAhUBLhQKHYnsBJAQFggeMAA&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.supremecourt.gov%2Fopinions%2F09pdf%2F08-205.pdf&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNF2hn4fN946L-Ma8WV0AHhWPW0oKQ&amp;amp;sig2=-JV0qIhMiqsYCaGDRth_wg&amp;amp;cad=rja), their highly contentious 2010 ruling. [Citizens United](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/08-205P.ZO) extended to for-profit corporations and labor unions the same first amendments rights to engage in elections that had hitherto been enjoyed by individuals. </p> <p>Corporations were essentially treated for the first time as though they were people. Together with the related ruling in [Speechnow.org](http://www.fec.gov/law/litigation/speechnow.shtml), the supreme court paved the way for the creation of Super Pacs that can make unlimited spending on political advertising to help their preferred candidates into office.</p> <p>What is less well known about Citizens United is that in it, Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the opinion, addressed head-on the fear that unlimited corporate cash would lead to an explosion in real or perceived corruption in the political system. He stated forcefully that there was no danger of corruption if one important condition was met: that corporations kept their distance from the candidates they were supporting and remained fully independent of the candidates\u2019 campaigns.</p> <p>\u201cBy definition,\u201d Kennedy wrote, \u201can independent expenditure is political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate.\u201d Such separation was necessary, he added, to avoid the risk that unlimited secret donations are given \u201cas a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate\u201d.</p> <p>The problem is that the US supreme court has never defined in detail what precisely it means by \u201ccoordination\u201d between a candidate\u2019s campaign and outside groups, preferring to leave the fine print to lower courts and state legislatures. Most of the legal emphasis on coordination is on actual spending on political TV and radio ads, while the other end of the money chain \u2013 fundraising by candidates from big corporate donors channeled through third-party \u201cdark money\u201d groups that do not have to disclose their sources of income \u2013 is largely unregulated. The lack of firm rules has left players in the election game relatively free to act as they wish \u2013 one reason why prosecutions are so rarely brought, or if they are, ever completed. </p> <p>The outcome of this legal fuzziness is clearly evident in Wisconsin, where the John Doe investigation has been halted before it could even reach a decision on whether or not a full criminal inquiry was merited. That remains the legal standing of the case at present, pending the US supreme court\u2019s decision.</p> <p>But a moral question continues to hang in the air. If, as Kennedy put it, even the appearance of quid quo pro must be avoided to uphold trust in democracy, does the light shone on the modern American way of staging elections by the John Doe files leaked to the Guardian give cause for public concern?</p> <p>The lead paint mystery</p> <p>The strange case of lead paint might help answer that question. Lead, as the [terrible events](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/28/lead-drinking-water-level-nrdc-report-flint-crisis) of Flint, Michigan, have shown, is a potent poison that can seriously impair the intellectual ability of young children. The Flint health crisis was caused by contaminated water, but another peril to public health is the presence of the toxin in household paint before 1978, when it was banned in the US.</p> <p>The John Doe files reveal that the billionaire owner of NL Industries, one of America\u2019s leading producers of lead used in paint until the ban, secretly donated $750,000 to Wisconsin Club for Growth at a time when Walker and his fellow Republican senators were fighting their recall elections. Also in the same time-frame, the Republican-controlled senate passed, and Walker signed into law, legal changes that attempted to grant effective immunity to lead manufacturers from any compensation claims for lead paint poisoning.</p> <p>Since the laws were passed, the federal courts have stepped in and [overturned](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/appeals-court-reinstates-wisconsin-lead-paint-suit-b99317605z1-268494482.html) [key elements](http://archive.jsonline.com/blogs/news/304161421.html) of them, leaving NL Industries \u2013 or National Lead Company as it was once known \u2013 still facing many legal challenges. But the point remains: had the new provisions been allowed to stand, they had the potential to save the company and others like it millions of dollars in damages.</p> <p>Lawyers working on the lawsuits argue that at stake were the rights of hundreds of children from poor urban areas whose lives were devastated by lead poisoning inhaled from paint when they were growing up. \u201cThese children were perfectly innocent. They entered life with all the gifts and health that God gave them and were devastated by this neurotoxin,\u201d said Peter Earle, the principal attorney on 171 cases that are currently ongoing against NL Industries and other former manufacturers of lead paint.</p> <p>The owner of NL Industries, Harold Simmons, made the [undisclosed payments to WCfG](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105164-Corporate-Checks-Sanitized.html#document/p5, \u201cGuardian\u201d) in three tranches between April 2011 and January 2012, precisely when the GOP senators and then Walker were facing a fight-to-the-death at the ballot box. </p> <p>Simmons, who died a year after Walker won his recall election, was a prominent funder of rightwing causes who, along with Donald Trump, was [reprimanded](http://articles.latimes.com/1993-03-18/news/mn-12355_1_contribution-limits) by the Federal Election Commission in the 1990s for exceeding legal limits of political campaign contributions. He [bankrolled with $3m](https://www.opensecrets.org/527s/527cmtedetail_contribs.php?ein=201041228&amp;cycle=2004) the notorious Swift Boat smear campaign against John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election that erroneously questioned the current secretary of state\u2019s Vietnam war record.</p> <p>Republicans in the Wisconsin legislature made an initial attempt to change the law on the liability of lead paint producers shortly after Walker became governor. As the name implied, Act 2 was one of his opening gambits that he rammed through the legislature in less than a month after he came to office in January 2011. </p> <p>One of Act 2\u2019s key provisions was to tighten tort law to make it much more difficult for lead victims to sue. Under its terms, anyone injured by lead paint who wanted to issue a new lawsuit had to prove that the company they were taking on was responsible for making the specific paint that was on their walls at the time they inhaled the toxin \u2013 a practically impossible task given the number of different manufacturers and the layer-upon-layer of paint on the walls of old houses. </p> <p>The measure in effect granted immunity to NL Industries and other lead producers from any new claims for compensation. </p> <p>Less than three months after the law was enacted, Simmons arranged for the [first and largest check](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105164-Corporate-Checks-Sanitized.html#document/p5, \u201cGuardian\u201d) \u2013 of $500,000 \u2013 to be paid directly from Contran Corporation, his business empire, to Wisconsin Club for Growth. It landed at the time that the six senators were in their recall battles.</p> <p>Later that year, Walker\u2019s interest in soliciting more money from Simmons for use in his own personal recall election is made plain in an email among the John Doe files dated 14 November 2011. It was written by Keith Gilkes, Walker\u2019s then senior campaign adviser. </p> <p>The email was sent just one day before opponents of the governor formally triggered the recall procedure, putting Walker\u2019s job on the line. Gilkes rehearsed the names of several wealthy donors to hit up for donations, singling out Simmons and [\u201cSheldon Aldenhouse\u201d](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p61/a317549, \u201cGuardian\u201d), presumably a garbling of the name of Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate who later [donated $200,000](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p74/a317508, \u201cGuardian\u201d) to bolster Walker\u2019s recall chances.</p> <p>The Gilkes memo sets out for Walker some of the \u201cred flags\u201d associated with Simmons and other potential corporate donors \u201cso you are aware of what you might need to defend in terms of contributions from donors when these are disclosed\u201d. He [warns Walker](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105984-2012-08-14-Exhibits-01-100-PT1.html#document/p72/a317550, \u201cGuardian\u201d) that Simmons had a controversial track record for reportedly dumping toxic waste in Texas. Gilkes pointed to [an article](http://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/2010/february/harold-simmons-is-dallas-most-evil-genius/) by Dallas Magazine in which the billionaire was dubbed \u201cDallas\u2019 most evil genius\u201d. The memo also notes that Simmons avoided having to pay millions of dollars in damages to pay for medical treatment for child victims of lead poisoning in Wisconsin\u2019s largest city Milwaukee after an appeals court cleared NL Industries of causing a public nuisance and dismissed a lawsuit brought by the city for [$52.6m](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/35084654.html).</p> <p>The leaked John Doe files do not record what conclusion Walker and his chief adviser reached about Simmons when they discussed him as a potential donor. What the documents do reveal is that only a month later, a [second corporate check](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105164-Corporate-Checks-Sanitized.html#document/p6, \u201cGuardian\u201d) from Contran Corporation for $100,000 was sent to WCfG.</p> <p>The third and final [check from Simmons](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3105164-Corporate-Checks-Sanitized.html#document/p6, \u201cGuardian\u201d) for $150,000, also made out to WCfG, was cut the following month from his own personal account.</p> <p>At this point, the Wisconsin legislature and Governor Walker made a renewed pitch to change the law to the benefit of NL Industries and other historic manufacturers of lead paint. They had already passed Act 2, but that only covered new claims, leaving the company still facing a mountain of lawsuits that were already ongoing.</p> <p>So the legislators had another go. In the same month as the third check landed, senate Republicans introduced a bill that would make the effective immunity for former lead paint manufacturers retroactive, thereby scuppering all existing lawsuits. </p> <p>That attempt failed to pass the Wisconsin legislature. But even then the Republican group did not give up. In 2013, after all the recall elections had been fought and won, partly with the benefit of Harold Simmons\u2019 support, the legislators tried one more time to pass a bill making the immunity retroactive.</p> <p>They did so with a great deal of encouragement from NL Industries. Earle, the lawyer acting for victims, has discovered under freedom of information laws that the firm employed a professional lobbyists for [330 hours](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3036372-GAB-Lobbying-Summary-Table.html), at a cost of $172,500, to persuade the Wisconsin legislature to pass the retroactive immunity bill.</p> <p>Another [Foia document](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3036374-EP-Memo.html#document/p5/a316185) shows that NL Industries\u2019 lobbyist directly suggested to the Republican leader in the state senate the language that should be added to existing law to make the effective immunity retroactive. The lobbyist encouraged the Republicans to write four words into an amendment that would apply the new immunity protections to all negligence lawsuits \u201cwhenever filed or accrued\u201d. </p> <p>Two months later GOP senators slipped into a [budget bill](http://www.twincities.com/2013/06/06/wisconsin-civil-litigation-provision-angers-attorney-pursuing-lead-paint-claims/) an amendment that contained the same four words proposed by NL Industries: \u201cwhenever filed or accrued\u201d. The amendment was introduced after midnight just before the bill was finalized. It can be found by anyone who looks hard enough on [page 548 of a 603-page bill](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3036359-Exhibit-8-2013-WI-Act-20-Biennial-Budget.html#document/p548/a316191) that Scott Walker duly signed into law. </p> <p>NL Industries used the amendment to press for dismissal of the negligence lawsuits it was facing. But the move failed. A federal appeals court stepped in and ruled that such a retroactive granting of corporate immunity was a violation of the US constitution.</p> <p>It is perhaps worth asking what it would have meant for the victims had the amendment stood. Victims like Yasmine Clark, one of the plaintiffs. She suffered such severe poisoning from lead inhaled from residential paint in her home in Milwaukee that she was hospitalized twice, when she was two years old and again when she was five. </p> <p>When she was at rock bottom, Clark was found to have a lead level in her blood of [48 micrograms per deciliter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3036375-Mushak-Report-3-13-10-Copy-1.html#document/p6/a316189) and had to undergo chelation therapy to remove the toxins. To give a sense of what that meant, doctors in Flint, Michigan, sounded the alarm after children were found to have levels above 5 micrograms per deciliter from polluted water supplies \u2013 about one-tenth of Clark\u2019s concentration.</p> <p>Clark\u2019s negligence suit, and 170 other cases like hers, are still ongoing against NL Industries and other former manufacturers of lead pigment paint. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been able to shut me down,\u201d Earle said.</p> <p>\u201cYasmine is a victim of egregiously vindictive behavior by these corporations,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cThe idea of freedom in the US is that no matter how poor you are you have the opportunity to surmount those disadvantages, and these lead companies took that opportunity away from her.\u201d</p> <p>As for Scott Walker, Earle said: \u201cThe governor has chosen to ignore the children and instead fought tooth and nail for the corporations that did this. I don\u2019t have words to describe that conduct.\u201d</p> <p>Scott Walker\u2019s campaign did not respond to Guardian questions relating to its relationship with NL Industries. NL Industries itself, and Contran Corporation, did not respond to numerous invitations to comment.</p> <p>As researchers pore over the Guardian\u2019s leaked John Doe files, seeking light amid the darkness of today\u2019s political process, they may ponder the lead paint mystery. There is no evidence that Wisconsin Republicans led by Scott Walker attempted to change the law as a favor in return for Simmons\u2019 $750,000 donation that had helped some of them win their own elections and stay in office. No charges have ever been brought.</p> <p>But is there even the slightest appearance of quid pro quo? And if potentially there is, should that be a matter that the American people care about? Give the last words to Donald Trump, the presidential nominee of Scott Walker\u2019s Grand Old Party: \u201cWhen you give to them, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian US interactive team is Aliza Aufrichtig, Kenan Davis, Jan Diehm, Rich Harris and Nadja Popovich.<br></p> <p>Additional research by Lauren Leatherby, Nicole Puglise and Mazin Sidahmed.</p> </noscript> </figure>",
  "<p>Annuities have suffered their worst year on record, with payouts to newly retiring pensioners falling by 15% so far during 2016, according to data provider Moneyfacts.<br></p> <p>Annuities are an income for life, whereby those retiring can swap their pension savings accumulated while at work for an agreed fixed income, paid out every year until they die. </p> <p>Purchasing an annuity was compulsory for most savers until former chancellor George Osborne stunned the \u00a312bn-a-year industry, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jun/14/pension-companies-stopping-retirees-access-savings\">freeing retirees</a><a> to do what they liked</a> with their money.</p> <p>Moneyfacts said that the average annuity income for a 65-year-old had fallen by 14.8% on a \u00a310,000 purchase price and by 15% on a \u00a350,000 purchase price so far in 2016. The figures are based on a pensioner buying a flat-rate annuity that does not increase with inflation. <br></p> <p>Annuity rates are largely influenced by two factors: interest rates and the longevity prospects of the population. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">Bank of England base rate cut</a> after the Brexit vote and the prospect of negative interest rates have pushed the incomes paid on annuities to levels unthinkable even a few years ago.</p> <p>Richard Eagling of Moneyfacts said: \u201c2016 has been a truly awful year for annuities, with rates falling to all-time lows. This is particularly disappointing as the stock market volatility that we are experiencing has re-emphasised the importance of a secure lifetime income for many retirees.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, record low gilt yields following the EU referendum result, the impact of Solvency II legislation and a significant weakening of competition in the annuity market have all exerted considerable downward pressure on annuity rates during 2016.\u201d<br></p> <p>The falls in annuity rates easily surpass the previous largest annual annuity income drop of 11.5% recorded in 2012. </p> <p>Moneyfacts said that although there were more than three months of the year remaining, it was unlikely that the current economic environment would facilitate a strong enough recovery in annuity rates to avoid it picking up the tag of being the worst ever year for annuity rates.</p> <p>Workers reaching retirement age without the protection of a salary-based pension have to rely on what they can earn from their savings. Under new pension freedom rules, they are allowed to access their pension savings from the age of 55, but need to closely examine the tax implications. </p> <p>Most financial advisers reckon that a safe level of draw-down from savings is around 4% a year. But this suggests that a pensioner needs to accumulate \u00a3250,000 in savings to be sure of an income of \u00a310,000 a year. </p>",

  "<p>Can access to water and sanitation be secured now for future generations? We don\u2019t have a choice; sustainability must be at the heart of all efforts to deliver these services.</p> <p>This was the central message of a panel discussion hosted by the Guardian at the annual World Water Week conference in Stockholm, Sweden. The panel was organised in association with the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) and supported by Fundaci\u00f3n Femsa, which works to create programmes around conservation and the sustainable use of water.</p> <p>The sustainable development goals (SDGs) \u2013 an ambitious agenda for social, environmental and economic change \u2013 were adopted by world leaders at the United Nations general assembly in September 2015. The agenda sets a target of \u201censuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all\u201d by 2030.</p> <p>Around the world, 650 million people lack access to safe water and 2.3 billion people live without adequate sanitation.

The real challenge, the panel agreed, is how to deliver them more efficiently. </p> <p>\u201cWe have to do things better and faster,\u201d said Alejandro Jim\u00e9nez, water, sanitation and hygiene (Wash) specialist at SIWI. \u201cFaster, because we will not achieve access for all at this rate of implementation. And better, because at present we cannot keep services functional once they are constructed.\u201d</p> <p>Sergio Campos, chief of the water and sanitation division at the Inter-American Development Bank, agreed. In Latin America and the Caribbean, he said, the challenge is not reaching the 30 million people who lack access to safe water and the 100 million people who don\u2019t have adequate sanitation, but ensuring a sustainable and continuous service. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jul/06/capturing-rain-save-mexico-city-water-crisis\">How capturing rain could save Mexico City from a water crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAround 90% of people in our region live in urban areas and we haven\u2019t been able to cope with population growth and rapid urbanisation,\u201d he said. \u201cMaintenance of the existing infrastructure has been systematically deferred and 35 to 60% of potable water is lost through leakages.\u201d </p> <p>Investing in the social, as well as the physical, infrastructure is one way of securing water and sanitation over the long term, said Mariano Montero, director of Fundaci\u00f3n Femsa. \u201cBy social infrastructure we mean empowering people to own the project,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t just give a community a solution that we think is best.

Even if they don\u2019t have money, they can invest by putting labour into the process.\u201d </p> <h2>New ways of thinking</h2> <p>Innovation will be key to the sustainable development of water and sanitation access, said Jayanthi Iyengar, senior vice-president and chief innovation and technology officer at Xylem, an American water technology provider. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to invent new technologies \u2026 but we do need innovation around how to accelerate their deployment.\u201d Iyengar added that technology would be particularly useful in detecting water losses and recycling water, but that consumers needed to be educated in innovative ways.</p> <p>\u201cOne of our surveys in California shows that where people understand what\u2019s involved in water recycling, they are much more willing to accept it. We went from a 42% to 89% acceptance rate, as soon as people had information on the treatment processes,\u201d said Iyengar. The same survey also found that more people are supportive of the term \u201cpurified water\u201d than \u201crecycled\u201d or \u201creclaimed water\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/sep/08/live-qa-114bn-a-year-needed-for-water-and-toilets-where-will-it-come-from\">Live Q&amp;A: $114bn a year needed for water and toilets \u2013 where will it come from?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But any programme of change needs funding. The millennium development goal (MDG) on water sought to halve the proportion of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation between 2000 and 2015. Annual expenditure to meet this goal was $35bn (\u00a326.5bn). By contrast, $115bn (\u00a387bn) will be needed per year to meet the SDG \u2013 sustainable and equitable access for all.</p> <p>Where will this money come from? \u201cThe starting point is a complete change in mindset,\u201d said Bill Kingdom, global lead for water supply and sanitation at the World Bank\u2019s Water Global Practice. \u201cMany of our clients are dependent on money coming from above. They spend it and then they stop [programmes] because there\u2019s no more money.\u201d </p> <p>Instead, said Kingdom, budget holders must find ways to allocate money more efficiently. </p> <h2>Making water affordable</h2> <p>Both Montero and Kingdom agreed that financial sustainability is critical for water and sanitation access to be secured indefinitely. \u201cI feel that we\u2019re not doing our jobs unless clients can move to self-financing over the long-term,\u201d said Kingdom. In the US, for example, the water service is publicly managed and provided but 100% privately financed. \u201cIt is decades down the road, but that\u2019s where I feel we should be moving.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7eec785b0df097dcb15b9ce283cc6a196675a8c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7eec785b0df097dcb15b9ce283cc6a196675a8c4/0_0_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman is shown how to fetch water from one of the ATM-style water dispensers in the Mathare slums in Nairobi, Kenya.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman is shown how to fetch water from one of the ATM-style water dispensers in the Mathare slums in Nairobi, Kenya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Irungu/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tariffs are one way a water utility could become self-financing and afford service improvements, but many people don\u2019t pay water bills because their service is bad.

We need these five organisational changes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The panel agreed that strong governance is critical for countries to ensure sustainable access to water and sanitation for all. The success of countries like Singapore, South Korea and Malaysia in achieving the MDGs on water and sanitation has been attributed to the fact that their heads of state were fully supportive of the notion of universal access. Effective leadership can also attract the investment needed to provide sustainable access. \u201cIn terms of a financial borrowing entity, water companies look pretty impressive,\u201d said Kingdom. \u201cThey have a natural monopoly on a product that is essential for life. That\u2019s a pretty good business case for lending money, as long as the governance is improved.\u201d </p> <p>But ensuring access to water and sanitation does not need to be done in traditional ways. In cities around the world, millions of people rely on an intermittent piped supply or are not connected to a water or sewerage network at all. Instead, they will often buy water from informal vendors and pay to have their sewerage removed from pit latrines. </p> <p>\u201cHow can the water sector integrate these informal vendors into the formal system, to make sure that the service provided is up to the standard people deserve?\u201d asked one audience member. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand what all parts of the sector are doing and map out who is doing what,\u201d said Jim\u00e9nez. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to provide a whole sewerage network for the city, for example, when 10% of it is covered by informal providers \u2026 We should see what existing providers can do and try to make a mix of services that can be progressively improved and help deliver solutions to all,\u201d he said.</p> <h2>Hardest to reach</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"273194189854a7aa0dc5b0b41c389c091d40a08c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/273194189854a7aa0dc5b0b41c389c091d40a08c/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man from the indigenous community of Pacayita collects water to irrigate a papaya field in Masaya, Nicaragua.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man from the indigenous community of Pacayita collects water to irrigate a papaya field in Masaya, Nicaragua.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oswaldo Rivas/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The panel also addressed the different levels of water and sanitation coverage between urban and rural areas. Data published by the WHO/Unicef joint monitoring programme at the end of the MDG period revealed that eight out of 10 people without access to an improved drinking water source live in rural areas, and only 51% of the global rural population have access to an improved sanitation facility (one that hygienically separates human waste from human contact), compared to 82% of the world\u2019s city-dwellers.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you look at rural areas of Latin America, people have the same level of coverage today that urban areas had 25 years ago,\u201d said Campos. </p> <p>\u201cInvestment in basic infrastructure has been concentrated in major capitals. Now we need to invest in small towns and medium-to-large cities so that people there have access.\u201d</p> <p>The panel also agreed that the hardest to reach \u2013 including people living in rural areas, the poorest and most vulnerable, ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples \u2013 should be prioritised in this new era of ensuring sustainable access to water and sanitation. </p> <p>\u201cThere is a huge problem with discrimination and cultural understanding of different values,\u201d said Jim\u00e9nez. Providing water and sanitation access to these people is more than just having a few more people to serve, it\u2019s part of a mind-shift to accommodate services to the aspirations of the people.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/gallery/2016/mar/22/world-water-day-global-crisis-13-photographs\">The global water crisis in 13 photographs</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Panel</h2> <p><strong>Eliza Anyangwe </strong><strong>(chair)</strong>,<strong> </strong>freelance journalist, the Guardian</p> <p><strong>Mariano Montero</strong>, director, Fundaci\u00f3n Femsa</p> <p><strong>Alejandro Jim</strong><strong>\u00e9</strong><strong>nez</strong>, programme manager, Wash specialist, Stockholm International Water Institute</p> <p><strong>Sergio Campos</strong>, chief, water and sanitation division, Inter-American Development Bank</p> <p><strong>Jayanthi Iyengar</strong>, senior VP and chief innovation and technology officer, Xylem</p> <p><strong>Bill Kingdom</strong>, global lead water supply and sanitation, Water Global Practice, World Bank</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

According to Nielsen Bookscan, fiction accounted for 5% of new titles in the UK, with children\u2019s books at 10% and graphic novels only 0.3%. On Kickstarter, 10.1% of successful publishing and comics projects were fiction, with children\u2019s books at 14.2% and graphic novels representing 8.8%.</p> <p>As a publishing veteran who <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/margot/derby-life-stories-advice-and-wisdom-about-roller/description\">launched her own imprint (via Kickstarter) last year</a>, Atwell says one of the most exciting things about crowdfunding is the way it inverts publishing\u2019s conventional publicity dynamic.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re creating a book, it\u2019s very affirming to know that it\u2019s something there is desire and demand for, versus the traditional publishing model of investing in an author and the production of a book, trying your darnedest to get the word out and reach readers, but not really knowing whether there is a readership.\u201d</p> <p>The writers and publishers using the site are \u201cinnovative, tech-savvy, and very willing to talk directly with their readers and fans\u201d, she continues, with some combining crowdfunding with more traditional approaches.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the most exciting projects we\u2019ve seen in the past year have been run by great independent publishers such as <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/896286441/2045227906\">Copper Canyon\u2019s Then Come Back</a>, a book of lost poems by Pablo Neruda, or <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/628605595/milkweed-books-because-bookshelves-should-never-be\">Milkweed Books</a>, a project to create a new independent bookstore, which is live on the site right now,\u201d Atwell explains. \u201cI\u2019ve also seen projects by hybrid authors who are published by mainstream Big Four publishers but also do projects on Kickstarter, such as <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/3548813\">Kate Milford</a>, who has run two great projects for novellas.\u201d</p> <p>Pitch and presentation are vital, when trying to stand out from thousands of other projects. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/katemiawhite?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Kate-Mia White</a>, who raised more than \u00a32,000 to fund the third volume of her Dark Forest series, spends a few days on every pitch she makes. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to create an eye-catching video with a strong theme, and keep the whole page in that theme,\u201d she says.</p> <p>White never even considered traditional publication, \u201cpartly because I was producing 16-page comics and partly I feel the internet is now a better way of reaching an audience.\u201d</p> <p>For David Hill, who raised more than \u00a33,000 to publish his memoir of living with a Staffordshire bull terrier, the \u201crelentless\u201d pitching didn\u2019t come easily.</p> <p>\u201cI was advised to share the link on multiple social media accounts several times a day, and talk about it until I thought I\u2019d talked about it too much, but then carry on talking about it anyway,\u201d Hill says. \u201cI found the first week or so to be quite dispiriting, but once the ball was rolling and it gained momentum, I started to feel encouraged, and finally, elated when it was successfully funded.\u201d</p> <p>When strangers are sharing their money to help with a project, the dynamic between writers and their backers can become very personal. \u201cMost of the backers know about my struggles with anxiety, job loss, and all the sacrifices that I\u2019ve made to give this rescue dog the life she deserves,\u201d Hill says. \u201cEveryone\u2019s been so supportive, and I\u2019ve been really humbled by that support.\u201d</p> <p>The artist-led model has seen substantial sums of money devoted to projects in areas where traditional publishing often struggles. Literary journals raised more than $200,000 on Kickstarter in 2015, while poetry received almost $300,000. Anthologies brought in almost $500,000, while art books picked up more than $4m.</p> <p>\u201c[Crowdfunding] certainly gives the writer much more creative freedom, and the ability to tell their story exactly as they originally envisaged,\u201d Hill says. \u201cI believe it\u2019s really enriching the art of storytelling, and giving readers a much wider selection of stories to choose from.\u201d</p> <p>The broad range of projects that Kickstarter supports is no accident: in 2015, the business reincorporated as a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/blog/kickstarter-is-now-a-benefit-corporation\">public benefit corporation</a>, a profit-making model that includes having a positive impact on the world as a legally defined goal. Atwell says this is part of the site\u2019s mission \u201cto support a more creative, equitable world, and to fight inequality\u201d. And while traditional publishing <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/27/us-study-finds-publishing-is-overwhelmingly-white-and-female\">struggles to address problems with diversity,</a> crowdfunding offers an alternative route to publication for writers who are struggling to be heard.</p> <p>\u201cI believe it\u2019s critical to our culture and our society that people from every conceivable background have the opportunity to share their stories, and find stories that resonate with them and their experience,\u201d Atwell says. \u201cEven more than that, I think it\u2019s important for people to seek out stories that seem alien to them, so they build greater understanding and empathy for others. Empathy seems to be in short supply in the world today, and I really do believe in the power of literature to help increase it.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 20 September 2016 to make clear that Rebel Girls is Kickstarter\u2019s biggest publishing project for an original work. <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/530877925/bibliotheca/description\">Bibliotecha</a> raised more than $1.4m for a new edition of the Bible in 2014.</li> </ul>",
  "<p>Waning consumer demand for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/luxury-goods-sector\">luxury goods</a> and global economic uncertainty have triggered sales warnings at Swiss group Richemont and its French rival Herm\u00e8s International. </p> <p>Richemont, whose brands include Cartier and Montblanc, said it was expecting a 45% plunge in first-half profits as sales of watches and jewellery dwindle.<br></p> <p>Herm\u00e8s said it was abandoning its annual sales growth target because the broad economic backdrop was so uncertain. Shares in both companies fell sharply, with Herm\u00e8s down 6.5% and Richemont down 4%.</p> <p>The luxury sector is being hit by declining sales in key consumer markets such as Hong Kong and Macau, with weakening demand partly driven by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/30/xi-jinping-tells-chinese-leadership-that-families-must-set-example-on-corruption\">a government crackdown on corruption and excess China</a>.</p> <p>In Europe, sales of high-end goods have been flagging after a series of terrorist attacks discouraged foreign tourists from travelling to some of the region\u2019s top shopping destinations such as Paris.</p> <p>Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX, said the whole sector was suffering. \u201cThe luxury market is suffering. Richemont and Hermes have both delivered downbeat trading updates and their stocks are being sold off in sharp fashion as a result,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThese come after a woeful summer for the sector, with Burberry and Swatch among several notable marques seeing sales and profits falling. Meanwhile Tiffany posted its steepest decline in sales since the financial crisis in May.\u201d<br></p> <p>Geneva-based Richemont reported a larger-than-expected 14% drop in sales in the first five months of the financial year to the end of August. Analysts had forecast an 11% fall.</p> <p>Sales were down in all regions, with Europe the biggest faller at 20%. The business struggled in Japan, where sales fell by 15% partly because a strong yen depressed tourist spending in the country.</p> <p>One bright spot was the UK, where Richemont said the sharp fall in the value of the pound since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">the Brexit vote</a> in June was helping to drive sales growth. \u201cElsewhere in Europe, sales were down, particularly in France, due to a significantly lower level of tourist activity,\u201d the company said.</p> <p>Watch sales fell 19% over the five months, while sales of jewellery were down 16%. Richemont said tough trading would weigh heavily on its first-half results: \u201cWe consider that the difficult trading conditions are likely to continue during September. Operating profit for the six months ending 30 September 2016 is therefore expected to be approximately 45% below the prior year\u2019s level,\u201d it said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are of the view that the current negative environment as a whole is unlikely to reverse in the short term. However, we remain convinced of the long-term prospects for luxury goods globally, and in particular for watches and jewellery.\u201d<br></p> <p>Herm\u00e8s said it was dropping its annual revenue growth target of 8% because of \u201ceconomic, geopolitical and monetary uncertainties around the world\u201d. It said it would maintain an ambitious goal for sales growth.</p> <p>Despite the caution, Herm\u00e8s said revenues in the first half of 2016 rose 6% to \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32bn), with growth across all regions. Net income rose 13% to \u20ac545m. In Europe sales rose 8%, but the company\u2019s chief executive, Axel Dumas, said trading at its shops in Nice, Cannes and Paris had suffered since the terrorist attack in Nice in July.</p>",
  "<p><strong>EasyJet</strong> is leading the FTSE 100 fallers on concerns about the outlook for the budget airline.</p> <p>Its shares are down 24p or 2% at \u00a311.10 after analysts at Barclays cut their target price from \u00a311.50 to \u00a310.50 with an equalweight rating. They said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given uncertainty around UK trading and the European geopolitical climate, visibility for the winter and 2017 is particularly low. On balance we think 2017 earnings will slip backwards as easyJet maintains its 8-9% growth rate, prioritising long term strategic opportunities over short term yields. Cash generation for the next few years will likely be poor, although the dividend is secure...</p> <p>Ever since the Sharm-el-Sheikh Metrojet bombing at the end of October 2016, it seems like easyJet has faced one demand shock after another (Paris, Brussels, Egyptair, Nice, Turkey, Brexit). The company is on track to record the worst year for yields in its history, and the situation has been compounded by operational challenges this summer including Gatwick congestion, extreme weather and French air traffic control strikes. All told, we believe external events have cost easyJet at least \u00a3150m in 2016.</p> <p>However, it would be dangerous to assume a \u2018bounceback\u2019 in the geopolitical or operational environment next year. In fact, we think investors should be braced for a tough winter, as easyJet continues to grow at 9% (mid single digit in the UK). The UK consumer makes up 50% of easyJet\u2019s revenue, and it is unclear how depreciation in sterling will affect appetite for off-peak discretionary travel (eg weekend/ski breaks). Allowing also for a tough October comparable, and the fact Easter moves out of the first half we model revenue per seat at -8.5% through the winter, leading to a forecast loss before tax of \u00a3123m \u2013 easyJet\u2019s highest in six years. </p> </blockquote> <p>Barclays was more positive on British Airways owner <strong>International Airlines Group</strong>, although its shares have slipped 1.5p to 418.2p.

  "<p>The former vice-chairman of the BBC Trust has expressed alarm about the \u201cbrutal\u201d way Theresa May effectively reversed David Cameron\u2019s decision to reappoint Rona Fairhead as chair of the corporation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/13/rona-fairhead-to-stand-down-as-bbc-chair\">Fairhead stepped down</a> on Tuesday after May indicated she would have to reapply for the job of chair of the new BBC unitary board, four months after Cameron renewed her contract. The former prime minister asked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/06/rona-fairheads-appointment-as-head-of-new-bbc-board-broke-rules-says-mp\">Fairhead to stay on as chair of the BBC Trust</a> during the corporation\u2019s transition to being governed by a powerful single board. </p> <p>Diane Coyle, a former Treasury adviser and vice-chair to Fairhead on the trust, said: \u201cI think it is an extraordinary turn of events so late in the day to change the arrangement for the transition.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, she said the timing was a \u201cbit strange\u201d.</p> <p>She added: \u201cIt is a very short period now before we are supposed to have the new structure in place and the white paper has not been published yet, and there is a lot of work to do after that ... The process is always pretty brutal, the way politicians and the way officials doing their job go about these things never use the same kind of respectful processes that occur in the private sector.\u201d</p> <p>Coyle said she was concerned about the independence of the new board, most of whose members will be appointed by the government.</p> <p>She said: \u201cWhat worries me now, is after all the erosion of BBC independence over the past 10 years or so, with top-slicing raids on the licence fee and the raid for the over-75 licences ... it is really important that this new structure has a truly independent chair and truly independent set of non-executives.\u201d</p> <p>May\u2019s decision to open up the appointment process to other candidates was backed by Damian Collins MP, acting chair of the Commons select committee for culture, media and sport.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it was right that Rona Fairhead was offered the job in the first place in the way that she was. We felt there should be a proper process of appointment where other candidates could be considered.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cBeing chairman of the new unitary board is effectively being chairman of the BBC, or chairman of this great global media company. Being chairman of the trust is being chairman of the regulator. And they are different roles and I think have different skill sets.\u201d</p> <p>Collins insisted that an open recruitment process would help protect the BBC\u2019s independence. </p> <p>He said: \u201cMany people would have said that \u2018Rona Fairhead was offered the job of being chairman of the BBC behind closed doors privately by David Cameron. Was that done to just buy her agreement to the abolition of the trust? Was that done because she was David Cameron\u2019s friend?\u2019 People can\u2019t say that any more. Whoever is the new chair of the BBC will have been appointed by a proper process.\u201d</p> <p>Coyle objected to Collins\u2019s suggestion that Fairhead had not been recruited properly when she was originally made chair of the trust. She said: \u201cI think you are being unfair to her in saying she has never been through any public process. She has.</p> <p>\u201cIn an ideal world you would always have a proper open process for any of these major public service roles. But it is bit of a fiction. I hope the select committee can use its authority to make sure that the process is now completely transparent and open.

The dramatic shakeup will alter the constituencies of more than 500 MPs. </p> <p>But there\u2019s a much bigger picture here that the boundary commissioners have overlooked.

An Eygyptian-born economist, Shafik is a smart woman, who has moved in and out of the UK public sector with ease. She worked as permanent secretary at the Department for International Development for three years before joining the IMF, and moved back to the UK in March 2014, as deputy governor of the Bank of England, a role that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/18/nemat-shafik-economist-stellar-cv-bank-of-england\">some argued </a>made her the most powerful woman in the City of London.</p> <p>Shafik - usually known by her nickname Minouche - is now moving again, to become<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/12/bank-of-england-deputy-governor-quits-nemat-minouche-shafik-london-school-economics\"> the first woman to run the London School of Economics</a>. It\u2019s an interesting move that gets her out of the bank during what is likely to be a tough time, dominated by Brexit negotiations.

But the UK\u2019s creaking infrastructure and the increased severity of climate change are likely to mean that Londoners in particular face a future where serious water shortages become more common.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/13/uks-hottest-september-day-since-1949-32c-heathrow\">The UK is currently experiencing its hottest September days since 1949</a>. Globally, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/13/august-ties-with-july-as-hottest-month-on-record\">data just published</a> shows that August and July were the hottest yet on record.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/16/drought-wildlife-farming-disaster-warning\">The last major drought warnings for most of the country occurred in 2012</a>, but there have been localised problems and close calls since. Britain\u2019s water and sewage infrastructure were built, from the 19th century, to withstand far different weather circumstances than those that are beginning to prevail as global warming takes hold.</p> <p>Climate change is likely to mean an increase in extreme weather of all kinds - floods, droughts, heatwaves and fiercer storms - with changes in rainfall patterns having knock-on effects on current infrastructure.</p> <p>One thing that both droughts and flooding have in common is a lack of storage space for water: in the case of floods, centuries-old storage spaces such as river flood plains and water meadows have been drained or redeveloped for agriculture and housing; and in the case of droughts, few new reservoirs have been built in the areas where they are most needed, particularly in the south-east of England.</p> <p>Sewage is also a key problem, as sewers can overflow during floods but become backed-up during droughts, when there is not enough water to flush material through the pipes. When rainfall resumes after a period of drought, the resulting back-up can cause blocked sewers and flooding.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/drought/9236909/Thames-Water-accused-of-mismanagement-by-closing-two-dozen-reservoirs.html\">Thames Water has been criticised for selling off 25 of its reservoirs</a> in the wake of privatisation, despite the threat of water shortages in London.</p> <p>Hunt told the Guardian that these reservoirs would have had \u201cno effect\u201d on the utility\u2019s current and future resilience to drought, as they were \u201cservice\u201d reservoirs intended to balance the load between supply and changing demand, rather than \u201cstorage\u201d reservoirs to collect water.</p> <p>However, the company is now facing having to buy new - and expensive - land for creating new storage reservoirs around London in order to provide reassurance against shortages, if measures to encourage residents to reduce their water use are insufficiently effective.</p> <p>Michael Roberts, chief executive of Water UK, the utilities\u2019 trade body, said: \u201cSince privatisation, the industry has invested billions of pounds in securing the nation\u2019s precious water resources, but we all need to do more in the face of current and future pressures on those resources.\u201d</p> <p>Rose O\u2019Neill, freshwater programme manager at WWF-UK, said that abstraction licences, used mainly water companies and farmers to take water from existing rivers, lakes and underground sources, should come under urgent review. </p> <p>She said: \u201cPressure on our rivers and water supplies is only going to rise. We need to act now to ensure we have enough water for people and nature in years to come. [The system of granting and monitoring] abstraction licences is out-of-date, unsustainable and not fit for purpose. It urgently needs reform.\u201d</p> <p>Simon Gosling, associate professor in climate risk at the University of Nottingham, said the report added to the body of evidence that the UK should expect and increase in the frequency and severity of droughts, owing to climate change. \u201cThis, when coupled with projected population growth scenarios, creates an important risk to water infrastructure as a result of water demand exceeding the available supply,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cOne of the recommendations in the report is for a \u2018twin track\u2019 approach to future water management, which would involve an enhancement in the supply of water along with improved management of the demand for water. This recommendation confirms one of the conclusions from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/12/uk-poorly-prepared-for-climate-change-impacts-government-advisers-warn\">UK Climate Change Risk Assessment, published earlier this year</a>, which noted that new policies and increased efforts are needed in order to provide more ambitious reductions in water consumption, and planning of new water supply infrastructure.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Marc Stutter, a research leader on water management at the James Hutton Institute in Scotland, told the Guardian that the report should help policymakers looking at government actions such as the licensing of businesses that need to use water. </p> <p>He said: \u201cIn terms of the disposal route of effluents to waters these are based on licensing discharge based on a safe level of effluent dilution with river flows. These need to recognise future risks of extreme drought and impaired dilution leading to severe ecological stress. The modelled scenarios [in the report] are a good basis [for further study] to understand drought effects for business sectors and the environment that rely on water.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Richard Harding, research fellow at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, added: \u201cThe UK, particularly the south-east, faces a critical water supply situation in the coming decades, with the twin pressures of rising population and the likelihood of increasing drought due to climate change. We mustn\u2019t let the recent run of wet years, since 2012, lull us into a sense of complacency, because the weather patterns could very well switch, as they did in the spring of 2012.\u201d</p>",

Those opposite don\u2019t believe in some of the flexibility measures that would actually deliver for individuals the ability to contribute more into their superannuation to provide more in their retirement. We on this side think it\u2019s important to protect those flexibility measures, which is why we have argued so strongly for them.</p> </blockquote> <p>(This is interesting because it is the next obvious policy area for Labor and the Coalition to cooperate on after the budget cuts.

She started the piece with former Labor leader and US ambassador Kim Beazley, backing in Turnbull on the Kevin Rudd nomination for UN secretary general. Beazley\u2019s conversations with the prime minister confirm the view that Turnbull did not consider Rudd a suitable candidate. And that a government could not nominate someone without endorsing. She uses the example for a wider point.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Beazley\u2019s intervention forces us to think again about this incident, and opens a wider appraisal of Turnbull\u2019s prime ministership than has generally been seen in the orgy of words marking 12 months since he toppled Tony Abbott.</p> <p>Much has been made in the past year \u2013 and the past week \u2013 of the high expectations voters had that Turnbull would transform politics and their disappointment that he has not.</p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s performance is rated in terms of these expectations. Many of those who criticise him notably do so because he has not delivered what they particularly want.</p> <p>On the left, there is disappointment on issues like climate change and same-sex marriage. On the right, the criticism is he hasn\u2019t done enough on tax reform, budget repair and industrial relations.</p> <p>But there is very little said about the way the Turnbull prime ministership actually works. Whether it is good, bad or indifferent, it is certainly a very, very different prime ministership.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be blunt here. This is a bloke who is not particularly good at retail politics, nor particularly concerned about running to the beat of the retail politics drum.</p> <p>As one cabinet minister says, \u201cYou will observe that a particular issue isn\u2019t quite zooming down the ski slope politically and he thinks that\u2019s fine, he\u2019s relaxed. He doesn\u2019t mind things being a bit \u2018off piste\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Yet all those who have moaned about three-word slogans and politicians driven by the 24-hour media cycle and \u201cannounceables\u201d still don\u2019t seem happy with an approach so conspicuously lacking such frenzy.</p> <p>Few doubt Turnbull\u2019s intellectual capacities. But few also observe that the prime minister sees his job foremost as head of the \u201cOffice of Wicked Problems\u201d, not first as the beating heart of a political organisation focused on winning the next election.</p> </blockquote> <p>Discuss.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-13T23:57:25.318Z\">at 12.57am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d88e46e4b067ad3008770e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-13T23:44:59.757Z\">12.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bowen says, hey government, there is more we can do to fix the budget together.

  "<p>Few names in American sport spark a reaction like the original North American Soccer League of the 1960s, 70s and 80s, a subject to be revisited each time the need arises for a lesson on how badly things can go wrong for football in the United States.</p> <p>The kitschy sexiness of the old NASL essentially collapsed under its own weight, a failed attempt to ramp up popularity for a very European brand of football in a recalcitrant United States. Some of those team names still cling on to life, in the MLS and modern incarnation of NASL: the New York Cosmos, one-time home of Pele. The Tampa Bay Rowdies, who played host to prolific English striker Rodney Marsh. And the Fort Lauderdale Strikers, a late 70s playground of Northern Irish great George Best. </p> <p>The Strikers, these days are limping along under the stewardship of a Brazilian ownership group led by Paulo Cesso, an education and technology entrepreneur, and Ronaldo, the Brazilian World Cup winner, is a minority partner.</p> <p>Except the Brazilian takeover of the distinctive red and gold hoops seems to have foundered. After a season of woe that has included the ignominy of <a href=\"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/fl-fort-lauderdale-strikers-late-paying-players-0713-20160712-story.html\">players being paid late and checks bouncing</a>, the Guardian understands the club has been put up for sale. Whether that amounts to an intention to seek a partial or full sale remains unclear \u2014 as does the future role of Ronaldo. However, in a statement to the Guardian, the club\u2019s managing director, Luis Cuccatti, said the Strikers\u2019 future was under discussion. \u201cWe are reviewing our current ownership situation and speaking with potential partners so that we can craft the best plan possible to move towards our goal of building a world-class soccer club,\u201d said Cuccatti.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/29/san-francisco-deltas-nasl-soccer-team-virtual-reality\">San Francisco Deltas: Silicon Valley's AI-enhanced take on soccer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Still, news that one of the NASL\u2019s flagship brands appears to be in turmoil caps a difficult month for the league. In some quarters, it might be seen as another question over the vitality of the NASL. Just last month, ructions emerged in Oklahoma City as Rayo OKC, in their very first season in the league, were plunged into crisis as a dispute developed between the majority ownership group, the owners of Spanish club Rayo Vallecano, and their local minority partner. The argument escalated to the point where one minority owner <a href=\"http://www.empireofsoccer.com/rayo-okc-minority-owner-removes-turf-in-dispute-with-spanish-investors-53004/\">apparently removed turf from the field</a>. </p> <p>In Fort Lauderdale, the difficulties are myriad. Low crowds in a densely populated Florida soccer market with the promise of more to come. <a href=\"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/fl-fort-lauderdale-strikers-late-paying-players-0713-20160712-story.html \">The late arrival of salaries</a>, an occurrence explained away as an issue over the transfer of funds from Brazil to the US. </p> <p>But it is a story that could have been foretold. Life in the minor leagues of soccer in the US is notoriously difficult. Teams come and go. Owners flame out. Fans, ditto. And though the Strikers name carries a certain cache, stemming from a late 1970s-early 1980s swoon thanks to luminaries like George Best, Gerd M\u00fcller and Ray Hudson, the nostalgia evidently only goes so far.</p> <p>It\u2019s nearly two years since Ronaldo and co set up shop. The Brazilians, who purchased the Strikers from the now tarnished event management company Traffic Sports in late 2014, arrived with a stark mandate. They pledged to re-elevate the club to its former glory. In that vein, last pre-season they undertook a trip to China. The idea was even floated that Ronaldo, then visibly out of shape, might pull on his boots once more and turn out for the South Florida outfit.</p> <p>Alas, no.</p> <p>He was a seldom seen figure, says fan leader Kenny Butler, president of the prominent Strikers supporters group, Flight 19. \u201cHis presence has been spotty since the beginning,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it was the same thing as them bringing [Brazilian defender] Leo Moura last year to play No10 when he\u2019s been a left-back all his career. If he could play No10 he would have done in Brazil. And they thought all the Brazilians would show up just to see Leo Moura.\u201d</p> <p>Ronaldo\u2019s likeness may have been overused, says the Sun Sentinel\u2019s Pedro Heizer. \u201cHe was never here,\u201d says Heizer. \u201cThe Strikers didn\u2019t advertise much but when they did it tended to include Ronaldo. I think that might have got to people because they never saw him.\u201d</p> <p>The Brazilians called the Strikers wrong, he believes, because they arrived \u201cthinking they knew soccer because they are Brazilian but failed to understand American soccer is a whole different beast.\u201d</p> <p>Initially the noises coming from the new owners were positive, Butler says. The fan relationship with the front office was productive. But then fans saw the team flooded with Brazilians, interpreted as an ultimately botched attempt to appeal to the local Brazilian community. A disconnect with fans has been palpable this season. In recent seasons, average crowds have been modest \u2014 around 3,000-4,000. This season, attendances have plummeted to around the 1,300 mark.</p> <p>Indications point to another factor being flux in the coaching and playing department. Former head coach Gunter Kronsteiner, who led the Strikers to the 2014 NASL championship match was let go by the Brazilians \u2014 to the consternation of many. After a dismal 2015 opening campaign, he was drafted back in for the fall portion of the NASL\u2019s split season, leading them into the playoffs once more. Yet, again the club and Kronsteiner parted ways. Nevertheless, the Austrian retains a strong affection for the club and offers some praise for Cesso and another of his partners, Rafael Bertani. But he is clear about where he thinks things went wrong.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/10/miami-fc-nasl-alessandro-nesta\">While Miami waits for MLS to arrive, city's newest team make its move</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey gave away the local players, they gave away the whole coaching staff,\u201d Kronsteiner told the Guardian. \u201cThe players and the coaching staff had a personal relationship with the fans. You just don\u2019t ignore this when you are serious about running a professional club. You don\u2019t kick out a Tom Mulroy or a Tim Robbie [who] are very well known in this area for being 100% committed to this club. Mistakes over mistakes.\u201d</p> <p>Kronsteiner, a former coach with Austria Vienna in his homeland, said the writing was on the wall when it became clear to him the club \u201cdidn\u2019t want to spend money anymore\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cSoccer was not their main goal,\u201d Kronsteiner said of the Brazilian owners. <br></p> <p>Mulroy, club president until his departure in November 2014, and Robbie were seen as key figures in connecting the club and fanbase. In particular, Robbie, latterly club president before leaving in May last year, represented a significant link to the storied past of the Strikers. It was his father, Joe Robbie, of Miami Dolphins fame, who started the original Fort Lauderdale Strikers franchise in the 1970s, and Robbie Jr started working for the club immediately after college. Mulroy, for his part, attracted credit for his outreach among the local area\u2019s youth.</p> <p>It\u2019s been a vexing season thus far for the Strikers. On the field, the team have lately gone six games unbeaten amid the turmoil. And in the US Open Cup, they went further than any other minor league team in reaching the quarter-finals. Off the field, issues are copious. <a href=\"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/soccer/fort-lauderdale-strikers/fl-strikers-new-york-cosmos-preview-0903-20160902-story.html\">Reports suggest the tardy arrival of payments has continued</a>. On the attendance front, the club took the decision to switch from their historic Lockhart Stadium home to Central Broward Stadium, home of the MLS Combine, ostensibly to provide a more intimate fan experience. That\u2019s just as well: one recent midweek game saw the reported crowd figure come in at 455.</p> <p>The team are too focused on trips to China and building a global brand, and not enough on their own backyard, the critics argue.</p> <p>As for the NASL as a whole, another rocky off-season may await. New club the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/29/san-francisco-deltas-nasl-soccer-team-virtual-reality\">San Francisco Deltas</a> are slated to join and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/29/carl-craig-head-coach-minnesota-united-mls\">Minnesota United are headed for MLS</a>. But the threat of contraction elsewhere lingers.

There was no engagement ring, no gift registry, no official photographer or party planner. The guest list \u2013 immediate family and close friends only \u2013 topped out at 14 people, which was about what their mock Tudor starter home could comfortably hold.</p> <p>About 200 people gathered at a friend\u2019s house that afternoon to toast the newlyweds with smoked meats, champagne and a tiered wedding cake. Some people headed to an off-campus dive bar for dancing, and the festivities continued until a 4am call from the local drunk tank. The bride\u2019s brother had been pulled over on a DUI while driving her yellow Fiat, according to the groom\u2019s memoir.</p> <p>And so began the most consequential marriage in US political history.</p> <p>The union solemnized between Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton in the living room of their first home as a married couple in Fayetteville, Arkansas, on 11 October 1975, created a force that has dominated Democratic party and US presidential politics for more than a quarter of a century and propelled two middle-class Americans into the highest circles of global and corporate leadership. </p> <p>The couple spent just over a year in the mock Tudor house that Bill bought to get Hillary to marry him \u2013 long enough for her to paint the kitchen cupboards a retina-burning orange and for him to botch a repair job on the fireplace. </p> <p>But even in that first year of married life \u2013 the last before either was elected to office \u2013 Bill and Hillary were trying to figure out how to accommodate two highly ambitious personalities within one marriage, according to their friends from those days.</p> <p>\u201cHe always knew he wanted to come back here and he made no bones about it. He wanted to come back here and help his state \u2013 and God knows it needed helping,\u201d said Ann Henry who, with her husband Morriss, hosted the Clintons\u2019 wedding reception at her house. \u201cHe had told all of us here about her. He told us: \u201cShe is so smart. She could do anything. She could be a US senator. She could be a governor. She could be anything she wanted to be. He recognised her and her abilities.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Six months after their wedding, Bill decided to run for state attorney general, plotting election strategy around a table that was used more for board games than dinner parties, according to friends. Even then, they called it the war room.<br></p> <p>By the end of 1976, after Bill Clinton\u2019s election, they were on their way to Little Rock, a journey that would take the Clintons to their first stint in the White House.</p> <p>For their baby boomer generation, they were the ultimate power couple. For Arkansans in the early 1970s, when women still needed a husband\u2019s consent to get a car loan or credit card, they stood for a new way of negotiating work and marriage, one where wives matched their husbands for career and political ambitions. Hillary Rodham did not even take her husband\u2019s name until 1982, when her husband who lost his bid for re-election as governor was trying to get back into power \u2013 that is when she began to go by Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p> <p>Bill Clinton, in his speaking slot at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/27/bill-clinton-speech-hillary-democratic-convention\">Democratic national convention</a> in July, spun the story of his marriage as classic fairytale romance. \u201cI met a girl,\u201d he began, recounting his awe-struck state upon meeting Hillary Clinton in the Yale law library in 1971, and how he finally won her heart, asking three times for her hand in marriage before he got a yes.</p> <p>The story as told by Bill Clinton, was said to be an attempt to \u201chumanise\u201d his wife, left out the messy real-life bits, as fairytales do, in his case the epic cheating and lying, the lacerating public humiliation that risked his presidency and smolders still in the background of Hillary\u2019s presidential ambitions, fanned by the comments of internet trolls. </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s testimonial and his repeated assertions that she was \u201cthe best darn change-maker I have ever seen\u201d did little to address the other questions about their extraordinary partnership, and really the ones that matter most: how did a formidable couple manage their respective ambitions?</p> <p>It is easy to ask, as many do, whether Hillary Clinton would ever have had a shot at being the first female president if she wasn\u2019t married to Bill Clinton, whether she exploited her position as first lady to jump on to a relatively safe New York Senate seat, and whether she once again used her husband\u2019s connections to major donors and Democratic party grandees to fix the race against Bernie Sanders in her second run for the White House. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"89542544cfeaf275988eb83a62becf90d831768d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89542544cfeaf275988eb83a62becf90d831768d/0_0_1979_1940/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Billary1 2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"980\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>That\u2019s the default sexist question.</p> <p>But maybe the real question is whether Bill Clinton, who had already lost one election by the time of his marriage, would have succeeded in becoming America\u2019s youngest governor and one of the country\u2019s most popular presidents without Hillary Clinton by his side? Maybe Bill Clinton held her back \u2013 and Hillary Clinton would have got there any way, or even sooner.</p> <p>Those who befriended the young couple as they embarked on married life in the college town of Fayetteville, Arkansas, in the 1970s asked early versions of those same questions about balancing ambition within a marriage.</p> <p>The friendships they made during that first year of married life were lasting. Morriss and Ann Henry, who hosted that wedding reception, were lawyers and had held public office, like the Clintons. They were in Philadelphia when Clinton formally accepted the nomination. So was Margaret Whillock, who was Hillary Clinton\u2019s first guide to southern living. Diane Blair, a close confidante from those days, died of cancer in 2000, but she kept extensive notes of their conversations, which are housed in the University of Arkansas.</p> <p>A look-back through time is always faulty. People project present-day realities \u2013 in this case Hillary Clinton as the Democratic nominee \u2013 on their memories. But when the friends first met in the 1970s, Bill and Hillary Clinton both seemed headed for prominent positions in public life. According to their friends, it was an open question who would get there first, and at what personal cost.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>It was a perfect fall day in the Ozarks \u2013 warm sun, cloudless blue sky, with a hint of coolness in the air, and the Razorbacks were playing a home game. Craig and Margaret Whillock\u2019s house was just down the street from the law school where Bill and Hillary Clinton taught. </p> <p>Craig Whillock, a former state representative and aide to a local member of Congress, had been one of Bill Clinton\u2019s earliest mentors when he came back home to Arkansas.</p> <p>When Bill Clinton announced he wanted to run for Congress, against a longtime Republican incumbent, Whillock ran up to get his contacts book, and drove the newcomer all over the district making introductions, according to his widow, Margaret.</p> <p>The Whillocks often opened up their home to large football parties, and on one glorious afternoon in 1974, Margaret Whillock looked up to see Hillary Clinton at the back door. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hillary\u2019s pay records show a starting salary of $16,450 \u2013 slightly more than her husband who was on $16,182</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere was something about her that was so compelling,\u201d Whillock said. \u201cI saw her out of the kitchen door, framed in the door watching the crowd, and she had on a white dress and I thought: \u2018She is going to be important to me\u2019.\u201d </p> <p>The Whillocks were already playing surrogate parents to both Clintons. Bill Clinton regularly used to drop in for dinner with the family, on his way home from a teaching job at the law school. When Hillary Clinton decided to pay a visit and eventually take a job at the law school herself, Bill Clinton asked Margaret Whillock to show her around. </p> <p>He was desperate for Hillary Clinton to like Arkansas, to like it enough to stay, Margaret Whillock said.</p> <p>\u201cBill Clinton was so excited she was coming to Fayetteville. He was thrilled out of his mind. He wanted her to like it here. He wanted her to meet people. I think he realized what a jewel he had in her.\u201d</p> <p>Whillock was working full-time as a school teacher and she had six children at home. That did not deter Bill. \u201cHe said: \u2018You have to have her over. You have to have her over,\u201d she said. </p> <p>So on Clinton\u2019s second day of work at the law school, Whillock invited her for lunch and the women became friends.</p> <p>Even then Hillary Clinton was a high-flyer \u2013 certainly in Arkansas where she was among the first women teaching in the law faculty, and a leader in expanding legal services to the poor \u2013 at a time when judges barred women from taking on rape cases on the grounds that they could not cope with the unpleasantness.<br></p> <p>She was an ambitious, east coast liberal in a hurry in a small, southern town that operated at a slower, gentler pace, especially where gender roles were concerned. Women \u2013 if they did work outside the home \u2013 were mainly confined to feminine professions like teaching and nursing. </p> <p>\u201cShe was different because she was interested in things,\u201d Whillock said. \u201cShe did things differently. She wasn\u2019t into going shopping too much and that kind of thing.\u201d<br></p> <p> Clinton was one of just 27 women in her graduating class at Yale law school. In Arkansas, there was an even bigger gender imbalance. She was among the first female professors at the law school, winning the job over 39 male and two other female applicants.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>And she earned more than her husband from the very beginning of their marriage. Both were employed to teach at the University of Arkansas law school. Hillary\u2019s pay records for the 1974-1975 academic year show a starting salary of $16,450 \u2013 slightly more than her husband, who was on $16,182 in his second year at the law school, and she would continue to outpace him on pay for her short time there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8f6a84510fa4c889f91c1a1583bc09de0da15fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8f6a84510fa4c889f91c1a1583bc09de0da15fe/0_0_786_538/500.png\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton pay\" width=\"500\" height=\"342\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton\u2019s starting salary was $16,450.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yale</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She also had a broader portfolio of responsibilities, teaching criminal procedure and establishing a legal aid clinic, and she came with glowing recommendations from her professors and supervisors at her previous jobs.</p> <p>By the end of that year, after Bill Clinton won his election as attorney general, the couple were on their way to Little Rock. Their lives as private citizens were over. </p> <p>Hillary Clinton would face much closer scrutiny over her conduct as a wife: her decision to keep her last name, to hold down a demanding job, and to take on big policy projects, such as her successful overhaul of Arkansas\u2019s public schools, which had been ranked worst in the country.</p> <p>She saw even then the possibilities of using her position as the first lady of Arkansas to make change \u2013 if not always the perils, according to Henry, whose husband Morriss had served as a state senator. </p> <p>\u201cShe was talking about Eleanor Roosevelt. That was her role model and mentor kind of thing,\u201d Henry recalled. \u201cI was saying sometimes you have to be careful and you can only do so much and then there is a backlash.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton disagreed, citing Roosevelt\u2019s activism as first lady. \u201cI said by the time Eleanor Roosevelt was so involved in politics, that marriage was all over and I am married with three children,\u201d Henry said.</p> <p>She was not clear whether Clinton really saw her point.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Diane Blair was a prodigious taker of notes \u2013 on yellow legal pads, note paper with silly cartoons, and in typed records of hour-long phone conversations with Hillary Clinton when the then first lady was having some down time at Camp David. </p> <p>Blair\u2019s reflections on her close friend take up 16 boxes of her papers at the University of Arkansas \u2013 pages scrawled with references to Chelsea Clinton\u2019s ballet lessons, the flannel nightgown Hillary Clinton wore in the living quarters, and other intimate details of her friend\u2019s life in the White House.</p> <p>But the essence boils down to this, Blair writes at one point, paraphrasing her friend: Bill Clinton was the duck. Hillary Clinton was the decoy. As the wife, Hillary Clinton was constantly under attack for exhibiting traits that might be admired in a man. </p> <p>Her intelligence and tenacity \u2013 which would have been an asset in a man \u2013 made people uncomfortable, according to pollsters. She needed to project a softer side. </p> <p>And Clinton told Blair, the White House operatives went along with that because it directed the criticism away from Bill Clinton.<br></p> <p>Clinton was also getting tired of the criticism of her appearance. \u201cI gave up my name, got contact lenses. But I\u2019m not going to try to present to be someone that I\u2019m not,\u201d she told Blair.</p> <p>\u201cShe has about come to the conclusion that no matter what she does is going to piss off some people, so will just continue to be herself and let everybody else make whatever adjustments they have to.\u201d</p> <p>From her privileged position as confidante, Blair also served as a sounding board for Clinton at the bleakest moments during her time as first lady, when she was confronted with her husband\u2019s affair with Monica Lewinsky.</p> <p>It seems clear even then, when the humiliation was still fresh, that Clinton never seriously contemplated divorce. \u201cHe has been her best friend for 25 years, her husband for 23 years, they\u2019re connected in every way imaginable, she feels strongly about him and family and Chelsea and marriage and she\u2019s just got to try to work it through,\u201d Blair wrote in her notes. \u201cShe is not trying to excuse him. It was a huge personal lapse. And she is not taking responsibility for it.\u201d</p> <p>Blair goes on to record Clinton\u2019s efforts to rationalise her husband\u2019s behaviour \u2013 because of the pressure he was under as president, his early upbringing, and to dismiss its importance. </p> <p>Ultimately, Clinton forgave her husband. \u201cShe\u2019s in it for long haul,\u201d Blair wrote. \u201cBecause she\u2019s stubborn; partly her upbringing; partly her pride \u2013 but, mostly because she knows who she is and what her values and priorities are and she\u2019s straight with those \u2013 she really is OK.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Nine months later, in July 1999, Blair flew to DC for a visit, arriving at the White House to find Bill Clinton practicing his putting, and Hillary Clinton lounging by the pool. </p> <p>That evening Blair found the couple in the solarium, with Bill Clinton helping Hillary Clinton with a speech \u2013 trying to make it punchier. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear how much she values his advice and editorial skills,\u201d Blair wrote. When Clinton came back from the event, she thanked her husband for his help.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s second act had begun. She spent her final months as first lady launching her run for the Senate seat in New York. From here on, it would be Hillary Clinton\u2019s ambitions taking center stage, and Bill Clinton offering back-up support.</p> <p>And, the old Arkansas friends said, Bill Clinton was entirely fine with that. The admiration he had for Hillary Clinton all those years before was still alive, they insisted.</p> <p>\u201cThe way he talks about her and the way she talks about him,\u201d said Margaret Whillock, visited the family in Chappaqua when Clinton was in the Senate. \u201cOne time he said Hillary got this great new dress for the Met opening or something like that. He knew those things. He was glad. He was proud of her.\u201d</p> <p>She went on: \u201cYou could just tell.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The European Union is facing an existential crisis, the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, will say on Wednesday, as he announces a raft of economic and security plans in the search for common ground in the wake of the British vote to leave.</p> <p>In his annual state of the union address to the European parliament, Juncker will say commonality between EU member states has never been so low, with governments everywhere quicker to say what they don\u2019t want from Brussels rather than work together.<br></p> <p>The EU executive hopes to find the elusive common ground with a plan to boost the EU\u2019s infrastructure fund by increasing its value to \u20ac500bn (\u00a3425bn).

At least 3,169 people died or went missing in an attempt to reach Europe during the first eight months of the year.<br></p> <p>Juncker\u2019s speech, which was still getting the finishing touches on Tuesday night, comes just two days before EU leaders meet in Bratislava for a summit without Britain, aimed at charting a way forward for the EU after Brexit.<br></p> <p>Neither event is expected to result in detailed discussions on the EU27 strategy for dealing with the UK as it heads towards the EU exit.</p> <p>Juncker will, however, refer to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/30/five-teenage-boys-arrested-after-man-dies-following-attack-in-essex\">the murder of a Polish factory worker</a> in Harlow, Essex, as he speaks out against violence and discrimination.</p> <p>EU officials are increasingly resigned to the likelihood that the UK is unlikely to trigger article 50 in the near future, a fact that causes varying degrees of angst.</p> <p>Martin Schulz, the president of the European parliament, who will meet Theresa May in London next week, called on the British government to trigger article 50 by the end of the year to provide clarity and avoid \u201cweakening\u201d the EU. \u201cTo wait more than a year is completely counter-productive,\u201d he told the Guardian and five continental papers. </p> <p>He dismissed the argument \u2013 advanced by some British government sources \u2013 that it would be better to wait until French and German elections are over, before triggering article 50 in late 2017. </p> <p>\u201cThis is not an acceptable argument. There are always elections in the European Union in some member states.\u201d Waiting until after Germany\u2019s elections in autumn 2017 could mean the UK would still be an EU member during the next round of European elections, throwing up complications for all sides. But the British government is unlikely to be face immediate pressure from other governments to trigger exit talks. </p> <p>In a letter to the 27 governments sent before the meeting, the man organising the summit, European council president, Donald Tusk, said it would be \u201ca fatal error to assume that the negative result in the UK referendum represents a specifically British issue\u201d.</p> <p>He writes that \u201cit is true that the leave campaign was full of false arguments and unacceptable generalisations\u201d, but the Brexit vote was also \u201ca desperate attempt to answer the questions that millions of Europeans ask themselves daily\u201d, citing border control and the fight against terrorism.<br></p> <p>\u201cPeople in Europe want to know if the political elites are capable of restoring control over events and processes which overwhelm, disorientate, and sometimes terrify them. Today many people, not only in the UK, think that being part of the European Union stands in the way of stability and security.\u201d</p> <p>The EU institutions are converging on the idea that Europe needs to concentrate on practical policies; both the nuts and bolts of deepening the single market and extending it to the internet through a digital single market will feature in Juncker\u2019s speech.<br></p> <p>Brussels insiders share frustration that national governments are reluctant to defend EU policies and complain that ministers lack EU knowledge, sometimes unaware when they say \u201csomething must be done\u201d, that a policy already exists, or is being discussed.</p> <p>According to Schulz, too many governments want to cherry pick the bits of the EU they liked, such as generous European funding for poorer regions, while ignoring the bits they don\u2019t. If countries continued to take the advantages without fulfilling their duties, this would end in \u201cdestroying the European Union\u201d he said. </p> <p>In his speech, Juncker will also mount a defence of trade policy, amid ongoing doubts about whether the controversial transatlantic trade deal (TTIP) can ever be agreed, as well as questions over ratifying the EU-Canada trade deal, which was seven years in the making.</p> <p>Tusk echoes this qualified defence of trade deal. \u201cFailing to reach trade agreements ... will inevitably create an impression that Brexit has sparked a process of eliminating us from the global game,\u201d he said.

With the expanded involvement of the private sector, use of innovations like cash transfers, and former aid recipient countries becoming donors themselves, some might say traditional aid is obsolete. </p> <p> It is true that for countries like mine, <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/views/OECDDACAidataglancebyrecipient_new/Recipients?:embed=y&amp;:display_count=yes&amp;:showTabs=y&amp;:toolbar=no?&amp;:showVizHome=no\">foreign aid funds</a> occupy a relatively small portion of our budgets compared with <a href=\"http://www.theafricareport.com/West-Africa/improved-ghana-cocoa-production-leads-to-world-surplus.html\">investments in our oil and cocoa sectors</a>, or the money we raise through taxes; and that self-sufficiency is exactly what we are \u2013 and should be \u2013 aiming for.

The question is whether such success can be replicated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/sep/2016-09-12T14:31:39.html\" data-alt=\"Map of Dosan, Riau province, Sumatra.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/sep/2016-09-12T14:31:39.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Map of Dosan, Riau province, Sumatra.</a> <figcaption>Map of Dosan, Riau province, Sumatra.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Undoing the damage</h2> <p>In 2003, the regional government began a poverty-alleviation programme, giving three hectare plots of land to smallholders \u2013 including those in Dosan \u2013 to plant oil palms. On receipt of the land, the villagers drained the peat to make the land more productive by dissecting it with a labyrinth of canals. And then the land started to burn.</p> <p>Six years later, after a particularly destructive fire ravaged 11 hectares around Dosan, a farmers\u2019 collective known as Cooperative Bungo Tanjung launched a programme to protect peatland, prevent fires and promote better cultivation practices.</p> <p>Most significantly, the programme promotes canal blocking. \u201cWe build the dams to keep the level of the water stable at a minimum of 30cm. At this level, palm oil can grow but it is humid enough to avoid fires,\u201d explains Pak Dahlan, a senior farmer in the village. Although it is relatively simple to build the dams, the 20m Indonesian rupiahs (\u00a31,150) that each costs \u2013 mainly thanks to the price of cement \u2013 is a handicap to scaling up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bf5c64de7d69e7e04f358d902fdd5e0a9f624a92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf5c64de7d69e7e04f358d902fdd5e0a9f624a92/0_8_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Firefighters from community-based firefighter unit Masyarakat Peduli Api\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Firefighters from community-based firefighter unit Masyarakat Peduli Api patrol Dosan at least twice a day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura Villadiego</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe community pays for the dams,\u201d says Dahlan, who adds that the village is trying to raise money to increase the number of dams from 13 to at least 25. As part of their money-raising efforts, the cooperative organises festivals and gatherings where they ask for donations.</p> <p>In addition to the dams, the Dosan smallholders have made a common agreement to stop the practice of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2012/nov/05/up-in-smoke-slash-burn-farming-video\">slash-and-burn</a>. The technique, widely used in Indonesia to clear forest quickly and cheaply, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/nov/11/indonesia-forest-fires-explained-haze-palm-oil-timber-burning\">significantly increases</a> the risk of uncontrolled fires. While slash-and-burn is illegal under Indonesian law, there is an exemption for smallholders which Dosan\u2019s smallholders are urged to ignore.</p> <p>The final core part of the fire-prevention project is the Masyarakat Peduli Api, a community-based firefighter unit funded by the Indonesian government and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) that patrols Dosan several times a day.</p> <h2>Beyond Dosan</h2> <p>In addition to the funding from the government and UNEP, a number of local NGOs are supporting Dosan in its efforts to stop forest fires. Perkumpulan Elang, a conservation and community development NGO in Riau, for example, has provided smallholders with the knowledge to build the dams and keep the water level stable in the peatlands.</p> <p>Other villages are now starting to follow Dosan\u2019s example.

However, while the principle of blocking canals can be replicated, each place has unique requirements so the design of solutions must be adapted to suit local hydrology characteristics, he added.</p> <p>Dosan people know the village and their land inside out, says Prayitno: \u201cCompanies can learn from this. They have to build a mutual relationship with local communities and give them more opportunities to participate in the [palm oil] supply chain.\u201d </p> <p>However, Rachel Carmenta, a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for International Forestry Research, says the current flurry of forest fire prevention schemes in Riau \u2013 both through the government\u2019s Peatland Restoration Agency as well as through communities such as Dosan \u2013 need to take stock of past lessons. \u201cThey are operating largely in the absence of a systematic evidence base\u201d, she says. </p> <p>In addition, evidence suggests the most effective fire management interventions \u2013 such as peatland rewetting \u2013 are also the most controversial, she says, and deploying these \u201cwill therefore require significant negotiation and stakeholder dialogue to bring about consensus, in turn requiring expertise, money and time \u2013 as well as monitoring.\u201d</p>",

Parents pay \u00a32.49 per month per child to use goHenry, following a free two-month trial.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the UK\u2019s first digital banking solution for families that aims to make kids smarter at managing money,\u201d CEO Alex Zivoder says. \u201cWe offer 8- to 18-year-olds a pre-paid Visa debit card and app with unique parental controls. It\u2019s all designed to help young people learn good money habits, while giving parents peace of mind and an easy way to manage pocket money.\u201d </p> <p>Parents pay pocket money on to the goHenry card from their bank account. They can set spending limits and decide where and how the card can be used, for example whether it can be used for online purchases. They can also keep an eye on how their child is spending the cash. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c66fca7f465266a3c50ea295c5e2199aabbe2981\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c66fca7f465266a3c50ea295c5e2199aabbe2981/453_26_623_778/400.jpg\" alt=\"Founder of goHenry\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Zivoder, CEO of goHenry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Tyler Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Cashless society</h2> <p>As Zivoder observes, many children can\u2019t buy things in an increasingly cashless society without borrowing a parent\u2019s card. \u201cAnd often parents have no oversight into this spending, while kids aren\u2019t learning the value of money,\u201d says Zivoder. <br></p> <p>Unlike traditional bank accounts, goHenry was founded by parents and built from the ground up, he says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t just take something for adults and brand it for kids; goHenry was designed specifically for young people and their parents.\u201d <br></p> <p>Children can earn more for completing tasks, while savings goals can be set for things they want to buy. \u201cMoney management is a vital life skill, and the more parents support their kids to know how to manage money, the better. Research suggests that children start forming money habits from the age of seven, whereas parents leave discussing saving until their kids are nine.\u201d<br></p> <p>Zivoder says the future of pocket money is digital. \u201cIn 2015, more than half of UK transactions were cashless. </p> <p>\u201cToday, one in 10 people use their smartphone to check their spending each day.\u201d<br></p> <h2>Parental control</h2> <p>Mother-of-four, Angela Davies, lives with husband Neill in the Hampshire village of Sway. \u201cMy youngest is 14 and two have left home now, but we\u2019ve used goHenry since 2012. Often I\u2019d forget to get cash out for pocket money,\u201d she admits. \u201cMy kids were too young for bank accounts \u2013 and the nearest branch is four miles away anyway.\u201d<br></p> <p>Davies says goHenry has provided a convenient way to make weekly pocket money payments from her bank account on to a goHenry debit card, while setting individual purchase and weekly spending limits. \u201cMy daughter can tag items of clothing \u2013 she loves Jack Wills \u2013 then she can see her pocket money building up until she can afford to buy them.<br></p> <p>\u201cI was also able to list tasks, so they could automatically earn more by doing household chores, such as washing the car. When your kids buy things you get a notification, too. It sounds more Big Brother than I mean it to,\u201d she smiles.</p> <p>However, while it is useful for parents to know how their child is spending their cash, is this level of parental monitoring and control is really necessary? </p> <p>After all, children learn by making mistakes.<em> \u201c</em>Our customers see it differently to controlling their kids,\u201d says Zivoder. \u201cThe rules enable parents to feel confident handing over freedom and independence to their kids to manage money, allowing them to learn by doing it within a safe environment.\u201d</p> <h2>Growth ambitions</h2> <p>Zivoder, a London-based father of two, has worked in e-commerce since 2006 when he launched Expedia in France. \u201cI joined goHenry from lynda.com, an online learning platform sold to LinkedIn for $1.5bn in May 2015. My specialty is scaling consumer web businesses.\u201d <br><br>He says the biggest challenge they have faced is creating the market. Because it\u2019s a new product, parents weren\u2019t necessarily searching for it on Google. However, more than 300,000 people now use goHenry, says Zivoder. <br></p> <h2>Niche focus<br></h2> <p>Warren Mead, banking partner at professional services firm <a href=\"https://home.kpmg.com/uk/en/home.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">KPMG</a>, believes there\u2019s plenty of room for new entrants in niche areas within the UK banking sector. \u201cThe strategy of some startups and small firms is to partner with large banks. Others are taking market share by targeting profitable niche areas, such as specialist lending and international payments. Many are growing quickly as a result. We\u2019ve seen a wave of digital-only and mobile-only banking entrants, but they\u2019re at an early stage, so it\u2019s difficult to assess their success.\u201d<br></p> <p> Mead says a key challenge that startups and smaller firms face in the banking sector is winning customers, because of high levels of inertia. \u201cJust 2% of banking customers switch current accounts each year, while 30% switch their car insurance,\u201d he explains. \u201cSignificant investment is also required, usually, and you must have a genuinely appealing idea, of course. But it can be done, especially if a large organisation backs you.\u201d </p> <p><strong>Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/small-business/\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.</strong></p>",

This has been at the heart of the research work commissioned and funded by the PTES and BHPS.</p> <p>For urban hedgehogs the problems are fairly obvious, but exacerbated by the recently discovered need for them to have a much larger home range that expected. A viable population of hedgehogs requires, in the best possible habitat (imagine a large park with plenty of interconnected gardens surrounding it) at least 90 hectares of unfragmented habitat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/22/hegehogs-disappearing-fast-need-champions\">Hedgehogs are disappearing fast \u2013 gardeners to the rescue | Patrick Barkham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This gets to the heart of the hedgehogs\u2019 problem. Their habitat is fragmented into pieces that are too small to sustain a population. So hedgehogs will still be present, but numbers may be dwindling even as we enjoy their company on a balmy evening.</p> <p>To deal with this <a href=\"http://www.hedgehogstreet.org\">Hedgehog Street</a> was launched. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/22/hegehogs-disappearing-fast-need-champions\">plan is simple</a>: people love having wildlife in their gardens and thrill at the birds, bees, bats and butterflies that make use of the ecologically sensitive planting \u2013 but they forget that not all wildlife has wings. So, we make a hole in the fence (talk to your neighbour first of course) and get them to do the same and on to the next \u2013 spreading hedgehog love along the street.</p> <p>The success has been a delight, 40,000 households are now signed up. And there are bigger projects using the same idea \u2013 in Oxford, Stockport, Chester, Solihull and Ipswich. People are reaching out beyond just their streets and into the wider community.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f07dc7482a89a051f8cd477e4e89d22a6cdedb0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f07dc7482a89a051f8cd477e4e89d22a6cdedb0d/0_279_4496_2698/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hedgehog in garden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Hedgehogs give us all a chance to getting really close, nose-to-nose, with a wild animal.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Bowler/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fences are not the only obstacles, of course. Hedgehogs have a much-mocked relationship with cars and roads \u2013 and it is likely that at least 100,000 are killed each year (probably more than 10% of the population). Keeping hedgehogs off roads is never going to be easy, better that motorists drive at night with a little more care for wildlife.</p> <p>Our rural hedgehogs have been suffering an even more dramatic population decline and here the reasons become a little contentious. There is no escaping the fact that where there are more badgers there are fewer hedgehogs. But as <a href=\"http://www.countryfile.com/blog/hedgehog-decline-are-badgers-blame\">I have argued before</a>, to blame badgers for this state of affairs is ecologically illiterate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/audio/2015/nov/07/hedgehogs-sow-grow-repeat-gardening-podcast\">Hedgehogs: Sow, Grow, Repeat Autumn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Badgers and hedgehogs have coexisted in this country since at least the retreat of the last ice sheet some 10,000 years ago. They are species that compete for the same food \u2013 macroinvertebrates such as worms. What has changed in recent years is industrial agriculture and its massive impact on the amount of this food in the soil, affecting both hedgehogs and badgers alike. Badgers have the advantage in that they can predate hedgehogs. They also create a climate of fear, in effect fragmenting the landscape for the hedgehogs as effectively as a busy road.</p> <p>What can we do for rural hedgehogs? Ensure that there is sufficient food and shelter for them. They are not called hedgehogs on a whim, they really do hog the hedges, and these need to be hedges with enough density to allow them to shelter away from badgers. Food will return to the field margins if farmers can be encouraged to not strip-mine the life out of the land.</p> <p>Hedgehog numbers throughout Britain have declined because of us; because of the way we use and abuse the land. Yet hedgehogs are an important species to us \u2013 we regularly vote it as <a href=\"http://www.discoverwildlife.com/british-wildlife/britains-national-species-revealed\">our favourite animal</a>. But I believe their importance runs deeper.</p> <p>Hedgehogs give us all a chance to getting really close, nose-to-nose, with a wild animal. They have no flight or fight response; they roll into a ball when bothered. So you can wait, quietly, for them to relax. As they do, you get to see their bright beady eyes and just possibly you might open your heart to them a little more. Which is good for all wildlife. Hedgehogs are like a gateway drug for falling in love with the natural world.</p>",

  "<p>Earlier this year, Michael Gove claimed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGgiGtJk7MA\">Britain\u2019s had enough of experts</a>. Now I don\u2019t agree with Gove on much, but when it comes to e-cigarettes, he may have a point. We\u2019re bombarded with stories about these products, but most just add to the confusion, with <a href=\"http://www.ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_891.pdf\">perceptions of vaping risks</a> rising year on year.

So which is it? Why can\u2019t the scientists agree? And will they ever?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cochrane.org/\">Cochrane</a> is a global non-profit group that reviews all the evidence on healthcare interventions and summarises the findings so people making important decisions \u2013 you, your doctor, the people who write medical guidelines \u2013 can use unbiased information to make difficult choices without having to first read every study out there. This week, the latest <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010216.pub3/full\">Cochrane review of e-cigarettes</a> was published. I\u2019m its lead author. While our conclusions are limited because there aren\u2019t many high quality studies available yet, overall the evidence suggests that (1) e-cigarettes with nicotine can help people quit smoking, (2) they don\u2019t seem to have any serious side effects in the short- to mid- term (up to 2 years), and (3) in some cases, switching to them leads to changes in your blood and breath that are consistent with the changes you\u2019d see in people who give up smoking altogether.</p> <p>This is good news. But other systematic reviews and studies have drawn very different conclusions, and I\u2019m going to try to shed some light why that is. </p> <p><strong>Can e-cigarettes help people quit?</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010216.pub3/full\">Our Cochrane review</a> (and others, like <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0122544\">this one published in PloS One</a>) suggest they can. But <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213260015005214\">a review published in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine</a> earlier this year, which received <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/e-cigarettes-dont-help-smokers-quit-study/\">a lot of attention</a>, suggests they actually make it harder. The reason for this difference is the types of studies the authors include. </p> <p>Randomized controlled trials are the best way to see if a treatment works. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/14/bad-science-ben-goldacre-randomised-trials\">Ben Goldacre</a>, author of <em>Bad Science</em>, explains, by randomly assigning people to one intervention or another and measuring the outcome in the same way across both groups, you can rule out alternative explanations for differences between groups. The reviews that find e-cigarettes help people quit smoking only include randomized controlled trials. The studies (like <a href=\"http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/ajph.2014.302482\">this one</a> and <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.28811/full\">this one</a>) that find that e-cigarettes <em>stop </em>people from quitting aren\u2019t randomized controlled trials - instead they survey smokers and ask if they are using e-cigarettes. Then, some months later, they ask the same people if they are still smoking. We don\u2019t know if the results from these studies reflect the effect of vaping, or if something else about the vapers makes it harder for them to quit. For example, it might be reasonable to imagine they are more dependent smokers, which is why they vape as well as using regular cigarettes. This would make quitting harder. </p> <p><strong>Are they safe?</strong></p> <p>The issue here isn\u2019t so much the study type, but the way you ask the question. By \u2018safe,\u2019 do you mean completely without risk? No, they\u2019re not \u2013 not much is. We\u2019ve seen stories about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/feb/26/man-catches-fire-after-e-cigarette-explodes-in-his-pocket-at-petrol-station-video\">people catching fire</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nicotine-e-cigarettes-poisoning-more-pets-4687629\">puppies with nicotine poisoning</a>. Plus, in general, it\u2019s not a great idea to inhale chemicals into your lungs if you can avoid it. Experts basically agree on that \u2013 I\u2019ve yet to come across a tobacco researcher or policy maker who would recommend you start using e-cigarettes if you aren\u2019t already a smoker. </p> <p>The crucial question here is \u2013 safe compared to what? Cigarettes are uniquely deadly. They kill one in two people who use them regularly. So, if you\u2019re asking whether e-cigarettes are safer than regular cigarettes, most experts would, after briefly hesitating, lean on the side of yes. The hesitation is there because e-cigarettes are new to the scene. We don\u2019t know their long-term safety profile, so we have to look for clues elsewhere \u2013 for example, studies that measure side effects of short-term use (<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010216.pub3/full\">results from these are promising</a>) and studies about how e-cigarettes affect your blood, lungs and heart. Interpreting these measures is complicated. For example, <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109716326559\">a recent study</a> found that vaping affects the same blood vessel in your heart as smoking regular cigarettes. This isn\u2019t necessarily surprising \u2013 we know nicotine, the active agent in both, affects this vessel. We also know that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/sifting-the-evidence/2016/mar/09/no-smoking-day-does-a-tobacco-free-world-need-to-be-nicotine-free-e-cigarettes-vaping\">nicotine isn\u2019t responsible for the harms associated with smoking</a>. So how to interpret these results? The gamut of expert reactions ran from <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/29/vaping-as-bad-for-your-heart-as-smoking-cigarettes-study-finds/\">\u201c[e-cigarettes are] far more dangerous than people realise</a>\u201d to \u201c<a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/health/vaping-could-be-as-bad-for-the-heart-as-smoking-scientists-warn-a3331936.html\">vaping carries a fraction of the risk of smoking</a>.\u201d When it comes to long-term safety, experts are making their best guesses in the absence of solid data, and that\u2019s where room for disagreement creeps in.</p> <p><strong>So what\u2019s next?</strong></p> <p>The good news is there\u2019s lots of research going on \u2013 finally. The most recent update of the <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010216.pub3/full\">Cochrane review</a> found 26 studies in the pipeline that will help answer questions about the safety and effect of using e-cigarettes to quit smoking. The more studies we have looking at a question, the more certain we can be about the answer. The irony is that until we have the answer, narrow interpretations of the results of individual studies risk doing further harm, undermining public confidence in science and possibly discouraging quit attempts. Fundamentally, tobacco researchers on both sides of the argument want the same thing \u2013 to reduce death and disease. We\u2019re in the same boat. If you\u2019re reading this as a member of the public, please don\u2019t be put off by the conflicting headlines \u2013 we all agree cigarettes are bad for you, most of us agree vaping is probably <em>much </em>safer than smoking regular cigarettes, and if you\u2019re a smoker we all really want our research to help you to quit. Don\u2019t let us get in the way.</p> <p><em>Jamie Hartmann-Boyce is an author and editor of the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction group, based at the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Radcliffe Observatory Quarter, Oxford, UK.

  "<p>The sun is climbing steadily into a pollution-tinged sky as I wrestle with my vertigo on a wall high above the Thames in London. I am catching the early tide for a spot of mudlarking and the thin metal ladder I am about to descend is the only access to this part of the river\u2019s foreshore. So, at 5.13am, with a tumbling tummy, I swing my legs over the edge and begin my white-knuckle climb down to the foreshore.</p> <p>Following in the footsteps of the original Victorian mudlarks, who picked the foreshore for a living, I am one of a relatively small number of people who search for the historic flotsam and jetsam that emerges every day from the mud of the Thames.</p> <p>For thousands of years human beings have been losing their possessions and dumping their rubbish in the Thames, making it the longest and most varied archeological site in the world. Twice a day the water recedes with the tide to reveal the foreshore. For those in the know, these muddy stretches provide a tangible link with the past and an oasis of calm in a chaotic city.</p> <p>I am not an archeologist or even a treasure hunter, obsessively searching for gold and coins with a metal detector (although I have found both without one). I am a seeker and collector of pieces of human history. My finds sometimes amount to no more than a button, a broken clay pipe or a shard of pottery, but each one is a precious window into past lives lived on and around the capital\u2019s famous river.</p> <p>I am lucky enough to pursue this unusual pastime as a hobby, but in the 19th century mudlarks were forced to the foreshore through need and desperation. At the time, London was the gateway to an empire and the Thames jostled with ships from every corner of the globe. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ccd393a4a8485a34e0fabca4d8b5e6b6381ccce5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ccd393a4a8485a34e0fabca4d8b5e6b6381ccce5/0_209_2420_1452/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From clay pipes to 500-year-old shoes: some of Lara\u2019s finds.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From clay pipes to 500-year-old shoes: some of Lara\u2019s finds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lara Maiklem</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Among this chaos, opportunities opened up for those willing or desperate enough to pursue them. Mudlarks were one such sorry band: children and old people who survived by wading through the foul-smelling mud to collect anything they could sell, such as rags, coal and rope.</p> <p>Mine is a happier tale. I began walking the Thames foreshore almost 20 years ago as a way of finding peace, solitude and sanity in one of the largest cities on earth. It has seen me through the death of my father and the confusion of early parenthood. Its strong, steady flow has calmed my racing mind and the ordinary, and often very personal, things I have found along its banks have taught me something of the fleeting moments that make up a life.</p> <p>Much of the foreshore in central London is covered with building rubble: over 2,000 years of destruction and rebuilding, from Boudicca to the blitz. Ancient fragments of Roman heating systems lie among the Tudor bricks and medieval floor tiles \u2013 sometimes a tile turns up showing the paw print of a long-forgotten dog or cat.</p> <p>Domestic waste \u2013 animal bones and oyster shells \u2013 lie in drifts, testament to London\u2019s appetite over the centuries. Shards of pottery from the vessels in which meals were served and cooked date back to Roman times, and beyond, and among it all are scattered what look like small white sticks. These are the broken stems of clay pipes, disposed of in much the same way as cigarette ends are today. The clue to their age lies in the pipe bowls themselves, which are plentiful in certain parts of the foreshore. Tobacco was brought to England from America in the 1580s and the earliest pipe bowls are tiny because tobacco was rare and expensive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"15c7ece5936c306a2767480a3e258201c6006c13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15c7ece5936c306a2767480a3e258201c6006c13/0_418_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lara mudlarking on the foreshore\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lara searches the foreshore for remnants of the past.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In certain parts of the foreshore the mud literally prickles with thousands of handmade pins. They can be found in such large numbers simply because so many were used, and subsequently lost. They date from medieval times to the industrial revolution, when the process was mechanised. Men would give their wives money to buy their pins, which were used for holding together everything from ruffs and dresses, to baby swaddling and shrouds.</p> <p>Over the years I\u2019ve eased buttons, lace ends, buckles, dress hooks and thimbles from the mud and plucked clay wig curlers, wooden nit combs, needles, beads and bodkins from its surface. I\u2019ve even found a beautifully decorated gold lace end, with possible links to the Tudor court, lying on the mud just waiting to be picked up. </p> <p>But perhaps the most personal objects are leather shoes. The anaerobic properties of Thames mud means that its treasures are cocooned in an oxygen-free environment, which preserves them as if they had been lost just yesterday. My Tudor shoe is a moment trapped in time, with wear creases across the top and indentations in the sole from the toes and heel of the last person to wear it more than 500 years ago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/14/urban-archaeology-historical-finds-city\">Urban archaeology: what historical objects have you found in your city?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Love tokens are also intensely personal finds. It became fashionable in the 17<sup>th</sup> century for young men to bend a silver sixpence for their beloved in lieu of a ring. If she liked him she would keep it, but a good number also ended up in the river. Even modern wedding rings are a fairly regular foreshore finds, which suggests that the Thames is still a willing recipient of broken hearts, dreams, and even the ultimate act of a broken spirit \u2013 suicide. I\u2019ll never forget the young man I saw washed up on the foreshore some months ago.</p> <p>As London wakes up around me and the commuters begin their ant-like march over London Bridge I\u2019m reminded of the unique tranquility of this urban space, which is there for all to enjoy. But with this gift comes responsibility. Thankfully there are <a href=\"http://www. https://www.pla.co.uk/Environment/Metal-Detecting-and-Digging-on-the-Thames-Foreshore\">rules and regulations</a> to protect the foreshore and the heritage it contains. </p> <p>In my opinion there is no need to dig holes in the foreshore, or even use a metal detector; a keen eye and some patience will reveal enough to satisfy most curiosities. Most of what I know about history I have learnt from the foreshore, but more precious than all the beautiful artefacts I have found is the peace and solitude it has given me.</p> <p><em>Lara Maiklem runs <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/LondonMudlark/\">London Mudlark</a>, the largest online mudlarking community. </em><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> to join the discussion</em></p>",
  "<p>British consumers admit that they are confused about exactly what household waste they can recycle, a new poll reveals, with plastic wrapping, mobile phones and disposable coffee cups at the top of their list.</p> <p>Frustrated by what they can and can\u2019t recycle, 63% of householders are puzzled that different councils collect waste in different ways - for example, using different colour bins - while 43% say they are not sure which days to put their bins out. </p> <p>Nearly three-quarters (73%) said they would welcome more transparency about what happens to their waste, according to the survey of 1,500 adults, by waste management company Viridor. It found there was generally low public trust in local authorities which oversee collection facilities.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Dan Cooke, director of external affairs at Viridor, said: \u201cPeople across the UK want to recycle more, and recognise the importance of doing so, but they need better systems and support to ensure the right stuff goes in the right bin every time. </p> <p>\u201cWe believe that greater transparency in the recycling and waste sector is crucial to rebuilding confidence with UK consumers to support them with recycling.\u201d<br></p> <p>The poll revealed that UK consumers believe that in five years\u2019 time up to 64% of household waste can be recycled, compared with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/01/england-urged-to-urgently-improve-stalled-recycling-rates\">current recycling levels of around 44.3%</a> in England. </p> <p>Consumers said they were generally confused about whether they could recycle thin plastic wrapping (56%), mobile phones (52%) and disposable coffee cups (51%) although crisp packets and lightbulbs also ranked highly among their concerns. </p> <p>It <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/18/no-plans-to-tax-coffee-cups-uk-government-says\">emerged earlier this year</a> that only around one in 400 coffee cups are recycled, with the rest sent to landfill. The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37159581\">BBC recently reported</a> on a huge rise in the amount of material put out for recycling being rejected because it is contaminated.</p> <p>The British Retail Consortium, the trade body for UK retailers, said new labelling would help consumers work out what could be recycled and what cannot.</p> <p>\u201cEncouraging householders to put packaging in the right bin is fundamental to maximising recycling and minimising costly contamination\u201d said Lee Marshall, board member of the On-Pack Recycling Label. \u201cThe labels give people the right nudge as they dispose of packaging. Linking local collection services to the labels people see on packaging will help councils increase recycling rates, avoid costly landfill taxes and reduce rejection rates at recycling plants.\u201d</p> <p>Cooke said the UK\u2019s recycling policy remained \u201clargely based on outdated assumptions\u201d and called on the government and local authorities to come up with new and ambitious thinking \u201cthat moves recycling, recovery and resource management closer to the needs of consumers and to a more productive economy.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Local Government Association said: \u201cIn the past decade, councils and residents have worked together to radically increase recycling and divert millions of tonnes of waste from landfill.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is there is widespread confusion over what can and cannot be recycled. If just one non-recyclable item is included with recyclable items, the whole bin is effectively contaminated. Councils then have to re-sort it, which is time consuming and very expensive.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no one-size-fits-all solution to waste collection.

[The data] suggests people are not getting picked up in the way that they should be, earlier on in the process,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The former director of the Prison Reform Trust Juliet Lyon said: \u201cIf you\u2019re thinking about someone that\u2019s got mental health needs, it\u2019s hard to imagine a less conducive environment to getting better than a prison. There\u2019s a tension with what\u2019s currently happening in our prisons: the lack of activity, the shortage of staff, the appalling rise of suicide and self-harm, and violence in prisons. \u201cI think the only way really to effect change is to establish the last resort principle that you use prison as a place of absolute last resort in the justice system.\u201d</p> <p>The father of one man who killed himself in prison said his son had mental health problems and should have been dealt with differently. <br></p> <p>Mark Saunders, 48, a bus driver from Basildon, Essex, said the family had been promised several times that 25-year-old Dean was in a \u201csecure, safe\u201d space before he killed himself in a cell at Chelmsford prison in January.<br></p> <p>The family believe he should have been detained under the Mental Health Act. \u201cI would have given my life to save him,\u201d he said of his son, who was married and had a child. \u201cAnd then you have to hand him over and trust them. And you trust them to continue that care. But they didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Dean Saunders was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after an incident in which he injured relatives who were trying to prevent him from stabbing himself. Mark Saunders, who was among the injured, had not wanted his son to be sent to prison and felt that he needed help.</p> <p>Saunders was initially on constant suicide watch in prison after he told a doctor he planned to kill himself.</p> <p>\u201cHe should not have come off constant watch, he should not have been put in Chelmsford in the first place,\u201d said Mark Saunders. \u201cBut once he was there, they had a duty of care and they had all of that information at hand.\u201d</p> <p>The MoJ said: \u201cEvery day, our healthcare staff provide support to thousands of prisoners at risk of self-harm or suicide, frequently saving lives through timely intervention.</p> <p>\u201cBut we must improve the way mental health problems are dealt with in the criminal justice system. That is why we are investing \u00a31.3bn to transform the prison estate, while also training staff to respond effectively to prisoners experiencing suicidal, self-harm and mental health issues.\u201d</p> <p>According to statistics released by the MoJ, there were 34,586 incidents of self-harm in UK prisons last year, an average of one every 15 minutes. There were 105 apparent \u201cself-inflicted\u201d deaths in prisons in the 12 months to June 2016, an all-time high and a 28% increase on the year before.</p> <p>Andy Bell, the deputy chief executive of the Centre for Mental Health, said there were big pressures on people in the prison system, including \u201cthose working in it and those imprisoned in it\u201d. </p> <p>Bell said a national scheme was being rolled out that aimed to treat people before they entered the criminal justice system.

It does not look like a healthy, natural situation. If that carries on, you end up with just 50% left.\u201d</p> <p>Insects and other invertebrates, which make up 97% of all animal species, are particularly struggling, with 59% in decline since 1970. These provide vital services such as pollination and keep soils healthy, said Eaton: \u201cThe work they do for us is just immense.

A mass of military infrastructure in Virginia is at particular risk of being soaked, with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2014/20141218_sealevelrise.html\">warning</a> that by 2050 a majority of US coastal areas are likely to be threatened by 30 or more days of flooding each year due to \u201cdramatically accelerating impacts from sea level rise\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe conclusions are clear: climate risks are accelerating in their likelihood and severity,\u201d said retired rear admiral David Titley of the US navy. \u201cThe next administration, whomever is elected, has the duty and obligation as commander-in-chief to manage this risk in a comprehensive manner.\u201d</p> <p>Ronald Keys, former commander of Air Combat Command, told the Guardian that he was initially skeptical about climate change but was then convinced by the impacts he saw first hand when returning to Langley air force base in Virginia after an uneventful spell there in the 1980s.</p> <p>\u201cI came in as commander in 2005 and there were north-easters that came through and brought three or four feet of water outside where I was living,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see that change and think \u2018a ha.\u2019 Before, a minor storm was a nuisance, now it is a danger to some of our operations.\u201d</p> <p>Keys said he hoped in a non-presidential election year that \u201ccooler heads may prevail\u201d over the rhetoric used by Trump and others. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to energize people now, but it\u2019s too late when the water is around your ankles,\u201d he said, \u201cPeople can say the temperature hasn\u2019t followed the models but I can read a thermometer and a flood gauge. We need to do this threat analysis now.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Household dust harbours a cocktail of toxic chemicals that have been linked to an increased risk of a range of health hazards, from cancer to problems with fertility, researchers in the US have found.<br></p> <p>The chemicals are shed from a host of common products, from flooring to electrical goods as well as beauty and cleaning products. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe think our homes are a safe haven but unfortunately they are being polluted by toxic chemicals from all our products,\u201d said Veena Singla, co-author of the study from the Natural Resources Defense Council in California. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/27/poison-chemical-health-law-toxic-regulation-harmful-substances\">Seven deadly poisons \u2013\u00a0and a law that won't protect you fast enough</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The scientists cautioned that children were particularly vulnerable to the health effects of contaminated dust as they often play or crawl on the floor and frequently touch their mouths. \u201cThey end up having a lot more exposure to chemicals in dust and they are more vulnerable to toxic effects because their brains and bodies are still developing,\u201d said Singla. </p> <p>Writing in the <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/resources/not-just-dirt-toxic-chemicals-indoor-dust\">Environmental Science and Technology</a> journal, Singla and colleagues described how they analysed 26 peer-reviewed papers, as well as one unpublished dataset, from 1999 onwards to examine the chemical make-up of indoor dust.

  "<p>At her first press conference in the week following that July Saturday night where Malcolm Turnbull stood before the voters ashen faced at the Sofitel, briefly contemplating his own political mortality, enraged at the very prospect of something so divergent from the life plan, Hanson was, reassuringly, the Hanson of old.<br></p> <p>It was like we\u2019d all peeled back the lid of the tin at the back of the cupboard marked 1998 and there she was, perfectly preserved in aspic. Those piercing eyes, cornflower blue. The flaming hair. The quaver in the voice. The righteous jut of the jaw. The stupendous scale of the feelings. The manifest disdain for facts and evidence.</p> <p>Pauline Hanson strode across the grass in Brisbane, spotlight trained on her, rugged up in a brightly coloured winter coat against a Queensland winter little more vengeful than a gentle breeze, ready to be disdained by the working press, a familiar ritual which that only endears the One Nation leader to her rusted-on supporters: plucky Pauline, giving those pricks of journos a good kicking. Go Pauline. You show \u2019em love. The Kimbos and the Himbos deserve everything they get.</p> <p>The Brisbane journalists didn\u2019t hesitate before getting stuck in, ripping her xenophobic, incoherent, noxious manifesto apart, question after question. Pauline Hanson just raised her jaw an inch or two higher and sailed on, a battleship of righteousness, with the flotsam holding on gamely, flapping against the hull. Watching the show back at my desk in Canberra, I had the clear view of the disconnected spectator. Here was Pauline, being pecked relentlessly by a mob of magpies. Like Donald Trump in America, attacks \u2013and that\u2019s what that press conference would look like to a person only glancing up periodically to peruse the show \u2013 are likely to make her stronger.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/10/pauline-hanson-is-back-and-its-still-just-as-hard-to-counter-her-rhetoric-with-facts\">Pauline Hanson is back, and it's still just as hard to counter her rhetoric with facts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Why is this? Understanding that requires referencing the various reasons why she\u2019s back. Hanson\u2019s and One Nation\u2019s success in 2016 is are in part about a double dissolution election (although Pauline\u2019s Hanson\u2019s personal support eclipses that), in part because the popular media has done a superb job of keeping Pauline Hanson in the spotlight as a quasi-political celebrity, partly because she appealed to voters Malcolm Turnbull spent zero time in the campaign talking to \u2013 the people stuck in the old economy with zero prospects of finding themselves recruited by Microsoft.</p> <p>I also think the strength of her showing is also about registering a gesture. She is a totem of the disdain many voters feel for politics as usual. Pauline Hanson is a raised middle digit on the floor of the Australian Senate. If the political class in Canberra rounds collectively on the stranger in its midst, deploys the blunt instruments of gotcha and when did you stop beating your wife, this will only confirm the worst fears of some deeply alienated voters that the system is rigged permanently against the interests of the people, that politics is about elites protecting their own patches. </p> <p>As John Howard noted in early July, treating Hanson as a \u201cscorned species\u201d is a monumental mistake. It expresses disdain for her supporters, who have as much right as anyone else to have their interests represented in parliament, and it ultimately plays into her studied depiction of herself as put-upon outsider, which is the dynamic on which she trades.</p> <p>Understanding Hanson\u2019s context is simple enough. But we face another challenge. The problem is not so much comprehending Pauline. Her shtick is now reasonably familiar. The contemporary problem is how we engage constructively with Hansonism, and by constructively I actually mean deconstructively, which is our core business as journalists: calling out the snake oil, attempting to protect people from being manipulated. </p> <p>Just as strategists have had to evolve their core methodologies as voters have evolved, journalists have to understand that the rules of our game are being rewritten as well. We have to understand that we now practise professionally in a post-truth environment, where increasingly, our audiences can increasingly choose to exist comfortably inside bubbles, selecting only the information and commentary that reinforces their views, rejecting other material.</p> <p>The problem we have in facing up to the more toxic and corrosive elements of Hansonism in 2016 (as opposed to the more orderly times in 1998) is that facts just don\u2019t seem to matter as much as they once did. My innate respect for facts and reason and evidence remained largely intact until I watched the dynamic around Donald Trump play out during America\u2019s gruelling primary season. </p> <p>I watched in horrified fascination from another hemisphere as the collective might of America\u2019s greatest newspapers turned their guns on the nativist king, not with random take-downs, or savage hit jobs, but just with forensic journalism: countering Trump\u2019s inflammatory nonsense with facts, and logic, and careful interrogation\u2014all with no visible impact on Trump\u2019s approval ratings.</p> <p>I know enough of my own eco-system, the world of national affairs that intersects between includes news publications, comments, threads and social media, to know that political conversation increasingly feels like a giant exercise in confirmation bias. A great many people still consume their politics passively and genially, with a healthy dose of scepticism and a genuinely open and enquiring mind, but there is also an increasingly rancorous cohort of political consumers who reject vehemently any information that does not reinforce their existing belief structure. </p> <p>This cohort feels the whole media-political superstructure is lying to them and manipulating them, and countering this belief with exhaustive explanation sometimes only escalates the feelings of rage. More lies. More manipulations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b18edd75160b4e9a10e827d991f024399804d53a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b18edd75160b4e9a10e827d991f024399804d53a/0_129_3884_2331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pauline Hanson and Malcolm Roberts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One Nation\u2019s Pauline Hanson poses for a photo with Malcolm Roberts, number two on her senate ticket, during her election-night function in Ipswich, west of Brisbane, Saturday, 2 July, 2016.

Journalists see ourselves as honest brokers, professional nit-pickers, pursuing the business of fact-checking and accountability, standing as an institutional check on executive overreach. </p> <p>We work ferociously hard, harder than we have ever worked, and for leisure we go to films like Spotlight and feel good about ourselves and our truth-to-power mission. A great chunk of our audience still respects what we do, bless them. But another chunk sees us quite differently. They view the media as being the tame house pets of a busted political system; part of the jig, which that is now well and truly up. </p> <p>Katharine Viner, the editor in chief of the Guardian, captured these developments wonderfully well in a recent essay about how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/12/how-technology-disrupted-the-truth\">technology has disrupted the truth</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now, we are caught in a series of confusing battles between opposing forces: between truth and falsehood, fact and rumour, kindness and cruelty; between the few and the many, the connected and the alienated; between the open platform of the web as its architects envisioned it and the gated enclosures of Facebook and other social networks; between an informed public and a misguided mob.</p> <p>What is common to these struggles\u2014and what makes their resolution an urgent matter\u2014is that they all involve the diminishing status of truth.<strong> </strong>This does not mean that there are no truths. It simply means, as this year has made very clear, that we cannot agree on what those truths are, and when there is no consensus about the truth and no way to achieve it, chaos soon follows.</p> </blockquote> <p>Practising journalism in a post-fact environment is, in a way, more of an existential threat for journalism than technological change. Our whole function in a democracy does rest on an assumption that facts have broad-based currency, that there are shared principles around which societies can coalesce and public interest can be served. To discover that the power of agreed facts is on the wane is, professionally, like losing your moorings. </p> <p>Intuiting the seeming inevitability of the post-fact, post-truth world, is a bit like enduring a head-on collision with the certainty of your own redundancy: what if, structurally, societally, journalism can no longer speak truth to power because no-one cares about us speaking truth to power any more, because no-one trusts us either?</p> <p>For the working journalist (as opposed to the working cypher for an undisclosed agenda, or working propagandist for their employer or their latest political paramour, or the non-working non-caring non-functioning hack), there really is no greater horror, because we know that journalism still matters. We know this, not as some statement of narcissism, as some abstract claim of entitlement, as some crotchety articulation of Paradise Lost, as some undignified foot stamp about our lost influence \u2013 we know it because the working journalist inhabits the same universe that powerful people inhabit.</p> <p>We are not of that universe, but we enjoy privileged sightlines on it, enough to know that lies get told, sometimes monstrous ones, that corruption happens, that self-interest can often trump the greater good and the national interest. We know that the public does needs us to stand vigilant, sometimes as more threat than promise, as a structural check on bad behaviour, not because we deserve that honour, but because we have been conditioned our whole careers to serve the public, and most of us are intent on doing that for as long as someone will fund journalism.</p> <p>I know, for example, that the following statement from Pauline Hanson\u2019s manifesto is a statement unsupported by evidence: \u201cMulticulturalism has failed everywhere. It is negative and divisive, a weight that is drowning our once safe and cohesive society.\u201d I know the proposed prescription for the problem is first, impossible and second, inflammatory, exhibiting the sort of sentiments that have in the grand sweep of history led great powers into destructive conflicts. </p> <p>\u201cOne Nation will abolish multiculturalism and the Racial Discrimination Act and promote assimilation, nationalism, loyalty and pride in being an Australian.\u201d This statement resonates with some people, particularly the losers of globalisation, but if you interrogate it it\u2019s about as meaningful as placing a drive-through order at McDonald\u2019s: could I have the McHappy Meal with a side of jingoism? Could I scapegoat someone else to feel better about myself and my prospects? Could we just send all the foreigners back home?</p> <p>But in order to call out the falsehoods and dissembles and false comforts, we have to be trusted by our audiences, and we have to be self-aware enough to understand that at least some of our audiences now think that most of us are no better than the people we purport to keep honest: that we are all part of the same stinking, creaking, self-referential system that is increasingly cloaked in odium.</p> <p>I\u2019ve reported every federal election since 1996. I\u2019ve never lived through an election cycle where media commentary mattered less than in the 2016 campaign. Neither major-party leader felt any great pressure to subject themselves to rigorous interviews. News Corporation\u2019s Daily Telegraph whipped itself into a frenzy about the evils of Labor day after day, loyally putting down progressivism in all its forms \u2013 and the result of all the histrionics and all the dire predictions of Armageddon from Ray Hadley and his ilk was a positive swing to Labor in the Telegraph heartland in Australia\u2019s most populous state. Take that, Rupert, said the good voters of New South Wales.</p> <p>Part of the declining cultural relevance of the mainstream media is due to forces entirely beyond our control. It\u2019s predominantly technological change, which has allowed consumers to access their own information without the pesky middle-people \u2013 and again, technology, allowing public figures to communicate with voters directly without the media filter. But if we think that\u2019s all it is we are deluding ourselves. We have to look in the mirror. Our intemperate excesses have also discounted our moral value. Our own behaviour has helped fuel a lack of trust, which leads inevitably to an erosion of our core mandate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/19/the-most-depressing-thing-about-pauline-hansons-view-of-muslims-the-facts-no-longer-matter\">The most troubling thing about Pauline Hanson's view of Muslims?

That doesn\u2019t mean white-washing her manifestly intolerable positions. It doesn\u2019t mean excusing her, or launching apologias, or finding reasons why she\u2019s terribly misunderstood: \u201csome of my best friends are Paulines\u201d.</p> <p>It means looking her directly in the eye. It means comprehending her and the voters she represents. It means acknowledging that there are people who vote for Pauline Hanson because they are afraid of the future for entirely rational reasons, because governments have failed to give them hope for the future, and we need to acknowledge that perhaps part of the reason politicians have been insufficiently attentive to the losers is because journalists \u2013 under pressure, battling shrinking newsrooms, unable to get out into the field \u2013 haven\u2019t done enough to tell their stories.</p> <p><strong>This is an edited extract of an essay that appears in the <a href=\"https://www.mup.com.au/items/190003\">spring issue of Meanjin</a>, out 15 September.

After extended remarks intended to refute the scientific consensus on climate change, and a comparison of himself to Socrates, Roberts said that: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>people are waking to the UN destroying our national sovereignty through implementation of the UN\u2019s 1975 Lima declaration and 1992 Rio declaration for 21st century global governance, often known as Agenda 21 \u2013 more recently as Agenda 2030.</p> </blockquote> <p>Roberts said that following the then-Keating government signing the Rio Declaration in 1992, it has been \u201csneakily implemented by ministers of every government since under the guise of biodiversity to steal property rights, sustainability to pass regulations controlling people and climate change to push foreign control using unlawful agreements like the Paris sham\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/14/debunking-malcolm-roberts-the-case-against-a-climate-science-denier\">Debunking Malcolm Roberts: the case against a climate science denier</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For these and other reasons, Roberts wants Australia to leave the UN. </p> <p>What is he talking about? In reality, the<a href=\"http://www.unep.org/documents.multilingual/default.asp?documentid=78&amp;articleid=1163\"> Rio Declaration</a> is an entirely nonbinding and voluntary agreement which 178 countries entered into at the Rio Earth Summit almost a quarter of a century ago. </p> <p>Its aim was to promote a vision of sustainable development by combatting poverty, disease and overpopulation; fostering conservation, atmospheric protection, pollution controls and biodiversity; and by establishing a greater role in all of this for non-state actors like women\u2019s groups, young people, NGOs and business. </p> <p>It also promoted local participation \u2013 many cities and local authorities around the world have signed up to ICLEI \u2013 also known as <a href=\"http://www.iclei.org/\">Local Governments for Sustainability</a> \u2013 which encourages their participation in implementing Agenda 21 initiatives. </p> <p>It\u2019s not a treaty, does not override national sovereignty and does not allow the UN to dictate what governments do. It has no legal force and is not intended to be implemented in a top-down way. </p> <p>Nevertheless, almost as soon as it was inked, Agenda 21 became the focus of conspiracy thinking, which at first mostly came from the far right. </p> <p>The main thrust of most of those conspiracy theories echoes Roberts\u2019s remarks to the Senate: Agenda 21 is in fact a UN plan to deprive nations of their sovereignty, and individuals of their property rights. </p> <p>On the fringes of the right, a benign agreement encouraging social and environmental stewardship became a disguised attempt to impose global communism on free citizens. </p> <p>Tom DeWeese, an American rightwing activist who heads up the American Policy Center, was one of the earliest critics of the agreement, and has remained consistent in his claim that sustainable development is a <a href=\"http://americanpolicy.org/2010/12/01/the-conservative-blind-spot/\">\u201cutopian, socialist nightmare\u201d</a>. </p> <p>Like Roberts, DeWeese wants his country to pull out of the UN, and also cites the erosion of national sovereignty and property rights as the main dangers posed by Agenda 21, which is voluminously attacked on his website. </p> <p>The<a href=\"http://www.jbs.org/issues-pages/stop-agenda-21\"> John Birch Society</a> \u2013 infamous for its decades-long crusade against imagined communist conspiracies \u2013 also played a key early role in pushing the idea that Agenda 21 was communism in another guise. </p> <p>During the late 1990s, the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politicalresearch.org/1997/05/01/extremists-and-the-anti-environmental-lobby-activities-since-oklahoma-city/#sthash.RjLJRZG1.dpbs\">burgeoning militia movement</a> in the US took the view that Agenda 21 was part of a grand plan to institute one world government \u2013 the plan for sustainable development was the first step on a road that would lead to the UN\u2019s black helicopters landing on the White House lawn to dismantle the Republic. </p> <p>This belief has persisted on the armed, radical right \u2013 the Bundy <a href=\"http://usuncut.com/news/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-oregon-militia-takeover/\">occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge last January</a> was driven in part by the idea that local ranchers were being deprived of grazing rights under the aegis of Agenda 21. </p> <p>In recent years, though, paranoia about Agenda 21 has become mainstream via rightwing media stars and politicians. Probably the most important advocate has been Glenn Beck, who has spruiked the conspiracy theory on television and radio. </p> <p>He even authored a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Agenda-21-Glenn-Beck/dp/1476716692\">dystopian science fiction novel</a> which envisaged an America under the yoke of global, environmentalist government. </p> <p>The blurb provides a neat summary of the fear at the heart of anti-Agenda 21 activism: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Just a generation ago, this place was called America. Now, after the worldwide implementation of a UN-led program called Agenda 21, it\u2019s simply known as \u201cthe Republic.\u201d There is no president. No Congress. No Supreme Court. No freedom.</p> </blockquote> <p>As usual, the real danger in far right beliefs is the way in which they cross over into mainstream conservative politics. </p> <p>Mainstream political figures in the US \u2013 among them former presidential candidates <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20130601200607/http://www.tedcruz.org/blog/2012/01/20/stop-agenda-21-the-constitution-should-be-our-only-%E2%80%9Cagenda-%E2%80%9D\">Ted Cruz</a> and <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/11/18/whats-with-newt-gingrich-and-agenda-21/\">Newt Gingrich</a> \u2013 have warned in dark terms about the danger posed by Agenda 21. </p> <p>As the theory caught on among the Republican grassroots in the last decade, several US state houses passed resolutions condemning it, and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/agenda-21-ban-alabama_n_1680565\">Alabama even passed a law</a> specifically aimed at its imagined danger to property rights. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/05/what-you-need-to-know-about-one-nations-malcolm-roberts-and-sovereign-citizens\">What you need to know about One Nation's Malcolm Roberts and \u2018sovereign citizens\u2019 | Jason Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And in Australia, Nick Minchin, a former Howard government minister and mentor to current rightwing powerbroker Cory Bernardi, voiced similar sentiments to the anti-Agenda 21 movement without naming the agreement. </p> <p>On efforts to combat climate change, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/editorial/minchins-climate-conspiracy-20091111-i9wf.html\">Minchin told the ABC\u2019s Four Corners</a> in 2009 that: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the extreme left, it provides the opportunity to do what they have always wanted to do, which is to sort of de-industrialise the western world. The collapse of communism was a disaster for the left and, really, they embraced environment as their new religion.</p> </blockquote> <p>Malcolm Roberts couldn\u2019t have said it better. </p> <p>In general, the debate about climate change in Australia has been poisoned by a belief \u2013 shared by the far right and some mainstream conservatives \u2013 that <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/business-spectator/why-is-climate-change-seen-as-a-communist-plot/news-story/cbc7e85e8563154211b09f11386caa65\">climate science is basically a leftist plot</a>. Roberts continues this tradition. </p> <p>Some will dismiss him as a harmless kook, and point out that One Nation are nowhere near the levers of power. But in a finely balanced Senate, in which Roberts\u2019 beliefs are effectively shared with some members of the Liberal party, it\u2019s not a stretch to think that Roberts will be able to act to prolong delays in this country coming up with an effective response to climate change. </p> <p>The danger of the far right, as always, is in their relationships with ostensibly mainstream actors, and the way in which their conspiracy thinking affects policy. </p>",

  "<p>The election of Malcolm Roberts as a One Nation senator has put Australia\u2019s media in a difficult spot.<br></p> <p>In his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/13/unelected-swill-one-nation-senator-malcolm-roberts-calls-for-australia-to-leave-un\">first speech to Parliament on Tuesday</a>, Roberts made many false claims about climate change. He said that climate change was a \u201cscam\u201d and implied that it was some sort of conspiracy between all the major international research agencies. \u201c ... there is no data proving human use of hydro-carbon fuels affects climate,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Most news outlets had stopped covering the views of climate science deniers in regular reporting. There is a clear scientific consensus that the world is warming and that human carbon emissions have caused it, so reporting the views of a few non-experts who push fanciful theories with no credible evidence is seen as \u201cfalse balance\u201d.</p> <p>But journalists are in a different position when someone in an important office holds such views.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/16/qa-brian-cox-brings-graphs-malcolm-roberts\">Q&amp;A smackdown: Brian Cox brings graphs to grapple with Malcolm Roberts</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Discussing whether the Guardian would publish letters from climate change deniers, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/27/publishing-letters-climate-change-deniers\">readers\u2019 editor wrote in 2013</a>: \u201cSometimes the identity of a person expressing an opinion is as interesting as the thing being expressed. If a member of the royal family wrote a letter denying that climate change exists the Guardian would almost certainly run it.\u201d</p> <p>Some have argued the media should ignore the views of Roberts. But as a senator his views may affect legislation and the terms of the debate that influence it. So those views are newsworthy, particularly in the early part of his term when many Australians will be becoming aware of him for the first time. Guardian Australia will report them when that is warranted on grounds of public policy debate.</p> <p> But to avoid repeatedly having to debunk Roberts\u2019 views, we have produced a handy reference list of his main arguments, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/16/qa-brian-cox-brings-graphs-malcolm-roberts\">as outlined on the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A program on 15 August</a>.

They point to temperatures in 1998 (or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/13/unelected-swill-one-nation-senator-malcolm-roberts-calls-for-australia-to-leave-un\">sometimes a bit earlier</a>) and say they were similar to today\u2019s temperatures. They conclude that therefore global warming has stopped.</p> <p>If you look just at the temperatures in the graph below, ignoring the red trend line which is averaged over longer time periods, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much warming.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4f8d486b734e8fa895310e3fa506096038f71b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4f8d486b734e8fa895310e3fa506096038f71b1/94_41_768_398/500.png\" alt=\"Global surface air and sea surface temperatures between 1998 and 2013\" width=\"500\" height=\"259\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Global surface air and sea surface temperatures between 1998 and 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nasa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>The most obvious thing wrong with this argument is that no climate scientist thinks global warming means temperatures will always increase at the same rate. The climate has many natural sources of \u201cvariability\u201d, which push temperatures up and down over months, years and decades. Superimposed over global warming, that variability can speed up or slow down the warming trend we see.</p> <p>Short periods of slower cooling are expected as a result of weather events such as La Ni\u00f1a.</p> <p>This probably happened between 1998 and about 2013 (although some scientists have controversially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/04/global-warming-hasnt-paused-study-finds\">suggested it may not have happened at all</a>). 1998 was a record hot year, and if you look only at the 15 years that followed, temperatures didn\u2019t increase much. </p> <p>Of course, choosing a record hot year as your starting point is cheating \u2013 just as choosing a record cold year would be. When you zoom out and look at the longer-term picture, there is a clear trend.

In this case, Roberts argues that all the major science organisations around the world have collaborated, manipulating climate data to suppress temperatures in the 30s and 40s, thereby making today\u2019s temperatures look unusual.</p> <p>The weird thing here is that Roberts isn\u2019t even getting the conspiracy theory right. The theory he is thinking of \u2013 which even most climate change deniers now reject \u2013 is not that global temperatures were higher in the 30s and 40s, but that specifically temperatures just in the US were higher than today.</p> <p>Climate scientists used to believe that was the case. Even then, they knew the world as a whole was warming, so the scientific discussion revolved around trying to explain the spatial variation \u2013 why temperatures in the US were different. It was in no way a challenge to the clear observation that global temperatures were rising sharply.</p> <p>The chart below is from a <a href=\"http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/hansen_07/\">paper published in 1999</a> discussing this issue and comparing the known global temperature rises with the understanding of US temperatures at the time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0a9b1cdc4443a531b0e1ac57914249d78a8b72c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0a9b1cdc4443a531b0e1ac57914249d78a8b72c/0_0_725_248/500.jpg\" alt=\"Graphs from a 1999 Nasa paper comparing how scientists then interpreted US temperatures with global temperatures.\" width=\"500\" height=\"171\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graphs from a 1999 Nasa paper comparing how scientists then interpreted US temperatures with global temperatures.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nasa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>The problem was, records going that far back are based on all sorts of measurements that are difficult to compare \u2013 some are taken at different times of day or at different altitudes.

Wahlberg\u2019s family dynamic is briskly yet believably constructed, and we\u2019re spared some of the more cliched moments we\u2019d usually expect in this kind of film. There\u2019s no heavy signposting or emotional goodbye when he sets off for the rig. And once we\u2019re at sea, the dialogue is terse, tense and delivers often complex technical minutiae clearly, without anything feeling as if it has been dumbed down. </p> <p>The film also squarely, and quite rightly, places the blame for the disaster at BP\u2019s door. Without turning them into moustache-twirling villains, we see its representatives callously place profits over potential loss of human life and environmental damage. I can\u2019t recall a film that\u2019s been quite so brave or clear in its untainted bile for one particular company (\u201cmoney-hungry sonsabitches\u201d). </p> <p>When all hell breaks loose, Berg stages the action horribly well, capturing the panic and gruesome mayhem without the film ever feeling exploitative. It\u2019s spectacularly constructed, yet it doesn\u2019t forget about the loss of life, ensuring that, despite thin characterisation, the impact is felt. Sentiment is kept at bay, and it\u2019s only a treacly country song at the end, over an otherwise powerful photographic tribute, that feels a bit clumsy. </p> <p>Wahlberg, again, makes for a solid everyman, and there\u2019s a nice decision, late in the film, to focus on his shock back on land rather than a sugary reunion with his family. Russell and Malkovich riff on types they\u2019ve played before, but with predictable skill, while Jane the Virgin breakout Gina Rodriguez makes the most of a small role as a young worker who calls for help.</p> <p>Deepwater Horizon is a gruelling disaster movie and a reminder of one company\u2019s catastrophic oversights, and it stands as a worthy tribute to the brave men involved.</p>",
