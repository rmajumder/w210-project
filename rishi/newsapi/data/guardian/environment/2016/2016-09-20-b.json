Wada did exactly what it was supposed to do \u2013 which is bring recommendations against Russia \u2013 but one of the stakeholders didn\u2019t like them.\u201d</p> <p>Discussions on the future of anti-doping are expected to take place between the IOC, Wada and other stakeholders at a special Olympic summit on 8 October in Lausanne. Bach has called on IOC members to come forward with ideas.</p> <p>Sir Craig Reedie, the Wada president who is also an IOC member and has come under fire from both sides, said he had repeatedly explained why Wada was not able to do more to tackle the Russian issue earlier and remains hopeful that the body will retain its clout and independence.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any incentive for the IOC to sideline Wada. The IOC doesn\u2019t do any testing, apart from at an Olympic Games. The IOC has expressed a wish that there should be an independent testing unit and we are working on that this week,\u201d Reedie told the Guardian. \u201cWe need to work out whether this should be under the Wada banner or whether it should be a separate organisation \u2013 who will make use of it and who will fund it.\u201d</p> <p>He said that if an independent testing unit was set up, then it would be difficult for Wada to run it without compromising its role as a regulator, though it could play a role in establishing it in the first place.</p> <p>\u201cIf the IOC establishes its own integrity unit, I await information on how that will be structured. I think the IOC are well aware that the other stakeholders in Wada are governments,\u201d Reedie added. \u201cInevitably the organisation would lose its independence, which is absolutely central to its functioning.\u201d</p> <p>The former Wada director general David Howman said recently that while he had long supported the idea of a more wide-ranging integrity unit, he was very concerned about the concept being advocated by some within the IOC.</p> <p>\u201cThis concept of some kind of integrity unit is something I have talked about and supported for a long time, but not in the form the IOC are thought to be advocating,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1041502/exclusive-howman-fearful-of-ioc-plans-for-future-of-anti-doping-amid-criticism-of-russian-response\" title=\"\">the New Zealander told Inside the Games</a>. \u201cFor them it seems to be about retaining control rather than ensuring full independence.\u201d</p> <p>Senior figures within the anti-doping movement are hoping that world governments, which collectively split the $30m annual budget for Wada 50-50 with the IOC, will put pressure on the IOC to maintain its independence. They believe the focus should be on strengthening Wada\u2019s independence, improving its governance and increasing its funding.</p> <p>Reedie, who has previously called for broadcasters and sponsors to invest in the fight against doping, said: \u201cThere are three challenges. Changes in the code are necessary to cover the kind of corruption we\u2019ve faced. We need increasing powers to deal with non-compliance. And we need to look at our own governance and whether after 17 years the structure is still the right one.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/jul/31/ioc-russia-doping-athletes-rio-olympics\">The IOC has failed to protect its honest athletes in the doping scandal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During a wide ranging debate about the future of anti-doping in the midst of the crisis sparked by systemic Russian cheating, serious issues in other parts of the world and whether Wada is fit for purpose, it has also been suggested that the IOC could turn to other organisations to fulfil its functions.</p> <p>The IOC insisted that the ongoing process was designed to result in a more effective anti-doping system. \u201cThe IOC is calling for a more robust and efficient anti-doping system. This requires clear responsibilities, more transparency, more independence and better worldwide harmonisation,\u201d said a spokesman.</p> <p>\u201cThe IOC will continue its push to make doping testing and sanctioning independent from sports organisations.\u201d</p> <p>At the Wada thinktank on Tuesday, the investigative reporter Declan Hill gave a keynote speech warning that Wada\u2019s future was also being threatened by negotiations with the IOC and the Qatari-funded organisation the International Centre for Sports Security (ICSS) about a proposed new agency to be called the Sports Integrity Global Alliance.</p> <p>However Chris Eaton, the executive director of Sport Integrity at the ICSS, insisted that rumours of an IOC and ICSS collaboration were wide of the mark. \u201cBut I do believe we have got to be talking of this in a more selfless way,\u201d he said. \u201cThere needs to be a discussion among all parties about how we preserve the credibility of sport.\u201d</p>",

The UN has insisted there are no forced returns.</p> <p>At a later summit on refugees, hosted by US president Barack Obama, May said another \u00a380m from the aid budget will be aimed at helping migrants, largely Eritreans, stay in Ethiopia through the financial support for the construction of new industrial parks offering 100,000 new jobs, including 30,000 for refugees. </p> <p>This is an expansion of the programme used in Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon to try encourage refugees settle in the region rather than make journeys to European countries.</p> <p>Of the 124,000 refugees who crossed the Mediterranean to Italy between Jan 2016 and 12 Sept, 12% were Eritrean - second only to Nigeria who made up 20% of the numbers crossing.</p> <p>At the Obama summit, May also announced that more of the UK\u2019s aid budget would be spent on humanitarian efforts.</p> <p>A UK official said \u00a31.5bn for the year would be going towards refugees and others in dire need which is an extra 10% uplift from the aid budget. About \u00a32.5m will go to an international fund to help resettle refugees in other countries.</p> <p>However, May unveiled no new commitments for the UK to take in more than the 20,000 vulnerable Syrians who David Cameron agreed to accept by 2020, despite calls from charities and Labour for Britain to do more.</p> <p>Speaking ahead of the summit, May argued it was better to help a greater number of refugees at camps in countries bordering Syria than to resettle a smaller number in the UK. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T21:45:31.822Z\">at 10.45pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e1a41fe4b05714d0da2cba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/patrick-kingsley\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T21:27:07.903Z\">10.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>More from Patrick Kingsley from the leaders\u2019 summit on refugees:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>The US also admitted that the pledges announced on Tuesday include any policy announced since the start of the year, and said that some of the pledges may not strictly fall within the previously stated goals of the summit. \u201cWe took a very broad interpretation,\u201d Ann Richard, the US\u2019s assistant secretary of state, said in an interview with the Guardian. </p> <p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t have to be a formal UNHCR resettlement programme, it could be other legal pathways for admission \u2013 scholarships, work visas or humanitarian visas.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The pledges also include decisions by Turkey and Jordan in January to nominally open their labour markets to Syrians even though many Syrians in both countries are in reality still excluded from legal work.

On Monday, refugee advocates were left disappointed by the announcement of a non-binding declaration that upheld world leaders\u2019 pre-existing responsibilities for refugees, but offered little in terms of direct commitments.</p> <p>But the mood changed on Tuesday, with 18 developed countries announcing plans to increase legal access to refugees, 17 developing countries pledging to increase refugees\u2019 access to education, and 15 claiming that they would take various measures that could help to expand refugees\u2019 access to work.</p> <p>The western countries included those that are well-known for their generosity to refugees, including Germany and Sweden, as well as those, such as Australia, who are often criticised for their treatment of asylum seekers.

Then they have a base from which to go. They have a welcome, rather than having refugees come in uninvited or illegally or alone.\u201d</p> <p>Australia launched a pilot of the program in 2013 and a similar initiative is being planned in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Germany and Switzerland have both experimented with the idea while Spain and Japan are among the countries who have expressed interest in the program.</p> <p>Canada will now work with the UN High Commission for Refugees and Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations to create training modules based on an analysis of the Canadian model as well as provide technical assistance to countries interested in adopting the program, said McCallum. </p> <p>Private sponsorship was launched in Canada after the Vietnam war and has since brought in more than 275,000 refugees, including nearly 9,000 Syrian refugees, in addition to those brought in by government programs. Studies suggest the support of private citizens facilitates the settlement process, with privately-sponsored refugees reporting more success and integration than their government-sponsored counterparts.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e16d41e4b05714d0da2b89\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T17:13:39.006Z\">6.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>An interesting spot on Twitter by the New York Times\u2019 UN correspondent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SominiSengupta\">Somini Sengupta</a>: the Russian foreign ministry tweeted that, held up by US president Obama\u2019s motorcade, <strong>Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov got out and walked the rest of the way to the General Assembly</strong>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mfa_russia/status/778242365962215424\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Manhattan traffic was blocked because of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarackObama\">@BarackObama</a> motorcade. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Lavrov?src=hash\">#Lavrov</a> decided not to wait in traffic jam &amp; headed to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UN\">@UN</a> by walking <a href=\"https://t.co/L4XVBsvU1d\">pic.twitter.com/L4XVBsvU1d</a></p>&mdash; MFA Russia (@mfa_russia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mfa_russia/status/778242365962215424\">September 20, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e16a5ae4b05714d0da2b7b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T17:02:11.067Z\">6.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hollande continues:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No county can say that it is immune to the threat of Islamic terrorism, which has claimed lost individuals within our countries and radicalised them. </p> <p>No wall can stop ... this scourge.

  "<p>More than \u00a3100m of the UK aid budget will be spent on returning Somali refugees to the country they fled and encouraging people escaping war zones not to cross the Mediterranean under plans outlined by Theresa May in New York.</p> <p>The prime minister used her maiden speech at the United Nations to expand on proposals aimed at stopping \u201cmass uncontrolled population movement\u201d, which has seen refugees travelling long distances in search of better lives. Her plans attracted criticism earlier in the summit over the suggestion that those fleeing war zones should stay and claim asylum in the first safe country they reach, rather than seeking sanctuary in European nations such as Britain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jun/20/one-in-every-113-people-uprooted-war-persecution-says-un-refugee-agency\">One in every 113 people forced to flee, says UN refugee agency</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, May pressed on with the argument on Tuesday in an address to the general assembly, as she focused on actions in north Africa to stop migrants crossing the Mediterranean.</p> <p>In her speech, May said Britain would send more troops to Somalia to help train local troops to combat the al-Shabaab militant group, including up to 30 teams of between five and 30 personnel with no more than 70 in the country at any one time.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK is now going to increase further our security support and we will be calling on others to do the same, hosting an international conference on Somalia in 2017 to maintain this vital momentum,\u201d the prime minister said.</p> <p>While acknowledging Somalia is facing serious security problems, the government is also contributing \u00a320m from the aid budget to encourage refugees who fled the country to return home from the Dadaab camp in Kenya.</p> <p>\u201cWe will invest \u00a316m in Somalia to help do things around food, education, shelter and sustainable livelihoods and then \u00a34m to Kenya to help support the process of returning these people,\u201d a UK official said.</p> <p>The process has recently been criticised by the Human Rights Watch group, which said the return of the refugees from Kenya to Somalia cannot be considered voluntary as the Dadaab camp is at risk of being shut down. The UN has insisted there are no forced returns.</p> <p>At a later summit on refugees, hosted by the US president, Barack Obama, May said another \u00a380m from the aid budget will be aimed at helping migrants, largely Eritreans, stay in Ethiopia through the financial support for the construction of new industrial parks offering 100,000 new jobs, including 30,000 for refugees.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/19/raped-imprisoned-beaten-migrants-reveal-perilous-journeys-europe-united-nations-general-assembly\">Raped, imprisoned, beaten: migrants reveal their perilous journeys to Europe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is an expansion of the programme used in Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon to try to encourage refugees to settle in the region rather than make journeys to European countries.</p> <p>Of the 124,000 refugees who crossed the Mediterranean to Italy between January and September this year, 12% were Eritrean \u2013 second only to Nigerians who made up 20% of the numbers crossing.</p> <p>At the Obama summit, May also announced that more of the UK\u2019s aid budget would be spent on humanitarian efforts.</p> <p>A UK official said \u00a31.5bn for the year would be going towards refugees and others in dire need, which is an increase of 10% on the aid budget. About \u00a32.5m will go to an international fund to help resettle refugees in other countries.</p> <p>However, May unveiled no new commitments for the UK to take in more than the 20,000 vulnerable Syrians who David Cameron agreed to accept by 2020, despite calls from charities and Labour for Britain to do more.</p> <p>Speaking before the summit, May argued it was better to help a greater number of refugees at camps in countries bordering Syria than to resettle a smaller number in the UK.<br><br></p>",

Just ask the players who did go. It was a game-changer in their minds.\u201d</p> <p>A decision on golf\u2019s future is expected before the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. \u201cWe can expect mammoth galleries in Japan,\u201d Finchem said. \u201cWe played the World Cup there in 2001, and if you just look at the footage, thousands and thousands and thousands of people came out.

CFO, which traded under brand names Payday First, Money Resolve and Flexible First, will have to hand money back to nearly 100,000 victims of its unfair practices. </p> <p>Citizens Advice said complaints about payday loans have <a href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/Global/CitizensAdvice/Debt%20and%20Money%20Publications/For%20publication%20-%20Part1-Overviewofthetrendsinthepaydaymarketreport.pdf\">collapsed by 86% </a>between 2013 and 2016. But campaigners warn that the industry is reinventing itself with still \u201ceye-watering\u201d interest rates on three-month loans aimed at people earning less than \u00a320,000 a year on insecure work contracts. </p> <p>The regulatory assault on payday lending, which began in earnest in summer 2014, has forced more than 1,400 companies out of the industry, while those that survive are nursing large losses.</p> <p>Wonga, easily the biggest player in the market, was forced to write off \u00a3220m of loans in October 2014, while the second biggest, Dollar Financial (owners of The Money Shop), was ordered to refund \u00a315.4m in the same month to 147,000 customers after regulators found it was lending more to borrowers than they could afford to repay.</p> <p>Earlier this year, another big player, Cash Genie, went into liquidation after being hit by a \u00a320m compensation bill. \u201cApproximately 38% of the 2013 market participants have left the market and therefore can no longer mistreat consumers,\u201d said Citizens Advice in a review of payday lending earlier this year. </p> <p>Crucially the regulators introduced a cap on interest rates in January 2015 and stamped down on companies raiding bank accounts several times to grab money on pay day. The measures have sent loan numbers tumbling. </p> <p>The industry\u2019s peak years were 2012-13, when around 10m to 12m payday loans a year, worth nearly \u00a34bn, were being taken out. </p> <p>But after rates were capped, the number of loans made by payday companies fell from 6.3m in the first half of 2013 to just 1.8m in the first half of 2015, according to the Financial Conduct Authority.<br></p> <p>Carl Packman, who has researched payday lenders for the poverty charity Toynbee Hall, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not really the case of the rise and fall of the payday lenders. It\u2019s the rise, a hiccup and probably another rise to come. They are shifting to slightly longer two or three-month loans, which are still extortionately priced. The fact they have been able to pay these fines shows they are not just scraping by. There is still a lot of money going through their books.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3cce6428fe257aecd8a27075a661a7d268dbc468\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cce6428fe257aecd8a27075a661a7d268dbc468/0_32_3499_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Hall/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-confirms-price-cap-rules-payday-lenders\">rate cap</a> limits interest to 0.8% a day and no one can repay more than 100% of what they initially borrowed. But even under the new rules, the annualised rate of interest that Wonga charges on a \u00a3100 loan is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/16/wonga-cuts-cost-borrowing-interest-rate\">1,509%</a> \u2013 although that\u2019s down from its 5,853% peak.</p> <p>The Money Shop, whose chain of high street outlets has more then halved from its once 500-strong network to just 230, charges an annualised rate of 709% on a \u00a3250 loan repaid over four months. It said it is modernising its stores and expanding some of them. </p> <p>But what has happened to the desperate borrowers once hooked on short-term loans? There is little evidence, yet, that legal doorstep lenders such as Provident Financial have picked up much of the business, or that illegal loan sharks have flourished. </p> <p>Some people have simply stopped borrowing, said Packman, but others have gone into deeper arrears on rent and utility bills. He points to a steep rise in bailiff orders by councils in recent years. </p> <p>Sara Williams, a Citizens Advice adviser, says other forms of high cost credit such as \u201clogbook loans\u201d (money secured against the borrower\u2019s car), guarantor loans and doorstep lending can be just as problematic for the borrower. \u201cThe worst excesses of the payday loan industry have gone\u201d, she said, \u201cbut checks on a borrower\u2019s ability to repay are in some cases still inadequate as recent Citizens Advice research shows.\u201d Her blog site, <a href=\"http://debtcamel.co.uk/payday-loan-refunds/\">Debt Camel</a>, helps victims of payday lending obtain refunds, without having to go through a claims management firm. Some people who have borrowed every month for years have recovered thousands in interest paid.</p> <p>The trail of misery left by the payday lending boom is showing up in complaints to the financial ombudsman. Earlier this month it said that WDFC, the parent group of Wonga, was the subject of 821 complaints, up from 361 in the same period of 2015, while Instant Cash Loans received 285 complaints.</p> <p>The industry insists it has reformed. Russell Hamblin-Boone, of the Consumer Finance Association, which represents around 75% of payday lending firms (although not Wonga), said: \u201cThe payday market is unrecognisable today from a few years ago. There are no rollovers, no cold-calling, no aggressive collection tactics and stringent customer affordability checks. Short-term lending now stands as a viable alternative to the mainstream credit market.\u201d</p> <h2>Payday loans - a timeline</h2> <p><strong>2006</strong> Payday loans first made their presence felt in the UK. They were developed and marketed as one-off loans for unexpected expenses or luxury items but in reality were mainly used to fund everyday expenses such as groceries, bills and the costs associated with owning a car, according to the charity Citizens Advice. In 2006 a total of \u00a3330m was lent to individuals \u2013 but over the next few years the industry enjoyed explosive growth.</p> <p><strong>2007</strong> Wonga launched in the UK and within a few years had become the sector\u2019s best-known name, helped by a blizzard of advertising, including several football-club shirt deals.</p> <p><strong>2009</strong> The total amount lent in the UK by payday lenders reached \u00a31.2bn.</p> <p><strong>2010-11</strong> Anger starts to build against \u201clegal loan sharks\u201d with Stella Creasy, a Labour MP, leading the charge. \u201cCompanies like Wonga are taking advantage of a perfect storm in consumer credit, where more and more people are struggling as the cost of living soars and mainstream banks withdraw from the market,\u201d she said.</p> <p><strong>2012-13</strong> The industry\u2019s peak years, when 10m to 12m payday loans a year were being taken out. In 2012 the amount lent hit \u00a33.7bn \u2013 more than 10 times the figure in 2006 \u2013 and in 2013 it stood at \u00a32.5bn. In June 2013 Wonga raised the standard interest rate quoted on its website from 4,214% to 5,853% APR. The following month it emerged that the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, had told Wonga that the Church of England wanted to \u201ccompete\u201d it out of existence as part of its plans to expand credit unions. But in September 2013 Wonga revealed that during 2012 it handed out nearly four million loans worth a total of \u00a31.2bn to one million customers.</p> <p><strong>2014</strong> An annus horribilis for Wonga and the industry. In May the City regulator laid into some companies\u2019 misleading adverts and in June Wonga was ordered to pay more than \u00a32.6m compensation after it was found to have sent threatening letters to customers from fake law firms. The following month the company axed the controversial cuddly puppets used in its TV adverts. Also in July the City regulator proposed a shake-up of the industry, The Money Shop agreed to hand back more than \u00a3700,000 to customers after it admitted breaking its own rules and Cash Genie said it may have to compensate customers after uncovering a string of problems. In October Wonga was forced to write off \u00a3220m of loans to 375,000 borrowers.</p> <p><strong>2015</strong> In January price caps on payday lenders took effect. Interest and fees on all high-cost short-term credit loans were capped at a daily rate of 0.8% of the amount borrowed. If loans are not paid on time, default charges must not exceed \u00a315. In addition the total cost including fees and interest is capped at 100% of the original sum. The caps mean someone borrowing \u00a3100 for 30 days and paying it back on time will pay no more than \u00a324 in fees and charges. In May Wonga relaunched itself with new TV adverts aimed at a more middle-class audience. In October Dollar Financial UK, with brands including The Money Shop, was ordered by regulators to refund \u00a315.4m to 147,000 customers. And in November it emerged that QuickQuid and Pounds to Pocket were to write off more than 2,500 loans to customers and refund almost 1,500 people following regulatory action.</p> <p><strong>2016</strong> In January it emerged that Cash Genie had gone into liquidation. In May Wonga said it saw its losses more than double in 2015: it reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a380.2m for the year. In July Google started banning some payday loan adverts and said that in the US it was outlawing ads for loans with an APR of 36% or higher. This week payday firm CFO Lending said it had agreed to pay more than \u00a334m in redress to more than 97,000 customers for unfair practices.</p>",

In 1994, McBurney was given a copy of Petru Popescu\u2019s 1991 book <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/books/the-encounter-amazon-beaming-review/\">Amazon Beaming</a> by his fellow director Annie Castledine. The book is based on a real-life encounter between an American photographer, Loren McIntyre, and an Amazonian tribe called the Mats\u00e9s or Mayoruna. Elusive and little studied by anthropologists, the Mayoruna are known as the \u201ccat people\u201d for their practice of inserting thin wooden spikes into their noses in imitation of jaguars; adding to the mystery, the tribal chief seems to have been able to communicate with McIntyre telepathically. The photographer related these facts to the rescuer who found him six weeks later floating in a canoe, starving and half-naked; the other tales he told were even more unfathomable. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f92e3642e3efa61c372e59a6b6fdf329e0cefe8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f92e3642e3efa61c372e59a6b6fdf329e0cefe8e/0_0_3752_2716/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cesar Sarachu, Tim McMullan, Clive Mendus and Paul Rhys in The Master and Margarita by Complicite/Simon McBurney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"724\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cesar Sarachu, Tim McMullan, Clive Mendus and Paul Rhys in The Master and Margarita by Complicite/Simon McBurney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to McBurney\u2019s long-term producer <a href=\"http://www.ideastap.com/IdeasMag/the-knowledge/judith-dimant-producing-complicite\">Judith Dimant</a>, it took the director the best part of two decades to work out how to render Amazon Beaming theatrically. \u201cWhen he\u2019s making work, he often does it very slowly; it can be very painful. He read the book, knew it interested him, but it took us a while to work it out. He first wanted to do it as a piece for 20 people wearing headphones, but by the time we finished, it was 600.\u201d She laughs. \u201cI still can\u2019t quite believe he\u2019s taking it to Broadway.\u201d</p> <p>Toni Racklin, head of theatre at the Barbican arts centre in London, who co-produced The Encounter, says even she is often taken aback by McBurney\u2019s imagination. \u201cWho would have thought that a show about maths would work? Or that you could do an adaptation of The Master and Margarita? What\u2019s fascinating is Simon\u2019s ability to turn a book or an idea into something extraordinarily theatrical. He works very closely with amazing scientists and mathematicians, he travels and does his research, but all it\u2019s in his head. What comes out is very deep and meaningful.\u201d</p> <p>Many have traced these polymathic tendencies back to McBurney\u2019s childhood. Born in Cambridge in 1957 to the hugely respected American archeologist <a href=\"http://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/research/laboratories/mcburney\">Charles McBurney</a>, who taught at the university, and his wife Anne, a secretary, McBurney grew up in a highly intellectual and creative environment. Anne in particular was keen to nurture her children\u2019s creative tendencies, and <a href=\"http://cso.org/about/performers/chicago-symphony-orchestra/gerard-mcburney/\">Simon\u2019s older brother Gerard became a composer</a>. Simon stayed in Cambridge to study, graduating in English literature from the university\u2019s oldest college, Peterhouse, in 1980, before taking an unexpected leap \u2013 across the Channel to Paris, in order to join the Jacques Lecoq school.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9ff3f2b180c7abe851649d91d71a298b8612473\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9ff3f2b180c7abe851649d91d71a298b8612473/0_0_4008_2835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ambur Braid (Queen Of The Night) and Lucy Crowe (Pamina) in McBurney\u2019s production of The Magic Flute.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"707\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ambur Braid and Lucy Crowe in McBurney\u2019s production of The Magic Flute.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.ecole-jacqueslecoq.com/en\">Lecoq</a>, with is emphasis on physical theatre, mime and mask work, was enormously influential as McBurney\u2019s style developed, suggests director Ian Rickson. The pair worked together on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/sep/30/mark-rylance-complicite-beckett-endgame\">a 2009 staging of Beckett\u2019s Endgame</a>, which McBurney was originally scheduled to direct, but \u2013 true to multitasking form \u2013 ended up starring in, alongside Mark Rylance. If there\u2019s a way of labelling McBurney, Rickson suggests, it\u2019s with a word sometimes sneered at in Britain and America \u2013 auteur. \u201cIt\u2019s very different tradition, the European one. You devise things collaboratively, you work through play: there\u2019s a lot of openness. In Britain, we tend to think the playwright is the creative artist and the director\u2019s job is to serve the text. Simon approaches it completely differently.\u201d</p> <p>In 1983, McBurney came together with fellow theatre-makers Marcello Magni and Annabel Arden to found a company originally called <a href=\"http://www.complicite.org\">Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Complicit\u00e9</a>. As well as paying homage to their French roots, the name hinted at the collaborative, semi-illicit nature of the work they wanted to make. (These days the company is simply known as Complicite, pronounced like the English word \u201ccomplicity\u201d.) </p> <p>Early shows celebrated that rough-edges aesthetic, notably a four-handed skit on the English seaside called Put It on Your Head, <a href=\"http://ericawagner.co.uk/676/\">which McBurney described</a> as \u201cpart idiocy, part pantomime, part commedia dell\u2019arte\u201d. In 1985 they won \u2013 to many people\u2019s surprise \u2013 the Edinburgh fringe\u2019s Perrier award, more usually awarded to standup comedians. But over the years Complicite shows have become highly stylised pieces of performance art, using cutting-edge technology like projected video and digital animation long before they became de rigueur. The means are hugely complex technically, even if the story they relate is simple. Paradoxically, that simplicity gives Complicite shows their rich interpretative texture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de2d6f8184446b01e1aec1c9ef6517a985b4fc15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de2d6f8184446b01e1aec1c9ef6517a985b4fc15/0_8_2178_1306/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from Mnemonic, a meditation on the act of memory\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from Mnemonic, a meditation on the act of memory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Devlin remembers being in the audience for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/jan/01/theatre.artsfeatures\">1999\u2019s Mnemonic</a>, a meditation on the act of memory that combined hi-tech sound design, music, lighting, video and projection to mesmerising effect. Even so, she recalls, the show commenced with a centuries-old trick \u2013 a disappearing gag. \u201cOn our chairs were a blindfold and a leaf. Simon came out on stage, looking like a dishevelled stand-up comedian, and told us to put the blindfold on, then pick up the leaf and feel its veins; the idea was to think about genealogy and family trees. And then when we removed them of course the set had changed to something completely different, and even though he\u2019d carried on talking all that time, Simon was suddenly nowhere to be seen. It was so simple, but stunning.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone I talk to emphasises McBurney\u2019s collaborative approach, a Tiggerish enthusiasm to get everyone involved in the process of developing a show. Says Rickson: \u201cHe\u2019ll listen to a stage manager, to an actor, to a fellow director, a musician. It all goes into the melting pot.\u201d </p> <p>This might not always be strategic, Dimant concedes: \u201cIf he\u2019s directing something, sometimes he complains that everyone seems to think he knows what he\u2019s doing, and he doesn\u2019t. He claims to be making it up as he goes along.\u201d Does that sometimes make for difficulties? There is a diplomatic pause. \u201cHe tends to leave things to the last minute, until he really has to decide something; he likes going up to the wire. Not everyone can handle that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89624cbbbb74e647d0451a3fbd9bacd0521de1f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89624cbbbb74e647d0451a3fbd9bacd0521de1f1/0_936_3349_2008/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cast of Rev, with McBurney on the right.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cast of Rev, with McBurney on the right.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite the high-minded rigour of his own work, McBurney isn\u2019t allergic to pop culture. In addition to his appearances on stage, he has lent his idiosyncratic screen presence \u2013 somewhere between whimsical professor and deviant arch-villain \u2013 to projects as varied as the easygoing BBC sitcom Rev (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teosebTsBSc\">where he was effortlessly sardonic as a careerist bishop</a>) and the 2011 film Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. Not many Lecoq-trained experimental theatre-makers have made cameos in Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation. McBurney has.</p> <p>The fees no doubt help, but he gives every impression of relishing these gigs, says Dimant. \u201cStraight after doing a first run of The Encounter, Simon disappeared off to film [horror movie] <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/06/16/the-conjuring-2-review-this-very-british-haunting-is-too-slick-t/.\">The Conjuring 2</a>. He enjoys just doing the acting, not having to think about anything but that. He kept sending us these pictures of himself wearing a moustache. He was having a whale of a time.\u201d</p> <p>In 2007, he bumped into the concert pianist <a href=\"http://cassieyukawamusic.tumblr.com\">Cassie Yukawa</a> (\u201cthe wisest, most humane person I know\u201d, says Devlin) in the street after a show; the two got married and now have three children. Although McBurney has a strong vein of nomadic restlessness \u2013 numerous people testify that trying to get hold of him when you really need him, let alone pin down which continent he\u2019s on, is a challenge \u2013 many people agree that having a home life has added much-needed stability to his life. In 2012, interviewed for BBC Radio 4\u2019s Desert Island Discs, he said if he had to be cast away for ever, he would want to bring along a pillow imbued with the \u201csmell of my family\u201d. His oldest daughter, Noma, even makes it into The Encounter, when we hear her attempts to interrupt McBurney\u2019s reading of Amazon Beaming. Over time, the bedtime story he reads her becomes braided with the infinitely stranger events of the rainforest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81b244a9fa76e591292a299f23c0484e88f1a9e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81b244a9fa76e591292a299f23c0484e88f1a9e7/0_311_4748_2848/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Close enounters of the weird kind: McBurney in The Encounter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Close encounters of the weird kind: McBurney in The Encounter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For McBurney, everything seems to be material, or at least contain the possibility of becoming material; and as time has passed, his work has become more personal. \u201cThe Encounter is very much about the state of world, what the shape of the future will be, environmentalism, and I think that\u2019s very informed by his children,\u201d says Dimant. Devlin agrees: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing about his life that doesn\u2019t fit to the work he\u2019s doing. It\u2019s all connected.\u201d</p> <p>Which raises the question: what on earth does McBurney do when he\u2019s not working? Racklin praises his cooking. Music is yet another obsession, as anyone who listened to the marvellously esoteric playlist he brought along to the BBC\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01kr7q1\">Desert Island Discs</a> \u2013 Gil Scot-Heron to Schnittke, Frank Zappa to Shostakovich \u2013 can testify.

The offer of moving on would easily beat the offer of turning back the clock.</p> <p>Electoral defeat evacuates stores of political capital, and Europhiles have to consider whether they want to spend their pennies on the sourest political grapes in the shop.

Former business secretary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/19/lib-dem-split-emerges-over-policy-of-seeking-second-eu-referendum\">Vince Cable voiced his concern</a> at the conference. Even Tim Farron\u2019s allies concede that the prospect of a second referendum is of value largely as a rhetorical symbol of dissent.</p> <p>There is tactical logic here: 48% of voters rejected Brexit \u2013 six times more than the Lib Dems attract. Millions of pro-Europeans are poorly represented. Labour is busy broadcasting a political colonoscopy, offering voters a tour of its internal pathologies.

Thousands joined after the referendum, and not because they were relaxed about the outcome. This is a party whose activists drape a giant blue and gold EU flag across the dancefloor at their conference disco. Debate on a second plebscite aired doubts, but defiance was the theme. Didn\u2019t Nigel Farage say that if the result were close, there should be a rerun? Wasn\u2019t the leave proposition criminally mis-sold \u2013 fictional millions for the NHS; imminent Turkish invasion?

Many Brexiters were hoping for an electoral martyrdom along those lines. They pace nervily around their unexpected trophy, which turns out to be tarnished with a duty to deliver the impossible.But in Scotland, it was the status quo (or a close variant) that won. It was easy to present the result as a stage in the spread of nationalist consciousness, with contagion to the rest of the country just a matter of time. In the vote on Britain\u2019s EU membership, the status quo was sentenced to death. Even if it could be shown that millions of leave voters were wracked with buyers\u2019 remorse (it can\u2019t), the union they might rejoin will never be the one they asked to quit.</p> <p>The referendum is already altering Europe\u2019s political geometry. The shock of British rejection is changing debates around integration and immigration. Next spring, Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right Front National, will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/nation-state-marine-le-pen-global-mood-france-brexit-trump-front-national\">almost certainly make it into the final round</a> of a French presidential election.

Nationalist and populist movements are thriving across Europe. Governments in Poland and Hungary are developing anti-liberal doctrines on a model borrowed from Vladimir Putin. To Europe\u2019s radical right, 23 June was a provocation and an inspiration \u2013 an incitement to slash harder at the ties of continental solidarity. The idea that moderate leaders in Paris or Berlin will sit with their engines idling while Britain ponders whether to join the convoy and at what speed is delusional.</p> <p>No one is more in denial about this than the Tory Brexiteers who skim over the detail of their mission as if leafing through the brochure for a pleasure cruise around the Commonwealthtoasting free trade deals on a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/20/brexit-weekly-briefing-buckle-up-a-nasty-divorce-looks-inevitable\">recommissioned Britannia</a>.

Many resent the burden of political maturity that comes with getting their way. They keep in their pockets the card showing May\u2019s quiet support for remain, ready to play it with a flourish when her first compromise with reality can be cast as betrayal. But it is hard for pro-Europeans to denounce that game while drenched in nostalgia, when the argument sounds like a plan to build a time-machine and return to the late 90s, back to the days when Brussels-phobia was but a yolk-stain on the tie of unelectable Tory reaction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/20/brexit-weekly-briefing-buckle-up-a-nasty-divorce-looks-inevitable\">Brexit weekly briefing: buckle up \u2013 a nasty divorce looks inevitable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lib Dems insist that their position is more nuanced than that, but nuance hasn\u2019t exactly been flying off the shelves in the retail end of British politics recently. A position that lends itself to caricature as contempt for the will of the people will be cast that way.</p> <p>Britain needs a liberal promise of engagement with Europe that absorbs the result of the referendum, and European liberals need British partners who will engage with their dilemmas on post-referendum terms. I understand why Farron is not ready to plunge his party into that mission without first underlining its anti-Brexit credentials. The Lib Dems are enfeebled, trying to build polling bulk. Undiluted remania is the only available political protein. Building a platform from which pro-Europeans can launch a bid to shape the future \u2013one to rival the flimsy, retrograde prospectus of the militant sceptics is not a task that a shrunken liberal party can easily undertake alone.

He mentioned Russia only fleetingly, suggesting that in a post-imperial era, Moscow was \u201cattempting to recover lost glory through force\u201d. </p> <p> He did not name his Russian counterpart and one of the world\u2019s \u201cstrongmen\u201d, Vladimir Putin, nor did he mention Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee who has spoken in favour of Putin\u2019s style of leadership.

The government boasts that car use is rising again, after being knocked back by the recession. It is spending \u00a39bn of our scarce money on roads every year, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/514912/road-use-statistics.pdf\">70% of which is on new capacity</a>. Thanks to the cuts, bus services supported by local authorities <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/485296/annual-bus-statistics-year-ending-march-2015.pdf\">reduced their mileage by 10% last year</a>.</p> <p>Over half the car journeys people make in this country are less than five miles: this is what policy failure looks like. Why don\u2019t people cycle instead? Perhaps because, though the number of motorists killed or seriously injured has fallen sharply, the number of cyclists killed or hurt on the roads has climbed since 2003. This now accounts for <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/514912/road-use-statistics.pdf\">14% of all casualties</a>, though cycling amounts to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/nts03-modal-comparisons\">only 1% of the distance we travel</a>.</p> <p>The simplest, cheapest and healthiest solution to congestion is blocked by the failure to provide safe transit. Last year the transport department crowed that it could cut \u00a323m from its budget as a result of an \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33013567\">underspend on the Cycle Cities Ambition budget</a>\u201d. Instead of handing this money back to the Treasury, it should have discovered why it wasn\u2019t spent, and ensured that it doesn\u2019t happen again.</p> <p>The undercapacity of the roads arises from the overcapacity of the vehicles that use them. Average occupancy of cars in the UK is 1.6; and it seems to me that the bigger the car, the fewer people it tends to contain. With a few exceptions (such as Mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s plans for London), almost nothing is done to change or challenge this.</p> <p>When a major feeder road was resurfaced in my home city, I heard people complaining that it took them an hour and a half to travel two miles to work. They could have walked in half the time, or cycled in one-tenth. The council had a perfect opportunity to intervene, with notices beside the road urging people to switch to two wheels or two feet. But it sat and watched, as trapped in its mindset as people were in their cars.</p> <p>Our problems are dwarfed by what is happening elsewhere. Global car production has almost doubled in 10 years. The number of cars on the planet is expected to rise from 1.2bn to 2bn by 2035. Carmageddon beckons: a disaster for the climate, public health and our quality of life. Yet it is still treated as an indicator of economic success.</p> <p>We are told that this is about choice. But surely there should be a hierarchy of choice: the choice of whether or not to suffer a premature death should take precedence over our choice of transport mode.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/05/toxic-air-pollution-particles-found-in-human-brains-links-alzheimers\">Our brains are filled with metal particles</a>, our children\u2019s lungs and mental development are stunted, and an epidemic of heart and lung disease is catalysed \u2013 all to grant people the choice of stewing in a traffic jam rather than getting there by other means.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/04/three-quarters-of-people-living-in-cities-want-clean-air-zones-poll-finds\">a recent YouGov poll in Britain</a>, 76% of respondents opted for clean air zones in their cities, enforced by taxes and charges. Sorry, wrong kind of choice.</p> <p>So here\u2019s a novel idea: how about a 21st-century transport system for the 21st century? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/jul/10/helsinki-shared-public-transport-plan-car-ownership-pointless\">Helsinki is making public transport as convenient</a> and flexible as private transport. For example, by aggregating people\u2019s requests via a smartphone app, minibus services can collect people from their homes and deliver them close to their destinations while minimising their routes. <a href=\"http://inhabitat.com/hamburg-announces-plans-to-become-a-car-free-city-within-20-years/\">Hamburg is building a network</a> of cycling and walking paths so safe, pleasant and convenient that no one with the ability to do otherwise would want to take a car.</p> <p>Let\u2019s set a date by which no new car is manufactured unless it\u2019s electric. Let\u2019s set up household charging points, allowing people to plug in without having to take their car off the road. Let\u2019s introduce a scrappage payment, not to replace old cars with new ones but to replace old cars with no car at all.

It is a private institution with responsibilities to its students and its staff. Most people would surely agree that there are some views (racism, for example) that universities should not tolerate. Where to draw the line between those views that, though controversial, are permissible and those that are deemed beyond the pale will always be subjective and contestable. There is no straightforward, commonsense way of deciding this and there may be a strong case for saying that caution has been taken too far.

Hanging up are a number of rejected items ranging from a sparkly skirt to an oversized boiler suit. Dagny has tried on a lot of clothes this morning, and she\u2019s not happy with any of them. Suddenly, she picks up a black and white-striped jumpsuit. \u201cThis looks sick,\u201d she declares. \u201c<em>This</em> is seriously cool.\u201d</p> <p>Hell isn\u2019t other people, but it might be shopping with them.

Her current EP, Ultraviolet, seals the deal: it\u2019s an exuberant but pensive riot of pounding drums, live instrumentation and just enough electronic flourishes to give it a modern edge, combined with some truly extraordinary songwriting. \u201cThere\u2019s a real art to making a good pop song,\u201d Dagny decides as she examines an unwise purple basque. \u201cPeople underestimate it: a good pop song can be fucking tricky.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf7337f9c0fe288e081c752d5c29aafa255e502c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf7337f9c0fe288e081c752d5c29aafa255e502c/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Checking the racks at Beyond Retro in London\u2019s Dalston.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Checking the racks at Beyond Retro in London\u2019s Dalston.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Getting those good pop songs heard can be equally tricky for some artists, and for some years Dagny was experiencing only modest success. Having flitted between a number of jobs \u2014 in a clothes shop, a wine bar and an elderly home \u2014 she came to London four and a half years ago to work on her music, and made waves back home in Norway with a series of low-key tours. But by summer 2015 she was growing despondent, and began applying for places at university near her home town of Troms\u00f8, northern Norway. </p> <p>In contrast with many musicians\u2019 stories it was Dagny\u2019s parents, both jazz musicians, who talked her out of it. \u201cI asked my dad recently, do you ever get worried about my future?\u201d Dagny smiles. \u201cHe said, \u2018No, I never worry about you. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s one route for everybody.\u2019\u201d<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>From a very young age I had big thoughts about the kinds of things other people my age didn't seem to be thinking about</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Last summer she also recorded Backbeat and, having been convinced to continue her music, planned to release it this February. Then on a Friday afternoon last September, Dagny\u2019s manager received a call containing the phrase \u201cZane Lowe wants to premiere your track on Wednesday\u201d. The song wasn\u2019t even finished, but it was an opportunity too good to turn down. Dagny was in the studio on the day in question, so her manager and sister came over to listen to the song\u2019s first play. They opened some beers and a bottle of Prosecco. \u201cWe sat down and we waited,\u201d Dagny recalls. \u201cThe song started, and it was like, \u2018Whoa.\u2019\u201d When the song finished, silence descended. \u201cWe just sat there and we looked at each other. And then I said: what happens now?\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"17d788e57394ad51a08e8b3dca5cd134a05c42ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17d788e57394ad51a08e8b3dca5cd134a05c42ad/0_0_3840_5760/667.jpg\" alt=\"Dagny.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I was Mel B when we dressed up as the Spice Girls\u2019 \u2026Dagny.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What in fact happened was that Spotify supported the track across its New Music Friday playlists and three days later the song \u2014 which aired on Beats 1 in an unmastered state \u2014 had over 300,000 Spotify plays. \u201cAnd then,\u201d Dagny adds, \u201cthe emails started coming.\u201d One of those emails led to a deal in the US with Republic Records, while Island picked her up in the UK.</p> <p>But the what-happens-now conundrum is not one Dagny takes lightly. While we\u2019ve been shopping, Beyond Retro\u2019s in-house sound system has been playing a number of songs by Dagny\u2019s peers; many, like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u69lXmBs08o\">L\u00e9on\u2019s Tired of Talking</a>, are by acts well known to music bloggers and Spotify listeners, and who regularly pick up decent streaming numbers and excitable online coverage, but falter when it comes to crossing over. \u201cI have a lot of fears about that,\u201d Dagny nods. \u201cI suppose this is the point where I become an artist.\u201d</p> <p>She recalls her early attachment to the Spice Girls \u2014 a band whose songs she enjoyed, but whose characters brought those songs to life \u2014 as an early influence. \u201cI was Mel B when we dressed up as the Spice Girls,\u201d she adds. \u201cMy sister was Emma. Everyone wanted to not be Victoria.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My brother got cancer when he was very young; he was 15 and I was nine, and it naturally became a big part of my life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In any case, artistry seems to be no problem for Dagny: her emotive lyrics offer a strong sense of what it\u2019s like to be 26 in 2016, and there\u2019s a lyrical theme in many of her songs \u2014 like Too Young, with its \u201cwe\u2019re too young to feel this old\u201d refrain \u2014 that capture what it\u2019s like to celebrate the twilight of one\u2019s youth as adulthood insists on taking hold. She laughs when I suggest her music carries a sense of impending doom, and says she prefers to think of the tone as \u201cpleasant melancholia\u201d. \u201cThe first time that feeling hit me was when I was 11,\u201d she continues. \u201cFrom a very young age I had big thoughts about the kinds of things other people my age didn\u2019t seem to be thinking about.\u201d </p> <p>When I ask what sort of topics were on her mind, she pauses. \u201cHonestly? Death. My brother got cancer when he was very young; he was 15 and I was nine, and it naturally became a big part of my life. The contrast with that is now, I feel in some ways as if I age much slower than I should \u2013 I\u2019m 26 and maybe I should be settled in my life but I\u2019m not at all. I constantly have a feeling that I should have come further than I have, based on how old I am. People back home are settling into their big things, and I\u2019m just getting started. Maybe that\u2019s just going to be how I am forever: very aware about time. That\u2019s my crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Support from big-hitters has diminished that crisis somewhat. Dagny responds with a diplomatic \u201cthat\u2019s a good question\u201d when asked if Spotify has replaced traditional radio, though she does add that it was traditional radio in Norway that made Backbeat a hit on home territory. \u201cQuite frankly,\u201d she offers, \u201cI don\u2019t think there are any rules in music any more, but you still have to go out and work for success. \u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e33790e752e2c13b5d73778480362029bb2164c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e33790e752e2c13b5d73778480362029bb2164c/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dagny selects a choker \u2026 courtesy of the Guardian\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dagny selects a choker \u2026 courtesy of the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That\u2019s unlikely to be a problem for the foreseeable future: beyond tonight\u2019s live show, at which she\u2019s decided she\u2019ll be wearing a silver choker purchased with 20 quid of the Guardian\u2019s money, there\u2019s a debut album to record. \u201cI know that nothing is going to happen by itself,\u201d Dagny smiles. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s quite nice.

I was like, this is next to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/79566/soylent-green\">Soylent Green</a>; I bet you we\u2019re going to start eating people. So yeah, welcome to the future.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s a challenge to keep up with Henry. Fans of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/06/better-things-atlanta-fx-comedy-donald-glover-pamela-adlon\">Atlanta</a> \u2013 Donald Glover\u2019s auteur drama on FX, <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2016/09/fx-atlanta-premiere-ratings-strong.html\">which drew three million viewers with its season premiere</a> \u2013 will recognise him as Alfred Miles aka Paper Boi, the laconic would-be rapper around whom much of the action revolves. But there\u2019s nothing laconic about Henry, who seems determined to put the world to rights \u2013 one genetically modified piece of fruit at a time.</p> <p>\u201cYou can put Trump in the White House, but you need to prepare for a revolt because I\u2019m going nuts,\u201d says Henry, as he waits for his English breakfast \u2013 a deconstructed version including black pudding \u2013 to arrive. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/08/escapefromnewyork.kurtrussell\"> Escape From New York</a> in here and you might as well call me Kurt Russell because I\u2019m going to be fucking people up. It\u2019s going to be Mad Max.\u201d</p> <p>From the coldly seething anger to the apocalyptic references, Henry\u2019s takedown of the Republican presidential candidate and his possibly cataclysmic consequences could come straight from the script of Atlanta. It has been the most popular of FX\u2019s offerings this autumn and one of the most critically lauded of the TV fall debutants. It\u2019s been called genre defying, earned comparisons to fellow FX show Louie and The Wire, and was dubbed \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/19/the-slo-mo-specificity-of-atlanta\">shrewd, emotional, and impolite</a>\u201d by the New Yorker\u2019s Emily Nussbaum.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It\u2019s also black. Brazenly so \u2013 from its cast and crew to its subject matter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/25/the-new-south-atlanta-georgia-city-of-black-power\">to the city in which it\u2019s set</a>. Atlanta has managed to stand out during a season that\u2019s been heralded for embracing diversity. But where other shows such as Luke Cage, Pitch or Queen Sugar may exist in alternate universes or times, Atlanta is set in the here and now, in contemporary America. And that setting, slap bang in the middle of the most divisive election race in recent history, feels apt.</p> <p>\u201cWe should be over this by now but we\u2019re not,\u201d says Henry of race relations in the US. \u201cWhich is why I\u2019m glad we\u2019re doing our show because we\u2019re going to be telling you exactly how we feel and exactly where we\u2019re coming from, and exactly how it feels to be a black American in this country right now.\u201d</p> <p>Variations on that line have been used by a lot of the cast while promoting the show \u2013 Donald Glover said he \u201cwanted to show white people, you don\u2019t know everything about black culture\u201d. During the show\u2019s first episode, which focuses around a shooting in a car park, the standout moment is when a white friend casually throws around the N-word. It\u2019s a scene which finishes on Glover and Henry staring down the camera at their acquaintance, and it feels like they\u2019re also looking at the viewer and America at large. It\u2019s as if those scenes are supposed to elicit a knowing nod from African Americans and a wince from white America.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cac0cba26db1ea7df483e93ca404fe679dab3ef4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cac0cba26db1ea7df483e93ca404fe679dab3ef4/199_126_2603_1563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jumping the couch: Keith Standfield as Darius, Donald Glover as Earnest Marks and Brian Tyree Henry as Alfred Miles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jumping the couch: Keith Standfield as Darius, Donald Glover as Earnest Marks and Brian Tyree Henry as Alfred Miles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNo one seems give a shit about what they say about any race in this country,\u201d says Henry. \u201cWhich is funny because the last time I checked isn\u2019t this the land of immigration?

It\u2019s like, yeah, but only if we say so, though.\u201d</p> <p>His words are shrewd, emotional and a little impolite, at least by conservative America\u2019s standards, but his tell-it-how-you-see-it approach began early. Henry was the youngest in a house with four older sisters in Washington DC. Acting was a survival mechanism as much as a hobby. \u201cMy sisters were teenagers when I was born so the last thing they wanted was a little nappy-headed boy running around,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI would imitate them or copy things off TV. I would leave the house and be these people.\u201d </p> <p>That early play turned into something more when Henry started acting at Morehouse College, the most famous of the historically black colleges and the same place <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/30/amuel--ackson--was-a-drug-addict-out-of-my-mind-but-showed-up-on-time-and-hit-my-marks\">Samuel L Jackson caught the acting bug</a>.

That\u2019s what our show is trying to do; create our own universe with these two young men trying to make it in this universe which is still part of this bigger picture. It\u2019s still part of America, it\u2019s still part of Georgia, it\u2019s still part of the south, but it\u2019s created it\u2019s own entity and I love that.\u201d</p> <p>Talking to Henry, that idea of identity and defining yourself comes up frequently.

So what about the world of Atlanta hip-hop? It\u2019s often presented as an out of control, drug-laced trap house where debauchery is next to godliness. For Henry it\u2019s much more complicated than that.</p> <p>\u201cIn hip-hop you can be anything. What you look like is the least of it: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/19/fetty-wap-i-didnt-even-get-to-use-no-bed\">Fetty Wap</a> has one eye. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/28/gucci-mane-everybody-looking-review-trap-stars-quickfire-post-prison-set\">Gucci Mane</a> has an ice cream cone tattooed on his face, and they\u2019re both still great,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I love about hip-hop: it challenges the norms of what we, especially as black men should be and look like. It welcomes the freaks and the ones who haven\u2019t been heard.\u201d</p> <p>Is that what Atlanta is doing? \u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s necessary, but it is absolutely necessary,\u201d he says.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the moment I think the economy still has some slack left in the labour market, you can see that in the subdued pace of pay growth.

But most believe there will be no change to the Bank of Japan\u2019s inflation target of 2%. James Stanley, currency analyst at DailyFX, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The big question is whether this review will lead-in to more stimulus or an introduction of monetary prudence. Many are questioning Japan\u2019s ability to do more stimulus given the size of their programs over the past four years; although in that last Bank of Japan press conference [governor Haruhiko] Kuroda addressed this head on, sharing his view that the BoJ hasn\u2019t yet hit the limits of monetary expansion.</p> <p>But there are some very big peripheral questions to be answered by the BoJ in this review, as in what are they going to do about the 2% target that they announced in April 2013 that they said they expected to hit in 2 years? That was April of 2015, or approximately 17 months ago, and yet we\u2019re still very far away from that target being realistically met. Also at issue are negative rates...would they dare to do more here given that results have been non-existent? And in terms of asset purchases: The BoJ has been buying \u00a580 Trillion a year in assets for a few years now. They\u2019re already cornering their own government bond market. Does the BoJ dare do more after four years have shown little hope of actually kick-starting inflation?</p> <p>So, nobody really knows what the BoJ will say during this review to be released tonight. This could lead to hazardous conditions if trading around the Yen as markets are appearing to approach tonight\u2019s event rather tepidly under the same guise of uncertainty that we are.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"441ab4dd8034baa79a7e513e2158ba34ecb2499a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/441ab4dd8034baa79a7e513e2158ba34ecb2499a/0_0_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kazuhiro Nogi/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Simon MacAdam at Capital Economics said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We expect the BoJ to cut its policy rate deeper into negative territory today which, according to the Overnight Index Swap market, does not appear to be expected until early next year.</p> <p>Admittedly, it is more difficult to gauge where we sit relative to the market on the prospects for further unconventional policy easing in Japan. But we suspect that we are more dovish.</p> <p>[There has been] speculation that there will be a policy shift away from asset purchases. Indeed, the yield curve has steepened recently in anticipation of the BoJ adopting this stance: long-dated yields have hit six-month highs this month.</p> <p>We believe, though, that the BoJ\u2019s Comprehensive Policy Review will throw open the door to innovative policy measures.

Spriggs said Rahamihad also showed sympathy for the Taliban.</p> <p>The FBI conducted a preliminary investigation into Rahami after his father contacted them following a 2014 stabbing to express concerns that his son was a terrorist.<br></p> <p>\u201cIn August 2014, the FBI initiated an assessment of Ahmad Rahami based upon comments made by his father after a domestic dispute that were subsequently reported to authorities,\u201d the bureau confirmed in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cThe FBI conducted internal database reviews, interagency checks, and multiple interviews, none of which revealed ties to terrorism,\u201d it said.<br></p> <p>The FBI did not clarify if it interviewed Rahami, who was captured in a shootout with police yesterday, in 2014, but confirmed it conducted a preliminary investigation. Rahami was not on any US watchlist, a US official confirmed.</p> <p>A blood-stained notebook was in Rahami\u2019s possession when police caught him on Monday. It was filled with extremist ramblings, referring to Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born radical Muslim cleric killed in a 2011 CIA-led drone strike; and Nidal Hasan, the former US army major who killed 13 people in a shooting rampage at the Fort Hood military post. </p> <p>\u201cTwo years ago I go to the FBI because my son was doing really bad, OK?\u201d Mohammad Rahami <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/nyregion/ahmad-khan-rahami-suspect.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news\">told the New York Times</a>. \u201cBut they check almost two months, they say, \u2018He\u2019s OK, he\u2019s clean, he\u2019s not a terrorist.\u2019 I say OK.\u201d<br></p> <p>He added: \u201cNow they say he is a terrorist. I say OK.\u201d</p> <p>A law enforcement official told the Associated Press that the FBI looked into the matter, but that Mohammad Rahami later retracted his comment and said he meant that his son, Ahmad Khan Rahami, was hanging out with the wrong crowd, including gangs.<br></p> <p>The FBI reviewed its databases and found no credible connection to terrorism or threat to the US from the son, the official said. <br></p> <p>Rahami was arrested for stabbing a person in the leg and possession of a firearm in 2014. But a grand jury declined to indict him, despite a warning from the arresting officer that Rahami was likely \u201ca danger to himself or others\u201d. </p> <p>The official who spoke to AP insisted on anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation. </p> <p>Rahami allegedly planted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/new-york-bombing-suspect-ahmad-khan-rahami\">two pressure-cooker bombs in Chelsea</a>, Manhattan, on Saturday \u2013 one of which exploded, injuring 29 \u2013 and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/17/pipe-bomb-jersey-shore-5km-run-us-marines\">pipe bomb 60 miles away in Seaside Park, New Jersey</a>, which forced the abandonment of a charity run for marines and sailors. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/new-york-bombing-both-devices-used-pressure-cooker-and-phone-reports\">A backpack of bombs was also found</a> abandoned near Elizabeth train station on Sunday night, although investigators have not publicly tied Rahami to these devices.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/18/cctv-new-york-city-explosion-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53thp\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2729860\"            data-video-name=\"CCTV shows moment of New York City explosion \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters/Orangetheory Fitness\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57deea02e4b0a8cdc6238ff3\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/18/160918cctv_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/18/160918cctv.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/18/160918cctv_V4.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/18/cctv-new-york-city-explosion-video\">CCTV shows moment of New York City explosion</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>So far Rahami has not been charged with terrorism offences or charges related to the bombs. Instead, he was charged with five counts of attempted murder of a police officer and two second-degree weapons charges, all of which result from his arrest in Linden, New Jersey, on Monday. More charges were expected to be brought against him in federal court, and on Tuesday the US attorney general, Loretta Lynch, said the explosions were being investigated \u201cas an act of terror\u201d.</p> <p>He is being held on $5.2m bail and remains in the hospital in critical but stable condition, after surgery for a gunshot wound to his leg. New Jersey congressman Tom MacArthur, who was briefed by the FBI, said Rahami required multiple surgeries due to gunshot wounds to his leg, forearm and shoulder from his gun battle with police.</p> <p>Police have not yet been able to interview him in depth, the New York police commissioner, James O\u2019Neill, said on Tuesday.</p> <p> Rahami had been arrested in 2014 on weapons and aggravated assault charges for allegedly stabbing a relative in the leg, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/20/nyregion/ahmad-khan-rahami-bombing-suspect.html?emc=edit_th_20160920&amp;nl=todaysheadlines&amp;nlid=67239970\">the New York Times reported</a> citing court documents, and spent over three months in jail before being released without indictment. He also spent a day in jail in 2012 for allegedly violating a restraining order, the paper reported. Although he was not on any terror or no-fly watch lists, he had been interviewed for immigration purposes traveling between the US and Afghanistan, an anonymous law enforcement official told the AP. <br></p> <p>William Sweeney, the FBI\u2019s assistant director in New York, said on Monday that the FBI had got a report of a domestic incident involving Rahami some time ago, but the allegations had been recanted, and \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to indicate that currently he was on our radar\u201d. <br></p> <p></p> <p>Initial analysis of the various bombs indicated minimal technical sophistication, according to a US official briefed on the investigation. Some investigators believe the bombs resemble designs released on to the internet by al-Qaida\u2019s Yemeni affiliate through its Inspire publication.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s something any 12-year-old could do if he had access to Christmas lights, a phone and ball bearings,\u201d the US official said.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/20/who-is-ahmad-khan-rahami-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53q63\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2735373\"            data-video-name=\"Who is Ahmad Khan Rahami? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters, Anthony Genaro, William Shardinksi, AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e1668de4b05714d0da2b67\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/21/160920Profile1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/21/160920Profile1_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/21/160920Profile1.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/20/who-is-ahmad-khan-rahami-video\">Who is Ahmad Khan Rahami?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Officials have said they have no other suspects at large, but cautioned they are still investigating. \u201cIt\u2019s a good sign that we found him in a doorway,\u201d O\u2019Neill told CBS on Tuesday. \u201cHopefully that means he had nowhere to go.\u201d</p> <p>A Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, told <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ABC7NY/status/778280195983872001\">ABC News</a> that there was no link between Rahami and his group. </p> <p>Rahami was spotted on surveillance video in Chelsea on Saturday evening carrying a backpack and two other bags, the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/20/nyregion/nyc-nj-explosions-ahmad-khan-rahami.html?emc=edit_th_20160920&amp;nl=todaysheadlines&amp;nlid=67239970\">New York Times reported</a>, with later footage showing him without the backpack and leaving one of the other bags by a mailbox.<br></p> <p>His fingerprints and DNA were found at the scene of the Manhattan bombing, the AP reported, citing anonymous law enforcement officials.

I am told that it is my fault, I voted for \u201cbombing\u201d, the blood of the dead of Aleppo is on my hands. But this could not be further from the truth. British airstrikes are targeted at Isis and are hundreds of miles from Aleppo where the worst suffering is occurring. The vast majority of civilian casualties, including those in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/18/i-filmed-the-syrian-boy-pulled-from-the-rubble-his-wasnt-a-rare-case\">famous images</a>, are victims of Assad\u2019s aggression against his own people, sparked by the democratic uprising of the Arab spring. Surely even those whose political activism is mainly commenting on Facebook and Twitter can recall that, in 2013, the House of Commons had a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/aug/30/cameron-mps-syria\">full debate on British involvement</a> in possible action against Assad. Labour did not support David Cameron, and our country has taken no overt military steps to respond to Assad\u2019s brutality.</p> <p>In fact, like many in our country, I wrestle with what more we could have done to stop Assad. The latest stories of life and death in Aleppo drive me mad with worry. If I am asked (as I am sure all MPs are, now that Twitter dominates debate), \u201chow do you sleep?\u201d, the honest answer is: not well. Not well at all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/syria-map/\" data-alt=\"Syria airstrike map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/syria-map/\">Syria airstrike map</a> </figure>  <p>So what can be done? With bombs raining down on the people of eastern Aleppo as we speak, it is urgent that the ceasefire is salvaged if possible. Theresa May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/19/theresa-may-resists-calls-uk-accept-syrian-refugees-aid\">is at the UN in New York</a> and she should be calling for an urgent meeting of the UN security council (UNSC) to bring the Russians to the table and do everything to get a deal. The UK should also be volunteering to take the lead on tracking aircraft over Syria, so that there is absolute clarity about who is responsible for these crimes.</p> <p>In the longer term, protection of civilians from aerial bombardment, along with the destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles, must be the aim. There is a legal precedent in Kosovo for the establishment of a no-fly zone without UNSC backing and this option should not be off the table if it can be shown to be the most effective way of protecting civilians. But even failing this there are things we can do. We can push for bigger windows to get humanitarian aid into the worst-hit areas. We can get support to the heroic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/feb/04/women-syria-civil-defence-rescue-workers\">White Helmets</a>, the Syrian volunteers who risk their lives to save as many people as they can from the death raining down on them. We can offer clear support to the credible, inclusive plans the Syrian opposition are putting forward.</p> <p>Last week I was elected co-chair of the Friends of Syria group in parliament, taking up the role held by my friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/16/the-guardian-view-on-jo-cox-an-attack-on-humanity-idealism-and-democracy\">Jo Cox</a>. She would have known what was needed, what to argue for. Most of all I think she would have said to help the refugees fleeing Syria, not just 20,000 by 2020 but many more, much more quickly. Peace in Syria may seem out of reach for now, but there are things that can be done, we must not waste time to bring relief to those who desperately need it.</p>",

No, not a Stereophonics B-side, but two problem areas for fashion. First, belts. The past couple of seasons have seen designers insist on anything but conventional buckling, most notably the paper-bag style (Margaret Howell) and the rope belt (Gosha Rubchinskiy). Boobs, meanwhile, continued to be celebrated and going bra-less is having a moment in Kardashian-Jenner world. Donatella Versace has tried to fix things by creating the boob belt, which she showed at her Versus show. Worn as part of a futuristic-looking outfit (bodycon trousers, tight jacket with exaggerated sleeves), the look was very Mad Max Fury Road and suggested a way to re-house any chunky 80s-style belts. <strong>PE</strong></p> <h2>Plastic-surgery bandages</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f902ab7dd84e6c40defa13b406c127d746a9a842\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f902ab7dd84e6c40defa13b406c127d746a9a842/206_248_4400_2961/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Backstage at the Anya Hindmarch, show, LFW.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bandaged up: backstage at the Anya Hindmarch show, LFW.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart C.

The models wore elegantly placed rolls of thick, white bandage tape around their head and neck. Some wore oversize sunglasses and the overall effect was that of a wannabe Hollywood starlet unveiling her new appearance after some career-altering face work.

Mary Katrantzou\u2019s pear-shaped silhouettes featured psychedelic prints mixed with ancient-Greek vase imagery. Add some circular perspex beading and you\u2019ve got something you might fit with a 60 watt bulb at Timothy Leary\u2019s Etsy store.

Some designers have even pushed that idea further, with traditionally \u201cugly\u201d tropes morphing into something else. At Christopher Kane, he styled his models with wet-look mullets, and the overall effect was Frida Kahlo meets the Bloomsbury set. At Gareth Pugh\u2019s dramatic and ominous show, models had liquorice strips of black lipstick and hair that was in between a crow and Medusa. Equally disturbing were the beauty elements of the occult-inspired Preen show: models wore dry pressed flowers on their lips (very Kate Bush), while sporting girlish plaits and Pentagram earrings. <strong>PE</strong></p> <h2>Dance, dance, dance</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab7e2b24b20382a9cf1b1dd37b9878ca90e9c97c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab7e2b24b20382a9cf1b1dd37b9878ca90e9c97c/0_256_4286_2572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Molly Goddard, LFW September 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rave on: Molly Goddard, LFW September 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben A Pruchnie/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When one of the stalwarts of London fashion week \u2013 Gareth Pugh \u2013 soundtracks his finale to Faithless\u2019s hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8JEm4d6Wu4\">Insomnia</a> you know something is up. Perhaps in response to the closure of Fabric, fashion is pulling an all-nighter and going out dancing. Pugh\u2019s collection was partly inspired by the exploits of tyrannical child emperor Eliogabalo (of course it was), but it also played with the black-and-white graphics associated with chaos theory so loved by rave flyers. Also on the playlist was The Prodigy, which soundtracked AV Robertson\u2019s show. <a href=\"http://www.disneyrollergirl.net/molly-goddard-ss17-nick-waplington/\">Molly Goddard</a>, meanwhile, turned her show into a catwalk rave, with models dancing.

  "<p>Tony Blair should be admired for his government\u2019s achievements on workers\u2019 rights and the health service, the Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, has said in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/20/tim-farron-speech-lib-dem-conferenence-says-lib-dems-would-be-willing-to-raise-taxes-to-find-a-lot-more-money-for-nhs-politics-live\">conference speech</a> pitched squarely at moderate Labour voters.</p> <p>He told the party\u2019s conference in Brighton he was amazed Labour party members were \u201cthrowing around the word Blairite as if it\u2019s the world\u2019s most offensive insult\u201d. </p> <p>Farron said he was not a Blairite, citing his opposition to the Iraq war, compulsory ID cards, 90-day detention, and deregulation of the banks. \u201cThere is more to Tony Blair\u2019s legacy than that,\u201d he went on. \u201cI kind of see Tony Blair the way I see the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/stone-roses\">Stone Roses</a>: I preferred the early work.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/15/corbyn-could-land-us-with-tory-government-for-25-years-says-farron\">I admire Tony Blair for beating Tories, says Tim Farron</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Farron said Blair\u2019s legacy was also the minimum wage, working tax credits, NHS investment and school-building. \u201cI disagree with him a lot, but I will not criticise him for those things. I admire him for those things,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cI respect him for believing that the point of being in politics is to get stuff done, and you can only get stuff done if you win. Otherwise you\u2019re letting your opponent get stuff done instead.\u201d</p> <p>Farron has previously expressed admiration for the former Labour prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/15/corbyn-could-land-us-with-tory-government-for-25-years-says-farron\">telling the Guardian last week</a> he believed \u201ca person who thinks winning elections so you can do good is honourable\u201d.</p> <p>The Lib Dems have made no secret during their Brighton conference of their desire to seize the support of voters on the centre-left and right concerned about the swerve of both main parties away from the middle ground.</p> <p>However, there is little evidence thus far that those voters have been convinced that the Lib Dems are the answer. New polling released on Tuesday shows their ratings have barely changed from a year ago, despite heightened attention following the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron\">Brexit vote</a>.</p> <p>When asked to compare Farron with the Liberal Democrat party, just 23% stated that they liked Farron but slightly more \u2013 28% \u2013 said they liked the Lib Dems, with no change from last year\u2019s conference. Almost half of those surveyed said \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d, an indication that the leader has barely raised his public profile since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/16/tim-farron-named-liberal-democrat-party-leader\">taking over from Nick Clegg</a>. </p> <p>It also remains to be seen how Farron\u2019s praise of Blair will be received by his party. On Monday night at the Lib Dems\u2019 annual unofficial glee club, members lustily sang: \u201cTony Blair can fuck off and die\u201d to the tune of Don McLean\u2019s American Pie.</p> <p>In the hall, the response was certainly muted, but Lib Dem sources say that was not the target audience for the comments. They say their leader will push on with his appeal to New Labour\u2019s early voters, ramping up his praise of some achievements of the Blair government. </p> <p>Farron said he wanted to convince voters his party was the only one that could deny a pro-Brexit Conservative government a majority. He said: \u201cI\u2019m prepared to work with people of all parties and none if it will make people\u2019s lives better.

And there are others I could work with too.\u201d</p> <p>In his speech Farron cited the former Labour frontbenchers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/labour-big-guns-chuka-umunna-caroline-flint-yvette-cooper-line-up-replace-keith-vaz\">Yvette Cooper, Chuka Umunna and Caroline Flint</a>, all currently competing to chair the home affairs select committee, which the Lib Dem leader called \u201ca retirement position\u201d. He said: \u201cShouldn\u2019t that be their leadership contest? What are these people doing, jostling for position in a sideshow? They should be centre-stage.\u201d</p> <p> Labour MPs Liz Kendall and Lisa Nandy have appeared at Lib Dem fringe events, voicing their support for cross-party collaboration. Nandy, who appeared with Green MP Caroline Lucas, told the fringe meetings her party spent too much time fighting over \u201csmall differences\u201d.</p> <p>Farron had far fewer conciliatory words for the Conservative party, the Lib Dems\u2019 former coalition partners. Earlier in the speech he said the party had \u201clost the right to call itself the party of business\u201d. </p> <p>He said: \u201cIt no longer supports business, no longer understands the need for calm economic pragmatism \u2013 but instead pursues the nationalist protectionist fantasies of the Brexit fundamentalists who have won the day. Indeed, my message to any business in this country \u2013 large or small \u2013 is if you are backing today\u2019s Conservative party, you are funding your own funeral. We are the free-market, free-trade pro-business party now.\u201d</p> <p>Farron said he was confident the party could make inroads in Conservative seats, starting with local government. Party sources said they were closely studying the success of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/justin-trudeau\">Justin Trudeau</a>\u2019s Liberal party in Canada, which won a surprise but emphatic victory over the Conservative government after the collapse of the leftwing New Democratic party, which had been the official opposition.</p> <p>Farron was unapologetic that he wanted to model himself on Trudeau, though admitted the Canadian was \u201cbetter looking than me and he\u2019s got a tattoo\u201d. He said: \u201cTrudeau\u2019s Liberals leapt over an inadequate official opposition to defeat a rightwing Conservative government. Do you fancy doing that? \u2019Cause I do.\u201d</p> <p>Opportunities for the party existed in Tory seats after boundary changes, Farron said. \u201cNo one believes, whether boundary changes happen or not, that Labour will gain a single seat from the Tories. The SNP could only possibly take one seat off the Conservatives. But there are dozens of Tory seats in our reach. Which means that the only thing standing between the Conservatives and a majority at the next election is the revival of the Liberal Democrats.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"575948a72cd97c8f10654a62eb8d485638efdeae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/575948a72cd97c8f10654a62eb8d485638efdeae/0_0_5581_3694/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An \u201cOi Farron\u201d badge at the conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An \u2018Oi Farron\u2019 badge at the conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As well as reiterating his promise to fight for a second referendum on any Brexit deal, Farron\u2019s speech also pledged a fully taxpayer-funded care service, rebranding the NHS as the National Health and Care Service, even if it would mean tax rises. The Lib Dems would also campaign against the reintroduction of grammar schools and would scrap Sats for younger children.</p> <p>Farron said beyond his party and the UK he believed there was a wider battle emerging between \u201cthe forces of tolerant liberalism and intolerant, closed-minded nationalism\u201d.</p> <p>With genuine emotion, Farron spoke of his experience volunteering during the refugee crisis in Lesbos, where he was confronted by an aid worker from New Zealand, who knew he was a British politician. \u201cShe looked at me and shouted: \u2018Stop handing out bottles of water and take some effing refugees.\u2019 Because that is how Britain is seen. Mean, and not pulling its weight. And maybe that doesn\u2019t bother some people, but it bothers me.\u201d </p> <p>The appeal not to abandon refugees, as more news came in that the UN would halt aid convoys into Syria after one was shelled, drew a standing ovation and raised fists in the crowd.</p> <p>\u201cI am proud of who we are \u2013 always a sanctuary for the desperate, the abused and the persecuted,\u201d Farron said. \u201cAnd I will not stand by and watch my country become smaller, meaner and more selfish.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>When Sarah Paulson won a lead actress Emmy, her first, on Sunday, for her role as Marcia Clark in The People v OJ Simpson, her girlfriend, actor Holland Taylor, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HollandTaylor/status/777733424698318849\">tweeted</a>: \u201cStill in New York. Still swooning. @MsSarahPaulson.\u201d</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t the only one swooning. Lesbians everywhere were, or screaming \u2013 full-on, girly shrieking at the TV in delight. And pride.</p> <p>First there had been Kate McKinnon gliding up to the stage in a spectacular red gown and bawling her eyes out for joy as she was awarded her first Emmy, for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series, Saturday Night Live.</p> <p>The SNL and Ghostbusters star has come a long way since The Big Gay Sketch Show on Logo TV almost a decade ago.</p> <p>Right on her high heels came suited-and-sneakered Jill Soloway, a tornado of a feminist writer whose multiple award-winning creation Transparent has been acclaimed as the most progressive, raw and entertaining family drama about the transgender experience ever produced.</p> <p>Winning her second Emmy, in her speech she called for the toppling of the patriarchy \u2013 but also thanked Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, whose streaming service Amazon Prime commissioned the show. </p> <p>Adding to the mood of heightened and awareness and support for LGBT issues, later that night Transparent star Jeffrey Tambor, who won outstanding lead actor in a comedy series for his portrayal of a transgender woman, declared in his Emmy acceptance speech on that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/18/emmys-2016-jeffrey-tambor-transgender-transparent\">henceforth</a> all trans roles should be taken by transgender people.</p> <p>Then a little later in a groundbreaking evening in Los Angeles \u2013 during which host Jimmy Kimmel issued constant tongue-in-cheek but pointed observations about increased diversity at the Emmys <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/08/oscars-so-white-diversity-issues-protests-sylvester-stallone-creed\">compared with the Oscars</a> \u2013 came Paulson.</p> <p>She had brought the house down earlier by <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/article/2016/09/18/emmys-2016-sarah-paulson-marcia-clark-red-carpet\">appearing on the red carpet with Clark</a>, the legendary prosecutor in the OJ Simpson murder trial whom Paulson played in her award-winning role.</p> <p>\u201cIt was awesome \u2013 and so seemingly effortless,\u201d <a href=\"https://pwcenter.org/profile/sarah-gubbins\">Sarah Gubbins</a>, a playwright and co-creator with Soloway of the new Amazon series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/25/i-love-dick-tv-you-still-cant-beat-the-book\">I Love Dick</a>, said of the night\u2019s highly visible lesbian element.</p> <p>Comedian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/tig-notaro\">Tig Notaro</a> and actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/nov/22/lily-tomlin-grandma-interview-sexism-ageism-isis\">Lily Tomlin</a> were also nominated, even if they didn\u2019t win.</p> <p>\u201cI did the Emmys party circuit and everyone was just reveling in it. You have to take the time to celebrate when you can feel the culture shifting. We\u2019re here, we\u2019re queer and there is nothing to fear,\u201d Gubbins told the Guardian.</p> <p>She said that the technological breakthrough in new television platforms created by the likes of Netflix, Hulu and Amazon had allowed \u201cthe gatekeepers\u201d to try more risk-taking shows, give access to more women and queer people and see the success.</p> <p>\u201cTelevision is blazing a path for queer female voices right now, and similar visibility in theater and film is catching up fast \u2013 it\u2019s about critical mass. It\u2019s remarkable,\u201d said Gubbins.</p> <p>In her acceptance speech, McKinnon thanked comedian and chat show host Ellen DeGeneres.</p> <p>She also thanked Hillary Clinton, who returned the compliment with a congratulatory tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/777673718982184964\">including</a> a gif of McKinnon impersonating her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not usually a person who shouts at the television, but when I saw these women winning Emmy after Emmy I just burst into applause and screamed \u2018Yesss\u2019 every time,\u201d said Trish Bendix, editor-in-chief of the self-described lesbian and bisexual pop culture website <a href=\"http://www.afterellen.com/\">AfterEllen.com</a>.</p> <p>It was named in tribute to the watershed moment when Ellen DeGeneres\u2019 sitcom character Ellen and the performer herself came out as a lesbian in 1997.</p> <p>DeGeneres became an instant gay hero, but her show was dropped and she was in the professional wilderness until she voiced the part of Dory in the 2003 movie Finding Nemo, then got her own chat show that became a hit.</p> <p> AfterEllen.com also <a href=\"http://www.afterellen.com/tv/514245-emmys-2016-huge-night-queer-women\">picked out </a>other less well-known lesbians and lesbian characters also enjoying Emmy success this year.</p> <p>There was a mini-uproar from parts of the live audience and on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TimTeeman/status/777684138321145856\">social media </a>Sunday night when the band played over The People v OJ Simpson producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/18/how-the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-2-staged-a-revolution\">Nina Jacobson</a> just as she was giving an emotional thank-you to her wife.</p> <p> However Bendix considered it mainly rotten timing, and similar snubs happened to several others on the night.</p> <p>\u201cIt was rude, though,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Lisa Kron, who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AejUt7TdexI\">won</a> two Tony awards in 2015 for writing the lyrics and book for Fun Home, the groundbreaking hit musical about lesbian cartoonist Alison Bechdel, said that lesbian visibility in arts and entertainment had hit a \u201ctipping point\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe were not just invented, none of this success is happening in a vacuum. There is a wave of visibility, it\u2019s being helped by the proliferation of social media and the ability for us to talk across distances to each other,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She thought the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/26/gay-marriage-legal-supreme-court\">legalization</a> of gay marriage has also helped. Kron is married to playwright Madeleine George.</p> <p>Oscar-nominated lesbian designer Patricia Field was winning accolades for her costumes for the straight characters of Sex And The City and The Devil Wears Prada years ago, but the stage was anything but crowded.</p> <p>\u201cThe talent and the content has always been there, in numbers. Now it\u2019s rising to the top as it always should have done, and coming of age,\u201d said Frances Wallace, executive director of Frameline, the media arts non-profit that produces the annual San Francisco international LGBTQ film festival.</p> <p>And, she pointed out, with transgender politics and related edgy story lines now in the vanguard, many lesbians and bisexual women in the industry feel there is even less to lose by coming out these days \u2013 and thanking their wives and girlfriends on global TV to boot.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a huge celebration,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<p>In one of Michael Bell\u2019s earliest encounters with Tyre King, the sports coach had to sneak the boy into a Columbus, Ohio, recreation center to play basketball. The age limit for the play center was 12, and Tyre was 13.</p> <p>\u201cBut, me, I was like, \u2018Hey, I want to get these kids in here,\u2019\u201d said Bell, 43. \u201cThis is a safe haven.

Moments later, police said, an officer fired \u201cmultiple\u201d times after Tyre reached for a BB gun in his waistband. He was pronounced dead at a hospital soon after.</p> <p>His death has gripped the Rust Belt city of 850,000, where residents protesting the shooting say uneven economic development has not benefited poorer neighborhoods like the one where Tyre lived. </p> <p>The environment Tyre was raised in mirrors \u201cso many young men\u201d in Columbus, said Mark Stansberry, Tyre\u2019s former hockey coach. \u201cA lot of dysfunctionality,\u201d he said, \u201cbut he was resilient.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was \u2026 always coming in with that smile,\u201d Stansberry said. \u201cHis smile was as big as the helmet.\u201d </p> <p>Last Wednesday, around 7.45pm, Columbus police said officers were dispatched to respond to reports of an armed robbery of a man for $10. The victim said a suspect was carrying a Ruger pistol.<br></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to mess with it over $10,\u201d the victim told the dispatcher. When police arrived, three males \u2013 including Tyre \u2013 matching the description of the suspects were spotted. Officers approached Tyre in an alley. Shortly after, police say Tyre reached for a BB gun from his waistband. It was then Mason, a nine-year veteran of the Columbus police division, shot King \u201cmultiple\u201d times.

Still, Evans said, the semblance of safety and access to opportunity isn\u2019t shared across the city\u2019s residents.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s this idea that Columbus is this place where we have low crime and we have affordable housing and job opportunities, but all of those things are only afforded to the few, and that few does include people of color,\u201d she said.</p> <p>At the rally on Monday, Evans and Fournier-Alsaada\u2019s group released a list of demands to the city\u2019s mayor, including a call to let residents shape the Summer Safety Initiative, new trauma service programs in areas affected by violence, and new community-policing initiatives.</p> <p>Standing nearby, Larry Robertson, a local musician, reflected on how his former hometown of Cleveland was rankled by the death of Tamir Rice, who was killed by police while carrying a pellet gun in a city park at 12 years old.</p> <p>\u201cBeing from Cleveland with Tamir, that really upset me,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThen with it happening again here within a couple years.

Last week, he was in a sporting goods store when one of his children asked if he could buy a paintball gun. The answer was simple. </p> <p>\u201cI told him no, you can\u2019t have any guns,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t afford for you to have a gun. Our kids can\u2019t play with toy guns.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>There are no puzzles, no enemies. You\u2019re alone on a remote Hebridean island with little evidence of life beyond the cawing gulls, and the odd glimpse of a shadowy figure on the horizon. There is one path to follow, which guides you over the dunes and into caves lit by phosphorescent flora. The story unravels, not through the completion of tasks, but through a pondering, poetic narration, and scattered letters. </p> <p>Are you playing a game?</p> <p>That question has haunted Dear Esther, an interactive exploration of love and grief, since its arrival as a modification to the sci-fi shooter Half-Life in 2008. Developed by a small team of researchers at the University of Portsmouth and later released as a standalone game, it treated the player as a tourist rather than a resident. Your agency in this beautifully drawn world is restricted to movement. The story washes over you like a tide rolling pebbles along the beach. </p> <p>This week, publisher Curve Digital is releasing Dear Esther: Landmark Edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One \u2013 an enhanced and updated version of the 2012 PC release. It remains a stark and spellbinding experience, which renders its lonely island in scintillating detail. The story of an unnamed narrator trudging through the grass and sand, reading out letters meant for his dead wife, Esther, remains elusive and haunting, the exact time and place of the action obfuscated behind historical yarns and recollections, as though the island is exerting its own autobiography onto the telling. Snippets of the story are provided in a randomised order, so that each playthrough reveals different angles and images. The interactivity is mostly interpretive \u2013 the player has to work out exactly how Esther died, and who is responsible, and where really is the narrator now? But even that description is misleading, because there is no compulsion toward interpretation. You can just walk and listen to the beautiful music. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b36fa3e50d9012c586d8306eb0ea1336c8f91fd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b36fa3e50d9012c586d8306eb0ea1336c8f91fd4/94_0_2811_1688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Firewatch looks like a survival sim, but what you\u2019re really grappling with is solutitude\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Firewatch looks like a survival sim, but what you\u2019re really grappling with is solutitude</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Campo Santo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, of course, we recognise Dear Esther as one of the originators in a new sub-genre of games, often termed walking sims. Subsequent titles such as Gone Home, Firewatch and the Stanley Parable have taken the premise of a minimalist interactive experience, and pushed it in new directions, though the fundaments are often the same: no puzzles, no enemies, just story, sound and movement. Newcomers like <a href=\"http://www.grave-game.com/\">The Grave</a> and <a href=\"http://nitengame.com/\">Niten</a> promise to take things further.</p> <p>All of these titles could be easy to dismiss as experimental diversions, a cluster of outliers far from the rest of the industry. But that\u2019s not really how it\u2019s turned out. Dear Esther, and titles like it, have introduced all sorts of interesting questions to the game development community. They have made designers think differently about elements like pace, environmental storytelling and meaning. </p> <p>Richard Lemarchand, lead designer on the first three Uncharted titles, has talked about how The Graveyard, a 2009 game by Belgian studio Tale of Tales influenced the famed \u201cPeaceful Village\u201d scene in the second instalment of Naughty Dog\u2019s blockbusting series. Nathan wanders through a Nepalese town, indulging in amusing but ultimately pointless interactions with the locals, kicking footballs, patting bulls, chatting \u2013 just as in The Graveyard, the character simply walks along a cemetery path, taking in the sights and sounds. We have seen the influence of walking sims in modern horror titles such as Soma and Vanishing of Ethan Carter \u2013 both emphasising environment and atmosphere over interaction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de910717209865baf9f699a9fa9e15627f8eefb0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de910717209865baf9f699a9fa9e15627f8eefb0/6_0_538_323/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Graveyard, a simple game that inspired the Uncharted series\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Graveyard, a simple game that inspired the Uncharted series</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tale of Tales</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stripped of traditional ludic elements, walking sims give the player room to really investigate the feel of every location, to think about the characters, to relate to them on a human level rather than as agents of action. Portland-based developer The Fullbright Company was inundated with messages from players who saw their own lives and struggles reflected in Gone Home, a domestic drama about first love and family breakdown. Firewatch, a game about loneliness and isolation, set in the Wyoming wilderness, got a lot of players thinking about <a href=\"http://www.dualshockers.com/2016/02/29/firewatch-how-a-game-about-loneliness-brought-me-closer-to-other-people/\">the emotional distance in their own lives</a>. </p> <p>First-person shooters like Doom and Unreal revolutionised our understanding of space, structure and embodiment in games. They put players into the body of a killing machine and set them lose. First-person walking sims have taken the environmental lessons, the same ideas of architectural structure as a form of storytelling, and diverted the focus from action to introversion. They leave the player alone in a world with their own thoughts. </p> <p>Playing Dear Esther now it seems crazy that its release was almost provocative. It angered people \u2013 people who tossed around definitions of what a game should be; definitions that would always lead to more questions, more exceptions, more problems. We have seen a similar reaction to No Man\u2019s Sky, its soulful, minimalist approach to space exploration at odds with the expectations and ambiguous hype. Weird games still have the power to shock and create fury, which is probably a good thing. </p> <p>People are always asking questions about the boundaries of art \u2013 what qualifies and what doesn\u2019t. This debate has been transposed onto games. What Dear Esther, and all walking sims tell us, is that there are different kinds of challenge and agency in this medium. Depth is not purely systemic. Dear Esther, like its spiritual successor Everybody\u2019s Gone to the Rapture, simulates walking through a kind of installation. You have to work with it; you fill in the gaps.</p> <p>It was a determination to reduce the elements of a first-person shooter to the absolute fundamentals that led to the development of Dear Esther. Since then, the genre has become an important force in its own right. Mainstream game developers play indie games; their teams have similar ideas and wonder about similar questions. It is possible to see the influence of experimental games in the Bioshock series, in the work and philosophy of Ubisoft, even in the Call of Duty series, where the surreal, hallucinogenic memory sequences that have come to typify the Black Ops titles, with the same focus on environmental and audio effect over player input. </p> <p>The walking sims have given permission for games to slow down, place the emphasis on player interpretation, and tell interesting stories through scenery and props and artefacts without resorting to graffiti. Perhaps we won\u2019t appreciate their full impact until virtual reality goes mainstream; with an input technology that utterly gives itself to the idea of immersion and second-by-second experience, those quiet moments of reflection, those detailed landscapes, those almost theatrical techniques and stories will make complete sense. Perhaps more than any other genre, the walking sim is preparing us for a future of synthetic worlds. <br></p>",

Speaking to the Guardian, he discussed his longshot bid for the White House and his disdain for those on the right who have failed to stand up to Trump, who is now closing in on Hillary Clinton <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">in presidential polling</a>.</p> <p>In McMullin\u2019s view, the forces that drove the British vote to leave the European Union and have aided the rise of Trump are part of the \u201csame movement, fueled largely by the Russians who seek to destabilize eastern and western Europe as well as North America through fomenting discord between different racial groups, different ethnic groups and different religious groups\u201d.</p> <p>McMullin, who spent a decade at the CIA, will make a foreign policy speech in Washington on Tuesday focusing on the global threats to US national security. </p> <p>He said he felt comfortable viewing Trump from Putin\u2019s perspective. \u201cI received the same training that Vladimir Putin did. He received it from KGB. I received it from the CIA. Vladimir Putin trained to identify weaknesses in people and exploit them for intelligence purposes.\u201d<br></p> <p>McMullin said Putin saw weaknesses in Trump \u2013 \u201cego, financial vulnerabilities\u201d \u2013 and also \u201cin a different sort of a way an alignment ideologically, at least as it pertains to leadership\u201d.</p> <p>As a political rookie and rank outsider, McMullin freely admits his own weakness. Aside from the benefits of understanding the Russian president, he says, there may not be \u201ca lot of parallels frankly, between what I am doing now and what I did in the CIA\u201d. He takes pains to note his experience working on Wall Street for Goldman Sachs, however, and as policy director for the House Republican Conference on Capitol Hill.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I am not a racist and most Democrats aren\u2019t racists either\u2019</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-barack-obama-birther-theory-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53bhd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2724745\"            data-video-name=\"A short history of Donald Trump's 'birther' conspiracy \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"ABC/The View, NBC/Today show, PBS Newshour, Donald Trump/YouTube, MSNBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57dc5c11e4b0df02df202fd1\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/16/160916birther_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/16/160916birther.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/16/160916birther_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-barack-obama-birther-theory-video\">Donald Trump\u2019s birther comments: a short history</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>McMullin has barely made a ripple since he declared his candidacy in August, motivated he said because he felt there had to be some alternative to the choices being offered. </p> <p>\u201cI firmly believe,\u201d he said, \u201cthat someone needed to step up and stand in contrast to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/17/elizabeth-warren-bernie-sanders-donald-trump-bigotry\">Donald Trump\u2019s bigoted rhetoric</a> and his allegiance to Vladimir Putin and at the same time to Hillary Clinton\u2019s promotion of large centralized government that is unaccountable to American people.\u201d </p> <p>He was dismissive of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/gary-johnson-and-jill-stein-not-allowed-in-first-televised-debate\">the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson</a>, whom he described as not \u201csuitable to be a leader of the free world\u201d. Johnson, a two-term Republican governor of New Mexico, has polled at around 8% nationally \u2013 not enough to qualify for the first presidential debate on 26 September. In contrast, McMullin has struggled to gain any traction at all. </p> <p>In one sense, that is part of his plan. As he is not on the ballot in enough states to get 270 electoral votes, it is impossible for him to win the White House outright. Therefore, his goal is to force and exploit electoral deadlock. The <a href=\"http://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xii\">12th amendment</a> says that if no candidate receives 270 electoral votes, the House of Representatives chooses, with one vote for each state, from among the top three candidates who received electoral votes. McMullin is hoping to win such votes from at least one state in the Mountain West. In Utah, strongly conservative but also strongly anti-Trump, he is polling at 9%.</p> <p>Should deadlock be reached, McMullin imagines a whole new campaign in which he, Trump and Clinton would compete in the Republican-dominated House, a chamber where, he thinks, Clinton would never stand a chance. At that point, he thinks Republicans in the House would realize \u201cI am more aligned with them on issues than Trump\u201d and Democrats would support him too. </p> <p>\u201cI am not a racist and most Democrats aren\u2019t racists either,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Of course, McMullin acknowledges that such goals will be very difficult to achieve, depending as they do \u201con variables that we don\u2019t control and very few that we do\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cBut it is what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are realistic about it.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018It\u2019s about trust more than issues\u2019</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/17/american-dream-divided-nation-equal-opportunity-trump-clinton-campaign\">Two American Dreams: how a dumbed-down nation lost sight of a great idea</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While his ambition relies on draining votes from Democrats as well as Republicans, McMullin did not have an immediate answer for why Democrats unhappy with Hillary Clinton, especially those who supported Bernie Sanders in the primary, should support him. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good question and I don\u2019t exactly know the answer to it,\u201d he said. \u201cI do have a theory based on some comments because we do have Bernie Sanders people coming to us saying we\u2019re going to support you and people who have supported Hillary Clinton but have grown concerned about the stories that have come out about Clinton Foundation and other things.\u201d </p> <p>Such people, he said, knew they didn\u2019t agree with him on many issues, particularly social concerns, but viewed him as trustworthy in a way Clinton is not. \u201cIt\u2019s about trust more than issues,\u201d he said.</p> <p>McMullin has taken some stances that do not accord with mainstream conservative thought.

  "<p>The Emmys broadcast on Sunday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/19/emmys-2016-tv-ratings-abc-jimmy-kimmel\">was the lowest in recorded history</a> for the second year in a row. Last month MTV\u2019s Video Music Awards lost a third of its audience from the previous year even though Beyonc\u00e9, a category three supernova with her own gravitational pull, was performing. Last February the Oscars were at an eight-year ratings low and the same month the Grammys were at the bottom of their own seven-year ditch. It\u2019s official: everyone is tired of awards shows.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/19/emmy-awards-2016-review-game-of-thrones-people-v-oj\">2016 Emmys broke more than one trend: this was an awards show that didn't suck</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If we look at the Emmys in particular, this broadcast raked in an average of 11.3 million viewers, down slightly from the 11.9 million who watched last year, but it was particularly bad in the under-49 demographic that advertisers crave in the same way Julia Louis-Dreyfus craves an all-time Emmy win record.</p> <p>There are some reasons why this broadcast did especially poorly. The four major networks take turns hosting the show and this year it was ABC\u2019s shot. They don\u2019t have any NFL games early Sunday evening to syphon viewers into the awards show like Fox did last year, giving it a bump. Also, they were up against football on NBC, which probably drained away some people who otherwise would have been interested in Kate McKinnon\u2019s acceptance speech.</p> <p>Then there is the larger question about why people are so apathetic against award shows these days. One factor might be fatigue with all of the presentations one has during the year, not just the Emmys, Grammys, Oscars and Tonys that make up the coveted EGOT, but there are also the Golden Globes, the VMAs, the Billboard Music awards, the Country Music awards, the BET awards, the People\u2019s Choice awards, the Critics Choice awards, and countless others. Heck, even the stodgy old Peabody awards had <a href=\"http://www.peabodyawards.com/stories/story/peabody-awards-sign-3-year-contract-with-pivot-tv\">a telecast last year</a>.</p> <p>The reason for the proliferation was that there was a surge in ratings for awards shows several years ago. The Emmys were gaining in momentum and in 2013 had an especially highly rated year with 17.6 million viewers. In 2014, the Oscars also had a strong year (12 Years a Slave won) with 43.7 million viewers, but just two years later those numbers were down to 34.4 million (Spotlight won).</p> <p>The spike, which was also felt by the Grammys and other shows, was blamed on social media. The theory was that people wanted to watch in real time and talk about the events with their friends on Facebook and Twitter, so it was actually bringing people back to live television after years of ratings erosion thanks the DVRs and other \u201ctime shifting\u201d techniques. This is why awards shows became so important, because it was one of the few ways networks could get people to actually watch the commercials.</p> <p>Broadcasters started to put all their eggs in the awards show basket, along with betting on sporting events and those live musicals that everyone is doing now. But even those are experiencing diminished returns. Ratings were down 15% for the 2016 games in Rio and none of NBC\u2019s musical outings like Peter Pan (9.2 million viewers) or The Wiz (11.5 million) could outperform its inaugural Sound of Music Live (18.3 million).</p> <p>It appears that the novelty of live events has worn off. Even just a couple years later we live in a much more \u201con demand\u201d universe where people can hardly even stomach a 15 second ad before watching the new Rihanna video. How can they deal with four to five breaks an hour backed full with the stuff of consumerism that pays the networks bills?</p> <p>Speaking of the internet, part of the problem has to do with how the cord-cutters are watching awards shows. While the VMAs drew only 6.5 million viewers, <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/tv-ratings-vmas-plummet-mtv-1201846812/\">MTV said</a> live streams of the event soared 70% over 2015 to 62.8 million video streams. Also, many viewers know that the key events, great performances and memorable speeches from every awards show will be available online the next day so they only have to watch the few four-minute clips that everyone is talking about rather than slog through three hours of self-congratulations and more car commercials than even the biggest Top Gear enthusiast could stomach.</p> <p>There is also something about the awards themselves. While the host doesn\u2019t seem to matter too much (sorry, Jimmy Kimmel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/19/jimmy-kimmel-host-emmy-awards-2016-best-lines\">you were great</a>) there has been some correlation at the Oscars between high ratings and blockbusters being nominated for best picture. The all-time high Oscars telecast was in 1998, when 57.2 million people watched James Cameron become king of the world for Titanic, one of the highest-grossing movies of all time.</p> <p>That may be the problem that the Emmys is currently facing. While critics generally <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-emmys-become-an-actual-good-awards-show\">praised the festivities</a> and best drama winner Game of Thrones is a huge cultural phenomenon, most at home have barely even heard of Baskets (which averages about 500,000 viewers on FX) or know why Louie Anderson really deserved his best supporting actor in a comedy trophy for appearing on it. The same goes for American Crime, the Sherlock made-for-TV movie, and possibly even Master of None (but we\u2019ll never know because Netflix still won\u2019t release ratings information). While it\u2019s way more cool to watch HBO, Netflix, Amazon, or even cable networks like FX or AMC, more people still watch network shows which are noting more than a blip on the Emmy ballot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/gallery/2016/sep/19/the-best-images-from-the-emmy-awards-2016-in-pictures\">The best images from the Emmy awards 2016 \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So, what can awards shows do to get back their cultural relevance, or at least their high viewing numbers? Well, obviously giving all the gold to comic book movies and the Big Bang Theory is one option, but nothing that critics or the Academies would really be happy about. The thing about this rapidly changing television environment is that no one has quite figured it out. The answer is probably a combination of having cheaper shows streamed directly to fans with a collection of the best bits edited together for general TV consumption. Most people just want to see the winners, a great performance or two, and the best and worst fashions of the night, not <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sla0lcVWH6Y\">Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s mom making everyone PB&amp;Js</a>. <br><br>But getting people to watch linear television and paying attention to the ads that support it is something not only facing the Emmys but many of the actual shows leaving triumphant on Sunday night. Perfecting its award show is something that is going to have to wait until the TV industry answers questions about its own survival.</p>",

Here we look at the critical work the organisation\u2019s volunteers do every single day.</em></p> <p>Aleppo and its surrounding area has seen much of the fighting in Syria over the past five years. For the Aleppo branch of SARC, run mostly by young volunteers who have given up other careers to do this work, the demands have grown from health and food parcels to pest control, mending water pumps, and running projects for street children. SARC is non political and is one of the only agencies able to cross the conflict\u2019s front lines.</p> <h2>\u2018Never have I seen children so motivated to learn\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d7754c7fe30b1f6a283a56903aed7f293ac6b9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d7754c7fe30b1f6a283a56903aed7f293ac6b9f/0_145_2272_1363/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Around 60 children live in shelters with their families in the rural area of Al-Majbal after fleeing Aleppo. In a makeshift tent, volunteers from SARC\u2019s psychosocial support team provide activities for the children. Most have not been able to go to school in some time, if at all. \u201cNever ever I have seen children so motivated to learn as these,\u201d says Qamar, a volunteer who is teaching basic numeracy and literacy. </p> <h2>Alone, homeless and begging to survive </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57287908a4dfc64b150da53cc150ad29ac0c177d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57287908a4dfc64b150da53cc150ad29ac0c177d/0_29_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A volunteer helps a child write her name\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>One of the most devastating impacts of the conflict has been on children who have been left homeless, alone and begging on the street in order to survive. Here, Mirna, who is 13, learns to write her name at a SARC project for street children in Aleppo, which provides welfare and support to 75 children. Abed, the SARC volunteer says: \u201cThis project has made a great impression on Mirna and other children, as they have been able to integrate well into their communities. Mirna is more confident and she likes to write her name everywhere. It is a fabulous feeling for her.\u201d</p> <h2>Displaced for the third time in two years</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16254147ee7fb0bad2caa4ede3067ff9a7ffd90b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16254147ee7fb0bad2caa4ede3067ff9a7ffd90b/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A boy is helped to walk to a mobile clinic by his mother and brother\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Radwan (centre) is helped to a SARC mobile clinic by his mother and brother to have his bandage changed, a daily task for the medical team.

She is also the sole carer for eight children. </p> <p>Many thousands of displaced people within Syria are struggling with existing health conditions. The drive to find safety comes first, and medical needs are often neglected by parents desperate to settle their children in a new location. A mobile health team from SARC has been able to provide Mrs Amina with the necessary medications at her new shelter in a public park.

  "<p>The outboard motor roared into life and the rope snapped tight, flicking sand across the beach. For a fraction of a second, the inertia of half a ton of concrete held sway before the entire construction slid down the runners and into the surf.

The sky was as blue as the over-saturated images in holiday brochures. The island\u2019s capital, St. Georges, with its busy harbour, was a few miles north. Just off Grenada\u2019s most spectacular beach I slipped below the surface to explore one dive centre\u2019s attempt to turn back the tide of coral reef decline.</p> <p>Coral reefs in the Caribbean region (and the entire tropical western Atlantic) have not had it easy. The effects of hurricanes, overfishing, El Ni\u00f1o events, pollution, invasive species, sea urchin die-off and mass tourism have combined over time to see coral cover on some reefs decline by over 90%. Native fish are threatened by the invasive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2016/jul/19/invasive-lionfish-have-reached-the-mediterranean-luckily-theyre-tasty-\">lionfish</a> from the Indo-Pacific, and the targeting, by local fishermen, of important and \u201creef-maintaining\u201d fish species such as parrotfish, has further hampered the reefs\u2019 recovery. Many reefs, once densely populated with hard corals, are overgrown with sponges and algae. </p> <p>Across the region, the more forward-thinking dive centres and networks of local tourism businesses are looking beyond tours which traditionally visit existing reefs and are creating their own.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d694d82e40e2dc606e74c684294c15a8f627399\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d694d82e40e2dc606e74c684294c15a8f627399/0_0_664_1000/664.jpg\" alt=\"An older section of the artificial reef showing signs of colonisation.\" width=\"664\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An older section of the artificial reef showing signs of colonisation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Aspinall/Triggerfish Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As I dived, there it was, clean and virginal: the new piece of this artificial reef. It had come to rest almost flat on the bottom, around fifteen metres down. Around it were other artificial coral pinnacles, already hosting shoals of snapper, flashing yellow and silver in the tropical sun. I even spotted a few urchins grazing on algae. By doing so, they were helping coral larvae to settle from the water and find a foothold. Thankfully, urchin numbers are recovering after their disease-driven decline and mass die-off in the 1980s. </p> <p>The team decided to move the newcomer into position. They attached a sling and a lift bag, and began to fill it with air from their cylinders. As the bag filled, the reef swayed a little and then rose towards the surface, like a giant heavy basket under a balloon. With four strong men to each corner, slowly the reef was pushed and pulled to slot in amongst a dozen or so similar structures built and dropped over the last few years. The oldest of these were increasingly covered in the dense matrix of reef life. Peering at the concrete blocks I could see evidence of their slow colonisation by encrusting bivalves - delicate tree-like growths of hydrozoans - and, hiding from the daylight, shoals of nocturnal soldierfish rested, waiting for the night.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94943fe1e7635a1bbdabc60ca362651d4b0f9e62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94943fe1e7635a1bbdabc60ca362651d4b0f9e62/0_63_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The new section of reef being manoeuvred into place next to a more established pinnacle of the reef.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The new section of reef being manoeuvred into place next to a more established pinnacle of the reef.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Aspinall/Triggerfish Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As I swam amongst the artificial pinnacles, the shoals of snapper swam from one \u2018to another.

It\u2019s helping women engage | Suzanne Moore</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We found the Momentum national office supportive and helpful, and we agreed a comprehensive plan to ensure that single parents and sole carers (of whom there are many in our 18,000-strong organisation) have access to cooperatively run breakfast clubs, after-school sessions and the childcare they need to facilitate their political engagement.</p> <p>As soon as this went public, we were met with a barrage of abuse. Just weeks after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/30/jeremy-corbyn-appears-compare-israeli-government-islamic-state-labour-antisemitism-review\" title=\"\">Shami Chakrabarti\u2019s report</a> rightly slammed spurious Nazi comparisons, our plan for accessible childcare was compared to the Hitler youth. \u201cTiny Trots\u201d was the running headline on Sky News. We were accused of wanting to run Stalinist indoctrination camps for children, and met with the usual abuse and trolling that is now commonplace for women (and apparently, particularly leftwing women) on the internet. We were also accused of (somehow) distracting from the task of getting a Labour government in place that would provide childcare for all.</p> <p>People might do well to remember that the last Labour government cut benefits for single parents in its first year of office. Vulnerable people need a Labour government, but Labour activists need to argue within our party for it to deliver on its promises once in power. A key way of doing that is ensuring our party is vibrant, welcoming and outward-looking on the ground \u2013 which is what Momentum Kids is about.</p> <p>It\u2019s laughable to suggest that we want to indoctrinate children \u2013 far from it. The children\u2019s activities on offer will be about making positive change, creativity and discovery. Global charity WE (formerly Free the Children) runs <a href=\"https://www.we.org/\" title=\"\">\u201cWE Day\u201d</a>, which has involved children making their own placards about issues that matter to them, in part to raise awareness of the plight of children in poorer countries.

The Labour party is there to bring together the different issues we experience and propose a coherent political programme of solutions, and then implement it in government. It cannot do that by treating elections as standalone events, won by a few weeks of knocking on doors to deliver a couple of key lines based on policies drawn up in spin rooms.</p> <p>It has to be a living presence in people\u2019s communities, gathering information, campaigning alongside and listening to people, and proving itself worthy of being handed the keys to power when it comes to election time.

  "<p>Hillary Clinton is having a harder time beating Donald Trump than she bargained for. According to a <a href=\"https://www.qu.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2378\">recent poll</a>, a staggering 44% of millennials say they\u2019ll be voting for either Green party candidate Jill Stein or Libertarian Gary Johnson. The chief reason for Clinton\u2019s dip in these polls is not \u2013 as Barack Obama <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/18/obama-says-sexism-could-lead-voters-to-back-trump-over-clinton/\">claimed</a> on Sunday \u2013 that she\u2019s a woman (though sexism does have a lot to answer for). It\u2019s because Clinton has assumed a third of the electorate \u2013 millennials \u2013 would vote for her out of fear of her opponent.<br></p> <p>Simply put, we want more. <br></p> <p>Millennials are the generation that has occupied Wall Street, shut down bridges for black lives and chained ourselves to the White House fence to stop the Keystone XL pipeline. Disillusioned by Obama\u2019s embrace of war and austerity alike \u2013 especially after knocking on doors to get him elected \u2013 we know better than to put blind faith in any candidate for the Oval Office. <br></p> <p>What Clinton can do now is prove that she\u2019s listening. Doing so could bear fruit in the polls, but only if she shows she\u2019s willing to part ways with her billionaire friends and push for policies that are in line with what millennials really want.<br></p> <p>Since the Democratic national convention, Clinton and Trump have peddled their own politics of fear. Hers: of an ascendant far-right. His: of immigrants and the prospect of a truly multi-racial democracy. If Bernie Sanders\u2019 primary campaign showed anything, though, it\u2019s that young Americans are eager to vote <em>for </em>something \u2013 not against it. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://soundcloud.com/politics-for-humans-guardian-us/its-millennial-week-in-election-season-politics-for-humans-podcast\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F283806286&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Laying out plans for single-payer healthcare and a $15 minimum wage, Sanders beat Clinton among millennials in each one of the 27 states where they faced off in the primaries. And he might still be the most popular politician in the US today.<br></p> <p>At a time when Americans across the political spectrum are turning against the status quo, Clinton seems to be embracing it. She spent weeks in August wooing millionaire donors in Silicon Valley and Martha\u2019s Vineyard, and has chased endorsements from Bush-era official and war criminals like Henry Kissinger. It\u2019s out of frustration that millennials will register protest votes, not ignorance.<br></p> <p>Make no mistake: a vote for either Jill Stein or Gary Johnson in a swing state is a vote for Trump, and could land the US in a situation more dangerous and unstable than any it has known yet. Clinton is this country\u2019s best hope right now. Especially if we want to avoid a future defined by hostility towards immigrants and people of color, the near certainty of catastrophic global warming and a disastrous economic plan ripped straight from the Tea Party\u2019s playbook.<br></p> <p>But making sure that painful, hate-filled future never comes to pass is up to the Clinton campaign now, and its ability to make an earnest and heartfelt appeal to the future of the Democratic party. <br></p> <p>So what is it that millennials actually want? Around 70% favor wealth redistribution, one Gallup poll found, and many are eager to avoid six-figure debt for things like education and routine visits to the doctor\u2019s office. The Movement for Black Lives released a detailed policy agenda this summer with plenty of ideas for senior Clinton staffers, and round-the-clock protests against the Dakota Access pipeline should give them a sense for where young Americans stand on new fossil fuel infrastructure and violations of indigenous rights.<br></p> <p>For the most progressive and diverse generation in history, Trump represents virtually everything our generation is against. Clinton represents everything that hasn\u2019t worked for us. Her embrace of politics as usual these last few months could cost her the election, putting Trump in the White House and emboldening his most dangerous supporters. Either way, Trumpism will grow so long as elites are setting the political agenda.<br></p> <p>Millennial-led movements, meanwhile, are showing a way forward, free of fear-mongering and full of hopeful visions for a fairer future. If defeating Trump means voting for Clinton \u2013 and it does \u2013 defeating the toxic ideology that surrounds him means she needs to take these movements\u2019 advice seriously.<br></p>",

While certain honeybees have defence strategies to reduce damage, including forming a mass of bees around the hornet, raising the temperature to a lethal 45C, Fera says the European honeybee is less effective at this \u201cheat-balling\u201d.</p> <p>In terms of the risk to humans, Shardlow said: \u201cThis is a fairly big wasp. Generally the bigger they are, the less aggressive they are. There are no bigger threat to humans than the wasps we already have.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>One live hornet and one dead one were spotted by government experts but as yet no nests. The National Bee Unit in North Yorkshire is conducting DNA tests on the dead hornet in an attempt to discover how it arrived in the UK.

They are traditional British Labour politics: a belief in social solidarity and equality, in freedom and responsibility, in security and prosperity for all, and an undying faith in democracy and the Labour party as the only means to achieve any of it.</p> <p>That faith was never blind, it comes from our history of delivering material social and economic progress for the people of our country, through winning the arguments and winning power. Our record of achievement, from the creation of the NHS and comprehensive education to the advent of a minimum wage, is why Labour can proudly claim to be the greatest movement for economic justice and social mobility that Britain has ever created. And it is precisely that history and its precious legacy that is at risk in this campaign.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2016/sep/07/why-labour-is-putting-energy-reform-at-heart-of-its-green-agenda-jeremy-corbyn\">Why Labour is putting energy reform at the heart of its green agenda | Jeremy Corbyn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The greatest lesson that we can take from our history is that we can only implement our vision and apply our values when we win power and form a government. And today, with Jeremy Corbyn as our leader, even in the sixth year of a radical, rightwing and failing Tory government, the straight-talking truth is that we look further from power than we have done for generations.</p> <p>The reason I am running in this campaign is that I am not prepared to sit by, as I was forced to in the 1980s and 90s, and see Labour\u2019s legacy dismantled by the Tories, as we turn inwards, away from unity, away from voters and away from any prospect of power. It\u2019s not just the Labour party that can\u2019t afford to make that mistake again, the people who need a Labour government now can\u2019t afford us to make that mistake.</p> <p>They are not interested in some soap opera about the PLP or the leaders\u2019 office. They don\u2019t care about Momentum\u2019s Marxist critique of the crisis in capitalism, or talk of coups and deselection. What they want is a Labour party that looks like a credible alternative to the Tories. They want a progressive party of the left, with radical plans to even things up in our deeply unequal society, but one rooted in the everyday concerns of the British people. And the way we go about proving we\u2019re up to the task is by being good at our current job of opposition, and looking ready for the next job, as a government.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The victories I helped win \u2013 on tax credits and disabled people\u2019s benefits \u2013 are our most important ones in opposition</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now if I felt Corbyn was able to achieve either of those goals, I would still be serving in his shadow cabinet. But I do not, and that is why I am standing to replace him. Because I think the evidence of the last year is that Corbyn, for all his experience, is not suited to the task of opposing the Tories effectively in parliament, still less at building a united Labour team and a credible programme for government. And I believe that I am.</p> <p>My evidence is the success I\u2019ve had in my short time in parliament at opposing the Tories, on health and social security, on their assault on public services and working people. The victories I helped win \u2013 on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/25/george-osborne-u-turn-scrap-tax-credit-cuts-autumn-statement\" title=\"\">tax credits</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/21/stephen-crabb-government-u-turns-disability-cuts-leaves-budget-disarray\" title=\"\">disabled people\u2019s benefits</a> \u2013 are our most important ones in opposition. Just as important is my ability to build a Labour team of all our talents. Over 100 Labour MPs nominated me to lead our party, and I would be able to unite us in parliament, as Corbyn cannot.</p> <p>Finally, there is the policy programme I have brought forward. It\u2019s a plan to turn our anti-austerity rhetoric into a radical but tangible plan for prosperity. A \u00a3200bn \u201cnew deal\u201d to invest in the schools and skills, hospitals and housing stock that we need. A fair deal on taxation to rebuild an NHS that the Tories has brought to its knees. And a revolution in rights and rewards, increasing security, pay, terms and conditions for millions of British men and women.</p> <p>But to deliver any of that, we have to win. And with just a few days to go in this contest and with thousands yet to vote, I am asking every Labour member, supporter and trade union affiliate to reflect on our history, to look to our future, and give me your vote and let me lead us back to power.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>The fraught future of Europe</strong><br></h2> <p>Your headline coverage of the hardening of attitudes to refugees and the corresponding rise of the far right in Europe made gloomy reading for me <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/01/alan-kurdi-death-one-year-on-compassion-towards-refugees-fades\" title=\"\">(9 September)</a>. All the more so because it reflects a similar hardening of attitudes towards refugees evident here in Australia.</p> <p>On a recent flight from Dubai to Adelaide my wife Julie and I encountered Syrian refugees bound for re-settlement in South Australia. They were in a state of anxious anticipation at the prospect of new life down under. But, much more than this, they were relieved to be escaping the holocaust in their homeland.</p> <p>I hope that promise of a new life is fulfilled. The odds are very much with them that it will. But it won\u2019t be completely plain sailing for them here in terms of acceptance by any means.</p> <p>They are starting out on a new life in a nervous society where buses for the first time ask passengers to be wary of unattended luggage, where government warnings encourage us to report anything that \u201cdoesn\u2019t look right\u201d, where an innocent question from a Syrian refugee to a policeman can be enough for that refugee to have his details written down as a routine security precaution, where our cyberspace is full of the most puerile anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant nonsense, where far rightists on immigration have just had marked success in our recent national election, and where a barbaric refugee policy still has strong public support.</p> <p>Let\u2019s hope we can buck our own version of the far-rightist trend you identify for Europe.

I totally agree that \u201cthe so-called Franco-German engine ... is broken \u2013 mainly because of France\u2019s economic weaknesses\u201d.

Anything above 6% is in violation of EU rules.</p> <p>Where are the politicians and journalists to shine the brightest light on this destruction of other nations\u2019 economies?

Like it or not, the Brexit decision pinpoints wide disillusionment in the UK with the apparent evolution of the EU into an unwitting instrument of the uneven distribution of power and wealth.</p> <p>The imminent withdrawal of Britain may have an even greater impact on the EU. It must contribute to the growing dissent among EU members suffering the dual impacts of austerity and the influx of refugees.</p> <p>That the European experiment is still worth pursuing goes without saying. In our current geopolitical context, even major economies such as Germany stand little chance on their own of competing with the superpowers, China and America.

  "<p>It was a big weekend for the Cleveland Indians. The Detroit Tigers were in town, and the AL Central title was at stake. The Tigers came in six games back, but the three-game series was the first of seven encounters between the two teams before the end of the season. For the Indians, the math was simple: win this series, and the Tigers would move far enough back in the rear-view mirror to practically assure a Cleveland playoff spot in October.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/15/jaime-jarrin-los-angeles-dodgers-announcer-vin-scully\">Jaime Jarr\u00edn: the remarkable story of the Latino Vin Scully</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Indians won the series 2-1, and the magic number to clinch the division dropped to seven with 13 games to play. There was baseball excitement in Cleveland. Maybe a Tribe championship to follow the Cavaliers\u2019 riveting NBA title a few months ago? A chance for a city that has had a professional baseball team since 1869 to win its first title since 1948.</p> <p>You\u2019d think that a ticket to the Indians-Tigers series would have been hard to come by, given the longtime rivalry \u2013 the Tigers and the Indians entered the American League in 1901 \u2013 and the implications for the postseason. But the team only drew, on average, about 25,000 for this meaningful September series, about two-thirds of the Progressive Field capacity. Tickets on StubHub were going for less than $10. And based on the number of fans wearing Tigers gear, it was obvious that a few thousand of those in attendance had driven the two and a half hours from Detroit.</p> <p>The numbers for this series were no aberration. The low attendances for the Indians this summer are causing some head-scratching among sports business experts. The team has been in first place since early June, but are third last in the league in attendance, ahead of only Oakland and Tampa Bay. The league average is about 30,000 a game, and the Indians are drawing just under 20,000.</p> <p>And yet the team has been reasonably successful over the past decade. Counting this year, the Indians have been .500 or better in six of the past 10 years, and barring some unforeseeable collapse this year will be the third playoff appearance for the Tribe in the past decade. But despite those successes, the team has been in the bottom third of Major League Baseball attendance in every one of those 10 years.</p> <p>\u201cThe attendance numbers for Cleveland are mind-boggling,\u201d said Wayne McDonnell, the academic chair of NYU\u2019s Tisch Institute of Sport Management, Media and Business and a man known as the \u201cbusiness of baseball professor\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Cleveland fans have always had a higher affinity for sports than other growing areas in the country</p> <footer> <cite>Jacob Rosen</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhat is a likely explanation, but one no one in Cleveland wants to deal with, is that maybe the city\u2019s population loss is finally hitting the sports marketplace,\u201d McDonnell continued. \u201cWhen you look at demographics and household incomes and the number of teams in a market, sports fans have to make hard decisions on where they are spending their money, and maybe Cleveland fans are choosing basketball and football over baseball because they don\u2019t have enough for all three.\u201d<br></p> <p>In the case of Cleveland baseball fans, the interest is still there, but just not enough interest to buy tickets. Proof of that is that the local TV ratings are up about 50% over last year. But Cleveland has the smallest US metro area with three of four major league sports teams (NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL), and the Cleveland metro area\u2019s average household income is the fourth lowest of the MLB team markets (ahead of only Pittsburgh, Miami and Tampa Bay). For economists, it\u2019s simple: fewer people with less money means less spending. And with the success of the Cavaliers, and the popularity of the Browns no matter how bad they are, the Indians may be the odd team out in Cleveland.</p> <p>Since 2010, only two metro markets in MLB have lost population: Cleveland and Pittsburgh. But population loss and a bad economy are only part of the reason the Indians might not be drawing; it is also hemmed in by sports market geography. Three other major league baseball teams are within 250 miles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2c88143f986eada3753bf9b777b7d4ccdf25a6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2c88143f986eada3753bf9b777b7d4ccdf25a6c/0_0_3600_2394/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tyler Naquin signs autographs for the fans at Progressive Field.

Cleveland are third last in attendance, ahead of only Oakland and Tampa Bay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Maxwell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are no reasons the Indians should not be drawing well this year under the basic criteria for the business of baseball. Besides the team being very good, the Indians and the city have invested about $40m in stadium upgrades in the past two years, including a new scoreboard, better restaurant options and more plaza areas that allow fans to move and watch the game from great sightlines. In fact, a popular ticket option started two years ago gets a fan a standing-room-only ticket and a beer for $13, and bar areas inside the stadium to sit in. Progressive Field is 22 years old, but has none of the fan dissatisfaction issues that the stadiums in, say, Tampa Bay or Oakland have.</p> <p>The team has also been overachieving in some ways, with few big-name players and a bottom-of-the-league payroll. Manager Terry Francona has gotten very good numbers from what many consider average players, and they are vying for the best record in the American League and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs (the Texas Rangers are one-and-a-half games ahead for home field). In many ways, like the city it calls home, the Indians are a hard-working, blue-collar team that one would think would appeal to the masses in north-east Ohio.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact is that this team is still popular, and we see the support in the TV ratings and people wearing Indians gear all over town,\u201d said John Adams, who has been pounding his drum in the Cleveland Indians bleachers for 43 years. \u201cBut the poverty rate here is real, and people are struggling. The comeback they are talking about in Cleveland is that we are staying afloat and not sinking. But for a family of four to spend a few hundred dollars going to a baseball game is just not doable for many here right now.\u201d</p> <p>The population numbers are daunting. The city of Cleveland itself has dropped from 500,000 in 1990 to about 385,000 today. In 1970, the Cleveland metro area had 2.3 million people; it now has 2 million. The only baseball markets that have lost population during that time are Pittsburgh and Detroit, but Detroit has about 4 million people and is still big enough to accommodate four pro sport teams. Even when the Akron-Canton and Youngstown populations are added to the mix, the Cleveland market has still diminished.</p> <p>For comparison\u2019s sake, look at Dallas-Fort Worth. In 1970, DFW was similar to the population of Cleveland with 2.4 million, but now has 7.1 million people. DFW only had the Dallas Cowboys back then, but its growth brought in teams from MLB (Rangers), the NBA (Mavericks) and the NHL (Stars). Cleveland still has three franchises \u2013 and even had an NHL team in the mid-70s. But the Cleveland population loss is even bigger when you look at the national trends: the US has had a population gain of about 50% since 1970.</p> <p>The geographical factor is also a problem. Within a two-hour drive of Progressive Field in Cleveland, there are three decent-size towns: Toledo (metro population of 650,000), Columbus (2 million) and Youngstown (550,000). But Toledo is closer to Detroit, Columbus is closer to Cincinnati, and Youngstown is closer to Pittsburgh. There are also six minor league baseball teams within two hours, which gives cheaper options for the casual baseball fan.</p> <p>There are other factors at play. The Dolan family bought the Indians after the successful 1990s, when they went to two World Series in 1995 and 1997, but attendance declined soon after and payroll spending went down significantly. Baseball is also is having trouble with younger fans; the games are too long for many and have too little action for others.</p> <p>The success of the Cavaliers with LeBron James hasn\u2019t helped, either. \u201cTo some degree, the Indians are now behind the curve [that] the Cavs\u2019 success has brought about,\u201d said Robert Boland, a professor of sports management at Ohio University. \u201cBusinesses have to buy Browns and Cavs tickets in advance because they will be gone if they don\u2019t. The Indians tickets are always there, so the business community feels they can buy them when they need to. But businesses and fans buy fewer tickets if they think they can get them at the last minute.\u201d</p> <p>Can the Indians reverse the trend? The best blueprint might be the New York Mets, which had a losing record in 2014, went to the World Series last year and are in playoff contention this year. Mets\u2019 attendance was 26,500 in 2014, and this year is at 34,500, an increase of 30%.</p> <p>But the economics might be different for Cleveland. The Indians went to the American League Championship Series in 2007, and were just one win away from the World Series. That success did not translate into increased attendance; it actually went down in 2008, by about 5% (28,500 a game to 26,700). Since 2010, the Indians have only been above the 20,000 average once.</p> <p>A part of the reason people are perplexed by this is the perception that Cleveland is such a great sports city and its fans will show up for losing teams regardless. That perception is based upon emotion, and the belief that sports teams are immune from basic economics. But the exceptions sometimes complicate those analyses. </p> <p>\u201cMathematics are important, but if they were the only predictor, Green Bay wouldn\u2019t have an NFL team and St Louis wouldn\u2019t be drawing 40,000 a game for the Cardinals,\u201d said Jacob Rosen, a sports business analyst and columnist for the Cleveland sports website Waiting For Next Year. \u201cCleveland fans have always had a higher affinity for sports than other growing areas in the country. Sports means a lot more to people in the midwest than the west coast.</p> <p>\u201cBut where [the Indians] are at right now is difficult to change; it is tough in baseball at this time to reverse sinking attendance numbers,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cThe stadium is no longer shiny and new. Casual fans have other options. But I still think winning this year and getting in the playoffs will have an effect. Fans here are very hungry for winning, and maybe we\u2019ll seen how that affects things from how the city has reacted to the Cavs\u2019 title.\u201d</p>",

On top of that, they have received extra money \u2013 outside their normal pay.</p> <p>At the start of their five-year term in office in May, President Yoweri Museveni, who has been in power for 30 years, handed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.observer.ug/news-headlines/44648-where-do-museveni-cash-envelopes-come-from\">362 legislators, mostly from his ruling party</a>, 5m shillings each as a gift. </p> <p>Analysts said it was a sweetener to legislators to vote in the speaker he wanted. It is expected that Museveni, 72, will ask MPs to remove an age-limit clause that would technically end his rule when he reached 75.</p> <p>\u201cThere is an issue of misplaced priorities,\u201d said Cissy Kagaba, the director of Anti-Corruption Coalition Uganda. \u201cPolitical benefit for the few [severely] upsets us as taxpayers. At the back of it all, roles and demands from the population remain unattended too.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Gerald Karyeija, an academic at Uganda Management Institute, said: \u201cWhenever the public sees MPs getting something, it elicits public dismay because the government has failed to delivery [to the ordinary people]. The public thinks it is getting a raw deal. The challenge is that we have a very big number [of parliamentarians] and maintaining it is very difficult.</p> <p>\u201cThe country had 382 legislators in the previous parliament. The government has created new districts to create smaller administrative units, arguing it would ease service delivery. But it has come at a cost \u2013 more MPs and other public administrators are required, eating into the money that would otherwise be used to extend social services to the locals.\u201d</p> <p>Beatrice Anywar, an independent MP, said: \u201cThe country is crying [out] for more doctors \u2026 not MPs.\u201d</p> <p>Obua agrees that Ugandans are getting a raw deal when it comes to service delivery, but said the problem was not MPs. \u201cIt is corruption. If we fought stealing of public funds, the sky is the limit for Uganda.\u201d</p> <p>Many Ugandans believe the focus should be on a smaller parliament, one that taxpayers can afford. For Mauso, basics such as drugs in hospitals should be the top priority.</p>",

  "<p>There\u2019s a great deal of crying for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/feb/10/outdated-and-resistant-to-change-how-can-we-fix-the-humanitarian-system\">\u201cchange\u201d of the aid system</a> right now: the system is unfair; the system is outdated and dysfunctional. In recent memory issues like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/nov/23/guardian-research-suggests-mental-health-crisis-among-aid-workers\">mental health of aid workers</a>, accountability, efficiency, local versus international, among many others, have rallied calls around this generalised notion that things need to change.</p> <p>This is all well and good, and in the majority of cases I agree. The aid system needs to change. We can all see it.</p> <p>But despite all of that, I have yet to meet someone who can articulate in any kind of coherent, concrete terms what changes really need to happen. One of the confounding aspects of this whole conversation is that the shouts for change tend to focus on generalities, platitudes and misdiagnosis, or a conflation of symptoms and illnesses. While these egregious ills of the aid system all seem obvious enough as we scroll through Twitter, the problem is that after agreeing in principle, we\u2019re often left with no clear sense of what comes next. </p> <p>I won\u2019t try to tell you what has to change. But I will tell you how. You want to change the aid industry? You need to follow five steps:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jan/18/will-a-grand-bargain-solve-the-humanitarian-funding-crisis\">Will a 'grand bargain' solve the humanitarian funding crisis?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>1 | Diagnose problems correctly</strong></h2> <p>The tendency right now is to shout \u2013 usually on social media \u2013 about whatever issue pisses us off today. I love ranting about celebrity advocacy but if I\u2019m honest, that stupid, ineffective celebrity advocacy is a symptom of a larger illness. It is easy to see that there are problems, but actually understanding those problems is tougher, so do the brainwork first.</p> <h2><strong>2 | Be specific</strong></h2> <p>Get away from the generalities and move towards the concrete. Most of the platitudes are no-brainers. I doubt you will find many humanitarian workers who disagree with the importance of inclusion, for example, or the importance of local. Which organisations, specifically, need to change which policies, specifically? Ask yourself: \u201cHow do I move the needle on my favourite issue?\u201d Many are passionate and outspoken about the need for change. Few have the insight needed to think through what, exactly, needs to change. </p> <h2><strong>3 | Commit to process and follow through</strong></h2> <p>The secret to changing the humanitarian system (or any other industrial complex) lies in being able to move within the system\u2019s own processes. There are no quick or simple solutions. Understand where, when and by whom the decisions that matter are made, and understand how to influence those decisions. You need to articulate what the improved state looks like, then outline the steps to get there, and then see the process through. </p> <p><em>A note, because this step is important:</em> Process and follow-through are bureaucracy. They\u2019re politics. They\u2019re not fun, and they\u2019re supremely unsexy. You\u2019re not going to get many likes on Facebook for pictures of process. But make no mistake: this is where aid industry change actually happens. I encounter ideas for positive aid industry change on a weekly basis, more or less. But the vast majority of these good and sometimes even brilliant ideas will never exist beyond the pub, the coffee room, or the Skype chat window. Why? Because they very often lack the capacity to follow through.</p> <h2><strong>4 | Articulate the day-to-day</strong></h2> <p>The big statements are easy. No one disagrees that aid should be more accountable, or that local NGOs and aid workers should have a more central role in shaping interventions meant for their own communities. But what do these mean for you and me next Tuesday? Whatever aid system change you feel needs to happen urgently, you must be able to articulate what that looks like for the rank-and-file, whether they\u2019re slogging it out in the bowels of HQ or out on the front line. Many seem to know what the head of the UN agency or the CEO of the household charity should do differently. But few seem able to say how business as usual should change for the project accountant or nutrition technical specialist or most of the other humanitarians around the world, who do the ordinary work of the industry day-in and day-out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/feb/10/outdated-and-resistant-to-change-how-can-we-fix-the-humanitarian-system\">'Outdated and resistant to change': how can we fix the humanitarian system?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>5 | Understand your pet issue in the context of time</strong></h2> <p>Be humble. Conventional development wisdom in the 1980s was to never give people actual money because they would use it badly. In the 1990s we discovered micro-credit and made peace with cash loans, but only if we changed enough interest and service fees to build sustainable micro-financial institutions (MFIs). And we trained recipients relentlessly to make sure they\u2019d know how to use money properly (I personally wrote the words \u201cnumeracy training\u201d into USAid proposals more times that I can remember during the micro-credit era). Now, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that the best way to help people is to just give them cold, hard cash with few or no follow-up expectations.</p> <p>Whether you perceive it or not, the ecosystem of aid and development entities is in a constant state of evolution \u2013 changing theory, changing practice, changing understanding about what it means to \u201chelp\u201d. Today\u2019s brilliant innovation will be tomorrow\u2019s old hat. And the practice that you so passionately evangelise this week could well be proven harmful the next. </p> <p><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\"><strong>Join our community</strong></a><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

I am grateful for the quick action of law enforcement in capturing the terrorist responsible for Saturday\u2019s bombings, and the off-duty police officer for stopping the terrorist in Minnesota. This weekend\u2019s attacks, from Minnesota to Manhattan, are just the latest to be carried out on US soil under President Obama. These should be a wake-up call for every American.</p> <p>Today, Hillary Clinton showed again that she will say anything - and blame anyone - to shift attention away from the weakness she showed as Secretary of State. The Obama-Clinton doctrine of not taking Isis seriously enough has emboldened terrorists all over the world. They are hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes President so that they can continue their savagery and murder.</p> <p>While our President has referred to them as the \u2018J.V. Team\u2019 and Hillary Clinton calls them our \u2018determined enemies,\u2019 I have been willing to call them exactly what they are: radical Islamist terrorists.</p> <p>I will bring an end to these senseless acts of violence. They are wrong to say that we\u2019re in a fight about \u2018narratives.\u2019 These terrorists pose an existential threat to our country, our values, and our way of life.</p> <p>When I am President, terrorists like today\u2019s suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings, Ahmad Khan Rahami, and yesterday\u2019s knife-wielding ISIS sympathizer in Minnesota, Dahir Adan, will be stopped. We will not look the other way. We will not allow political correctness and soft-on-terror, soft-on-crime policies to threaten our security and our lives.</p> <p>Revelations that the Obama Administration wrongly granted citizenship to over 800 immigrants awaiting deportation from countries of concern to national security or high rates of immigration fraud puts this weekend\u2019s attacks in a broader perspective. The safety and security of the homeland must be the overriding objective of our leaders when it comes to our immigration policy.</p> <p>That\u2019s why I\u2019ve proposed extreme vetting for immigrants from troubled parts of the world where terrorists live and train, and oppose Hillary Clinton\u2019s 550% increase in the number of refugees from the conflict in Syria. These are tough problems that require tough leadership. We need to get smart and get tough fast so that this weekend\u2019s attacks do not become the new normal here as it has in Europe and other parts of the world.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e03907e4b051672d9f7e2c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-19T19:14:52.227Z\">8.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Fox News Channel host and future press secretary Sean Hannity will host a town-hall meeting with Donald Trump in Ohio on Wednesday, according to Politico:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Hadas_Gold/status/777948042859257856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hannity will do a Town Hall with Trump this Wednesday in Ohio</p>&mdash; Hadas Gold (@Hadas_Gold) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Hadas_Gold/status/777948042859257856\">September 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e03541e4b0ef60eaef0f33\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-19T18:58:18.398Z\">7.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bernie Sanders is feeling the...

  "<p>A UN aid convoy delivering food relief to a rebel-held area near Aleppo was targeted in an airstrike, as a week-old ceasefire brokered by Russia and the US collapsed with a new surge of Syrian government bombing. </p> <p>The US said it blamed Russia for the attack on the convoy, whether or not Russian planes were involved, arguing Moscow was responsible under the ceasefire agreement for reining in Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government forces. </p> <p>The attack on the convoy, made up of Syrian Red Crescent trucks carrying UN-supplied food, was reported to have killed at least 12 people and destroyed 18 trucks laden with food intended for tens of thousands of people cut off by the war in a rural area west of Aleppo city. </p> <p>Aid officials said it was hit from the air while unloading food at a warehouse in opposition controlled Urem al-Kubra. Early reports suggested most of the dead were Syrian Red Crescent drivers.</p> <p>Stephen O\u2019Brien, the UN\u2019s emergency relief coordinator, said that the convoy had been clearly marked and its route had been provided to all parties to the conflict. </p> <p>\u201cLet me be clear: if this callous attack is found to be a deliberate targeting of humanitarians, it would amount to a war crime,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.unocha.org/top-stories/all-stories/syria-unsarc-convoy-hit-urum-al-kubra-northwest-aleppo-city\">O\u2019Brien said</a>. \u201cI call for an immediate, impartial and independent investigation into this deadly incident. The perpetrators should know that they will one day be held accountable for violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.\u201d</p> <p>The US state department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement: \u201cThe destination of this convoy was known to the Syrian regime and the Russian federation and yet these aid workers were killed in their attempt to provide relief to the Syrian people.\u201d<br></p> <p>Kirby added: \u201cThe United States will raise this issue directly with Russia.

US officials said that the secretary of state, John Kerry, was trying to contact his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, to assess whether the ceasefire could be salvaged, but hopes of doing so were fast dimming.</p> <p>A senior US official said: \u201cAt this point the Russians have the burden of demonstrating very quickly their seriousness of purpose because otherwise, as you say, there\u2019ll be nothing to extend and nothing to salvage.\u201d</p> <p>There was no immediate public comment from Russian officials. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/syria-map/\" data-alt=\"airstrike graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/syria-map/\">airstrike graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Hours before the convoy was struck, Kerry had pointed to the resumption of humanitarian deliveries as a sign that the ceasefire could be starting to bring benefits. But later on Monday, with the ceasefire just short of a week old, the Syrian army issued a statement blaming \u201cterrorist groups\u201d for hundreds of alleged violations and saying it would no longer observe the truce. The US-Russian ceasefire \u201cwas supposed to be a real chance to stop the bloodshed, but the armed terrorist groups flouted this agreement,\u201d the statement said.</p> <p>However both Kerry and the French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said Russia and its Syrian government allies had been responsible for the most serious violations.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality, according to the information we are getting from the ground, is that violations of the ceasefire are acts of the regime,\u201d Ayrault told reporters at the sidelines of a UN general assembly meeting in New York. </p> <p>The Syrian army declaration followed the bombing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/19/week-old-syrian-ceasefire-hangs-in-balance\">Syrian army positions</a> around Deir ez-Zour by western coalition forces including the US, Britain, Denmark and Australia. The countries involved have said the strikes were aimed at Islamic State frontline positions and unintentionally hit Syrian troops as they fought to take those positions on Tharda mountain.</p> <p>Russia has said the strikes killed 62 Syrian soldiers and injured about 100 others, and the Syrian government has described the bombing as \u201con purpose and planned in advance\u201d.</p> <p>The collapse of the ceasefire came just as humanitarian convoys had restarted to some of the 18 civilian enclaves cut off by the war, 15 of which are besieged by Syrian government forces and their allies, according to the UN. Aid officials had been optimistic than two convoys of 20 trucks each might finally reach 250,000 besieged in rebel-controlled eastern Aleppo. </p> <p>Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council and the humanitarian advisor to the UN special envoy for Syria, said the Aleppo convoys had been set to depart early on Tuesday morning. </p> <p>But Egeland told the Guardian: \u201cIt hinges on so little now. What I fear we now have is a window of opportunity that we hadn\u2019t before and we\u2019re not able to use that window of opportunity when we have it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The perfect global rugby season will never exist. Well, maybe it does on paper but not in reality. There are competing hemispheres, unions and clubs to pacify, not to mention different financial imperatives, audiences, time-zones and ambitions. Sticking half-a-dozen adolescent ferrets down your trousers simultaneously is slightly less problematic.</p> <p>Now imagine all six ferrets arriving with their own legal advisers and you begin to grasp the unenviable situation facing World Rugby as it attempts to broker a schedule that suits everyone. Small wonder the initial proposals to have emerged from negotiations have fallen short of jaw-dropping. A suspension of summer Test tours in the year after a World Cup? The northern hemisphere club season poking into June? The Six Nations staying broadly, if not exactly, where it is? We are talking cautious diplomacy, not revolution.</p> <p>Perhaps there should be gratitude for such small mercies, given the worldwide Test diary between World Cups is currently blank from 2019 onwards. There will inevitably be some sort of compromise. But what price a sport so wrapped in self-interest it cannot see the bigger picture: players abandoning cash-strapped unions to flock to wealthy club leagues overseas, a dominant world-leading side making many of their rivals look pedestrian, too many meaningless games in front of mediocre crowds. Fail to think about the many rather than just the few and everyone will be poorer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/01/global-season-new-zealand-home-nations-rugby-union-the-breakdown\">Global season will only happen if New Zealand and home nations work together | Paul Rees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So who, precisely, should any new structure be looking to satisfy? The easy answer is television, because it pays the bills. Not so fast. If your competitions are so compelling, your product so attractive, your players so skilful and the queues for tickets so long, the TV and advertising dollars will follow automatically. That is the problem, from a distance, with Super Rugby, which will continue in its present bloated format next year. Full stadia and logistical sense are only minor considerations, prompting an increasing raft of players from Australia and South Africa, in particular, to seek a more fulfilling professional life in Europe.</p> <p>No, the secret is to make the players feel they have the best of both worlds: playing a great game and not being flogged to death for the privilege of doing so. If they are fresh and playing good opposition on decent surfaces, everyone benefits. If they are happy and fulfilled, fans and advertisers will take even more of a shine to them. If they say they do not want to get on a plane every five minutes, it probably pays to listen to them.</p> <p>They also need to be protected from themselves. Watch a game of modern Premiership rugby and it is a minor miracle anyone lasts until Christmas, never mind next July when the 2017 Lions tour wraps up. Less is unquestionably more, certainly for the leading players. To expect them to prepare for 22 league games and potential play-offs, plus nine European club fixtures and a further 12 Tests per year is ludicrous; in a decade\u2019s time it will probably be illegal.</p> <p>So let\u2019s draw up something with the players\u2019 interests front and centre. They still want to play in big games for their clubs and represent their countries to the best of their ability. Having a fallow summer once in a while would be beneficial and it would help to formalise the current summer and autumn Test format as well.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/01/lions-tour-treadmill-premiership-pro-12-rugby\">Lions tour the prize but first comes treadmill even robots would find wearing | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Why not split the world rankings into groups of six \u2013 New Zealand, England, Australia, South Africa, Wales and Ireland would currently be in the premier division \u2013 and require them all to play each other in the same calendar year? England could go to NZ and Australia in June and play the remaining three in Europe in November, although there is nothing to stop the All Blacks, say, travelling north in June if required. The top two would contest the Global Test Challenge final in late November with the winners collecting the newly minted Gus Pichot trophy. The bottom two would play off, as happens in tennis\u2019s Davis Cup, to avoid dropping to the next level where Argentina, France, Scotland, Fiji, Georgia and Japan would be vying to replace them. Arrange for the Six Nations to start slightly later in March and, suddenly, there is a fresh, invigorating, more meritocratic feel to the landscape. Not to mention shorter tours.</p> <p>It will not happen immediately but let us just imagine something similar was kicking off in 2018. The draw would be made the previous year, giving everyone plenty of time to market the fixtures. The grand final could be played at a neutral venue if that helps logistically; Ireland are already due to face New Zealand in Chicago in November. Income from worldwide ticket sales, television revenue and sponsorship would be pooled and fairly allocated, rather than the host nation pocketing everything. Nor, with the final being played in the first week of December, would it clash unduly with football\u2019s World Cup.</p> <p>That would mean a player such as Dylan Hartley or Alun Wyn Jones playing 11 Tests, to include any final or play-off. A World Cup season would be the only year that figure rises to 12. Only in the two other autumns might there be traditional incoming three-Test tours to Europe, including midweek games against keen club opposition. A world club shootout between the winners of the four major competitions \u2013 Premiership, Pro12, Super Rugby and Top 14 \u2013 is another alternative.</p> <p>Domestically, things will need tweaking on a case-by-case basis. Expanding the Premiership to reflect the fact there are, at most, 16 clubs in England who can hope to sustain viable professional rugby is one option; a conference system with enhanced play-offs might work. Either way, international players would not start playing until October and would also be otherwise engaged during international periods. The European club competition would reach its climax on the first weekend in June alongside an enhanced spring-time sevens schedule.</p> <p>Two summer Tests to finish (aside from Lions years) and July and August would be hammock months in the northern hemisphere. The Top&#xa0;14 in France might have to bend slightly while the Rugby Football Union would need to swallow a significant potential reduction in Twickenham match income but the benefits of greater collective drawing power and worldwide sponsorship potential would be huge. Better-marketed women\u2019s internationals and age-grade fixtures could all further enhance the mix. Get the balance right and, in 20 years\u2019 time, there could be millions thinking: \u201cThis is far more fun than watching football.\u201d</p> <h2>Players\u2019 health check</h2> <p>Have you passed the age of 30 and played rugby union or league as either a professional, semi-professional or an amateur? If so, your sport needs you. Experts at the Carnegie Research Institute at Leeds Beckett University are looking to study how former players fare health-wise in later life, following previous studies at the Auckland University of Technology (AUT) and the University of Aberdeen. The researchers are looking to recruit \u201cas many men over 30 as possible\u201d to study whether there are any links between concussions and longer-term neurological well-being, as well as assessing the muscle, bone, joint and cardiometabolic health of former players.</p> <p>Dr Karen Hind, senior research fellow in the school of sport at Leeds Beckett, is well aware of the upside of rugby \u2013 \u201cA life of rugby provides so many benefits for those taking part\u201d \u2013 but the New Zealand study uncovered some worrying findings, suggesting former rugby players suffered from more general health issues, including arthritis and more hazardous alcohol drinking behaviour, than people who used to play non-contact sport.</p> <p>\u201cOur project will examine links between concussions and future health, but it is also a broad study of how people who played rugby are getting on later in life,\u201d said Dr Hind. \u201cWe have previously found vertebral fractures in one out of three current professional players so we will also be exploring this in retired players. We need people to enrol regardless of how they are getting on \u2013 whether they are happy and healthy or having difficulty with any aspect of their lives. We also need people who haven\u2019t taken part in rugby post-school so that we can compare findings.\u201d</p> <h2>Technology on the blink </h2> <p>A minor detail but at the last three Premiership matches attended by your correspondent \u2013 all at different grounds around the country in the past 10 days \u2013 the electronic big screen or stadium clock has been on the blink for some or all of the game. There were also issues at the Bath v Newcastle fixture. Apparently, this is often the responsibility of outside contractors rather than the individual club but, currently, spectators everywhere are not being brilliantly served.</p>",

  "<p>In January 2012, park ranger Eligio Eloy Varga was hacked to death by a machete near the border of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. This incident, still unsolved, kicks off the new documentary thriller, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://deathbyathousandcutsfilm.com/\">Death by A Thousand Cuts</a>. Airing in the Raindance film festival in London on 1 October, the film explores how the fate of forests in two neighbouring countries has exacerbated social conflict, xenophobia, poverty, and even resulted in multiple murders. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201c[Haiti and the Dominican Republic] share the island of Hispaniola, but have starkly different trajectories, in large part, related to how they have managed their natural resources,\u201d said Jake Kheel, co-director of the documentary, which won the Jury\u2019s best documentary prize at the Seattle film festival. </p> <p>The border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic is visible from satellite: the Dominican side is covered in thick forest while the Haitian is largely bare hills. </p> <p>Over hundreds of years, Haiti has lost the vast majority of its forests to charcoal production, which even today remains the primary source for cooking fuel in the impoverished country. </p> <p>Meanwhile, \u201cthe Dominican Republic, with far greater forest cover and a functioning protected area system, has become one of the strongest and most stable economies in the region and is often held as a model for natural resource protection and conservation,\u201d said Kheel. \u201cThis inequality of resources has often lead to violent conflicts.\u201d</p> <p>Working in the Sierra de Bahoruco national park, murdered park ranger Varga was tasked with combatting an epidemic of illegal deforestation for the charcoal trade that has put pressure on the park\u2019s forests and wildlife.</p> <p>Yolanda Leon, a Dominican biologist and president of local NGO, Grupo Jaragua, called Bahoruco \u201cthe jewel of the crown for Hispaniolan biodiversity.\u201d </p> <p>A part of the Jaragua-Bahoruco-Enriquillo Unesco biosphere reserve, the national park is one of the most important biodiversity sites in all of the Caribbean. It\u2019s home to the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2016/aug/11/solenodon-haiti-dominican-republic-cuba-dinosaurs-extinction\">Hispaniolan solendon</a>, a bizarre mammal that lived with the dinosaurs, as well as six critically endangered amphibians. Experts have also documented 107 bird species, including many endemic species, and more than 1,500 plants in the reserve. Many of the animals and plants found here no longer survive on the ecologically devastated Haitian side. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2016/aug/11/solenodon-haiti-dominican-republic-cuba-dinosaurs-extinction\">Dinosaur-surviving mammal endangered by stray dogs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the park has also become a flash point for Haitians desperate to make a living by producing charcoal and the Dominicans charged with protecting the forest. </p> <p>\u201cThe tragic irony, of course, is that along the border, working class Haitians and Dominicans work side-by-side and have rich and complex intermixing of language, cultural customs and traditions,\u201d said Kheel, who directed the film with Juan Mejia Botero.</p> <p>Up to 1 million Haitians live and work in the Dominican Republic, but have recently become subject to new laws that have forced mass deportations.</p> <p>Tensions between Haitians and Dominicans are largely due to \u201cracism,\u201d according to Leon. She calls it a product of national \u201cpatriotic\u2019 sentiment\u201d that portrays Dominicans as Spanish, white, and Christian versus Haitians, who are consistently painted as other, ie black, French, and voodoo-practitioners. </p> <p>\u201cThis attitude has been enforced by ruling classes and elites who profit from the cheap labour provided by Haitians to many sectors of the Dominican Republic economy without regard for humane treatment,\u201d she said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0452fe82038c28769f939665ba5377d0575b06f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0452fe82038c28769f939665ba5377d0575b06f/0_0_4608_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Most illegally-produced charcoal is smuggled to Haiti\u2019s charcoal market in Croix-des-\u00adBouquets, on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Most illegally-produced charcoal is smuggled to Haiti\u2019s charcoal market in Croix-des-\u00adBouquets, on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jake Kheel/Courtesy of Death by a Thousand Cuts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kheel, who has recently screened the film for the Dominican Republic\u2019s new environment minister, hopes his powerful documentary can create change at the top.

I think this is a grave mistake. The government, private sector, environmental groups, and society at large all have a responsibility in environmental stewardship.\u201d</p> <p>To Kheel, the only way forward is for both countries to do something they are not known for: work together. </p> <p> \u201cUntil they begin to come up with an integrated, holistic, bi-national solution, it will be difficult to see great progress made,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Shortly after Varga\u2019s murder, two Haitian men had their throats slit and bodies dumped in a canal.

  "<p>A far-reaching global trade deal being negotiated in secret could threaten the goals of the Paris climate deal by making it harder for governments to favour clean energy over fossil fuels, a leak of the latest negotiating text shows.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jun/03/wikileaks-documents-trade-in-services-agreement\">controversial</a> Trade in Services Agreement (Tisa) aims to liberalise trade between the EU and 22 countries across the global services sector, which employs tens of millions in Europe alone.</p> <p>But a new EU text seen by the Guardian would oblige signatories to work towards \u201cenergy neutrality\u201d between renewable energy and fossil fuel power, although amendments proposed by the EU would exempt nuclear power from this rule.</p> <p>The document, marked \u201climited distribution \u2013 for Tisa participants only\u201d, would also force member states to legislate against \u201canti-competitive conduct\u201d and \u201cmarket distortions\u201d in energy-related services. This is viewed by campaigners as code for state support for clean power sectors, such as wind and solar.</p> <p> A right to regulate is explicitly mentioned in the paper, but governments would first have to prove the necessity for regulations that legally constrain multinationals.</p> <p> The same clause was used in the World Trade Organisation\u2019s Gatt and Gats treaties which entered into force in 1995, and led to 44 complaints by multinationals via their governments. Of these, 43 were upheld.</p> <p>Susan Cohen Jehoram, a spokeswoman for Greenpeace, told the Guardian: \u201cWe fear the same thing will happen with Tisa but on a much larger scale, when legislation is proposed to keep temperature rises to 1.5C [above pre-industrial levels, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-key-points\">as agreed at the Paris climate summit</a>].</p> <p>\u201cIf we want to reach that target, governments will need a toolbox of measures that can give incentives to cleaner energy.

  "<p>It\u2019s a warm September afternoon in the Kallio district of Helsinki. Out in the <a href=\"http://www.hel.fi/www/uutiset/en/helsinki/franzenia-day-care-centre#\">Franzenia daycare centre</a> playground, groups of four- and five-year-olds roam contentedly. \u201cWould you like an ice-cream?\u201d asks one, having set up her elaborate \u201cstall\u201d on the edge of the sandpit.

It is a tall, somewhat dour former university building, built in the 1930s and converted to its present role last year. Yet it is in places such as this oddly homespun centre with its strange echoes of bureaucracy, walls plastered with children\u2019s art and piles of play paraphernalia, that the Finnish <a href=\"http://pasisahlberg.com/finlands-educational-success-is-no-miracle/\">education \u201cmiracle\u201d</a> starts to take shape.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/11/finland-ranked-worlds-most-literate-nation\">Finland ranked world's most literate nation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Finland, whose comprehensive school system has sat at the top of Europe\u2019s rankings for the past 16 years, the narrow, heated debates on school governance and structure that obsess the UK \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/free-schools\">free schools</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/academies\">academies</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/live/2016/sep/15/should-grammar-schools-be-scrapped-join-our-debate-12-2pm-bst\">grammars</a> \u2013 do not exist. Schools ultimately deliver academic success, the Finns would agree - and there has been intense worldwide interest in how they manage it (see below) \u2013 but they would also argue that groundwork for good school performance begins earlier, long before children enter formal school, and arguably while their future pupils are still in nappies.</p> <p>Central to early years education in Finland is a \u201clate\u201d start to schooling. At Franzenia, as in all Finnish daycare centres, the emphasis is not on maths, reading or writing (children receive no formal instruction in these until they are seven and in primary school) but creative play. This may surprise UK parents, assailed as they are by the notion of education as a competitive race. In Finland, they are more relaxed: \u201cWe believe children under seven are not ready to start school,\u201d says Tiina Marjoniemi, the head of the centre. \u201cThey need time to play and be physically active. It\u2019s a time for creativity.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c8994e410b1742fc0111c64d8d98caff9595c959\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8994e410b1742fc0111c64d8d98caff9595c959/0_54_2448_3060/800.jpg\" alt=\"Staff and children\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Franzenia daycare centre, Helsinki.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karin Hannukainen/University of Helsinki</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indeed the main aim of early years education is not explicitly \u201ceducation\u201d in the formal sense but the promotion of the health and wellbeing of every child. Daycare is to help them develop good social habits: to learn how to make friends and respect others, for example, or to dress themselves competently. Official guidance also emphasises the importance in pre-school of the \u201cjoy of learning\u201d, language enrichment and communication. There is an emphasis on physical activity (at least 90 minutes outdoor play a day). \u201cKindergarten in Finland doesn\u2019t focus on preparing children for school academically,\u201d writes the Finnish educational expert <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/pasi-sahlberg\">Pasi Sahlberg</a>. \u201cInstead the main goal is to make sure that the children are happy and responsible individuals.\u201d</p> <p>Play, nonetheless, is a serious business, at least for the teachers, because it gives children vital skills in how to learn. Franzenia has 44 staff working with children, of whom 16 are kindergarten teachers (who have each completed a three-year specialist degree), and 28 nursery nurses (who have a two-year vocational qualification). The staff-child ratio is 1:4 for under-threes and 1:7 for the older children. Great care is taken to plan not just what kind of play takes place \u2013 there is a mix of \u201cfree play\u201d and teacher-directed play - but to assess how children play. The children\u2019s development is constantly evaluated. \u201cIt\u2019s not just random play, it\u2019s learning through play,\u201d says Marjoniemi.</p> <p>Play at this stage of child development can successfully engage them in the process of learning, says <a href=\"http://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/people/staff/whitebread/\">David Whitebread</a>, director of the Centre for Research on Play in Education, Development &amp; Learning at the University of Cambridge. Once engaged in a task they enjoy, whether acting out a story or constructing a building, children become motivated to constantly refine and improve on their task and to increase the challenge. \u201cFrom a psychological point of view you can see how play can help children become powerful learners,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Carefully organised play helps develop qualities such as attention span, perseverance, concentration and problem solving, which at the age of four are stronger predictors of academic success than the age at which a child learns to read, says Whitebread. There is evidence that high-quality early years play-based learning not only enriches educational development but boosts attainment in children from disadvantaged backgrounds who do not possess the cultural capital enjoyed by their wealthier peers. Says Whitebread: \u201cThe better the quality of pre-school, the better the outcomes, both emotionally and socially and in terms of academic achievement.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/27/britain-borrowing-education-ideas-finland\">Britain should be wary of borrowing education ideas from abroad</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Importantly, early years care in Finland is designed and funded to ensure high take-up: every child has a legal right to high-quality pre-school care. In Franzenia, as in all daycare centres, there are children from a mix of backgrounds. Fees, subsidised by the state, are capped at a maximum of \u20ac290 (\u00a3250) a month (free for those on low incomes) for five-day, 40 hours a week care. About 40% of 1-3-year-olds are in daycare and 75% of 3-5-year-olds. Optional pre-school at the age of six has a 98% take-up. Initially envisaged in the 70s as a way of getting mothers back into the workplace, daycare has also become, Marjoniemi says, about \u201clifelong learning and how we prepare young children\u201d.</p> <p>The time children spend in pre-school, with its emphasis on play and socialisation, are \u201cthe most important years\u201d, says Jaakko Salo, special adviser to the OAJ, the Finnish teachers\u2019 union. Finnish education is undergoing the biggest financial cuts in its history, with the latest round lopping \u20ac2bn, or 8%, off the budget, but early years and primary schools \u2013 the bedrock of the system and the point where learning skills can be most successfully embedded \u2013 have been relatively protected, according to the OAJ.</p> <p>Daycare is not the only factor underpinning academic success. Hard-wired into Finland\u2019s educational mission is the idea that equality is vital to economic success and societal wellbeing, as well as the belief that a small nation, reliant on creativity, ingenuity and solidarity to compete in the global economy, cannot afford inequality or segregation in schooling or health. Behind its stellar education ranking is a comprehensive social security and public health system that ensures one of the lowest child poverty rates in Europe, and some of the highest levels of wellbeing. Gunilla Holm, professor of education at the University of Helsinki, says: \u201cThe goal is that we should all progress together.\u201d</p> <h2>How it works<br></h2> <p>The success of Finland\u2019s comprehensive school system is a story now well-told. At the turn of the century, much to the surprise of the Finns, let alone the rest of the world, it emerged as a global leader in education. Pisa tests revealed Finnish pupils produced some of the world\u2019s highest scores in maths, science and reading. In the three subsequent reports, the <a href=\"http://gpseducation.oecd.org/CountryProfile?primaryCountry=FIN&amp;treshold=10&amp;topic=PI\">last in 2012</a>, the country\u2019s performance dropped slightly but it remains the highest-ranked in Europe.</p> <p>Its success came under a system built resolutely against the grain of prevailing education fashions adopted by developed countries, including the UK, in the 1980s and 90s. In Finland, children do not start formal academic learning until seven. Driven by a commitment to equality (on both moral and economic grounds), it outlaws school selection, formal examinations (until the age of 18) and streaming by ability. Competition, choice, privatisation and league tables do not exist. \u201cTeaching to the test\u201d is an alien concept. Grammar schools, the UK government\u2019s current obsession, were abolished decades ago. Free school meals, tentatively endorsed for younger pupils only in the UK, are universally provided.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2016/sep/14/why-does-theresa-may-want-to-bring-back-grammar-schools-video-explainer\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53xqx\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2717686\"            data-video-name=\"Why does Theresa May want to bring back grammar schools? \u2013 video explainer\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d93571e4b05caf65ecd196\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/14/160914grammarsfinal_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/14/160914grammarsfinal_V4.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/14/160914grammarsfinal.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2016/sep/14/why-does-theresa-may-want-to-bring-back-grammar-schools-video-explainer\">Why does Theresa May want to bring back grammar schools?</a></figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/mar/15/children-learn-play-age-eight-lego\">Children should learn mainly through play until age of eight, says Lego</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those elements of British schooling that cause most parental anxiety \u2013 will my child get into a \u201cgood school\u201d, will they get into a top set, will they get a good Sats score \u2013 are largely absent in Finland. Differences in educational outcomes between individual schools in most areas are relatively trivial, meaning parents rarely send their children farther afield than the local comprehensive. Pupils are generally more content too: a quality-not-quantity approach means school hours are shorter and homework duties are light. After-school tutoring is rare. Finnish children are happier and less stressed than their British contemporaries.</p> <p>As UK educational policy becomes more narrow and centrally prescribed, Finland devolves more power to teachers and pupils to design and direct learning. Teachers are well paid, well-trained (they must complete a five-year specialist degree), respected by parents and valued and trusted by politicians. There is no Ofsted-style inspection of schools and teachers, but a system of self-assessment. Educational policy and teaching is heavily research-based.</p> <p>Worried that its sliding Pisa scores reflected a complacency in its schools, national curriculum changes were introduced this year: these now devote more time to art and crafts. Creativity is the watchword. Core competences include \u201clearning-to learn\u201d, multiliteracy, digital skills and entrepreneurship. At the heart of the new curriculum, the National Board of Education says unashamedly, is the \u201cjoy of learning.\u201d</p>",

She\u2019s designed to help residents locate information and complete application forms, as well as simplify some of the council\u2019s internal processes.

If she can\u2019t answer something, she\u2019s programmed to call a human colleague and learn from the situation, enabling her to tackle a similar question unaided in future.</p> <p>Amelia is due to be deployed later this year, and is supposed to be <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/16/robot-called-amelia-to-do-the-job-of-human-workers-at-a-local-co/\">60% cheaper than a human employee</a> \u2013 useful when you\u2019re facing <a href=\"https://new.enfield.gov.uk/news-and-events-old01/enfield-council-sets-budget/\">budget cuts of \u00a356m over the next four years</a>. Nevertheless, the council claims it has no plans to get rid of its 50 call centre workers.</p> <p>The Singaporean government, in partnership with Microsoft, is also planning to roll out intelligent chatbots in several stages: at first they will answer simple factual questions from the public, then help them complete tasks and transactions, before finally responding to personalised queries.<br></p> <p>Robinson says that, while artificially intelligent chatbots could have a role to play in some areas of public service delivery: \u201cI think we overlook the value of a quality personal relationship between two people at our peril, because it\u2019s based on life experience, which is something that technology will never have \u2013 certainly not current generations of technology, and not for many decades to come.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/dec/22/the-smartest-cities-rely-on-citizen-cunning-and-unglamorous-technology\">The smartest cities rely on citizen cunning and unglamorous technology</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But whether everyone can be \u201cupskilled\u201d to carry out more fulfilling work, and how many staff will actually be needed as robots take on more routine tasks, remains to be seen. Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne\u2019s influential 2013 paper <a href=\"http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf\">The Future of Employment: How Susceptible are Jobs to Computerisation?</a>, estimates that 47% of US jobs are \u201cat risk\u201d of being automated in the next 20 years. Another <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/deloitte-review-jobs-london-risk-of-automation-2016-3\">report by Deloitte</a> found that in London, 29% of admin and support services jobs, and a whopping 72% of transport and storage roles, are at \u201chigh risk\u201d of automation.</p> <p>However, <a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/report/The+Future+Of+Jobs+2025+Working+Side+By+Side+With+Robots/-/E-RES119861\">a report Forrester published last year</a> was less pessimistic about people\u2019s future employment prospects, suggesting that only 9.1 million US jobs will be automated by 2025. Robinson is more inclined to believe Forrester\u2019s estimate. \u201cIt\u2019s inarguable that as technology develops, it will automate certain tasks. But \u2018tasks\u2019 are very different to \u2018jobs\u2019. I also think some reports are hugely optimistic about what technology will be able to accomplish in [the] future.\u201d</p> <p>If Google or another tech giant does eventually manage to create an artificial general intelligence that can successfully perform any task a human can, the job losses would dwarf anything we\u2019ve seen before \u2013 and not only among the 1.5 million people employed by local government in England. A universal basic income, which would provide everyone with enough money to maintain a decent standard of living, is often cited as a solution to this problem. But in the medium term we might find robots still need our help; that there are things we simply do better than machines.</p> <p>For example, humans working cooperatively with machines are generally regarded as the strongest chess-playing entities, each drawing upon their skills to beat opponents. Identifying what those skills are in public service terms, and how best to combine them with automated systems to improve urban life, is a challenge no city can afford to ignore. Otherwise more people might find, as London\u2019s lamp lighters once did, that their services are no longer required.</p> <p><em>Guardian Cities is a member of the Habitat III Journalism Project. <a href=\"http://citiscope.org/journalism-project\">Read more about the project here</a>. </em><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> to join the discussion</em></p>",

  "<p>Petr Pol\u00e1k was driving through his home town in the Czech Republic when he noticed something unusual about the journey. He recalls: \u201cAll of a sudden there were stairs on the road so the car was bumping along them. It was strange and I knew there was something wrong. So I looked at my hands and I had an extra finger on one of them. I thought, \u2018Wow, this is a dream.\u2019 But I was so excited that I woke up seconds later.\u201d</p> <p>It was the first time that the owner of coffee house <a href=\"http://marycka.cz/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mary\u010dka</a>, based in the Czech city of Ostrava, had experienced a phenomenon called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/apr/27/mysteries-lucid-dreaming-brain-consciousness-research\">lucid dreaming</a>, an elusive state in which you consciously know you are dreaming. Unlike a regular dream where there is no control over what you experience, a lucid dream offers you the possibility to influence your surroundings and choose which activities to engage in. It is like virtual reality, but within your own head. But are dreams really an effective space for entrepreneurs to problem solve, generate new ideas and even learn new skills?</p> <p>Daniel Erlacher, a neuroscientist at the University of Bern, Switzerland, believes they can be. He explains that because the brain is in a less rational <a href=\"http://www.simplypsychology.org/psychoanalysis.html#free\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u201cfree association state\u201d</a> the dream is the perfect environment for creative thinking. In a<a href=\"http://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/IJoDR/article/view/9505/pdf_31\" rel=\"nofollow\"> joint study with colleagues at the University of Heidelberg</a> in 2012, Erlacher found that while most lucid dreamers participating in the research used the experience to have fun, 29% used it for problem-solving, 27% explored creative ideas and insights and 21% practised skills.<br></p> <p>Pol\u00e1k is eager to learn how to prolong his experience of lucid dreaming so is experimenting with different <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/13/go-places-asleep-lucid-dreaming\">techniques</a> to induce the experience. He wants to use his moments of nighttime lucidity to improve his business. And that is not as unlikely as it sounds.<br></p> <p>A study at the University of Lincoln in 2014 found that people with <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/drm/24/2/152/\" rel=\"nofollow\">frequent lucid dreams are better at cognitive tasks</a> performed while awake that involve insight, such as problem-solving.<br></p> <p>US-based entrepreneur Jody Clower says she regularly brainstorms in her lucid dreams and that she came up with the name for her property tech startup <a href=\"https://www.nestiny.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nestiny </a>during one experience.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fd1716f275586575897c52e6ca74b5f98fc424cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd1716f275586575897c52e6ca74b5f98fc424cc/48_0_1024_1280/800.jpg\" alt=\"jody clower\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jody Clower.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Bueno</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She says: \u201cI like portmanteaus, so I had ideas floating around my head and, for about a week or so, I tried to come up with something. I liked the word nest because it had an implied meaning of cosiness and home, but I just couldn\u2019t find the right thing to go with it. Then one night I was in a lucid dream and it occurred to me to put the word nest together with the word destiny. It made sense and I woke up thinking \u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Using lucid dreaming to solve problems is not without challenges, however. Lucid dreams can be frustratingly brief, Clower says. \u201cEvery now and then, I will hit a brick wall when brainstorming, mostly solutions too intricate or complex work problems \u2026 Those can be a bit frustrating because I am racing during the dream to arrive at a solution because I know that the time is precious.\u201d<br></p> <p>With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/oct/09/awake-3am-entrepreneurs-biphasic-sleep-insomnia\">many small business owners already struggling to get a good night\u2019s sleep</a>, some may be concerned that being \u201cawake\u201d in their dreams will take a toll on their mental alertness during the day.<br></p> <p>According to Stephen LaBerge, psychophysiologist and a leader in the scientific study of lucid dreaming, the experience is usually just as restful as non-lucid dreaming. Indeed, studies by the neuropsychologists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/apr/27/mysteries-lucid-dreaming-brain-consciousness-research\">Ursula Voss and Martin Dresler</a> have shown that brain activity while lucid dreaming is similar to the regular <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep\" rel=\"nofollow\">REM</a> (rapid eye movement) sleep during which we all dream.<br></p> <p>However, in his bestselling book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Exploring-World-Dreams-Stephen-LaBerge/dp/034537410X\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming</a>, LaBerge writes that how tired you feel after a dream depends on what you did in the dream. For example, Clower admits that while most mornings she wakes up feeling refreshed, a night of intense problem-solving while lucid dreaming can sometimes mean she is mentally exhausted the next day.<br></p> <p>Lucid dreaming can have more than just a psychological effect on practitioners. Erlacher has found that mentally practising an activity during dreams can even improve physical skills. In one small study, published in the journal Sport Psychologist in 2010, lucid dreamers were asked to toss coins into coffee cups before bed and then dream about themselves practising that night. In the morning, when asked to toss coins again, the lucid dreamers who <a href=\"http://journals.humankinetics.com/doi/abs/10.1123/tsp.24.2.157\" rel=\"nofollow\">successfully practised while dreaming were more accurate</a>, compared with those who failed to practise and a control group of non-lucid dreamers.<br></p> <p>Choreographer Jade Shaw, who founded small business <a href=\"http://parkourdance.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ParkourDance</a> in 2012 after brainstorming the idea during a lucid dream, says she has experienced this first hand. She claims that after practising aerial cartwheels in a dream state she felt it was easier to perfect the movement while awake. Although she admits she couldn\u2019t be sure what level of impact her lucid dream activity really had on her performance.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9bde308f9d521109ef6ccbd20eb895b64e4c85e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bde308f9d521109ef6ccbd20eb895b64e4c85e7/0_52_864_1080/800.jpg\" alt=\"woman dancing\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Choreographer Jade Shaw says brainstorming in a lucid dream helped her to come up with the idea for her dance company.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lydia Polzer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are limitations to what entrepreneurs can do in a lucid dream. Erlacher says: \u201cA lucid dream will not help you to learn another language if you have never heard it before. You have to have some experience with the things you practise in your dreams. It\u2019s not a miracle.\u201d<br></p> <p>But before small business owners start thinking they have a new, handy way to rehearse an important pitch or come up with an invention, be warned; learning how to get lucid in a dream is not easy, it takes time, effort and a little luck.<br></p> <p>Scientists such as LaBerge devised techniques to induce lucid dreams, most notably the Mild technique (mnemonic induction of lucid dreams). This involves improving dream recall \u2013 for example, by keeping a dream journal, repeatedly questioning whether you are awake or dreaming, regular affirmations to get lucid and visualisations before sleeping. And a <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2013/11/17/remee-lucid-dreaming/\" rel=\"nofollow\">plethora of gadgets</a> are now available claiming to help get users to that state while asleep.<br></p> <p>Sadly, Erlacher says that there is no foolproof way to induce lucid dreams. In fact,<a href=\"http://www.lucidity.com/SleepAndCognition.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> only about 20% of the population</a> claim to have lucid dreams once a month or more. He says that most people will have to train for one to two months for their first lucid dream using an induction technique.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf you want to have more lucid dreams you have to continue with your training,\u201d says Erlacher. \u201cThat\u2019s the major obstacle in lucid dream research, to find reliable, easy to apply techniques to induce lucid dreams.\u201d<br></p> <p><strong>Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/small-business/\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.</strong></p>",

Structural changes to the economy have resulted in entire communities being left without work and often without adequate social and economic infrastructure. </p> <p>We see manufacturing jobs disappearing, the loss of jobs in some sectors due to privatisation, and the global quest for ever greater profits by using ever cheaper labour. We have seen a worrying trend towards casualisation and insecure employment and, on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/sep/20/sure-unemployment-is-down-but-plenty-of-people-would-like-to-work-more\">latest ABS labour force figures</a>, a decline in the total number of monthly hours worked in all jobs.

Living in poverty is not a sickness. Nor is it a crime. Yet we continue to fall into the ideological trap of either pathologising or criminalising people who sin against the dominant moral code by not being \u201cself-reliant\u201d in the marketplace. </p> <p>This is not new. The earlier McClure Report, tabled by Jocelyn Newman in 2000, began from the same premise; that we urgently needed to address the problem of \u201cwelfare dependency\u201d because it, and people\u2019s lives, are seemingly spiralling out of control.</p> <p>It\u2019s time we stopped disguising market failure as a personal failure to participate in the market. For this is where we are starting again, with the current offerings of \u201crevolutionary\u201d vision and \u201cradical\u201d change by social services minister, Christian Porter. By focusing on the supposed failings of the individual, we are missing the bleeding obvious: that there are not enough jobs (and more specifically, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/sep/20/sure-unemployment-is-down-but-plenty-of-people-would-like-to-work-more\">not enough hours!</a>) for those who can work as well as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/13/axing-clean-energy-supplement-has-barely-caused-a-ripple-but-it-should\">seriously inadequate level of income</a> support for those who cannot. </p> <p>In the same way, the persistence of homelessness is not a failure of individuals to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and buy a house (or get their parents to pitch in), but rather a failure of the housing market, which is structured in such a way as to be brilliant at providing choice for those at the top, and dazzling as a speculative sport, but lousy at ensuring access to affordable and appropriate accommodation for all.</p> <p>The other trick that is used to mask the failures of the market is to blame social services. In this discursive sleight of hand, the persistence of unemployment and poverty is proof that the services are not working, and that their funding is a waste of public money because <em>they</em> have failed to end homelessness or unemployment or poverty. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/02/labor-shouldnt-support-newstart-cuts-it-would-be-a-moral-and-electoral-mistake\">Labor should not support Newstart cuts. It would be a moral and electoral mistake | Van Badham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So, the endgame is not even the modest alleviation of poverty, let alone the arresting of inequality. It is the running down of what actually does work or would work as an investment in people and communities, like Gonski, a highly targeted investment in children\u2019s education, focusing on student need rather than sector. Or like Tafe, a national treasure, that on the watch of governments of both sides of politics, has been systematically undermined and gutted. Likewise, community health programmes, community legal aid programmes, social services and justice reinvestment programmes have been either deliberately cut, like the highly successful Youth Connections, or decidedly ignored.</p> <p>Australia does not have a welfare problem. We have a poverty problem and an inequality problem, but you know that these problems are going to be ignored when the dominant discourse focuses our attention on the \u201cwelfare problem.\u201d&#xa0;</p> <p>It is true that providing someone with income support and forgetting about them is not the solution to unemployment. But neither is it the cause of unemployment. In short, it is neither the solution nor the problem. And the problem of unemployment and underemployment, which is a structural rather than a behavioural problem, is not going to be addressed by forcing people to live below the poverty line, which is what we appear to be comfortable with allowing to remain as the status quo, even after the welfare revolution. And in the meantime, we are still eagerly being told that corporations need welfare assistance via tax cuts and concessions.</p> <p>Poverty is not a personal choice. Being a full-time carer, or living with a disability or mental illness, or leaving a violent partner, or being residualised by the labour market, should not result in poverty in a prosperous and progressive country. We should certainly not begrudge the money we spend to make sure that no one is left out or pushed out; that no one is excluded from having a place to call home, a place to work for those who can work (and appropriate income support for those who cannot), a place to learn, and a place to heal. We should not be comfortable with the retrograde notion that charity should be the default mode of providing social security.</p> <p>If we take as our starting point the supposed need to reduce social expenditure, we will not arrive at the goal of reducing poverty and inequality. If our efforts as a society are predicated on the alleged need to \u201cget people off welfare\u201d we will certainly go some way to cutting the welfare budget and getting people off the government ledger.

  "<p>For a long time \u2013 at least since the economic emergence of South Korea in the 1960s \u2013 many low-income countries have been able to achieve rapid economic growth through industrialisation.</p> <p>The process usually starts with low-end manufacturing (apparel, footwear, plastics) and entails large numbers of workers moving from low productivity smallholder agriculture to high productivity export manufacturing.<br></p> <p>Industrialisation has helped to drive an unprecedented convergence between rich and poor country wealth levels. By the early 2000s, 83 developing countries were achieving growth rates more than <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/site/devpgd2012/49067839.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">twice the rate</a> of OECD members.<br></p> <p>But this development model is being eroded \u2013 largely by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/16/robot-factories-threaten-jobs-millions-garment-workers-south-east-asia-women\">increasing automation</a> of industrial production.

Most rich countries have seen declines in the share of manufacturing in their economies for a long time. But industrialisation made them richer than countries that followed after them. </p> <p>Rodrik calculates that industrialisation peaked in western European countries such as Britain, Sweden, and Italy at income levels of around $14,000 (at 1990 levels). India and many sub\u2010Saharan African countries appear to have reached their peak manufacturing employment at income levels of $700 (at 1990 levels). <br></p> <p>More worryingly, Rodrik demonstrates that automation has been taking out <a href=\"https://www.sss.ias.edu/files/papers/econpaper107.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">more low-skilled jobs</a> than medium or high-skilled ones, increasing inequality.<br></p> <p>All of this is about to accelerate.

Adidas is piloting highly automated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/25/adidas-to-sell-robot-made-shoes-from-2017\">footwear factories</a> in Germany and the US that will allow consumers to order customised footwear before it is manufactured which can then be delivered directly to them.

And if growth rates for poor countries aren\u2019t going to be spectacular then it becomes even more important to make sure that the benefits of the growth that is achieved are fairly shared. <br></p> <p>This means valuing the development potential of the informal economy, rather than seeking to substitute it.

  "<p>First, the myths. There are no \u201csuper rats\u201d. Apart from a specific subtropical breed, they do not get much bigger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/11/fake-giant-rat-picture-internet\">than 20 inches long, including the tail</a>. They are not blind, nor are they afraid of cats. They do not carry rabies. They do not, as was reported in 1969 regarding an island in Indonesia, fall from the sky. Their communities are not led by elusive, giant \u201cking rats\u201d. Rat skeletons cannot liquefy and reconstitute at will. (For some otherwise rational people, this is a genuine concern.) They are not indestructible, and there are not as many of them as we think. The one-rat-per-human in New York City estimate is pure fiction. Consider this the good news.</p> <p>In most other respects, \u201cthe rat problem\u201d, as it has come to be known, is a perfect nightmare. Wherever humans go, rats follow, forming shadow cities under our metropolises and hollows beneath our farmlands. They thrive in our squalor, making homes of our sewers, abandoned alleys, and neglected parks. They poison food, bite babies, undermine buildings, spread disease, decimate crop yields, and <em>very</em> occasionally eat people alive.<strong> </strong>A male and female left to their own devices for one year \u2013 the average lifespan of a city rat \u2013 can beget 15,000 descendants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"A new way of controlling rat numbers.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ftheguardian%2Fvideos%2F565004370353997%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=400&amp;height=400\" style=\"max-width:400px;max-height:400px\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" width=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>There may be no \u201cking rat\u201d, but there are \u201crat kings\u201d, groups of up to 30 rats whose tails have knotted together to form one giant, swirling mass. Rats may be unable to liquefy their bones to slide under doors, but they don\u2019t need to: their skeletons are so flexible that they can squeeze their way through any hole or crack wider than half an inch. They are cannibals, and they sometimes laugh <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rats-laugh-but-not-like-human/\">(sort of)</a> \u2013 especially when tickled. They can appear en masse, as if from nowhere, moving as fast as seven feet per second. They do not carry rabies, but a 2014 study from Columbia University found that the average New York City subway rat carried 18 viruses previously unknown to science, along with dozens of familiar, dangerous pathogens, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/oct/11/health.medicineandhealth1\">C difficile</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/hepatitis-c\">hepatitis C</a>. As recently as 1994 there was a major recurrence of bubonic plague in India, an unpleasant flashback to the 14th century, when that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/17/black-death-rats-off-hook\">rat-borne illness</a> killed 25 million people in five years. Collectively, rats are responsible for more human death than any other mammal on earth.</p> <p>Humans have a peculiar talent for exterminating other species. In the case of rats, we have been pursuing their total demise for centuries. We have invented elaborate, gruesome traps. We have trained dogs, ferrets, and cats to kill them. We have invented ultrasonic machines to drive them away with high-pitched noise. (Those machines, still popular, do not work.) We have poisoned them in their millions. In 1930, faced with a rat infestation on Rikers Island, New York City officials flushed the area with mustard gas. In the late 1940s, scientists developed anticoagulants to treat thrombosis in humans, and some years later supertoxic versions of the drugs were developed in order to kill rats by making them bleed to death from the inside after a single dose. Cityscapes and farmlands were drenched with thousands of tons of these chemicals. During the 1970s, we used DDT. These days, rat poison is not just sown in the earth by the truckload, it is rained from helicopters that track the rats with radar \u2013 in 2011 80 metric tonnes of poison-laced bait were dumped on to Henderson Island, home to one of the last untouched coral reefs in the South Pacific. In 2010, Chicago officials went \u201cnatural\u201d: figuring a natural predator might track and kill rats, they released 60 coyotes wearing radio collars on to the city streets.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How is it that we can send robots to Mars and yet remain unable to keep rats from threatening our food supplies?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Still, here they are. According to Bobby Corrigan, the world\u2019s leading expert on rodent control, many of the world\u2019s great cities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/dec/01/homes\">remain totally overcome</a>. \u201cIn New York \u2013 we\u2019re losing that war in a big way,\u201d he told me. Combat metaphors have become a central feature of rat conversation among pest control professionals. In Robert Sullivan\u2019s 2014 book Rats, he described humanity\u2019s relationship with the species as an \u201cunending and brutish war\u201d, a battle we seem always, always to lose.</p> <p>Why? How is it that we can send robots to Mars, build the internet, keep alive infants born so early that their skin isn\u2019t even fully made \u2013 and yet remain unable to keep rats from threatening our food supplies, biting our babies, and appearing in our toilet bowls?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>\u201cFrankly, rodents are the most successful species,\u201d Loretta Mayer told me recently. \u201cAfter the next holocaust, rats and Twinkies will be the only things left.\u201d Mayer is a biologist, and she contends that the rat problem is actually a human problem, a result of our foolish choices and failures of imagination. In 2007, she co-founded <a href=\"http://senestech.com/\">SenesTech</a>, a biotech startup that offers the promise of an armistice in a conflict that has lasted thousands of years. The concept is simple: rat birth control</p> <p>The rat\u2019s primary survival skill, as a species, is its unnerving rate of reproduction. Female rats ovulate every four days, copulate dozens of times a day and remain fertile until they die. (Like humans, they have sex for pleasure as well as for procreation.) This is how you go from two to 15,000 in a single year. When poison or traps thin out a population, they mate faster until their numbers regenerate. Conversely, if you can keep them from mating, colonies collapse in weeks and do not rebound.</p> <p>Solving the rat problem by putting them on the pill sounds ridiculous. Until recently no pharmaceutical product existed that could make rats infertile, and even if it had, there was still the question of how it could be administered. But if such a thing were to work, the impact could be historic. Rats would die off without the need for poison, radar or coyotes.</p> <p>SenesTech, which is based in Flagstaff, Arizona, claims to have created a liquid that will do exactly that. In tests conducted in Indonesian rice fields, South Carolina pig farms, the suburbs of Boston and the New York City subway, the product, called ContraPest, caused a drop in rat populations of roughly 40% in 12 weeks. This autumn, for the first time, the company is making ContraPest available to commercial markets in the US and Europe. The team at SenesTech believes it could be the first meaningful advance in the fight against rats in a hundred years, and the first viable alternative to poison. Mayer was blunt about the implications: \u201cThis will <em>change the world</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Mayer is a tall, vigorous woman in her mid-60s with bright eyes, spiky grey hair and a toothy grin. Her ideologies of choice are Buddhism and the Girl Scouts. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of my core,\u201d she said of the latter, \u201cto do for others.\u201d In conversation, her manner is so upbeat that she seems to be holding forth radiantly before an audience or on the verge of bursting into song. When asked how she is doing, she frequently responds in a near-rapture: \u201cIf I was any better, I\u2019d be a twin!\u201d \u2013 she also appears to enjoy watching people wonder whether this is an expression they should know.</p> <p>When I took a seat in her office earlier this year, she clapped her hands triumphantly and said \u201cOoh!

The career change was unexpected, even to her. After a close friend died suddenly of a heart attack, Mayer called up a biologist she knew and asked how something like this could have happened. The biologist had no satisfying answer; she explained that while heart disease in men had been thoroughly studied, little attention had been devoted to post-menopausal heart disease in women. \u201cWell you\u2019ve got to change it,\u201d Mayer replied, outraged. The biologist was otherwise occupied, so Mayer decided to do it herself. At 46, she entered a PhD programme in biology at Northern Arizona University.</p> <p>After graduate school, her initial research as a professor of biology at Northern Arizona focused on artificially inducing menopause in lab mice so that she could study changes in the postmenopausal heart. Three years into her efforts, Mayer was contacted by Patricia Hoyer, a colleague in Phoenix, who said that she had stumbled across a chemical that seemed to make mice infertile, without having any other effects. Together, Mayer and Hoyer synthesised a new compound, which they called Mouseopause.</p> <p>Shortly after Mayer and Hoyer published their work on Mouseopause in 2005, Mayer received a telephone call from a veterinarian in Gallup, New Mexico, who had read about her research. The Navajo reservation where he worked was overrun by wild dogs. There were too many to spay and neuter, so he was euthanising almost 500 a month. \u201cIf you could do for a dog what you can do for a mouse, I could stop killing dogs out here,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>Mayer describes herself as \u201cextremely connected to animals, dogs in particular\u201d. When she arrived in Gallup and saw the piled corpses, she agreed to test Mouseopause on an initial group of 18 reservation dogs. \u201cI held up that first puppy, who I called Patient Zero,\u201d she told me, \u201cand I said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what this is gonna do to you, but you will live on a satin pillow the rest of your days.\u201d The injection made the dogs infertile, but left them otherwise happy and healthy. (Mayer brought home all 18 dogs and built a kennel in her yard to house them until she could find homes for them with families she knew personally. Patient Zero, renamed Cheetah, lived with her until she died of old age \u2013 though the pillow was fleece.)</p> <p>The next call came from Australia in 2006. Biologists there wanted an adaptation of Mouseopause for rats. Rats, they told her, were eating 30% of the rice crop in Australia and Indonesia. If she could reduce the rat population by even half, they claimed, the crops that would be saved could feed millions of people.</p> <p>Mayer was moved by the idea of finding a solution to rat overpopulation that was neither lethal nor toxic. Since its invention, rat poison has been our primary method of curbing rat populations, but it is dangerous. Ingested in high doses, it\u2019s fatal to humans, and it poses a particular to children because it is sweet and brightly coloured. In the US alone, more than 12,000 children per year, most of whom live below the poverty line, are accidentally poisoned by pesticide meant for rats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/oct/14/man-v-rat-could-the-long-war-soon-be-over-podcast\">Man v rat: could the long war soon be over? \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The collateral damage inflicted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/09/trouble-in-paradise-lord-howe-island-divided-over-plan-to-exterminate-rats\">rat poison also extends to the environment</a>, leaching into the soil and poisoning house pets, farm animals, and wildlife that feed on rats. Worst of all, rat poison is not very effective at eliminating large infestations. As long as there is still a food source, colonies bounce back, and, especially in Europe, rats have grown resistant to the toxins. As Mayer often says, \u201cDoing the same thing over and over and expecting different results: isn\u2019t that the definition of insanity?\u201d</p> <p>Persuaded by the research, and by her wife, fellow biologist Cheryl Dyer, Mayer decided to devote her career to developing a new, smarter way to control the rat population. In 2007, they founded SenesTech. \u201cPeople say never to invest with a husband and wife team,\u201d Mayer joked to me. \u201cI say, \u2018Oh absolutely not! Then you have dominance.\u2019 But wife and wife? Works great!\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>For Dyer and Mayer, the immediate problem was obvious: while the lab mice and feral dogs had received injections in controlled studies, wild rats would have to eat the formula of their own volition. Rats are neophobic \u2013 they avoid what they don\u2019t know. What\u2019s more, city rats are already well fed. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/25/new-york-city-rats-evicted\">New York City</a>, for example, they have fresh bagels, pizza, melted ice cream and fried chicken in unending supply. To succeed, Dyer and Mayer had to make the compound not just edible but delicious.</p> <p>After a series of tests, they quickly settled on a liquid, rather than solid, formulation. Rats have to drink 10% of their body weight every day to survive, and so are always looking out for something potable. \u201cWe compared the [two] and they peed on the solid and drank the liquid,\u201d Dyer told me. \u201cRats are pretty straightforward.\u201d</p> <p>Where Mayer is tall and voluble, Dyer is short and broad-shouldered, quiet and succinct. She seems most comfortable behind the scenes, if only because it is easier to get away with wearing Hawaiian-print shirts and no shoes. At SenesTech\u2019s headquarters, Dyer\u2019s windowless office is right next to Mayer\u2019s, and if Mayer\u2019s office evokes Zen, Dyer\u2019s evokes an island paradise. Scenes from Hawaii cover her walls, hula (and rat) figurines line the shelves, and on her desk sits a small wooden sign, which says, \u201cWELCOME TO THE TIKI BAR.\u201d There is also a widescreen TV, on which Dyer likes to watch old movies on mute all day.</p> <p>It was Dyer\u2019s job to make Mouseopause palatable for rats \u2013 a tricky proposition because its active ingredient, 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD), is bitter and caustic. Rats have the same taste preferences as humans \u2013 they love fat and sugar \u2013 though Dyer\u2019s experiments with various flavour profiles indicated that their appetite for both exceeds ours.</p> <p>She was also tasked with the greater challenge of adapting Mouseopause to work on rats, which are much hardier than mice. While VCD caused the eggs in mouse ovaries to degenerate rapidly, female rats were far less susceptible. Hoping for a compound effect, Dyer added a second active ingredient: triptolide, which stunted any growing eggs. The results were better, but still not good enough. \u201cThey just had smaller litters, goddammit,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Eventually, out of a mix of curiosity and desperation, she fed it to both males and females. The result was dramatic. It turns out that the triptolide destroyed sperm \u2013 the males became sterile almost immediately after ingesting the formula. This was a total surprise: no one had ever tested triptolide on male rats before. It was \u201cstunning\u201d, Dyer told me. \u201cTotally unpredictable.\u201d Test after test: no pups. She sighed. \u201cMan, you should have seen the No Pup party.\u201d After three years of research and development, they had a product that worked and did not harm other animals. (The active ingredients are metabolised by the rat\u2019s body in 10 minutes, which means that any predator that eats it is not affected, and the compound quickly breaks down into inactive ingredients when it hits soil or water.)</p> <p>ContraPest, the finished product, is viscous and sweet. Electric pink and opaque, it tastes like nine packets of saccharine blended into two tablespoons of kitchen oil. \u201cRats love it,\u201d Dyer said. \u201cLove it.\u201d Mayer, who taste-tested every version during the development process, could not say the same for herself.</p> <p>In 2013, New York\u2019s Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) reached out to Mayer after hearing about SenesTech\u2019s early trials to ask whether the company would test ContraPest in New York\u2019s subways as part of a citywide effort to find new, more successful alternatives to poison. Many cities devote manpower and money to keeping the rats under control, but New York, which is more or less the rat capital of the western world, is the epicentre of anti-rat efforts. Every incoming mayor of New York declares his intentions for a vast rodenticide \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/dec/01/michaelellison\">Giuliani even appointed a \u201crat czar\u201d</a> to oversee the carnage \u2013 only to leave the next guy even more to deal with.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e032e663657a79a5b1a8811742b57d2844ee105f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e032e663657a79a5b1a8811742b57d2844ee105f/40_0_3241_4052/800.jpg\" alt=\"Brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) rearing up.

(Norway rats, the species infesting New York, are not in fact the largest rat type.) They asked Mayer whether they should send a few New York rats on a plane to Arizona so that SenesTech could experiment with them before coming to New York. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d replied Mayer, amused. \u201cI never met a rat I couldn\u2019t sterilise.\u201d</p> <p>Mayer dispatched two of SenesTech\u2019s youngest scientists, women in their 20s, to New York in order to test whether the formula was appealing enough. Would New York rats prefer ContraPest to water or pizza? Wearing their best approximation of hazmat suits to protect themselves from the filth, the scientists patrolled the subway\u2019s trash storage rooms under Grand Central Station. They planted bait boxes filled with feed stations of ContraPest and then stood nearby, counting the rats that came in and out with clickers in order to track how many rats were taking the bait. For six months, they baited and counted, washing their suits at the end of each day in bleach.</p> <p>The two young women went home to Arizona with good news: not only did the New York rats drink ContraPest, the drink actually worked on them. The test confirmed the highest hopes of the company \u2013 there was an alternative to poison that would work, even in New York City, and they had found it.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When humans and animals come together, there are choices. Mayer believes that if you understand the ecology of the animal and you understand your own ecology, then you and the animal will be able to coexist peacefully. After centuries of misperception and squeamishness, we finally have a good grasp of rat ecology. Now the problem may be our reluctance to look too carefully at ourselves.</p> <p>In his 1983 book More Cunning than Man, writer Robert Hendrickson lists \u201cthe obvious ways in which rats so well resemble humans: ferocity, omnivorousness, adaptability to all climes, migration from east to west in the life journey of their species, irresponsible fecundity in all seasons, with a seeming need to make genocidal war on their own kind.\u201d He describes rats and men alike as \u201cutterly destructive, both taking all other living things for their purposes.\u201d</p> <p>Humanity\u2019s long struggle with rats mostly signals the worst traits we share with them: our inability to live responsibly within our environment; our tendencies toward hedonism and greed; and our failures to look after the weakest among us. Getting rid of them means correcting ourselves first.</p> <p>SenesTech is not alone in its attempts to devise a more sustainable, responsible method of ending the rat problem. Its work is heir to an existing method: integrated pest management, or IPM, which holds that if humans \u2013 particularly city-dwellers \u2013 took more care with their environment, rats wouldn\u2019t thrive.</p> <p>IPM\u2019s most vocal advocate is Bobby Corrigan, who has brought its principles to farmlands and cities all over the world, most notably New York, which recently revised its rat control programme on his advice. Twice a year, he teaches the New York health department\u2019s \u201cRat Academy\u201d, a three-day training for industry professionals. This April, there were maybe 100 attendees wedged into wooden theatre seats in a downtown auditorium, holding weak coffee and spongy muffins.</p> <p>Corrigan is a thinnish, pale man, bald except for a low, wispy crown framing his ears. He spends his nights on the streets or in basement corners studying rats. Once, he lay in an alley with peanut butter spread around him all night so he could get good photographs. (\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t safe. Yes, they were urinating on me. In grad school, you do crazy things.\u201d) He regards his work with utmost seriousness.</p> <p>\u201cHere\u2019s what health professionals do,\u201d he said to his audience by way of introduction. He pointed at a slide behind him and read aloud.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>We protect the roof over people\u2019s heads.</em><br><em> We protect the food they eat.</em><br><em> We protect their health, comfort and safety.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying this to pat us on the back. This is real. This is our job. [Rats] get on airplanes. They gnaw on wires. They cause diseases. To me, this is the shot heard round the world.\u201d Then he spent 20 minutes explaining how to divine information from rat droppings based on their moisture.</p> <p>As the day wore on, Corrigan\u2019s core message for his audience emerged: fighting rats means committing to holistic efforts, not looking for a quick, flashy fix. \u201cWe love to spritz problems away,\u201d Corrigan told me later. \u201cA chemical or a trap, it\u2019s a Band Aid, and they\u2019re Band Aids that come off very quickly.\u201d Instead, Corrigan argues that you first need to remove the rat\u2019s food, then remove the rat\u2019s shelter, and only then take lethal measures if you have to.</p> <p>In theory, this solution is simple. It does not involve radar or guns. Instead, it demands lids for the trash can, and caulking for the cracks in foundations, or \u201ckeeping our own little nests clean\u201d, as Corrigan says. It is the obvious answer, the one that has been sitting under our noses for centuries: stop feeding them, stop housing them, and they will go away on their own.</p> <p>The problem is that people, as a rule, prefer the quick fix. Setting out poison is easier; the ultrasonic machine looks cool. The sensible, labour-intensive option meets with resistance. Often, when Corrigan is called out to consult with a property owner, the owner rejects his advice, simply because following it would require too much thought, effort or expense.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Your rats are my rats. If the city blows it off, the sewer rats become everybody\u2019s rats. Rats are everybody\u2019s issue</p> <footer> <cite>Bobby Corrigan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And sometimes, even those who are willing to try his methods do not have the resources. Ricky Simeone, the director of pest control for New York\u2019s health department, explained to me that the neighbourhoods that struggle with the worst rat infestations are not the ones who file the most reports to his office. The poorest neighbourhoods are too overwhelmed with other social or economic problems to file complaints \u2013 or, worse, they accept rat infestation as one of the conditions of living in poverty.</p> <p>Corrigan confirmed that rats, especially in cities, affect the poor more than the rich, because effective pest control services are expensive. But he pointed out that no one totally escapes the rat problem, no matter how rich. Cities such as New York make evident a universal truth. \u201cWe\u2019re all holding hands whether we know it or like it. Your rats are my rats. If the city blows it off, the sewer rats become everybody\u2019s rats. Rats are everybody\u2019s issue.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone thinks, \u2018It\u2019s not my job, it\u2019s someone else\u2019s job,\u2019\u201d Corrigan continued. \u201cThey think, \u2018Oh I live in New York, no one can get rid of the rats in New York!\u2019\u201d He gave a short sigh. \u201cWe don\u2019t think we can do it alone, so we don\u2019t do anything as a group.\u201d As with all conditions that threaten everyone but torment the disadvantaged above all, the situation is not better because we are not better.</p> <p>\u201cHomo sapiens,\u201d Corrigan said to his audience at the Rat Academy. \u201cDoes anyone know what this means?\u201d</p> <p>He smiled a grim little smile. \u201cWise man.\u201d</p> <p>Improving society is a collective project, but as Corrigan attests, it happens because individual people make it their business to incite change. Mayer and Dyer, too, see this as their mission. \u201cWe have to be better stewards than this,\u201d Dyer told me fiercely. \u201cWe\u2019re better than this.\u201d If SenesTech looks quirky in the attempt, its founders do not seem to mind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fc24d57fdceeb4b973e14de5cf688dd168e29513\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc24d57fdceeb4b973e14de5cf688dd168e29513/0_197_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Rats are so longstanding a threat to humanity that contemplating an end to the rat problem seems like a fantasy.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Rats are so longstanding a threat to humanity that contemplating an end to the rat problem seems like a fantasy.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>On a Tuesday night in August, Mayer and Dyer held a celebration in their backyard for staff and investors. The company had just received US Environmental Protection Agency registration, a process that usually takes years and often costs more than companies of SenesTech\u2019s size can afford. (The EPA is making an active effort to get rat poison off the markets in the US, and received news of SenesTech\u2019s science with enthusiasm.) Now, with the EPA\u2019s blessing, the company could take ContraPest to commercial markets. Immediately, more than 100 calls and 200 emails came in with order requests. </p> <p>Mayer and Dyer live in a one-level wood cabin a few miles north of downtown Flagstaff, in a wooded area near a field of wildflowers. For the occasion, they had cleared the back patio, where Mayer does her morning meditation and yoga, and filled it with deck furniture and folding tables. The sun was coming down the San Francisco Peaks.</p> <p>It was not a typical investors dinner, but then, SenesTech\u2019s nearly 700 stakeholders are mostly firemen. While most biotech startups are funded by investment bankers and venture capitalists, Mayer chose to pursue funding from grant-giving bodies and a horde of private donors, all of whom made small investments, and each of whom Mayer knows by name. It was a pure accident of networking that so many of them turned out to be firemen, but she is thrilled with the situation. \u201cFirefighters really believe in doing good,\u201d Mayer explained to me. \u201cAnd they\u2019re like teenage girls. Once one of them invested, they all wanted in.\u201d</p> <p>There were perhaps 25 people \u2013 investors, board members and SenesTech staff \u2013 gathered on the back patio, eating tacos and drinking from Mayer and Dyer\u2019s impressive liquor collection, but they made noise for 50. They were boisterous and loving, hugging each other, teasing each other, shouting old stories to roars of laughter, and clinking glasses. About half the room seemed to be wearing Hawaiian patterned shirts.</p> <p>When the time came for Mayer to give a speech, she demurred for a moment before standing. Her toast turned briefly into an anecdote about flattening mouse skeletons in lasagna tins. \u201cBut seriously,\u201d she said, returning to her theme, \u201cWe knew [this day] would come. It\u2019s great to be riding this wave with you. It\u2019s just so sweet.\u201d Glasses heaved into the air.</p> <p>There was considerable work left to do: now that SenesTech had its national registration, it would have to file for registration in every state. (Since then, the company has registered in 11 US states, and begun registration in the EU.) The manufacturing team was hurrying to make enough ContraPest to accommodate the requests coming in.<strong> </strong>Dyer was working hard on adaptations that would make the formula work in a variety of different environments, and planning variations for different species. Mayer was preparing for a torrent of meetings. While ContraPest has been effective in every test SenesTech has run so far, there is a lot still to learn about how rats in different parts of the world will respond to it in the wild.</p> <p>It sounds crazy: a band of animal lovers<strong> </strong>and firemen in the mountains of Arizona, led by a Buddhist girl scout, making a pink milkshake for rats that may eventually improve the lives of millions of people. They are unruffled by scepticism: In the middle of one interview, Mayer forgot a detail and yelled towards the door, \u201cCheryl, who said to you, \u2018That\u2019s just not how we do it?\u2019\u201d Dyer hollered back from the other room. \u201cWhich time?\u201d In response, they point to hard science, solicitations from governments and companies around the world, and an endorsement from Stephen Hawking, who featured them on his documentary mini-series Brave New World.</p> <p>Rats are so longstanding a threat to humanity that contemplating an end to the rat problem \u2013 and one that does not require us to kill them \u2013 seems like a fantasy. They are, as Mayer herself put it, a more successful species than us. Long after we\u2019re gone, they will still be here. But the possibility of a truce seems closer than ever before. \u201cThe answer in the future may lie completely within biotechnology,\u201d said Corrigan when I asked for his impressions. (He and Mayer consider themselves allies in the campaign to create sustainable solutions to the rat problem. Mayer fondly recalls a nighttime \u201crat safari\u201d she once took with Corrigan in New York.) \u201cThe SenesTech product is a breakthrough, but it is still at the very infancy stages of biotechnology for this species,\u201d Corrigan said. \u201cThis is going to be maybe years of refinements and changing and experiments. We\u2019re not walking yet. And we\u2019re certainly not running.\u201d</p> <p>Mayer, Dyer and their team seem cheerful at the prospect, and confident that they are doing the work of the future. \u201cDo you see this?\u201d asked Ali Applin, a senior member of SenesTech\u2019s staff. We were sitting in Mayer\u2019s office, and Applin pointed to a little sign on the coffee table that read \u201cMake it so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is what she tells us,\u201d Applin said.</p> <p>Mayer nodded, smiling. \u201cThat\u2019s what you need to do. I mean, why squabble over something and say, \u2018I can\u2019t do that\u2019. Make it so. Find a way. There\u2019s always a way.\u201d</p> <p>After a moment, she had another thought. \u201cYou\u2019re really gonna have to do that, Ali, when you take this to Argentina soon. If we thought Laos was hard \u2013 I mean, my God.\u201d She grinned mischievously and folded her hands together and pressed them to her forehead and said a mantra. \u201cI wish you ease on the path to peace.

  "<p>Last week\u2019s labour force figures produced the best unemployment rate for three years but also a record level of underemployment. The two different measures \u2013 one good, one bad \u2013 highlights the changing working environment, and also explains why despite unemployment falling, the amount of slack in the employment sector means wages continue to grow slower than ever.</p> <p>It is certainly good that the unemployment rate in August fell to 5.6% in seasonally adjusted terms, and 5.7% in trend terms \u2013 both of which were the best for three years. All other things being equal (the favourite phrase of economists), a falling unemployment rate is always better than a rising one.</p> <p>But one problem with the latest figures is that the three-year-low rate occurred because since the start of the year a lower percentage of people have been in the labour market. The participation rate has fallen from 65.3% last November to 64.7% in August \u2013 a difference of around 100,000 people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/15/australia-didnt-have-a-great-recession-tell-that-to-young-people\">Australia didn't have a 'great recession'? Tell that to young people | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the unemployment rate is the percentage of unemployed within the labour force, this means that had the participation rate stayed steady, the unemployment rate would now be higher \u2013 around 6.3% in seasonally adjusted terms and 6.1% in trend terms.</p> <p>Now there is only so far you can go holding the participation rate steady, but it is undeniable that the current low unemployment rate is a function of both a lower participation rate and strong part-time employment growth.</p> <p>Since December, in trend terms, part-time employment has risen by 105,330 jobs, while full-time employment has fallen by 21,460 jobs:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Employment growth - monthly (trend)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/S4Yz8/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And with this rise in part-time work, not surprisingly has come an increase in underemployment.</p> <p>In August, the underemployment ratio \u2013 which measures the percentage of employed who wish to work more hours \u2013 reached a record 9.2%, while the underemployment rate \u2013 which measures the number of underemployed as a percentage of the labour force \u2013 also hit a record high of 8.6%.</p> <p>One of the odd things about underemployment is it wasn\u2019t much of a thing until the 1990s recession, and even then only really became an issue anyone really cared about in the past 15-20 years.</p> <p>Until the start of the century there were always more unemployed than there were underemployed; now it is the opposite:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Unemployed and underemployed\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Vcv1f/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> The reason for the increase has been the change in employment from full-time to part-time, and the increase in the number of women in employment.</p> <p>In 1986 for example, 93% of men were employed full-time, so it is little wonder back then only 2.5% of male workers wanted more hours. Now just 81% of men work full-time, and 7.5% of men are underemployed.</p> <p>Similarly, 30 years ago, only 48% of women were in the workforce, compared to 59% now. And not surprisingly given women are more likely to be in part-time work this has also seen an increase in the numbers of women willing to work more hours.</p> <p>And a big and often ignored change has been the level of youth in full-time work. In the 1980s, youth were as likely to work full-time as were adults, now there is a record low number of youth working full-time:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of adults in full-time employment\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Pt6sH/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> All these factors combined means that it is largely silly to compare underemployment levels further back than around 20 years.</p> <p>If we were to suggest underemployment was the best indicator of employment, you would be arguing that things are worse now than during the 1990 recession:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Underemployment ratio by gender\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7lV9c/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> But that said, the current underemployment rate does suggest there is a lot of \u201cslack\u201d in the current employment market \u2013 and it is a slackness that has increased in the past 12 months.</p> <p>In May 2004, the unemployment rate was 5.6%, as it is now. The underemployment rate was 7.1%. For the next 10 years the two measures largely followed each other \u2013 as the unemployment rate went down or up, so too did the underemployment rate.</p> <p>But that changed mid-way through 2014. First, the underemployment rate began to rise much faster, and then when the unemployment rate began to fall, the underemployment rate oddly kept rising:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Change in underemployment &amp; unemployment since May 2004\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/j6dWv/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> It means that now while the unemployment rate is where it was in May 2004, the underemployment rate is 1.5 percentage points higher than it was then.</p> <p>That is why the underutilisation rate (a combination of unemployment and underemployment) is also 1.5% points higher than it was in May 2004. And this is not just due to more youth working part-time, the underutilisation rate is higher for workers over 25 years of age as well:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Underutilisation rate\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3G5ab/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/sep/06/the-economy-may-be-growing-but-it-sure-doesnt-feel-that-way-to-most-of-us\">The economy may be growing but it sure doesn't feel that way to most of us | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p> That the underutilisation rate has fallen in the past year is certainly a good thing, but that we now have a greater proportion of the labour market either wanting to work more hours or are unemployed than we did during the height of the global financial crisis highlights the weakens of the labour market.</p> <p>It means that any wage growth is likely to be muted for some time, as should any extra need for employment occur due to improved economic conditions, the easiest step would be to allocate more hours for workers rather than try to employ new people.</p> <p>There is no reason to bemoan the fall in the unemployment rate, but the rise in underemployment is likely to be an ongoing issue. And should the two measures continue to diverge, it will only serve to underscore the weakness of the unemployment rate at measuring the health of the economy. &#xa0;</p>",
