  "<p>Nick Xenophon has revealed his party will oppose cuts to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) and propose amendments to allow the agency to recoup some funds or take equity in projects it invests in.</p> <p>The compromise comes after sustained Greens opposition and uncertainty within Labor over whether to accept the $1.3bn cut to Arena contained in the government\u2019s omnibus savings bill.</p> <p>Xenophon told Guardian Australia on Friday he will write to shadow climate change and energy minister, Mark Butler, seeking Labor support for the compromise when parliament returns next week. It follows concern about the cut expressed at Labor\u2019s left caucus in the first sitting week of parliament.</p> <p>The government plans to cut $1.3bn from Arena, which gives out funding in the form of grants. It has promised to create <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/23/australia-announces-1bn-clean-energy-fund-to-invest-in-emerging-technologies\">a separate $1bn fund that will give loans</a> or take an equity stake in emerging clean energy technologies, funded from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation\u2019s existing allocation for borrowing.</p> <p>On Friday Xenophon announced he and his colleagues would vote against the cut and put up an alternative to save Arena.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/08/large-scale-solar-to-triple-after-what-could-be-arenas-final-renewable-energy-grants\">Large-scale solar to triple after what could be Arena's final renewable energy grants</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The plan is to change Arena\u2019s funding rules to allow it to have grants repaid with interest, if the project funded becomes a commercial success. Alternatively, Arena would be given the option of taking equity in the project and reap returns. </p> <p>\u201cUnder both proposals money would be ploughed back into the fund to replenish it,\u201d Xenophon said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cIf the Turnbull government is fair dinkum about innovation and agility, this proposed change to the funding mechanism will be a game changer in the innovative renewable energy space.\u201d</p> <p>Xenophon said ditching the Arena grants fund ignored its role in driving early-stage innovation.</p> <p>Labor, the Greens and NXT\u2019s three senators are sufficient to block the omnibus savings bill or insist on changes to the Arena cuts, if the government is amenable. </p> <p>Before the election Labor proposed accepting the $1.3bn cut but to offset it with a $300m increase in funding for renewable energy.</p> <p>Last week, manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/30/labor-says-coalition-has-lied-and-included-additional-cuts-in-omnibus-savings-bill\">those two elements of the policy went together</a>, leaving Labor room to oppose the $1.3bn cut to Arena when it decides its stance on the omnibus bill next week.</p> <p>Labor is also yet to decide on the $1.4bn cut to the clean energy supplement, which would decrease the benefits of new welfare recipients. It backed the cut before the election, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/08/labor-signals-shift-on-election-savings-plan-after-opposition-to-welfare-and-pension-cuts\">is signalling it could now oppose it </a>due to its effect on those on already-low welfare payments like the pension and the dole.</p> <p>On Friday morning the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, called on Labor to back all the measures in the omnibus savings bill which \u201creceived bipartisan support during the course of the election campaign\u201d.</p> <p>Asked on Sky News if the government would accept some measures being broken out of the savings bill to pass the rest of the measures, Cormann repeated that he expected Bill Shorten to \u201cdeliver on his word\u201d and pass the lot.</p> <p>On Thursday the Greens energy and climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, called on Labor to \u201cto listen to energy companies, the CSIRO, university solar researchers and the Australian people who all say Arena\u2019s funding should continue\u201d.</p> <p> \u201cAustralia could be a renewable energy superpower, yet we have a government intent on sending us back to the dark ages by cutting clean energy ... and an opposition who may wave through these cuts,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Correction: An earlier version of this article suggested $1.3bn would be cut from Arena\u2019s budget and added to a new renewable energy fund. In fact, the $1bn for the Clean Energy Innovation Fund will come from CEFC\u2019s existing borrowings.</em></p>",
  "<p>Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, has launched an attack on Britain for \u201cgrowing fat and lazy\u201d, making it ill-prepared for the business deals that need to be done after leaving the EU.</p> <p>Fox, a former GP and staunch Eurosceptic, suggested business executives would rather be playing golf on a Friday afternoon than negotiating export deals.</p> <p>He made the remarks, first reported by the Times, at a Conservative Way Forward event for business leaders in parliament.</p> <p>\u201cIf you want to share in the prosperity of our country, you have a duty to contribute to the prosperity of our country,\u201d he said. \u201cThis country is not the free-trading nation that it once was. We have become too lazy, and too fat on our successes in previous generations.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is the point of us reshaping global trade, what is the point of us going out and looking for new markets for the United Kingdom, if we don\u2019t have the exporters to fill those markets?\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to change the culture in our country. People have got to stop thinking about exporting as an opportunity and start thinking about it as a duty \u2013 companies who could be contributing to our national prosperity but choose not to because it might be too difficult or too time-consuming or because they can\u2019t play golf on a Friday afternoon.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/14/liam-fox-resignation-adam-werritty\">Fox resigned as defence secretary</a> from David Cameron\u2019s government over questions about access given to his friend and unofficial adviser Adam Werritty.</p> <p>However, Theresa May gave him the post of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/philip-hammond-appointed-chancellor-as-george-osborne-exits\">international trade</a> secretary in her new government as one of several high-profile Eurosceptics handed responsibility for dealing with the fallout of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron\">vote to leave the EU</a>.</p> <p>In comments that appear at odds with May\u2019s stated commitment to an active industrial policy, Fox also argued: \u201cWe must turn our backs on [those] that tell us: it\u2019s OK, you can protect bits of your industry, bits of your economy and no one will notice. It is untrue.</p> <p>\u201cProtectionism has always ended in tears. We must be unreconstructed, unapologetic free traders.\u201d</p> <p>A Downing Street spokesman did not endorse Fox\u2019s remarks, saying: \u201cThe principle behind our approach is to ensure British businesses can succeed in the world.\u201d</p> <p>Fox also indicated more emphasis would be placed in future on exports, in contrast to the previous government\u2019s focus on attracting foreign investment.</p> <p>\u201cUp until the change of government, the policy was to get as much foreign direct investment into the United Kingdom as possible, but to largely ignore overseas direct investment elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s a problem because it\u2019s great the year we get the foreign investment and we get jobs created, but every year after that all their income flows go to their parent companies.\u201d</p>",
  "<h2>Monday</h2> <p>You\u2019d have thought that government officials would have wised up to the fact that the Downing Street snappers can read their briefing notes if they wander about with them in their hands. So for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/06/grammar-schools-government-will-publish-plan-end-ban-weeks\">want of a decent ringbinder</a>, the government was forced to bring forward plans to reintroduce grammar schools, a policy the education secretary, Justine Greening, is far less keen on than Theresa May. Still, at least the row about selection and parental choice has taken everyone\u2019s eyes off another embarrassment for the Department for Education. Last year\u2019s SATs are now acknowledged to have been so hard that even primary schools that performed above average have been given a negative progress-related target for next year\u2019s tests. In layman\u2019s terms, this means the majority of schools will have to do less well than last year to prove they are doing better.</p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>It\u2019s an ill wind ... Keith Vaz announced he would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/labour-big-guns-chuka-umunna-caroline-flint-yvette-cooper-line-up-replace-keith-vaz\">stand down as chair of the home affairs select committee</a> just as many of his colleagues were going through the division lobby to vote on the government\u2019s finance bill. One Labour MP just happened to be standing behind a colleague who is on the committee. Seeing news of Vaz\u2019s resignation on the colleague\u2019s mobile, without blinking an eye, she immediately turned to another Labour MP and said: \u201cI trust you will be supporting my candidacy for chair of the home affairs committee.\u201d The king is dead, long live the queen. She hopes. Still, Vaz does have a few friends left in the Labour party. Ken Livingstone went on Sky News to say a politician shouldn\u2019t be judged on one or two mistakes, such as apparently offering to pay for cocaine and appearing enthusiastic about breaking in an inexperienced east European sex worker. Ken then went on to mention Hitler.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>Relationships don\u2019t get much more meta than this. Having very openly got together at the Met Ball in the summer, actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/19/tom-hiddlestone-taylor-swift-match-made-in-heaven-pr-stunt\">Tom Hiddleston and singer Taylor Swift</a> then went on to conduct their romance almost entirely in public, with photographers on call to detail every hook-up of l\u2019affaire Hiddleswift. Swift has now very publicly broken up with the Hid on the grounds that their relationship had become too public and the Hid has been very publicly photographed mooching around looking broken-hearted. To make matters worse for the Hid, it now looks as if he won\u2019t land the job of playing the next James Bond that he or his people had been angling for after his success in The Night Manager. Daniel Craig has reportedly been offered $150m to continue as 007 for another couple of films.</p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>At last something Labour can win. For years now, the title of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2012/oct/25/westminster-dog-of-the-year-pictures\">Westminster dog of the year</a> has been a safe Tory seat, but Labour MP Jonathan Reynolds\u2019 two labradoodles, Clinton and Kennedy, managed to see off a strong field to be crowned 2016 champions. \u201cI speak for everyone in the Labour party when I say it\u2019s about time we won something, so we might as well accept this,\u201d Reynolds said. Mind you, Clinton and Kennedy did have an advantage as the competition seemed to be rigged in favour of the bigger dogs: the assault course jumps were twice the size of Clem, the diminutive shih tzu owned by Labour MP Anna Turley. Despite there being two Tories on the judging panel \u2013 Andrea Jenkyns and Hugo Swire, the owners of last year\u2019s winners \u2013 the result wasn\u2019t well received by some Tories, who felt Reynolds\u2019 pooches should have been marked down for not being sound enough on Brexit.</p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>Today is the day Britain starts a huge round of trade deals that will be wrapped up within one to two years. At least that\u2019s what the Brexit minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/05/david-davis-vows-to-build-national-consensus-on-brexit\">David Davis,</a> promised in a piece for the Conservative Home blog in July: \u201cI would expect the new prime minister on September 9th to immediately trigger a large round of global trade deals with all our most favoured trade partners. I would expect the negotiation phase of most of them to be concluded within 12 to 14 months.\u201d Except, as the Australians, the US and the Japanese have pointed out in the past week, that isn\u2019t going to happen. Partly because they have said they will prioritise concluding trade deals with the EU, but mainly because it will be impossible to conduct meaningful trade negotiations with other countries until the precise nature of our own exit from the EU has been finalised. So it will be at least two and a half years before we can even start negotiating. All of which is great news for the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, as it means he can do what he likes doing best \u2013 flying round the world doing not very much. With or without his friend Adam Werritty.</p> <p><strong>Digested week, digested: Brexit means never having to give a running </strong><strong>commentary on Brexit.</strong></p>",

He referred to attendees as \u201cyou people\u201d at one point. Trump also railed against the Obama administration for not admitting Christian refugees from Syria into the United States, a major cause of concern for evangelicals who have long advocated for minority Christian communities in the Middle East. The problem is that Trump\u2019s own refugee policy would be a blanket ban on anyone from the region entering the United States.</p> <p>He did seem cognizant that no one would mistake him for a devout evangelical. At one point in the speech he joked that his support for repealing the Johnson Amendment, which would allow churches to engage in partisan politics while keeping their tax exempt status, was the only way he could get into heaven. But the biggest applause was not for Trump himself but for when he proclaimed \u201cHillary Clinton is unfit to be president.\u201d The room exploded in applause and one attendee could be seen waving his tricorn hat in support.</p> <p>Values Voter Summit is sponsored by the Family Research Council and has a constellation of conservative groups represented. Even the far-right John Birch Society had a table in the group\u2019s exhibition hall.</p> <p>But Trump\u2019s performance seemed to ease the concerns of attendees who represented some of the most ardent cultural warriors in the party, a group that has long been uncomfortable with the nominee and preferred other candidates like Ted Cruz in the primary.</p> <p>Dylan Miller, a rising community college freshman from Northwest Florida said the speech changed his mind about Trump. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem maniacal\u201d said the teenager, in contrast to the Republican nominee\u2019s performances on television. Miller had said he had always planned on voting for Trump \u201cbecause he wasn\u2019t Hillary,\u201d but Trump\u2019s performance made him feel far more comfortable with his vote.</p> <p>Another attendee, Sarah Ocker, a student at Tulsa Community College in Oklahoma, said she was \u201cmore there\u201d now than she was before the speech. She \u201cagreed with a lot\u201d of what Trump said, particularly about \u201creligious liberty.\u201d Ocker still had major hesitations about Trump and still couldn\u2019t commit to voting for the Republican nominee though but was \u201choping\u201d she could find a reason to vote for him in November.</p> <p>Vernon Lewis of Marshall, Texas was further along in the process. Lewis had once thought he would have to hold his nose to vote for Trump.

  "<p>The Rabbits, written by Kate Miller-Heidke and adapted from a picture book by John Marsden and Shaun Tan, was one of the most popular shows to run at this year\u2019s Sydney festival. The production, which debuted at Perth international arts festival in 2015, promised to bring the book to life with spectacular staging and costumes that would bring a third dimension to Tan\u2019s illustrations and characters. Everybody raved about it. Guardian Australia gave it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/18/the-rabbits-review-triumphant-adaptation-of-a-deeply-tragic-story\">a five-star review</a>.</p> <p>There was only one snag: I would never be able to see it. </p> <p>Live theatre is an experience most enjoy, but for those who are blind or have low vision, the gap left by the visual information \u2013 taken for granted by sighted people \u2013 can be extremely frustrating. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/18/the-rabbits-review-triumphant-adaptation-of-a-deeply-tragic-story\">The Rabbits review \u2013 triumphant adaptation of a deeply tragic story</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I lost my sight at the age of five as the result of glaucoma. As a musician and writer, I have a particular interest in theatre and have welcomed the increase in audio-described theatre available in Australia. With descriptions, people like me can engage with and sometimes get lost in the work on stage. Sometimes we\u2019re backstage before a show begins, touching the props and costumes. </p> <p>I wouldn\u2019t be able to see The Rabbits, but on 21 January \u2013 late in the season \u2013 I was able to enjoy it. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d193c398d0211bf67ea7be2cf2d97ae5d977c95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d193c398d0211bf67ea7be2cf2d97ae5d977c95/0_0_4832_3216/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Rabbits at Sydney Festival in 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The marsupials\u2019 costumes were softer ... zippered like a coat and trousers\u2019: The Rabbits at the 2016 Sydney festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Green</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Rabbits is an allegorical tale of colonisation told from both sides as a group of marsupials (described as \u201cnumbat-like creatures\u201d) have their world invaded by the arrival of the rabbits. The tactile tour organised by Sydney festival was led by the stage manager, Garry Alcorn, who guided a group of us as we touched and held some of what would be appearing on stage.</p> <p>Garry showed us a long pole with a flag on one end and a gun on the other which the rabbits planted on the ground to mark their territories. We felt the rabbit captain\u2019s costume too: a gargantuan top hat with brass studs, gold medallion and trim. Around the sides were plastic clockwork cogs; the 17th century navy coat was transformed to a stiff boat-shaped contraption around the torso, complete with trimmings and gold buttons. The preshow notes, which are given to vision-impaired people before the show, explained the black coat was full of white indecipherable calligraphy, just like the illustration in the book. </p> <p>The marsupials\u2019 costumes were softer, more comfortable two-pieces which could be zippered like a coat and trousers. Last, Garry passed around a baby \u2013 the show\u2019s most important element. It felt like a soft toy animal and had a long tail that fitted snugly around the neck. The end of the tail had a small hook to attach it to kites as they flew out of the reach of the marsupial mothers. </p> <p>During the performance I listened through an earpiece as an audio describer talked me through what was happening on stage \u2013 the movement of the actors, the changes of scene, any other visual cues that were important to the show. Audio describers are usually volunteers trained by Vision Australia, who I work with sometimes; they prepare the preshow notes, and with meticulous timing, feed in the information during gaps between dialogue.</p> <p>Michael Ward is the national coordinator of audio description at Vision Australia. The service, he says, enables people who are blind or have low vision to access the rich elements on offer onstage, helping them be more in the moment than they are when they have to do the extra work of deciphering as well as listening. It also helps place scenes in context and \u201censures you are not the only one in the room not laughing at the sight gag\u201d, he says. </p> <p>Belvoir St Theatre\u2019s production of Stephen Sewell\u2019s The Blind Giant is Dancing was audio-described on 12 March, but I attended an earlier performance too. I was struck by how different the play was the second time around.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37223d286fde4e6eb56caf20dd358044ce0cf5d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37223d286fde4e6eb56caf20dd358044ce0cf5d0/0_0_6496_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yael Stone and Dan Spielman in a promo shot from Belvoir\u2019s 2016 production of the Blind Giant Is Dancing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"591\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yael Stone and Dan Spielman in a promo shot from Belvoir\u2019s 2016 production of The Blind Giant Is Dancing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brett Boardman/Belvoir St Theatre</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Without audio description, the core interest was the dialogue between the main characters: an enraged progressive (Alan played by Dan Spielman), a stubborn feminist (his wife Louise played by his real-life partner Yael Stone), sinister journalist Rose and a controlling magnate. One of the first scenes features an argument between Alan and Louise, and at first, I sided with Alan, in the throes of a midlife crisis with Louise just not listening to him. But with audio description, I learned that Louise kept coming to Alan\u2019s side during their fight, trying to hold him before being rebuffed. I sympathised more with her that time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/feb/16/tv-stars-yael-stone-and-dan-spielman-on-bringing-their-marriage-to-belvoirs-stage\">Orange Is The New Black's Yael Stone brings her marriage to Belvoir's stage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With audio description, movement on stage becomes part of the drama instead of just background noise. In Belvoir\u2019s production of Blind Giant, the sets changed rapidly with little sound; the seeing audience was notified of the move by a flashing screen of text that dominated the stage. Alan could be at home, at his workplace or at a bar having a drink with Rose. Without description, all I got was a jumble of loosely connected chatter with few clues from the script or accompanying sounds. I had to guess where scenes were set \u2013 the local council? The Labour party campaign office? Alan\u2019s office? And where did Alan work? The Institute of Applied Economics in Redfern was stated numerous times on the screen but no one on stage mentioned it. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>With audio description, movement on stage becomes part of the drama instead of just background noise</p> <footer> <cite>Ria Andriani</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Knowing it was in Redfern upon second viewing, I could picture some of the local bars where Alan would meet with Rose. We were told the names of each character as they appeared on stage, too \u2013 helpful when actors are playing more than one character.</p> <p>Jill Gavin, the audio describer for The Blind Giant is Dancing, explained her preparation: \u201cI watch the play three times, once in the audience and twice more in a separate space. At Belvoir the audio describers sit in the green room and watch the show on a video feed.\u201d </p> <p>Gavin uses the scripted stage direction and director\u2019s comments to write preshow notes and fills in the rest with extra information, such as what individual characters look like, what they wear and what they are doing in the spaces between the script. By summarising the scenes one or two pages in advance, Gavin can time her description on cue. This is important: a description must be to the point and not superfluous.</p> <p>As a blind theatregoer, knowing the context and physical detail of the performance makes a great deal of difference to our experience. Tactile tour and audio description services add new layers of information and help us appreciate the complexity of live performance and the richness of our local creative culture. At present these services are mostly confined to major arts companies with well-established procedures in place. But for true accessibility, audio description should be part of every performance.</p>",
  "<p>It was an ordinary, 40-minute flight from Oslo to Trondheim that I spent preparing for a speech I was to give upon landing. But when I turned my phone back on upon arrival, I noticed something very odd, something that had in fact never happened before. A post had been deleted from my Facebook page without any warning. I had shared one of the most iconic images from the Vietnam war \u2013 Nick Ut\u2019s photograph of a naked, screaming child running away from napalm bombs, as a statement in the ongoing debate about Facebook\u2019s editing policies.<br></p> <p>Facebook has taken a strong, rigid stance against \u201cindecent\u201d images. And it is commendable that they execute their role in the prevention of the distribution of images containing violence and child abuse seriously. We all have a responsibility towards this. Yet, by failing to distinguish between such images, and others that have formed the fabric of our history as a global society, Facebook neglects another important role that it plays on the world stage. To erase posts containing such images is to limit freedom of expression, democracy, the right to criticize and question, and view past events as they actually were, not as they have been deemed to be by one giant corporation. I am happy to note that Facebook has now decided to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/09/facebook-reinstates-napalm-girl-photo\">reverse</a> that policy in this particular case \u2013 but serious questions remain. <br></p> <p>Media consumption today is increasingly digitized, but even more so it is curated. News and social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Flipboard have overtaken traditional news outlets as our primary sources of information, of news, of connection to the world around us. They have become our most frequently visited sites, especially among the younger generations, and have empowered the public to create and share their own content. With this ease of access to information in today\u2019s world, comes a great responsibility to enact policies that make positive contributions to society.<br></p> <p>By exercising such overarching editorial rights, large corporations that ought to bring us closer together as human beings through transparency, end up altering history, and altering the truth. Already, Facebook and other media outlets\u2019 algorithms narrow the range of content one sees based on past preferences and interests. This limits the kind of stories one sees, and in turn restricts access to a holistic outlook for the user. We run the risk of creating parallel societies in which some people are not aware of the real issues facing the world, and this is only exacerbated by such editorial oversight. As we move towards a more automated world, this is not a responsibility that should be surrendered to machines only.<br></p> <p>By deleting such iconic pictures that have played a crucial role in transforming world views on the pain and cruelty of war, Facebook is contributing to changing history. I want my children, and other children around the world, to grow up in a society where history is told as it was. In a society where they can grow into mature adults by learning from experiences of past generations, to be better informed citizens of the world. They need to understand what happened both in our darkest moments and our brightest. Today, images are the most powerful and important means of communication, and they must depict reality.<br></p> <p>It would be tragic for history, for the truth, to be told in the version that comes from any one corporation\u2019s mouthpiece. This is why I believe it is imperative that such outlets take their responsibility seriously, while exercising such great influence over their users\u2019 access to information. We have today shown that through the power of social media, we can influence social media. Let\u2019s continue to do that. It is after all a platform for and made by the people, where you can\u2019t let machines run your morality.<br></p>",

The tribe\u2019s chairman, David Archambault II, said the pipeline, which will run under the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, will \u201cknowingly poison water\u201d.</p> <p>The pipeline was originally meant to run near the city of Bismarck, which has an overwhelmingly white population, before objections resulted in the relocation to Native American land. </p> <p>\u201cOur hearts are full, this an historic day for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and for tribes across the nation,\u201d Archambault said. </p> <p>\u201cToday, three federal agencies announced the significant decision to respect tribal sovereignty and stop construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline on army corps land.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur voices have been heard. The Obama administration has asked tribes to the table to make sure that we have meaningful consultation on infrastructure projects</p> <p>\u201cBut I know that our work is not done. We need to permanently protect our sacred sites and our water. There are areas on the construction route that do not fall within federal jurisdiction, so we will continue to fight.\u201d</p> <p>There have been several violent clashes between a coalition of Native American tribes and security guards at a protest camp set up at a pipeline construction site in North Dakota. Other activists, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/07/jill-stein-graffiti-charges-north-dakota-oil-pipeline-protest\">including the Green party presidential candidate, Jill Stein</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/25/native-americans-north-dakota-pipeline-ruling\">actor Susan Sarandon</a>, have lent their voices to the protests, which peaked last weekend when tribes claimed cultural sites were being bulldozed.<strong tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\"></strong></p> <p>Jack Dalrymple, North Dakota\u2019s governor, ordered 100 national guard troops to the area of the protest camp ahead of Boasberg\u2019s decision. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe said it has received assurances that the troops will not enter the camp. Energy Transfer, the company that is building the pipeline, has claimed that its workers have been attacked by protesters. </p> <p>On Thursday, Boasberg had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/07/judge-halts-north-dakota-pipeline-protests-standing-rock-sioux\">ruled</a> that work will temporarily stop between North Dakota\u2019s state highway 1806 and 20 miles east of Lake Oahe, but will continue west of the highway because he believes the US Army Corps of Engineers lacks jurisdiction on private land.</p> <p>The pipeline would funnel 500,000 barrels of oil a day from the North Dakota oil field to a refinery in Illinois. The project is expected to be finished by the end of the year but tribal leaders have raised concerns that the pipeline, which will run under the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, will pollute drinking water for millions of people and disturb sacred sites. </p> <p>In total, the pipeline will make 200 river crossings in four states. The US Army Corp of Engineers, which has jurisdiction over pipelines that cross major waterways, approved the Dakota Access plan <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/30082016/dakota-access-pipeline-standing-rock-sioux-army-corps-engineers-approval-environment?utm_source=Inside+Climate+News&amp;utm_campaign=3d7fa5f272-Weekly_Newsletter_Week_of_6_126_17_2016&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_29c928ffb5-3d7fa5f272-327786905&amp;mc_cid=3d7fa5f272&amp;mc_eid=57ae39df05\">despite warnings</a> from the Environmental Protection Agency that leaking oil could pollute the rivers. Energy Transfer has downplayed the concerns, insisting that any leak would be swiftly remedied. </p> <p>In court documents, Texas-based Energy Transfer said the Dakota Access pipeline is 45% complete and that a temporary injunction to stop it would have \u201cdevastating short and long-term impacts\u201d to the project.</p>",

  "<p>With so many passions aroused in Europe by the impact of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/refugees\" title=\"\">refugee crisis</a>, rising populism, fear of terrorism, not to mention confused debates over secularism and burkinis, exploring what European Muslims think has arguably never been more important. One interesting figure is the grand mufti of Slovenia who I met at a recent conference in Austria, held by the International Peace Institute. Slovenia is a predominantly Catholic country of two million people \u2013 among them, an estimated 50,000 Muslims. The country\u2019s first mosque is currently under construction in the capital, Ljubljana. Building it required the overcoming of many political and administrative hurdles \u2013 these were eventually cleared when Slovenia\u2019s constitutional court ruled that denying a minority the right to a place of worship ran counter to religious freedoms. Unsurprisingly, Grand Mufti Nezad Grabus thinks these are difficult times for Muslims in Europe. They constantly have to fend off suspicions of links with radical Islamism or terrorism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/08/muslim-woman-kicked-off-american-airlines-flight-islamophobia\">I didn't realize how often Muslims get kicked off planes, until it happened to me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Grabus is a quiet, smiling man in his late 40s. If there is one thing he wants to stress, it is that \u201cIslam is part of European civilisation\u201d. Islam is by no means a new religion in Europe, \u201cbut it has new manifestations\u201d, he says. He was shocked by this summer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/19/nice-becomes-latest-french-city-to-impose-burkini-ban\" title=\"\">burkini ban</a> in some French seaside resorts, and he\u2019s bluntly opposed to any legislation outlawing the niqab. But he also says the niqab is something European Muslims must work to counter, because it prevents Muslim women from finding a rightful place in society. Grabus was born in the Bosnian town of Travnik (his father later moved the family to Slovenia where he\u2019d found work, when it was part of communist Yugoslavia). He is a Balkan Muslim. Islam certainly isn\u2019t new in the Balkans, a region that was dominated for centuries by the Ottoman empire.</p> <p>Just as Europe is a patchwork of cultures and nations, Europe\u2019s Muslim populations are extremely diverse, as is their history. This may sound obvious, but it\u2019s something that gets easily pushed aside in all the heated debates about Islam, migration and identity politics. Muslims tend to get lumped together as a single entity. \u201cIn Europe, we Muslims have to acknowledge that we have no common narrative,\u201d says the mufti, \u201cthere are many differences.\u201d For example, he points to how ethnic characteristics play a more important role than many observers realise. Muslims can relate as much to their ethnic or national roots (Bosnian, Albanian, Turkish, Kurdish, Algerian, Pakistani etc) as they do to their religious beliefs. Religious revival, as in any faith, doesn\u2019t mean you sweep away other parts of your identity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How many people know that the first mosque in France was built by the French secular republic (in Paris, in the 1920s)?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But that\u2019s not to say there can\u2019t be a \u201ccommon narrative\u201d, and Grabus is adamant that: \u201cAs Muslims in Europe, our duty is to create one, in which we would expose our understanding of Islam belonging here.\u201d Much of this, he points out, has to do with education and overcoming ignorance, both among Muslims and non-Muslims. How many people, he asks, know that Austro-Hungary, under the Habsburgs, recognised Islam as an official religion as long ago as 1912? How many know that the first mosque in France was built by the secular French republic (in Paris, in the 1920s) as a tribute to the tens of thousands of Muslims who died in the first world war? And how many people are ready to consider that the medieval scholar Averroes, born in C\u00f3rdoba when Andaluc\u00eda was ruled by the Arabs, was a European Muslim?</p> <p>With all the current obsessing over terrorism and radicalisation, it\u2019s easy to forget about Europe\u2019s variety, and the diversity of its Muslim populations. Days after talking with Grabus, I was in Cologne, meeting representatives of the Turkish-Islamic Union for religious affairs (as part of a study group on Germany and the refugee crisis, organised by the Robert Bosch Foundation). The central mosque in Cologne is a beautiful, modern building with concrete and glass walls, and an Ottoman-styled dome. It is still under construction, and it stands as proof of some of the societal changes now under way.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/08/francois-hollande-islam-can-co-exist-with-a-french-secular-state-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/526q4\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2701651\"            data-video-name=\"Fran\u00e7ois Hollande: Islam can co-exist with a French secular state \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d17b30e4b013613fffb500\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/08/160908hollande_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/08/160908hollande.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/08/160908hollande_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/08/francois-hollande-islam-can-co-exist-with-a-french-secular-state-video\">Fran\u00e7ois Hollande: Islam can co-exist with a French secular state</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>A million Muslims live in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia \u2013 a third of Germany\u2019s three-million-strong Turkish community.

Describing his position of third in the polls as \u201ca good beginning\u201d, he insists he can be the catalyst to disrupt and break the classical outmoded left-right political blocs.</p> <p>Macron\u2019s remarks on passporting run counter to claims made by both Philip Hammond, the chancellor and Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, that passporting rights will be preserved. Hammond told MPs this week that any attempt by the EU to split off euro-denominated clearing would not benefit the EU, with business instead drifting to New York.</p> <p>Johnson has insisted the UK\u2019s financial services sector will not be stripped of the passporting rights, which exist within the single market, saying that the City of London will remain a global financial centre.</p> <p>But Macron said: \u201cWe have the eurozone. Could we accept to be cleared, regulated and de facto have inflows and outflows from a country that has decided to leave the EU? For me, definitely not.\u201d</p> <p>He added the EU could not wait months and months for the UK to start Brexit talks. \u201cProcrastination is not the right answer. We have to be extremely strict on the implementation of Brexit so there is a common approach between member states. We must avoid a sector by sector or country by country approach, and ask the UK to be clear.\u201d</p> <p>He also spurned the concessions on free movement as a price for access to the EU single market. \u201cIf you accept such caveats, the more you can damage the EU and it will be an open door for whoever has doubts about Europe, and so reduce the incentive to be pro-European. </p> <p>\u201cI was completely against the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/feb/17/four-eu-states-shun-camerons-benefits-plan-politics-live\">agreements signed with the UK in February</a>; it just said \u2018OK if you give me more, then I will stay in the club\u2019.

It\u2019s a very strange defeat for Europe if people accept that.\u201d</p> <p>Macron said he is trying to develop a programme on economic dynamism, married to social protection, equality of opportunity and security: \u201cI am not just a liberal movement. I come from the progressive left. I am trying to refresh and counter the system.\u201d</p> <p>Macron, attacking his rivals on the right on their strongest issue of national identity, described \u201cthe recent shortcut in the debate from the Nice terrorist attack to the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/burkini-ban-suspended-nice-court-france\">burkini ban</a> as crazy. A national debate on this was the best way to divide the country\u201d.</p> <p>He said that the middle classes were losing their sense of cultural security, but that issue could not be solved by national laws and bans.</p> <p>\u201cThe guy who killed people in Nice was not a Muslim. Daesh [Islamic State] want civil war in our country. They want to divide the country. But they are not in a position to break our country unless we decide to enter into this game and organise a civil war. It is crazy to think the best way to defeat Daesh is to fight Muslims. We have 5.5 million Muslims in France\u201d.</p> <p>But he said there was a deeper issue about unintegrated Muslims in France, especially Salafists who regarded Islamic law as superior to French secular law. He estimated that between 25\u201330% of French Muslims, close to 2 million, thought in this way, and the answer lay in enforcing French secular law.</p> <p>French Muslims had to become less dependent on preachers from Algiers and Morocco, he said. But he added that measures such as the burkini ban, or <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/11/france-bans-burqa-and-niqab\">wearing the veil</a>, risked disenfranchising Muslims and risking their ability to be fully aligned with the Republic.</p>",

As well as social media, they will use their expertise in promotion, marketing, media and digital rights to take the sport to a new level of awareness and participation across multiple platforms, including mobiles, tablets and smart TVs.</p> <p>The new F1 chairman, Chase Carey, who will become the face of the sport, wants to expand the digital footprint. He says: \u201cThere are multiple dimensions to developing the digital opportunities in Formula One. \u201cThere is the marketing potential in telling the Formula One story, and it\u2019s a great story with some of the most attractive stars in the world \u2013 great drivers, great teams, great brands, great technology.\u201d</p> <p>Americans know how to sell things.

Carey will not go along with Ecclestone\u2019s view of the young.

They haven\u2019t got enough money to put in the bloody banks anyway.\u201d</p> <p>There is another area where Liberty Media are likely to succeed where Ecclestone has failed, and that is the United States itself.</p> <p>Ecclestone, to borrow from the tagline for the film Easy Rider, is the man who went looking for America and couldn\u2019t find it anywhere. Formula One has had more circuits in the US than anywhere else.</p> <p>There have been 10 all told\u2013 Sebring, Riverside, Watkins Glen, Long Beach, Caesars Palace, Detroit, Dallas, Phoenix, Indianapolis and Austin \u2013 but the sport has never taken a hold over there, although the crippling fees they have been charged has not helped.</p> <p>Teams and their sponsors need F1 to succeed in the biggest market of them all and to do that the United States must host two or three races so F1 fans become used to watching events in their own time zone.</p> <p>Against a background of declining crowds and haemorrhaging TV audiences the arrival of Liberty Media may be as well-timed as the US cavalry in countless westerns.</p> <p>Formula One, for all its global glamour, is in reality a rather introverted village, a conservative and rather self-obsessed troupe who have not cared enough about their adoring supporters.</p> <p>Carey and the man behind Liberty Media, John Malone \u2013 known as the Darth Vader of Wall Street \u2013 will change all that.</p>",

Sudan has consistently declared support for the elected government, with which it signed a cooperation agreement in 2012. When the civil war began in December 2013 Sudan (as the country most affected by instability in the new state) won praise for involvement in reconciliation contacts.

The decision to send troops to help stability in South Sudan deserves praise and should not be misunderstood as a \u201cgamble\u201d or an attempt \u201cto maintain the fiction of global reach\u201d, as Tisdall writes.

  "<p>There has only ever really been one director of Tate, and that has been Serota. Sat facing him at a recent dinner, I was asked by a European collector how it was that I had been seated opposite God. Before Serota, there was only the Tate at Millbank. No Tate Modern nor St Ives. Tate Liverpool opened just as he joined in 1988. Since then, he has successfully reinvented the Tate name, steering a somewhat fusty and guarded institution into the 21st<sup> </sup> century. Directors of Tate\u2019s branches have come and gone. Serota has remained.

Good at fighting his corner with a succession of governments, he is equally adept at schmoozing collectors around the world in order to procure loans and donations.

His career \u2013 at Oxford\u2019s Museum of Modern Art and running the Whitechapel \u2013 before he replaced <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Bowness\">Alan Bowness</a> as director of Tate, was more about collaborating with artists than building a collection.

So too is the desire to make it one of the world\u2019s great museums. He has made Tate truly international. The popularity of Tate Modern took Serota by surprise. No one expected such numbers. Serota thought he had an art museum; what he got was a major tourist attraction.

Looking at museum chiefs around the world, I ask myself: who would want the job? Who would want to come to London now?

The museum itself was founded on money derived from <a href=\"http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/founder-tate-gallery-dies\">Henry Tate\u2019s fortune in the sugar trade</a> and, ultimately, from slavery. Tate cannot survive on public money alone, but the origin of private sponsorship is an increasingly contentious ethical issue. The institution needs the goodwill of artists and of the public, many of whom find such sponsorship deals morally repugnant and unjustifiable.</p> <p>Like all British museums, Tate finds it increasingly difficult to fund purchases in the overheated art market. It also faces criticism about the pay offered to its curatorial and programming staff. Where is the money to come from, to attract the best and the most ambitious? Tate\u2019s new director will have to deal with all of this, and run a museum too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3edfd1aef1f982b6f6d2e1be4f50c7cc64ad05a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3edfd1aef1f982b6f6d2e1be4f50c7cc64ad05a7/0_0_1447_1023/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sigmar Polke\u2019s Alice in Wonderland at Tate Liverpool, 1995.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"707\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sigmar Polke\u2019s Alice in Wonderland at Tate Liverpool, 1995.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tate Photography/\u00a9 Estate of Sigmar Polke/DACS 2014, photograph \u00a9 Tate Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Serota\u2019s five greatest Tate hits</h2> <p><strong>Richard Serra: Weight and Measure</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/serra-weight-and-measure-p20144\">Tate Britain, 1992</a>)<br>In the winter of 1992, the American sculptor installed two large blocks of forged steel on the floor of Tate.

I knew I wanted to look at issues surrounding masculinity and violence so I thought back to my own experience.</p> <p> \u201cI thought back to getting stomped out and the aftermath and thought that moment was a good way in to explore why boys act the way they do, why there are these weird social hierarchies that exist and that have been there for generations,\u201d he says. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWV2hK4HVEk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wWV2hK4HVEk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p> At AFI, he earned a Student Academy Award for the short film <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2073039/\">Nani</a>, which he co-wrote with <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4454043/\">Joshua Beirne-Golden</a>; then they teamed up to write Kicks<em>,</em> a coming-of-age film that\u2019s much more than a boy-meets-shoe, boy-loses-shoe, boy-gets-shoe-back story. </p> <p> A compelling mixture of the gritty and surreal, Kicks<em> </em>tells the story of Brandon, an undersized Bay Area teen caught between the dreams of childhood and the harsh actuality of adolescence. The film opens with Brandon talking over a slow motion foot chase ... and a floating astronaut only Brandon sees. This symbol of Brandon\u2019s isolation and his desire for escape, is a recurring motif throughout the movie.</p> <p> When Brandon obtains the shoes he covets \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.flightclub.com/air-jordans/air-jordan-1\">Bred Ones</a> (Black and Red Jordan Ones, a renowned shoe among sneakerheads) \u2013 he\u2019s convinced his stature will grow. But like Tipping, he gets beaten up and robbed. (This being 2016, the aggressors also record the incident on their phones and post it online.) Humiliated and desperate to recover his shoes, Brandon and his two best friends undertake a classic hero\u2019s quest. Their journey reveals the consequences of macho posturing and ultimately forces them to confront their values and those of their community. </p> <p> It feel like a quintessential urban American tale but Tipping draws from a wider array of influences. Growing up in the Bay Area, he loved mainstream movies \u2013 Steven Spielberg, John Hughes and Star Wars<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em>\u2013 while dreaming of becoming a rap star. (\u201cBig mistake,\u201d he acknowledges.) In college, Tipping spent a semester in Rome and became entranced by Italian cinema; returning to the University of California at Santa Barbara, he switched from economics to film and media studies and says that for Kicks<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em>he drew upon his time in Rome as well as the French classic, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-bicycle-thief--bicycle-thieves-1949\">The Bicycle Thief</a>.</p> <p> Still, much of the movie is distinctly personal, such as the use of rap to bolster the narrative and, of course, the astronaut. \u201cIt took a lot to convince people,\u201d he says, because it would be expensive and time-consuming on an indie film. Tipping insisted it was essential to the film \u2013 \u201cI would rather have made a different movie until I was able to make this with the vision I wanted\u201d \u2013 and ultimately prevailed.</p> <p> Tipping also carefully tracked the script\u2019s violence. The shocking first fatality transpires before a gun can be fired. \u201cI did not want to Tarantino anything,\u201d Tipping says. \u201cThese are real issues kids are facing and if you glamorize it then it becomes disrespectful.\u201d The director wanted the audience to feel anxious even when no violence was occurring onscreen, to give a sense of the the toll taken by living in that environment. \u201cI lived in constant anxiety when I was young.\u201d</p> <p> Tipping also strove to make Flaco and Marlon, Brandon\u2019s murderous uncle, more than one-dimensional gangsters. \u201cIf I set them up as \u2018that thug\u2019 then they\u2019re easy to dismiss,\u201d Tipping says. Instead both are depicted as trying, in deeply flawed ways, to be responsible and loving family men. \u201cI think about the kids stomping me out and what happened to them that made them think it was OK to beat the crap out of anyone. It must have been more painful than anything I\u2019d been through.\u201d</p> <p>Despite this thoughtful approach, the movie is rated R because the teenage boys talk like, well, teenage boys. Tipping contrasts it with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/26/jason-bourne-review-matt-damon-back-in-fun-but-forgettable-action-revamp\">Jason Bourne</a>, which \u201chas an execution-style scene every two minutes\u201d, but is rated PG-13, \u201cso they can show that in a high school but they can\u2019t show Kicks there.\u201d</p> <p> Casting was crucial, especially since Tipping used relatively inexperienced actors with little rehearsal time on a low budget. He saw an instant connection between 13-year-old Jahking Guillory (Brandon) and Christopher Meyer (Rico) and CJ Wallace (Albert), both 17. \u201cThere was this natural dynamic where they treated [Guillory] like a younger brother and you could see he\u2019d be bragadocious and wanted to be like them. It was raw and authentic.\u201d</p> <p> They gelled so well at the audition that Wallace, the son of the late rapper Biggie Smalls, took Meyer\u2019s phone number, knowing they\u2019d both get cast. \u201cWhat you see is on the screen \u2013 those guys really became my best friends,\u201d says Meyer.</p> <p> Authenticity came easy for Guillory. \u201cI was always the underdog, the smallest person in my neighborhood and with my long hair people teased me that I looked like a little girl,\u201d he says, although instead of using violence he\u2019d prove teasers wrong as a local football and track star in Long Beach, California. Unlike Brandon, Guillory says he wouldn\u2019t attack a bully to get his sneakers back. \u201cI\u2019d just tell the dude\u2019s mom,\u201d he laughs.</p> <p> Wallace, raised to be polite and well-behaved, reveled in the chance to indulge in Albert\u2019s \u201ctalk to any girl, say anything and believe everything. It was like a little escape for me to break all the rules\u201d.</p> <p> Tipping says the teenagers had a natural feel for what their characters would say. He allowed numerous takes, especially for Wallace. \u201cHe\u2019d have us laughing so hard I\u2019d say, \u2018let\u2019s do 10 more,\u2019\u201d Tipping says. However, some humour was cut \u201cotherwise the audience wouldn\u2019t pay attention to the next scene\u201d. Wallace cites a deleted car chase \u201cwhere I was going off like Chris Tucker\u201d that would have tilted the tone of the movie too much.</p> <p> The rookie director also knew how to draw emotions from his young cast. Before they started filming, Tipping asked Guillory to think about someone he\u2019d lost \u2013 \u201cmy great-grandma was my best friend\u201d \u2013 and then talked to him about it on set when Guillory needed to cry.</p> <p> Tipping had one final casting challenge: the shoes in question. \u201cI spent weeks changing my mind \u2013 from <a href=\"http://sneakernews.com/2016/01/20/first-look-at-the-air-jordan-11-space-jam/\">Space Jams </a>to red <a href=\"http://www.flightclub.com/air-jordan-4-retro-toro-bravo-fire-red-white-black-cmnt-grey-011779\">Toro Bravos,</a>\u201d he says, although they were always Air Jordans, the original status shoe. </p> <p> Needing a timeless style, he finally chose Bred Ones ... but then needed a new pair \u2013 two actually, in case the star got scuffed up. \u201cWe were so strapped for cash, having spent 80% of our wardrobe budget on the astronaut costume so I dug deep into my own pockets,\u201d he says. While it\u2019s \u201ca little embarrassing\u201d to admit, he\u2019s basically the same shoe size Guillory was at 13 so he kept both pairs for himself. \u201cScore for me,\u201d he says. \u201cI have not been jumped for them yet.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Plans by Britain\u2019s only caviar farmer to expand his operations to a tiny rural community in East Sussex have sparked a backlash from locals concerned over its environmental impact.<br></p> <p>Ken Benning opened the country\u2019s first caviar farm in Devon two years ago and supplies Michelin-starred restaurants in Britain, but his planning application for a further sturgeon farm at East Chiltington has been greeted with a wave of opposition.<br></p> <p>Placards reading \u201csay no to Caviar farm\u201d, \u201csave our sea trout\u201d and \u201ceating up our landscape\u201d have sprouted from hedges at almost every home along the main road, which nestles below the South Downs escarpment. With immaculately kept gardens running along the virtually traffic-free Chiltington Lane it is a picture postcard English hamlet.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Benning\u2019s Exmoor Caviar business is marketed as \u201cBritish Caviar\u201d and its product has been stocked by retailers including Selfridges in the past. A calamitous decline in beluga sturgeon populations in the Caspian Sea resulted a decade ago in a international trade ban on wild-harvested eggs, which has in turn fired a rise in caviar farms around the world.</p> <p>East Chiltington residents learned of the plans last month and met on Sunday to discuss the proposed farm. They have a week to register their views with Lewes District Council, which will decide on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://planningpa.lewes.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&amp;keyVal=OBSO3AJDI7J00\">Benning\u2019s application</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Janet Downes, a local resident leading opposition to his plan, said: \u201cThis is a very narrow country lane outside South Down national park. He\u2019s coming to move tonnes of earth on a sloping site.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>She said the visual impact was \u201ctoo vast\u201d. She said the land has been used for grazing for hundreds of years. \u201cIf someone wanted to come here and put an agricultural enterprise that we thought fit in with the local area, we wouldn\u2019t have a problem.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.wrongthingwrongplace.com/\">A website</a> set up by locals opposed to the plan claims: \u201cBuilding the caviar farm will require thousands and thousands of tonnes of earth to be moved to reshape the slope and dig the ponds \u2013 and all that in the middle of a tiny hamlet in one of the quietest parishes in the county.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2b6916b7b64a099d2f1bb4fb5eb1a045c2f7756\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2b6916b7b64a099d2f1bb4fb5eb1a045c2f7756/0_0_3495_1472/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Locals opposed to the proposed Chiltington Caviar farm in East Sussex\" width=\"1000\" height=\"421\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Locals opposed to the proposed Chiltington Caviar farm in East Sussex.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: wrongthingwrongplace.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>John St Pierre, vice-chairman of the Ouse and Adur Rivers Trust, said he would not object outright to the application but there must be protections for sea trout, which spawn in the Winterbourne river before heading out via the Bevern stream and river Ouse to sea. The farm will draw water from it to fill its ponds.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t like the idea of having a fish farm there, we\u2019d rather it wasn\u2019t there, but we\u2019re not going to be antagonistic to someone who wants to set up a business. What we are concerned about is the flow, and if it\u2019s insufficient in winter we lose a small but significant spawning ground for sea trout,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Local councillor for East Chiltington, Sarah Osborne, who lives a quarter of a mile down the road in St John Without, said: \u201cMy main concern is that the farm does not fit with this location. If it goes through, the land will be permanently scarred. It won\u2019t be put back to the way it was. I worry about the impact on local environment, especially the Winterbourne brook.\u201d</p> <p> </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"678e2cbbc68d23539d2e1c7f9210e7260f232ff9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/678e2cbbc68d23539d2e1c7f9210e7260f232ff9/32_0_820_492/500.jpg\" alt=\"Plans for the a new caviar farm\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plans for the a new caviar farm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Benning, who said he bought the land south of Chiltington House from his parents, rejected the charges and accused residents of nimbyism.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe campaign is incorrect, it\u2019s scaremongering. Their evidence is not true,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir campaign is save our sea trout. Sea trout come in December. Southern water has a flow gauge \u2013 all the water comes from the South Downs, in winter it flows heavily. They claim I will be extracting water every day so it will dry out [but I will not].\u201d<br></p> <p>On the visual impact, he said: \u201cYou cannot see the farm from the road, it\u2019s not scarring the landscape. It\u2019s making two redundant fields get some life from farming. It\u2019s a derelict site.\u201d<br></p> <p>He defended caviar farming in Britain as an ethical and sustainable way to provide food, with the female sturgeon milked for their eggs rather than killed. Benning also said the Sussex operation \u2013 which planning documents show involves five ponds, two for the sturgeon \u2013 would be less extensive than the existing one in Devon.</p>",
  "<p>Bermondsey, Millwall\u2019s south London home patch for the past 106 years, has been called many things in its time. \u201cLondon\u2019s larder\u201d was one hopeful piece of rebranding, tribute to its many tinned food factories. \u201cBiscuit town\u201d came and went, legacy of the Peek Freans boom years, when the world\u2019s combined Garibaldi reserves were supplied by London\u2019s most unloved peninsula. Even snappier, although not often mentioned by local estate agents, was \u201cTarget Area G\u201d, the Luftwaffe\u2019s name for Bermondsey and surrounding areas during the nine-month firestorm of the blitz.</p> <p>Miraculously the Den escaped the bombings untouched right up until April 1943, when it was all but destroyed in a raid. Millwall\u2019s manager, Bill Voisey, sitting up late in his office, survived a direct hit, although his injuries meant he was succeeded by the legendarily debonair Jack Cock, England footballer, war hero, popular singer and star of the &#xa0;films <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0164233/\" title=\"\">The Winning Goal</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020936/\" title=\"\">The Great Game</a>.</p> <p>It is a very Millwall, very south-Bermondsey-cum-New-Cross-wilderness kind of story; a place that seems to have spent most of the past 500 years since Henry VIII demolished on a whim its only monastery, being unwanted, unloved and generally shot to bits.</p> <p>These same qualities of resilience may be needed again after the decision this week by Lewisham\u2019s Labour council to approve plans for compulsory purchase of land around the Den as part of a mass \u201cregeneration\u201d project. Millwall currently rent the land under threat, the loss of which could threaten the club\u2019s basic operations. They offered to buy it at a higher price. Lewisham chose to go with the developer Renewal, which is ultimately controlled by offshore companies with mysterious owners and whose plan involves shoehorning in 2,400 homes, the huge majority for private sale, as part of Boris Johnson\u2019s ramped-up \u201cNew Bermondsey\u201d vision.</p> <p>The end result of which is more of the same old, same old. Target Area G is once more in the crosshairs. The Den is again under attack. As indeed, more broadly, is football itself, or at least its fogged and dwindling status as a force for community and collectivism, to be prized and valued beyond the annihilating simplicities of the market.</p> <p>This was probably always coming. From the outside, Bermondsey has always felt like an oddly abandoned place, hard to get to, hard to get out of, a hidden corner of outer-inner London jutting out into the southern bend of the Thames. Wealth and work have tended to dribble away, first the leather industry, then the food factories and finally the docks.</p> <p>Millwall have at least stuck around, a marmalade and jam works team from the Isle of Dogs shifted up river and settled on Cold Blow Lane. It has been a febrile existence, right from the first dockers\u2019 derby with West Ham, during which the East Ham Echo noted \u201call attempts at football were ignored\u201d, culminating in West Ham\u2019s Jarvis inflicting serious injury by smashing the head of Millwall\u2019s Deans against a metal advertising board.</p> <p>A period of success in the late 1960s was followed by the closure of the docks and an increased sense of inner-city alienation. The hand grenade chucked on to the pitch from the away end at Griffin Park may have been a harmless replica, but for two decades the Den attracted some genuinely frightening people. A huge amount of work has gone into tackling racism in the ground. But this was for many years a place where something curdled and scabbed did occasionally erupt into view. Football cannot solve these problems. It does at least try.</p> <p>This is all a part of the current story. New Bermondsey. We get the idea. Time to flush out and rebrand. Revenue streams must be wrung, the light let in. The developers\u2019 plan is, quite literally, to \u201cclad\u201d the Den, to make it look new from the outside, the architectural equivalent of slapping a new hat on grandma\u2019s head and wheeling her off into the corner because the posh in-laws are coming round.</p> <p>And yet, industry loyalties aside, there are some serious problems with what Lewisham and its developer are proposing to do. For a start, the plans to create a \u201cnew community\u201d overlook the fact Bermondsey already has a community, one that has been flourishing, quietly, with help from Millwall themselves.</p> <p>This is not simply a local leisure service provider. Football clubs do not relocate when times are thin (unless they are MK Dons). They stick it out and engage. London\u2019s hunger for space may have finally touched the Den. But the club believes it has the right not to be edged out, but to play a role in the regeneration of the area. Instead it finds itself ushered to one side by a local authority that has little historic interest in sport of any kind, whose boundaries end a tantalising 500 metres west, and whose inhabitants have often been supported by the club\u2019s own community initiatives.</p> <p>Three years ago Millwall sent their players out to join the (successful) campaign to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jan/24/protest-plans-shut-lewisham-hospital\" title=\"\">save Lewisham hospital A&amp;E department</a>, a triumph that offered plenty of political capital to the same officials now selling their land from under their feet. The Millwall Community Trust has also been out there going above and beyond, offering education and opportunities, helping young offenders and kids with learning difficulties.

That gap is smaller thanks to the UK consistently running a surplus in trade in services \u2013 an area covering businesses such as financial and legal services \u2013 which helps make up some of the trade deficit in goods. </p> <p>Britain\u2019s international trade secretary, Liam Fox, said: \u201cThis data is very encouraging as it shows a major boost for exporters post referendum.

Consumer spending appears to have held up well and surveys suggest manufacturing and services companies enjoyed a rebound in activity in August following an initial post-referendum slump in July.</p> <p>Howard Archer, economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight, said the improved trade performance in July lifted hopes it would make a positive contribution to third-quarter GDP.</p> <p>\u201cDecent news for UK third-quarter growth prospects as the trade deficit narrowed markedly in July helped by improved exports, and construction output defied expectations of a drop in output,\u201d he said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/05/uk-services-sector-brexit-rebounds-pmi-eu-referendum\">Based on recent business surveys published by financial data company Markit</a>, the economy looks likely to have grown 0.1% in the third quarter. That would represent a sharp slowdown from 0.6% in the second quarter.</p> <p>But Archer also noted the ONS\u2019s warning not to read too much into one month\u2019s data. In its report on trade, the ONS said: \u201cAs monthly data can often be volatile, it is unclear whether this is an impact of the depreciation of sterling and it is necessary to look at the trend over the next few months to get a clearer picture.\u201d</p> <p>On construction, the ONS said: \u201cThere is very little anecdotal evidence at present to suggest that the referendum has had an impact on output. You should note that we always warn against overly interpreting one month\u2019s figures.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Hollingsworth at the consultancy Capital Economics echoed those warnings. </p> <p>\u201cWhile we would caution against reading too much into any one month\u2019s figures at the best of times, this is particularly true of trade and construction figures.</p> <p>\u201cIndeed, the survey evidence suggests that the near-term outlook for construction is poor ... The near-term outlook for trade on the other hand looks a little better ... The upshot is that while it is still early days, the latest figures give us little reason to alter our view that the immediate impact of the vote to leave the EU will be less severe than many had anticipated.\u201d<br></p> <p>Chiming with recent business surveys showing companies are having to pay more for imported materials because of a weaker pound, the ONS trade release showed import prices grew by 3.2% on June 2016. </p> <p>Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the UK\u2019s near-term trade prospects would continue to be largely determined by how much the benefits of lower sterling for exporters are offset by higher input costs. <br></p> <p>\u201cOver the long-term, the UK\u2019s trade position will be driven by how successful the government is in delivering the best possible terms of trade for the future, both with the EU and with markets further afield,\u201d added Thiru.</p> <p>The ONS construction figures showed output was flat in July, better than economists\u2019 expectations for a 0.8% drop. It compared with a 1.0% drop in June. Measured against a year ago, output was down 1.5%, the biggest drop since April 2013 but above expectations for a 3.2% drop in a Reuters poll of economists.</p> <p>Construction orders rose 8.6% in the second quarter compared with the first quarter, primarily boosted by housing.</p> <p>The figures will reassure Bank of England policymakers meeting to set interest rates next week that they can afford to leave policy unchanged for now.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">Interest rates were cut to a new record low of 0.25% in August</a> and governor Mark Carney hinted another cut to take rates close to zero could follow before the end of the year.

The evidence that they harm poorer children\u2019s life chances is clear, but the residual belief among many that somehow they promote social mobility remains stubbornly resistant to the facts.</p> <p>It\u2019s not difficult to understand why. Many people in politics and the media benefited from a grammar education themselves and feel it formed the basis of their success. They genuinely want to offer that opportunity to others whose parents can\u2019t afford a private school or the expensive catchment area of a popular comprehensive. The problem is that for every success story there are far more hidden examples of lost potential.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/07/grammar-schools-expansion-disaster-social-mobility-tsar-alan-milburn\">More grammar schools would be a disaster, says social mobility tsar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fact is that grammar schools rarely educate young people from low income backgrounds \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.suttontrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GRAMMAR-SCHOOLS-FACT-SHEET.pdf\" title=\"\">just 3% of their pupils</a> receive free school meals \u2013 so they exacerbate social divisions rather than easing them. Combined, Grammar schools educate just 9,000 low-income pupils. That\u2019s fewer than the number of low-income pupils in Bradford. And this is why education experts are united in opposing them.</p> <p>But even if a way could be found for more poor pupils to benefit from grammars they would still be a bad idea. The fundamental assumption behind selective schools is that only a small percentage of the population can truly benefit from an academic education.</p> <p>Not only is this not true \u2013 look at inner-city schools such as King Solomon academy in London where almost all pupils achieve five good GCSEs \u2013 but it\u2019s economically dangerous. We no longer live in a world where it makes sense for just 20% of the population to have access to high-quality academic education. Without higher-level skills students will have no chance of competing for jobs in an increasingly global market.</p> <p>It also goes against the beliefs that have guided education policy over the past six years, in which I played a part as an adviser to Michael Gove. During this period, the government pursued the goal of academic education for all through policies such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/17/gcse-exams-replaced-ebacc-michael-gove\" title=\"\">EBacc</a> \u2013 which encourages pupils to take more traditional subjects at GCSE \u2013 and a new curriculum. Many new academies and free schools have been designed around a \u201cgrammar-style education for all\u201d ethos.

It\u2019s not as if countries with selective systems are trading off social inequality for a better educated elite \u2013 they\u2019re getting the worst of both worlds. The <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/korea/education-at-a-glance-2014-country-notes.htm\" title=\"\">OECD has found</a> that not only are selective systems more socially segregated, they are also less effective than inclusive ones.

Perhaps you think your children will have no problem passing the 11-plus, but be aware that at the height of the grammar school system it was estimated that some 70,000 children a year were inaccurately placed on the wrong side of the dividing line. Maybe they\u2019ll be good enough and still fail. The reason most grammars closed in the 1960s and 70s was not because of a top-down government decision but because they became very unpopular with voters who worried that their children would miss out.</p> <p>The tragedy in all of this is that there is so much the government could do to genuinely boost social mobility. Even if you support grammar schools, a few extra can be nothing more than a distraction. What we need are great schools for all, especially in the \u201cleft-behind\u201d communities that need them most. And that requires investment in recruiting and retaining the best teachers and leaders and giving them the resources to give every child a high quality education.</p> <p>The prime minister is right to want to boost social mobility, but that requires educational excellence everywhere.</p>",

In fact, I actually work for a state school. My husband works in private education and we had to move recently as he got a job. My daughter was going into year 10 at the time, and the only state school in the area was not very good. We had little choice but to pay fees at my husband\u2019s new school. We felt that moving our daughter from a high-performing grammar to a failing state comprehensive would have been too much of a leap. It\u2019s disappointing, but the only schools in our catchment area are failing, so I\u2019m stuck between my principles and wanting the best for my kids. <br></p> <p>Our children are now at his current school with class sizes that run to a maximum of 20. They are both happy in their school, though my daughter (who is in year 11) has said on numerous occasions that she is looking forward to being back in the state sector when she goes to sixth form college next year.</p> <p>The reason I am pro-state education is that I am naturally a Labour supporter. The children of the wealthier people in this country have huge advantages over everyone else; there is still an old boys\u2019 network at work and the advantages that they get as a result of the schools they go to are huge. By sending my children to a private day school (with a small staff bursary) instead of to our local comprehensive, which was recently graded as inadequate by Ofsted, I know I\u2019m doing something to help their future but I\u2019m in a privileged position and yes, it does make me sad.

Quite right too | Robert McCartney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Two of my older children attended an academy, and the other two younger ones attended non-academies. Choosing a school was very difficult and for the older two I was swayed by popular middle-class opinion about academies. My sons both sat entrance exams to make sure intake was balanced across the ability ranges (there was some scepticism about this among families). I regret sending my older sons to the academy, neither particularly flourished there. The pastoral care was poor and the results-driven ethos meant my sons were steered towards subjects that suited the school more than them. One of my sons was much better off after he moved for sixth form because it was much less formal and \u201cgrammar school-y\u201d. He fitted in better and the teaching was engaging, collaborative and student-focused. He managed to get an A in English language, a subject he opted into reluctantly at the last-minute and which thought would turn him off, because it was brilliantly taught by a skilful teacher. </p> <p>I never considered moving schools as it never reached crisis point with either child and I thought the disruption would outweigh any benefit, but in retrospect I think the atmosphere of pressure was bad for both children. What I disliked most about these specific academies was their lack of focus on students\u2019 best interests compared to the reputation of the school. For example, the school I sent my boys to had a deservedly excellent reputation for music, but to be in the orchestra you had to be of a very high standard \u2013 this favoured privileged kids who\u2019d achieved high grades in external music exams. There were a few inspirational teachers, who I believe would have performed equally well in any school, and a lot of stressed-out automatons who were as worried for their reputations as the kids were for theirs. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>\u2018I sent my children to a comprehensive and have no regrets\u2019<br></h2> <p><strong>Lee, 42 </strong> </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e67f1bd007aa578deb47afb7bac8f06b1d504d09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e67f1bd007aa578deb47afb7bac8f06b1d504d09/0_0_2880_1728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Students working on computers in school\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I have three teenagers who are all very different but are thriving in a diverse and inclusive environment.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juice Images / Alamy/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I attended a grammar that was a brutal and miserable place.

The per capita expenditure was also weighted heavily in favour of the grammar school students which is quite unfair. <br></p> <h2>\u2018I wish my children had got into the local state school\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Laura Joseph, 41 from Bristol<br></strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/06/grammar-schools-social-mobility-theresa-may-early-years\">Grammar schools don\u2019t help social mobility \u2013 we need to start earlier | Melissa Benn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We applied to our three local state schools \u2013 they are all good.

Instead, we got a place at a school a bit further away \u2013 one that didn\u2019t have a great reputation \u2013 so instead chose to pay to send our child to a local Steiner school. It\u2019s very different to how I was educated: I went to my local comprehensive. Steiner schools do not believe in formal learning; there\u2019s no national curriculum. It\u2019s a homely setting, so they do baking bread, and there\u2019s smaller classes. There are also no screens \u2013 so, no children sitting around using iPads. The children also don\u2019t get set homework. I never thought I\u2019d send my child to an alternative school, but there are many benefits to their approach. It\u2019s very creative. It was a big disappointment, however, not getting into any of our local schools. I wanted my children to go to them partly for practical reasons (it\u2019s easy to get to) but also because of the sense of community they offered. One of the schools, which is actually on our street, is attended by lots of our neighbours and it would have been nice for the kids to be part of that.</p> <p><em>Did you get it right?

  "<p>At first glance it looks like any normal fixture. London Irish v Richmond in the Greene King Championship, kick-off 3pm. Tickets still very much available if you are free on Saturday afternoon. Beneath the low-key facade, however, lies an occasion awash with irony. For anyone with a passing interest in the strange economics and murky past politics of English club rugby this is not any old game.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/17/championship-wild-west-professional-rugby-union-dangers\">\u2018The RFU Championship has become the wild west of professional rugby\u2019 | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It must be significant because Nigel Melville, the Rugby Football Union\u2019s director of professional rugby, will be among those present. On one level there is the whole acrimonious story of Richmond\u2019s ejection from the leagues in 1999 when they were subsumed, against their wishes, into a holding company bearing Irish\u2019s name. The grand old club have spent 16 years trying to recapture their lost status; small wonder their chairman, Peter Moore, frequently uses the word \u201cresurrection\u201d.</p> <p>Yet beneath Richmond\u2019s understandable pride \u2013 as well as the still-simmering resentment at their abandonment by some supposed Premiership friends \u2013 there is another layer of intrigue. Richmond may be back but not as a professional outfit. Having won promotion they have opted to stay a strictly part-time squad, combining their rugby with jobs in the City and elsewhere and training together for only a handful of hours each week. For better or for worse, it feels like the 1980s reincarnated.</p> <p>That would be fine \u2013 and prudent given Richmond attract 2,500 paying souls for their most attractive matches \u2013 if they were playing against clubs doing the same thing. But London Irish, relegated from the Premiership last season, are a fully professional operation with an All Black, Ben Franks, in their starting front row. Richmond have an old Etonian prop named Timmy Walford. Even setting aside the potential safety concerns, it raises an urgent question: what exactly is the Championship\u2019s raison d\u2019etre?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/17/championship-wild-west-professional-rugby-union-dangers\" title=\"\">As highlighted last season in the Guardian</a> there are all sorts of issues for players operating beneath the Premiership: poor salaries, insufficient medical insurance, no union assistance in negotiating fairer contracts. Several clubs are creaking, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/05/london-welsh-avoid-winding-up-order-high-court-pay-debts\" title=\"\">London Welsh\u2019s high court appearance</a> this week the latest example of financial instability. \u201cIt\u2019s not just London Welsh, four or five are on the edge,\u201d Moore says. \u201cI can\u2019t see how this model can continue. To have 24 professional clubs in England, to my mind, is not a financially viable option.\u201d</p> <p>Something has to give. While the Premiership salary cap has risen \u2013 the base level is \u00a36.5m per club with an allowance for two extra \u201cmarquee\u201d players on top \u2013 Championship clubs receive \u00a3530,000 in central funding per annum. A fully-professional squad of 35 pro players at a basic \u00a330,000 apiece \u2013 not enough to buy an open-air potting shed in Richmond \u2013 costs double that. \u201cIt was quite clear to me when I researched the other clubs that the Championship is not a business opportunity,\u201d Moore says, dryly. \u201cI think the RFU has got to redefine what the purpose of the league is.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23bf5608a74e705bfc1477a6ad6b46d4f65ec661\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23bf5608a74e705bfc1477a6ad6b46d4f65ec661/0_138_4250_2551/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Franks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">London Irish\u2019s Ben Franks featured for the All Blacks in last year\u2019s World Cup final but is set to face Richmond\u2019s team of amateurs on Saturday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The good news is Melville is grasping that nettle. Quite why it has taken previous RFU regimes so long to do so is the subject of numerous conspiracy theories: surely it should have been obvious aspiring English players, coaches and referees need a healthy environment in which to develop. Happily, the former England scrum-half and captain, who cut his own teeth in Otley, is alive to the ridiculous fact more Premiership academy players are dual-registered further down the pyramid than with second-tier clubs.</p> <p>\u201cThe Championship is critical to us for the development of young players,\u201d he said this week. \u201cWe need to get these kids into these games and I think we can create a really attractive product.\u201d</p> <p>To that end, Melville has been touring the country discussing options with clubs and sponsors. He accepts \u201csomething\u2019s broken and we have to fix it\u201d and met Sir Ian McGeechan, among others, in Nottingham on Thursday for further talks. Simply throwing money at the problem, he says, is not the answer. \u201cLet\u2019s not fool ourselves that by pumping a ton of money into a level-five club that it\u2019s somehow good for the game. It\u2019s probably not. We have to determine levels of professional rugby and make sure we police those to help people create sustainable rugby. It can\u2019t just be money going out of the game to a washed-up pro from the Premiership.\u201d</p> <p>The Richmond way is one possible avenue but is still problematic. What about clubs outside London where there are fewer well-paid banking jobs? If the whole league goes semi-pro will the gap with the Premiership become too cavernous? Might it lead to a closed shop with no promotion or relegation? What about the head-spinning logistics? Richmond\u2019s Canada international lock Tyler Hotson arrives at his desk at Goldman Sachs at 6.45am. Try doing that on a Monday morning in December having played away in Penzance the previous day. \u201cI\u2019m a lot busier than I used to be,\u201d says Hotson, who has had stints at Doncaster, Plymouth Albion and London Scottish. \u201cWe try to train in a short and sharp way simply because we have to.\u201d</p> <p>Hopefully there will be a happier ending than last time, when the club\u2019s backer Ashley Levett abruptly pulled the plug and Richmond, who finished fifth in their first Premiership season, were treated badly after going into administration. The board of English First Division Rugby had spotted a convenient opportunity to reduce the Premiership from 14 clubs to 12, prompting Richmond\u2019s then-coach John Kingston to accuse those in charge of \u201ccannibalism\u201d.</p> <p>Moore concedes the episode \u201cdoes still rankle\u201d but also has clear memories of the Levett era when Richmond briefly masqueraded as the world\u2019s most ambitious club. \u201cThere was no normality. We went from one employee to about 70 in three months. There was no business plan, there wasn\u2019t time. My background was financial and when I came in I said: \u2018I don\u2019t understand how this can possibly work.\u2019 It still doesn\u2019t work 20 years later.\u201d</p> <p>Good luck, regardless, to the gallant optimists of Richmond as they seek to improve on their opening 16-41 defeat to Jersey and remain a thriving local club for all. \u201cThe most important thing for us is to come out of this season solvent,\u201d Moore says. Even if there is the occasional mismatch, he promises the team will relish the opportunity and raise a communal glass in the bar afterwards. \u201cRugby is to be enjoyed, not endured. Once the players do their warm-downs and get past 7pm we\u2019re back to normal traditional rugby. Otherwise there\u2019s no point in playing.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>North Korea\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/09/north-korea-nuclear-test-earthquake\">latest nuclear test</a>, once again, seems to have taken everyone by surprise. </p> <p>Coming only nine months after its last nuclear detonation and following ever-advancing ballistic missile tests, including a successful submarine launch just two weeks ago, Kim Jong-un\u2019s latest wake-up call to world leaders will be hard to ignore.</p> <p>But why now? And, for a leadership recently experiencing a flurry of high-profile defections, what does the latest test mean about stability in Pyongyang?</p> <h2>1. Why now?</h2> <p><strong>Duyeon Kim, visiting senior fellow, Korean Peninsula Future Forum</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dc50b3c9b85fc40b0401d9bd573178386aa4990d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc50b3c9b85fc40b0401d9bd573178386aa4990d/0_0_2006_3000/669.jpg\" alt=\"Duyeon Kim.\" width=\"669\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This apparent nuclear test is not surprising, because we have been \u2013 and should continue to expect \u2013 North Korea to continue testing its nuclear devices and missiles. </p> <p>Pyongyang has every technological, political and strategic reason to continue testing, and continued launches will only help perfect its technology.</p> <p>Today\u2019s timing is also politically advantageous, because it coincides with the anniversary of the regime, Founding Day, and a series of international summits in the region. </p> <p>I\u2019d be curious to learn if this was one or two simultaneous tests. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/11/newsid_3664000/3664259.stm\">India tested two nuclear devices</a> together before calling it quits, and I have wondered if or when North Korea would think about following suit.</p> <p><strong>Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"129f82e0bdcd81f5a507b29c5fbcebb51a37fb76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/129f82e0bdcd81f5a507b29c5fbcebb51a37fb76/0_0_500_700/357.jpg\" alt=\"Bruce Klingner\" width=\"357\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Korea watchers endlessly debate the timing and motivation of North Korean actions, looking for a linkage to anniversaries, potential regime instability, or a supposed response to US or South Korean movements. </p> <p>Such debate is the lifeblood of analysts but is ultimately worthless.</p> <p>Instead, the focus should be on the North Korean actions \u2013 which are provocations, violations of UN resolutions or laws, or deadly attacks \u2013 rather than the array of possible regime motivations. </p> <p>Perhaps the latest nuclear test was indeed timed to celebrate North Korean Founding Day, a major national holiday, but more important than the timing is that the test is another blatant defiance of UN resolutions and the international community must respond.</p> <h2>2. What does this signify about the regime?<br></h2> <p><strong>Bruce Bennet, RAND</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f15a77f1dc5721c81653673b146092f48ab8ba5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f15a77f1dc5721c81653673b146092f48ab8ba5b/0_0_420_420/420.jpg\" alt=\"Bruce Bennet\" width=\"420\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>During Kim\u2019s four-year reign, Pyongyang has conducted 37 missile tests, more than twice as many as his father Kim Jong-il did during 17 years in office.</p> <p>The nuclear test is not reflective of regime stability or instability, but is rather the manifestation of Pyongyang\u2019s decades long quest to develop, augment, and refine its nuclear arsenal and the means to deliver them via missiles against the US and its allies.</p> <p>This year North Korea has engaged in a rapid-fire series of tests. In addition to the two nuclear tests, Kim has successfully launched an intercontinental ballistic missile, a road-mobile intermediate-range missile, a submarine-launched ballistic missile, upgraded medium- and short-range missiles, re-entry vehicle technology, a new solid-fuel rocket engine, and an improved liquid-fuel ICBM engine.</p> <p><strong>Cha Du-Hyeogn, Korean Institute of Reunification</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"060bd3574fae22893c6a229e304d791d42163901\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/060bd3574fae22893c6a229e304d791d42163901/0_0_292_292/292.jpg\" alt=\"cha-du-hyeogn\" width=\"292\" height=\"292\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This North Korean test is a cynical message to the Seoul government, which has been claiming that the North is undergoing an internal breakdown.</p> <p>We do not have the confirmed data on its magnitude yet, but if the result is significantly better \u2013 for example, twice as stronger than before \u2013 then its message [of strength] will carry far more weight.</p> <p><strong>Eom Sang-Yoon, The Sejong Institute</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ea45df2d3b65c885131818fe32ff214a30cf1251\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea45df2d3b65c885131818fe32ff214a30cf1251/0_0_120_150/120.jpg\" alt=\"Eom Sang-yoon\" width=\"120\" height=\"150\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eom Sang-yoon</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NK News</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The test can consolidate internal unity. However, the impact on regime stability would have been greatest after their first test. This is the fifth test (so it will have a smaller ripple effect), but Kim Jong-un doesn\u2019t have any other option available to him to consolidate his power.</p> <p>In reality, the best way to stabilise the regime is by developing economy and making people live well. However, Kim has limited options, and boasts his leadership through military armaments.</p> <h2>3.

They are certainly aware that there is an election coming up.</p> <p>On the one hand, they are getting a fifth test over with before the new president takes office, while they are also putting a kind of exclamation point on the end of the eight years of the Obama policy of \u201cstrategic patience\u201d. </p> <p>This is the North Korean way of saying \u201cSee look, here\u2019s what you\u2019ve reaped.\u201d</p> <p>For South Korea, what we\u2019ve seen this year is South Korea reverting to a traditional, conservative approach and just really not talking to the North Koreans. So what does the fifth test do? I think it will just prompt Seoul to apply more pressure internationally, so I don\u2019t think this was any type of game changer.</p> <h2><strong>4. Will this be enough to get China back on onboard with sanctions?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Duyeon Kim, KPFF</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dc50b3c9b85fc40b0401d9bd573178386aa4990d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc50b3c9b85fc40b0401d9bd573178386aa4990d/0_0_2006_3000/669.jpg\" alt=\"Duyeon Kim\" width=\"669\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The latest apparent nuclear test places a burden on China, but Beijing is unlikely to crack down on Pyongyang the way the international community desires, because of its own strategic interests and because it believes in positive inducements like dialogue and a peace treaty to change North Korean behaviour.</p> <p>But Beijing might consider rethinking its current position if Washington\u2019s response creates a negative security environment for China.</p> <p><strong>Bruce Bennet, RAND</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f15a77f1dc5721c81653673b146092f48ab8ba5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f15a77f1dc5721c81653673b146092f48ab8ba5b/0_0_420_420/420.jpg\" alt=\"bruce-bennett-rand\" width=\"420\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>China has recently been placing major pressure on South Korea to prevent the US deployment of the THAAD missile defence system in Korea \u2013 a system designed for protection against the growing North Korean nuclear and missile threat. </p> <p>As part of that pressure, China has apparently been lax in imposing the sanctions from UN Security Council Resolution 2270 (reportedly, trade between China and North Korea actually grew 9% in 2016 versus 2015).</p> <p>It is hard to tell whether China will decide to assume the role of a regional Great Power and seek to curtail the North\u2019s provocative behaviour \u2013 thus far, China has not decided to do so.</p> <p>It is ironic that China opposes the THAAD missile defence system being deployed in South Korea when China deploys a similar missile system referred as the <a href=\"http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/world/china/hq-19.htm\">HQ-19,</a> which it appears to deploy against the North Korean NoDong and Musudan missiles \u2013 the same threats that worry South Korea.</p> <p><em>A version of this article first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.nknews.org/2016/09/north-koreas-5th-nuke-test-why-now-and-what-next/\">NK News - North Korean news</a></em></p>",

Other funders, such as the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria then came in with support.</p> <p>Secondly, Sri Lanka had an enlightened public health system and academia. It did not just buy in millions of mosquito nets and drugs; it conceived a plan to solve its own particular problem. </p> <p>Sri Lanka\u2019s director general of health services said success came through teamwork and strong political commitment over many years. <br></p> <p>\u201cElimination of malaria from every nation is possible. That\u2019s the best lesson I guess: you have to work hard,\u201d Dr Palitha Mahipala said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jun/24/malaria-scheme-cuts-child-deaths-sahel-rainy-season-access-smc-project\">Malaria scheme cuts child deaths during Sahel's rainy season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More than 80% of Sri Lanka\u2019s 22 million people live in rural areas which provide ideal ecosystems for <em>Anopheles culicifacies </em>mosquitoes, which are one of the main vectors for malaria in the region. </p> <p>It was not possible to eliminate the mosquitoes from jungle areas, so the government focused instead on the parasite which causes the disease in humans, and is transmitted from person to person by the mosquito.</p> <p>The quick diagnosis of malaria in children meant they could be treated earlier, reducing the chances of mosquitoes sucking up the parasites in their blood and transmitting the disease to other people.</p> <p>Sri Lanka also sent mobile clinics into the worst-affected areas and spent time, money and effort on educating the public.<br></p> <p>Other countries have also been doing well. The millennium development goals, set by the United Nations in 2000, focused minds and attracted money. The number of new malaria cases worldwide fell by 37% between 2000 and 2015 while death rates dropped by 60% overall and by 65% among children under the age of five.</p> <p>The countries on the list of 21 that could eliminate malaria within the next four years, published by the WHO in April, are: China, Malaysia, South Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Belize, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Paraguay, Suriname, Bhutan, Nepal, Timor-Leste, Algeria, Botswana, Cape Verde, Comoros, South Africa and Swaziland. All have brought down malaria cases dramatically and share a political commitment to the endgame.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/malaria-zip/giv-226010wFSksbLbSlN\" data-alt=\"The worldwide fight against malaria - map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/malaria-zip/giv-226010wFSksbLbSlN\">The worldwide fight against malaria - map</a> </figure>  <p>Last year, the UN and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation devised a plan to eradicate malaria worldwide by 2040. It was not an outrageous suggestion; for the past 15 years, there have been ever more ambitious and hopeful strategies and statements from global organisations and leaders on the prospects of ending malaria.</p> <p>But there are stubborn spots. The countries where the problem is most difficult to tackle are still in sub-Saharan Africa, which is suffering most of the child deaths.</p> <p>\u201cThere should be no deaths in malaria if you have the right health system and identify patients early on,\u201d Alonso said.</p> <p>The Democratic Republic of the Congo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/apr/25/nigeria-urged-to-focus-on-malaria-as-other-countries-edge-towards-elimination\">and Nigeria</a> suffer more than 40% of all malaria deaths.

The world can\u2019t afford that approach.\u201d</p> <p>The reason why Sri Lanka\u2019s success is so symbolic is because we have been here before. In 1955, the UN committed to ending the scourge of malaria. It was optimistic because it thought there were effective tools. The pesticide DDT had been found to kill the mosquitoes that were spreading the disease in US army camps in the Pacific during the second world war. Widespread use of DDT and the drug chloroquine drove malaria out of many countries in the Americas, Europe and parts of Asia.<br></p> <p>But it all fell apart. There was no real attempt to tackle malaria in sub-Saharan Africa because it was thought to be too difficult. Elsewhere, elimination fell foul of the problem that has bedevilled all malaria control efforts: resistance of the malaria parasite to drugs and of the mosquitoes to pesticides. Then in 1962, Rachel Carson\u2019s blockbuster Silent Spring was published, alerting the world to the environmental devastation wreaked by DDT. The UN\u2019s malaria eradication plan was officially scrapped in 1969.</p> <p>Sri Lanka had been so close. Two million cases a year had dropped to just 17 in 1963. But when control efforts ended, the numbers surged back up and malaria was endemic once more. By 1998, there were more than 250,000 cases a year.</p> <p>\u201cIn the world of malaria, Sri Lanka carries a special weight,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cIt is often cited as the example of what happened during the first malaria eradication programme. They didn\u2019t complete the job and malaria came back with a vengeance. We need to learn from the past so we don\u2019t repeat the mistakes.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/feb/10/should-we-wipe-mosquitoes-off-the-face-of-the-earth\">Should we wipe mosquitoes off the face of the Earth?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Elimination means the end of malaria in a country or region. The aspirational talk is of eradication: \u201cmaking the parasite disappear from the face of the planet\u201d, Alonso said.</p> <p>Realistically, he said, the tools, knowledge or physical resources were not available to do that. But as one country after another succeeded in eliminating malaria, it was possible they would obtain all of those things and be on track to end the disease.</p> <p>Eradication has been achieved in only one disease so far: smallpox. The eradication of polio is so close and yet so far, with small numbers of cases in just a few countries but also a constant sliding back, as seen recently in Nigeria, which had been considered polio-free.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Dinitha Rathnayake</em><br></p>",
  "<p>Rows over what photographs Facebook will permit on its vast social network are nothing new: its no-nudity picture policy has caused controversy before due its less than subtle approach.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/09/facebook-deletes-norway-pms-post-napalm-girl-post-row\">Facebook deletes Norway PM's post as 'napalm girl' row escalates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Apart from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/08/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-napalm-girl-photo-vietnam-war\">deletion of the Pulitzer-prize winning photograph</a> of a napalm attack in southern Vietnam, images of breastfeeding are frequently removed. In 2008, the company banned and removed any such images that showed nipples, causing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/dec/30/facebook-breastfeeding-ban\">backlash and protests from tens of thousands of mothers</a>.</p> <p>The company\u2019s image censorship guidelines <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/feb/21/facebook-nudity-violence-censorship-guidelines\">were leaked to the press in 2012</a>. They specifically called for reviewers to remove images of breastfeeding if the nipples were exposed but to allow \u201cgraphic images\u201d of animals if shown in the \u201ccontext of food processing or hunting as it occurs in nature\u201d, resulting in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/22/facebook-no-nipples-rule-breastfeeding\">further outcries</a>. The company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/16/facebook-policy-nudity-hate-speech-standards\">clarified its guidelines</a> on nudity in 2015, but has not changed its policy.</p> <p>Facebook says its policies are aimed at stopping pornography and abuse. The latter is a serious problem on some social media \u2013 in the UK earlier this week the director of public prosecutions, Alison Saunders, said prosecutions relating to stalking and harassment were at record levels in England and Wales because so much was being conducted online.</p> <p>Facebook says it uses both automated systems and human reviewers before taking action. Users of the social network are encouraged to actively report, via onsite tools, images they think could contravene Facebook\u2019s \u201ccommunity standards\u201d.</p> <p>An automated system collates those reports and flags images to human reviewers who determine if they breach the site\u2019s guidelines, which specifically outlaw nudity.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards\">Facebook says</a>: \u201cWe restrict the display of nudity because some audiences within our global community may be sensitive to this type of content \u2013 particularly because of their cultural background or age.</p> <p>\u201cWe remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing in on fully exposed buttocks. We also restrict some images of female breasts if they include the nipple, but we always allow photos of women actively engaged in breastfeeding or showing breasts with post-mastectomy scarring.\u201d</p> <p>Should content be found to contravene Facebook\u2019s rules, it is deleted and accounts can be banned or removed. The company says the biggest problem is that for reasons of fairness and speed \u201cit is essential that we have policies in place that our global teams can apply uniformly and easily when reviewing content\u201d. That means one global guideline for all, regardless of local sensibilities.</p> <p>Exceptions should obviously be made in some circumstances, but Facebook\u2019s problem is when and where those one-offs should be considered and how not to allow, in its eyes, undesirable content through.</p> <p>Zuckerberg continues to claim that Facebook is not a media company, just a technology company. But it is one with arguably more power than any other organisation on the planet for influencing the news agenda through promotion or censorship.</p>",

Others still found community and camaraderie in the public restaurants and snack bars that formed part of their working day. </p> <p>\u201cPeople were visibly working harder to stay fed \u2026 [But] even by working much harder, and even when wages started to rise, people could not feed their families well.</p> <p>\u201cMuch of what people did at the time of the price spikes was familiar crisis-coping behaviour: substituting less costly items, cutting out more expensive items and replacing them with filling foods, sacrificing safety, taste and familiarity for volume and price.\u201d</p> <p>The authors asked why so many people moved towards more processed, packaged and purchased foods, and concluded it was for a mix of practical and psychological reasons, including the accessibility and addictive nature of junk food, with its high sugar, salt and fat content.</p> <p>As people worked harder and longer, and migrated to towns, other regions or countries to find work, more turned to heavily marketed convenience food, particularly unhealthy processed items with high levels of fat, sugar and salt \u2013 a more \u201cwesternised\u201d diet.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"077156419743f9a8ae7fa17da9ba37b7e84be012\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/077156419743f9a8ae7fa17da9ba37b7e84be012/0_278_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A temporary food stall is seen in a street in Old Dhaka, Bangladesh\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A temporary food stall is seen in a street in Old Dhaka, Bangladesh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: K M Asad/LightRocket via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The researchers, who followed individuals and families for four years, observed rapid changes in eating habits and \u2013 together with increased urbanisation \u2013 a transition to more hazardous, undignified and insecure jobs as people toiled to put food on the table.</p> <p>International prices reduced in 2012, but the impacts of the cultural shift triggered by the price rises are still being observed, explained the authors. </p> <p>\u201cOur research found that in addition to cutting down on pricey items, replacing nutritionally rich food with filling staples and borrowing cash to buy food, people in all research sites are turning to unhealthy fast food,\u201d said lead researcher and IDS research fellow Naomi Hossain.</p> <p>\u201cGovernments in developing countries need to pay urgent attention to these changes, and implement appropriate food safety and advertising standards regulation, in order to guard against a global epidemic of unbalanced nutrition and obesity.\u201d</p> <p>Oxfam<strong> </strong>programme researcher John Magrath said: \u201cThis shows that the food price crisis has pushed many people \u2013 especially women \u2013 further into hard, insecure work, with uncertain hours and poor, unreliable wages.

  "<p>JD Wetherspoon\u2019s Eurosceptic chairman has attacked the political and economic establishment for doom-laden predictions about the impact of leaving the EU that he said have turned out to be false.</p> <p>Tim Martin took aim at David Cameron, FTSE 100 chief executives, the governor of the Bank of England, City economists and Goldman Sachs in a tirade accompanying the pub chain\u2019s annual results. He also disparaged the CBI, the International Monetary Fund and the OECD.</p> <p>\u201cThe overwhelming majority of FTSE 100 companies, the employers\u2019 organisation CBI, the IMF, the OECD, the Treasury, the leaders of all the main political parties and almost all representatives of British universities forecast trouble, often in lurid terms, for the economy in the event of the leave vote,\u201d Martin said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I call \u2018scare story one\u2019 was that the act of voting leave would cause an immediate and profound downturn in the economy, and that\u2019s been proved to be entirely false.\u201d</p> <p>He said Wetherspoon\u2019s trading had improved since the end of its financial year and suggested that this was caused by sporting success, better weather and the referendum result. Pre-tax profit, excluding one-off items, for the year to 24 July rose by 3.6% to \u00a380.6m, on sales that increased by 5.4%. <br></p> <p>Martin criticised Cameron and the former chancellor George Osborne for predicting that families would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/18/eu-referendum-reality-check-uk-households-worse-off-brexit\">eventually be \u00a34,300 worse off</a>, mortgage rates would rise and house prices would fall after a vote for Brexit. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, supported these claims \u201cin terms\u201d, he said. </p> <p>Martin, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/26/staying-in-eu-bad-for-small-businesses-says-wetherspoon-chief\">longstanding critic of the EU</a>, attacked Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, for saying it was a given that economists were correct <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/25/ifs-brexit-extend-austerity-budget-deficit-eu-referendum\">in predicting malign consequences</a> from a vote to leave.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis is a strange argument to advance, since consensus forecasts from economists, who generally failed to forecast the last recession or the catastrophic flaws of the euro, are almost always delusional,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Economic surveys since the referendum on 23 June have been mixed. A report showing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/uk-factories-bounce-back-brexit-shock-eu-referendum-manufacturing-sector\">recovery in the services industry</a> during August followed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/uk-factories-bounce-back-brexit-shock-eu-referendum-manufacturing-sector\">a </a>rebound for manufacturing and high street spending. But economists have said the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/07/slowing-gdp-growth-bolsters-fears-of-uk-recession\">could still slip into recession</a> and have warned that higher prices and slowing investment will eventually take their toll.</p> <p>Martin said: \u201cThey [the experts] didn\u2019t say \u2018in the long run\u2019. The Treasury said interest rates would immediately go up and that it would cause so much uncertainty that unemployment would go up, and there would be an immediate and severe shock. There is only one thing that is definitely true and that is democracy is better for your economy.\u201d</p> <p>Rival pub operator and brewer Greene King was warier about the economy than Martin. In a trading update, the company said consumer confidence and leisure spending were threatened by the referendum result \u201cand we are alert to a potentially tougher trading environment ahead\u201d.</p> <p>Having been proved wrong about the damaging effects of a Brexit vote, Martin said, the establishment was raising unnecessary fears about whether Britain could do a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/uk-could-clinch-trade-deal-with-eu-within-two-years-says-expert\">trade deal with the EU</a> and that trade would continue with or without a formal agreement.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018Scare story two\u2019 is that if we don\u2019t join the single market, we are in deep trouble, and that is across mainstream economists. That is also in my view absolute twaddle,\u201d he said.</p>",

  "<p>Dozens of tourists have been rescued after being trapped overnight in small cable cars dangling above the slopes of Mont Blanc in the Alps.</p> <p>Their return to land ended an extraordinarily complex and vertiginous rescue effort over two days amid the spectacular but dangerous landscape of western Europe\u2019s tallest mountains. </p> <p>The last passengers were brought down on Friday morning after emergency workers managed to untangle cables that had jammed on Thursday, according to the mayor of the French town of Chamonix. </p> <p>The ordeal began on Thursday afternoon when cables on the Panoramic Mont Blanc cable car service got twisted, trapping 110 people in a string of cars at altitudes of up to 3,800 metres (12,500ft). </p> <p>French and Italian helicopters flew in rescuers who used cables to drop down on to the tops of the cars and lifted out passengers one by one. One of those rescued told the local radio station France Bleu Pays de Savoie that he had \u201cclosed his eyes for a few moments to avoid looking into the void\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThe extent of this rescue operation is simply unbelievable,\u201d Colonel Frederic Labrunye, commander of the provincial gendarmerie group of Haute-Savoie, told Associated Press. \u201cBy the volume of people to rescue \u2013 we rarely rescue 110 people at the same time in high mountain \u2013 and by the environment in which it happened \u2026 in the heart of one of the largest glaciers in Europe, over a distance of five kilometres of cable with 36 cabins.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"329eb85fafcec5dbe8c7f4ff104773f87fc63568\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/329eb85fafcec5dbe8c7f4ff104773f87fc63568/0_52_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A rescue helicopter near three of the stranded cable cars\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A rescue helicopter near three of the stranded cable cars.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luca Bruno/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Helicopters had to carefully fly over the cables, which is risky itself, then lower a rescuer on to an area \u201cnot larger than a table\u201d, and extract the passengers, he said, describing it as \u201cair surgery\u201d.</p> <p>As fog descended and darkness started to fall on Thursday evening, authorities called off the helicopter rescue and switched to plan B, Fournier said. </p> <p>Mountain guides identified the cable cars closest to the ground and used climbing ropes to carry passengers down one by one. The passengers were then escorted by foot to the nearest mountain station.</p> <p>Fournier said 65 people were rescued on Thursday and another 12 were brought down overnight. The remaining 33 people were in cable cars too high off the ground for plan B, so they had to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/08/110-people-stuck-on-cable-cars-in-the-french-alps\">stay there overnight</a>. Children aged seven and nine from South Korea and a 10-year-old from Italy were among those stranded.</p> <p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t get a lot of sleep, it was a strange experience, but they were warm under blankets and with their families,\u201d Fournier said. Five rescuers stayed overnight in the cable cars and provided blankets, food and water to help weather the chilly night-time conditions. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75e70b599e1cbda2d8b5a8fc0b6dbf85d406be64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75e70b599e1cbda2d8b5a8fc0b6dbf85d406be64/0_64_1971_1183/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People who spent a night in cable cars are escorted by rescuers before being brought to the ground in Courmayeur\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People who spent a night in cable cars are escorted by rescuers before being brought to the ground in Courmayeur.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Pierre Clatot/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kathy Cook, a tourist from Michigan who was carried down to the ground by a rescuer after almost 10 hours stranded, called it \u201creally quite an experience\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe helicopter rescue failed because the fog moved in, so we had to just wait and then they decided they could relay us safely to the ground, and we walked up the glacier to the hut,\u201d she said upon arrival in Courmayeur. </p> <p> Police said all the remaining passengers seemed in good health when they were rescued on Friday morning.</p> <p> \u201cWe were in contact with them throughout the night, the people were cold,\u201d but there did not appear to be any health emergencies, the local police chief, St\u00e9phane Bozon, told Agence-France Presse</p> <p>The prefect of the Haute-Savoie region, Georges Fran\u00e7ois Leclerc, said the rescuers had been forced to halt their operation at 8.45pm on Thursday as they could not \u201cguarantee the safety of the pilots, rescuers and the people stuck in the cars\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e885cd66006b03b1603de526e6bca765a28ee21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e885cd66006b03b1603de526e6bca765a28ee21/0_260_4767_2860/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Journalists surround a rescued tourist who was trapped overnight in a cable car\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Journalists surround a rescued tourist who was trapped overnight in a cable car.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luca Bruno/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> The cable car ride, which offers spectacular views of western Europe\u2019s tallest mountains and deep valleys below, connects the Aiguille du Midi peak in France, at 3,842 metres, to Pointe Helbronner in Italy, at 3,462 metres.

  "<p>One of my daughters put out the recycling while the eldest, a vegetarian, regaled me with her passionate cheerleading for the socialist utopia of Jeremy Corbyn. Another vegetarian daughter asked if it was OK to ask if someone who had gone crazy with a knife in New Zealand was a terrorist. It was suggested by her mother that merely asking the question was making unfair assumptions.</p> <p>Should we take refugees into our house? Should we buy coffee in Starbucks? Is it OK to have a bath rather than a shower? Was that T-shirt the product of child labour? It\u2019s a limitless morass.</p> <p>I miss my parents\u2019 limited, practical live-and-let-live philosophy. Our moral universe was very simple \u2013 don\u2019t do anything to anyone else that you wouldn\u2019t wish to be done to you. They, and my other relatives, were kind and decent people, who never spoke cruelly of others and did all they could to help when help was needed.</p> <p>As a working-class family, however, morals were confined entirely to domestic life, not global dilemmas. My parents had no views on Vietnam, or the Nixon presidency or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/08/biafranlessons\" title=\"\">Biafran tragedy</a> \u2013 one of those things that were sad but which you could do nothing about except give a couple of bob if you had it to spare. And in those more collectivist years, private charity was frowned upon, as it appeared to be letting the state off the hook of its collective responsibilities. Charity was a Victorian relic.</p> <p>It was all my family could do to survive, pay the bills and go on holiday for a couple of weeks a year. The rest of the world was someone else\u2019s problem \u2013 the powerful, those with a voice and enough social capital for the great middle-class hobby of virtue signalling and do-gooding (my parents intensely disliked \u201cdo-gooders\u201d).</p> <p>I have a lurking and possibly shameful suspicion that a lot of what passes for modern morality \u2013 buying eco washing powder, signing endless and usually pointless online petitions and doing charity marathons/mountain climbs/moustache cultivation \u2013 is a kind of exhibitionism that convinces ourselves, and our children, that we are good people, while actually achieving relatively little (and, not incidentally, letting the government off the hook).</p> <p>We hear about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/08/black-woman-in-berlin\" title=\"\">microaggressions</a> (unconscious, apparently innocent acts of aggression usually against minority groups) but these micro-moralities such as whether to go to Starbucks \u2013 the other side of the coin to microaggressions \u2013 seem to cause as much disharmony. I was ticked off by my children recently because I decided not to eat a restaurant meal because it was crap. This was that greatest of all crimes \u2013 wastefulness. You would think that instead of living in a time of relative prosperity, we were in 1950s austerity Britain, where my grandmother always kept tiny scraps of soap to press together into new blocks.</p> <p>I have mixed feelings about the application of this moral mission creep to (and from) our children. Not all apparently moral activity is virtue signalling by any means. Yet to tell them to hurt no one, to be kind and honest, seems to me moral injunction enough \u2013 at least until they are grown up enough to make their own judgments. Perhaps the rising level of depression and anxiety among children is not unconnected with the sense that they must work harder and harder to qualify as good people.</p> <p>Most of us are helpless to redress most evils. Perhaps we go through the theatre of morality to help us feel more powerful. Which is fine \u2013 so long as it doesn\u2019t produce neurotic children and, later, judgmental adults, all in the cause of moral ends that are rarely, and sometimes never, achieved.</p> <p>After a lifetime I have only come up with one ethical trope \u2013 be good, but don\u2019t try to be better than you are. It just leads to hypocrisy. Which is not an argument against virtue. It\u2019s a plea for honesty \u2013 and an injunction against the unstinting tiresomeness of middle-class guilt.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/timlottwriter\" title=\"\"><em>@timlottwriter</em></a></p>",

If you fly someone halfway round the world, take them to a very expensive restaurant or pay a string quartet to accompany you while you ask them to be with you forever, you\u2019re putting them in a position in which they might feel obliged to come up with a positive answer. Asking someone to marry you when they\u2019re sat next to you on the sofa means they have the mental and physical space to reflect on the question and give an honest response.</p> <p>Passion, drama and fireworks, literal and figurative, can make a relationship more exciting. Yet I believe true love comes when you\u2019re with the one person you adore doing nothing with. If you start with an elaborate, expensive proposal, you\u2019re setting the bar very high. Anyone can seem fun and thrilling if they\u2019re sending you endless roses and whisking you away in helicopters. It\u2019s much harder to find a person who can make you as happy just by sharing a takeaway with you. Every sofa has a history, and if yours can tell your love story, I think it might be the most romantic place possible to ask your partner to marry you.</p>",
  "<p>In a refugee camp near the Greek city of Thessaloniki, I treated a Kurdish woman in her early twenties for a throat infection. Before she left, the translator asked her if there was anything else we could help her with. She broke down in tears. She had four children who she was struggling to look after and keep clean. She showed us a photograph of her children, just one year ago, well dressed and smiling. This woman was not only tired and desperate, she was ashamed of her living conditions. The food was bad, toilets revolting and she could not properly look after her family.</p> <p>This refugee crisis is the worst in living memory. The UNHCR currently estimates that <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html\">there are 65.3 million people displaced from their homes by conflict and persecution globally</a>. Many are women and 41% are children.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Women were deliberately not drinking water so they could avoid a trip to the revolting portable toilets</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In times of crisis women bear the brunt. All refugees are marginalised, but the women are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and physical and sexual harm. Many are victims of unimaginable atrocities as they flee their home countries. Pregnant women and those with small children are uniquely vulnerable on the dangerous journey to Europe. Throughout these camps there are widespread reports of gender-based violence.</p> <p>In the camps women are under extraordinary pressure. Many have young families to provide for. Living in small tents they need to look after their children, feed their families, keep them clean and try to retain some normality with dignity.</p> <p>Women are hit hardest by poor access to sanitation and water. Washing clothes for large families in a refugee camp becomes an impossible task. Summertime Greece is hot, in the camp where I worked women felt they could not keep clean and were deliberately not drinking water so they could avoid a trip to the revolting portable toilets; just six for a camp housing 600. They were risking dehydration and kidney and urine infections. One woman cried as she described the shame she felt about having to urinate in a bucket inside a tent that she shared with her large family.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"19dace4a776585bf06bd54a6ba3e5eb2ecbbad18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19dace4a776585bf06bd54a6ba3e5eb2ecbbad18/0_623_2448_2371/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graffiti at the camp\" width=\"1000\" height=\"969\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Small acts of kindness do not solve the problems but they do give some comfort and dignity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah Mitchell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Asides from the issue of sanitation, the toilet area was poorly lit and women felt afraid and unsafe going there at night, with reports of intimidation and fights.</p> <p>In the rush to respond to the large numbers of refugees arriving, many of the camps have sprung up in previously abandoned warehouses. They were not designed for human habitation. However, provision of clean, well-lit sanitation facilities, which a large number of people can use is not a difficult task and something that could be easily addressed in the camps.</p> <p>Another recurring theme was that women did not want to be intimate with their partners. Many felt pressured into having sexual relations and there were newly pregnant women in the camps. Women have distinct health needs that can easily be overlooked in the response to acute medical needs. Provision of good maternity care and being pragmatic about access to family planning should be prioritised.</p> <p>Many of the women had previously assumed the role of carer in their family, and many were deeply upset by their inability to carry out that role in the camps. The UNHCR emphasises that women must be involved <a href=\"http://www.refworld.org/docid/479f3b2a2.html\">specifically with the management and distribution of resources</a>. There was little evidence of this on the ground in the camps. Unfamiliar and unpalatable food was given out. Many of the women complained that by the time it arrived it was hardly edible. </p> <h2>We need to empower women in the camps</h2> <p>Central to the humanitarian response should be empowering these women who have lost everything. Many of the women felt they weren\u2019t being listened to. Here simple, pragmatic things can make a huge difference; volunteers in one of the camps organised distribution of fresh fruit and vegetables, which were needed to cook traditional meals from back home. Another gave out cooking utensils. Many of the women were delighted by this. Another volunteer gave pillows to each of the tents. These small acts of kindness do not solve the problems but they do give some comfort and dignity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These women see no solution to their problems ... They wait with their children for their lives to start again</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, the painful reality is that these women see no solution to their problems within reach. They wait with their children for their lives to start again. They are terrified for their children\u2019s future as they have no access to formal education. One said that a prison sentence would be better than being in the camps, because at least then they would know when they would get to leave.</p> <p>The responses of local people in the towns hosting the refugees was mainly one of kindness and compassion. The volunteer response, though at times chaotic, shows some of the large amount of goodwill towards refugees in Europe. The response of some of the European countries to the refugees is shameful, especially the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/02/child-refugees-calais-failed-by-britain\">failure of the UK to provide a safe haven for the many unaccompanied child refugees</a>. </p> <p>The world has been slow in its response to the refugee crisis, but this is an issue that will affect us all for many generations. These women have faced the most appalling conditions with the utmost of resilience and dignity. As the refugee crisis slips down the news agenda and out of the public\u2019s mind, these families are going nowhere. If Lebanon, a country with a population of under 5 million can host 1.5 million refugees, then surely the rest of the world can play its part too. </p> <p><em>Translation by </em><em>Nada Sarsour, Amer Sawaf, Mohamad Abou Ras, Mariam Saleh and Mohamad Namo. </em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

  "<p>Twenty years, an entire European club football mini-era and one grand, toxic backstory in the making: this is the one we\u2019ve waited for. When Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Pep Guardiola walk out at Old Trafford on Saturday for the first Manchester derby of the season it seems fair to say the surrounding machinery of the Premier League, from clubs and fans to sponsors, broadcasters, hacks and hangers-on, will feel a sense of pieces falling into place, a plotline resolved.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 versus Pep is a match the Premier League has circled relentlessly, a thrillingly poisonous sibling rivalry entwined for the past eight seasons around Europe\u2019s grandest clubs. And now at last it\u2019s ours. A little past its ripest point, a little out of time as the age of the preening superstar manager begins to fade, but with its key personalities poised at a fascinating point in their careers.</p> <p>Never mind the match is likely to be a cautious affair, with any managerial interaction dialled back to suit the occasion. The re-gearing of the Pep-Jos\u00e9 franchise is a significant step in itself for a footballing culture that prizes above all the operetta of pure personality. Not to mention another staging point in the league\u2019s own aggressive expansionism, a supremacy measured out in advertising eyeballs, social media heft, global TV audiences, Taiwanese rolling news crews, US magazine covers and the sheer commercial event-glamour of a meeting of the current Big Football A-listers.</p> <p>At the heart of it all is that two-hander, the itch that refuses to be scratched. The story of Pep-Jos\u00e9, with its deeply personal animus, its shades of light and dark, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/23/pep-guardiola-jose-mourinho-manchester-city-united-rivalry\" title=\"\">has been told many times</a> but it remains a deliciously cinematic affair. The essence of any great TV sitcom is the main characters should appear convincingly stuck together, incapable of leaving one another\u2019s orbit. So it is with the world\u2019s two highest-paid football managers. It has been three years now since Mourinho and Guardiola shared a stretch of touchline. The sense of sibling claustrophobia has never left them.</p> <p>Even in his most significant moment of recent triumph in May 2015 Mourinho chose not to dwell on Chelsea\u2019s league title or the immediate space around him, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/03/jose-mourinho-chelsea-champions\" title=\"\">talking instead about the state of the Bundesliga</a>. \u201cI could choose another club in another country where to be champion is easier. Maybe I will go to a country where a kitman can be coach and win the title.\u201d Ah yes. Pep The Kitman. You get the feeling Jos\u00e9, stung by those \u201cTranslator\u201d jibes, really had thought about this one.</p> <p>It is a fraternal obsession forged in the extraordinarily fecund Barcelona coaching ranks of the mid-1990s, a footballing Camelot from which Mourinho would eventually be exiled, Guardiola enthroned in perpetuity. Mourinho first turned up at Barcelona as Bobby Robson\u2019s bagman in 1996. Guardiola was a senior player, a European champion, a Catalan. Even here it is easy to detect an evolving battle of favourite sons. Robson would later recall his first sight of Jos\u00e9 with a fond chuckle: \u201cThis young, good-looking ex-schoolteacher who spoke very good English and had a minor Portuguese coaching certificate.\u201d Bobby\u2019s first impressions of Pep, meanwhile, were stingingly chaste and respectful. \u201cI liked Pepe, as we called him. He knew the game and he knew how to conduct himself. He always had something to say in the dressing room at half-time. Pepe had class. He had bearing.\u201d</p> <p>Mourinho, a little less taken, preferred the company of Hristo Stoichkov. He stayed long enough to learn at the feet of Louis van Gaal, then built his own coaching legend elsewhere but Barcelona would still in its own way come to define him. Mourinho had assumed the Bar\u00e7a job was his for the taking in 2008. Guardiola, the insider, was hired instead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d190e4281ce04780e3d3bfed1662200f00a12ee6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d190e4281ce04780e3d3bfed1662200f00a12ee6/0_23_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pep Guardiola and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pep Guardiola, then of Barcelona, shakes hands with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, formerly of Real Madrid, before the 2011 Champions League semi-final first leg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergio Perez/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And so an easy dichotomy presents itself. On one hand Jos\u00e9 the dark angel, the bastard stepson, avenging Edmund to Pep\u2019s entitled Edgar. On the other cosseted Pep, the natural heir with every advantage from his own Catalan nationalism to a supreme playing career given ignition by Johan Cruyff himself, who famously appeared unannounced at a youth game and instructed Carles Rexach to move the skinny right midfielder to the more central, tactically vital <em>pivote</em> role, from where Guardiola has surveyed the world ever since.</p> <p>The contrasts between the two, personal and tactical, have perhaps been a little overplayed down the years, magnified by the epic tensions of Mourinho\u2019s time at Real Madrid. At times there has been a cartoonishness, a sense of an extreme, exaggerated position being taken. If Barcelona must always seek to mean something, to project a slightly cloying notion of beauty, a love affair with the ball itself, then Mourinho would be the opposite, a manager for whom the only meaning was in winning, the ball a bore.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/07/zlatan-ibrahimovic-pep-guardiola-manchester-united-city-barcelona\">Zlatan Ibrahimovic\u2019s contempt for Pep Guardiola burns brightly as derby looms | Daniel Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is tempting to conclude the most satisfying moment of his career to date, Peak Jos\u00e9, is still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/apr/28/barcelona-internazionale-champions-league\" title=\"\">that brutally pared-back 1-0 defeat with Inter</a> at the Camp Nou in 2010 with 10 men and just 19% possession, enough on the night to knock Pep\u2019s Barcelona out of the Champions League. Even in his second spell at Chelsea Mourinho will perhaps be remembered best for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/27/liverpool-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the gleefully smothering 2-0 win at Anfield</a> that derailed Liverpool\u2019s title challenge, an act of tactical spite from which Brendan Rodgers never really seemed to recover.</p> <p>In professional middle age it is instead the similarities between these managerial siblings that become more interesting. Both are above all exhausting, obsessive personalities. For all his beatific visions of fluid and inventive football there is a little darkness in Guardiola too. As early as last summer at least one regular inside the Bayern boardroom was talking about the club\u2019s eagerness to appoint a more easy-going, less draining replacement. This is the nature of relentless high-end football management. The lines of style and tone and texture blur. What remains is simply a desperation to win.</p> <p>So too with tactics and ways of playing. Like Guardiola, Mourinho knows the value of possession and \u201cresting on the ball\u201d. In England he was an innovator, the man who finally killed 4-4-2, who won the league title with a high-speed three-man forward line, and whose best teams have been defined by creative, goalscoring midfielders from Deco to Frank Lampard, Wesley Sneijder, Mesut \u00d6zil, Eden Hazard and Cesc F\u00e0bregas. Similarly some of Guardiola\u2019s most inventive work has come with his defence, from Carles Puyol and Gerard Piqu\u00e9 to J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng, given licence at times to pump long lofted passes forward from the back, another note of evolution beyond the pure possession fetish of his early years.</p> <p>There is another note of sympathy. For all the fanfare both men come to Manchester having edged out now beyond the usual 10-year sustained success cycle that has defined so many of the great managers from Shankly to Clough to Sacchi. Both carry with them a pleasantly antsy need to push on and rebuild and maintain.</p> <p>Guardiola\u2019s Bayern played some sublime football but the fact remains his last really tangible triumph came five years ago. Mourinho has two league titles in the same period but in his last year at Chelsea he seemed to be entering his supernova phase, still giving out heat but oddly toxic and doomed. There is a line of thought he got the United job only because of the Pep-Jos\u00e9 narrative, the arrival of Guardiola across town forcing United\u2019s hand, compounding Mourinho\u2019s value like the slightly less famous partner in a celebrity marriage of convenience.</p> <p>Beyond this even the basic idea of the grand, maestro-like uber-manager can look a little overblown, a little pomp-rock. Doing more with less is the thing now: Seville-era Unai Emery or the stripped-down, punkish brilliance of Diego Simeone. Meanwhile the Premier League has just booked Led Zeppelin and the Eagles. The sense of a plateauing out, of an overripeness to both men\u2019s legends lurks just beyond all this. Certainly it is hard to envisage a situation where both get to emerge from this victorious.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/08/jose-mourinho-faith-wayne-rooney-manchester-united-city\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s faith in Wayne Rooney faces biggest test in Manchester derby | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not that too much should be read in to Saturday\u2019s game beyond the basic spectacle. These are a pair of brittle, evolving teams. There is a waiting game around City\u2019s midfield, with Ilkay G\u00fcndogan only just gaining fitness. How Guardiola deploys his cast of slightly underwhelming full-backs, a key Pep role, will also be fascinating. The most interesting note to date has been his revitalising effect on some of the attackers at his disposal, with the banned Sergio Ag\u00fcero already in mid-season bloom, and Raheem Sterling showing the benefits of the kind of tight, detailed, no quarter coaching that seems to bring the best out of him.</p> <p>For Mourinho there are loose joins and new combinations all over the pitch, plus the apparently compulsory question of what exactly to do with Wayne Rooney. Not to mention the key issue of what Mourinho\u2019s own persona will be at United. Perhaps in time he may even be able to claim a slightly absurd kind of underdog status given United\u2019s absence from the Champions League, a position that has always best suited his team-building qualities.</p> <p>For now, as football\u2019s grandest theatrical duel cranks up its engines once again it is time simply to sit back, enjoy the big fat schmaltzy notes, the fine-point detail, and above all the enduring syzygy of football\u2019s most toxic managerial siblings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/09/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> </aside>",

Song launched Frank + Oak alongside high school friend Hicham Ratnani, who graduated with an engineering degree from Montr\u00e9al\u2019s McGill University. Song was born in China, but moved to Montr\u00e9al at the age of six.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/discover-cool-canada/2016/sep/09/magnifique-montreal-at-a-glance\">Magnifique Montr\u00e9al at a glance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although it now ships to more than 40 countries, Song stresses that local identity is the key to Frank + Oak\u2019s success. In 2013, the brand opened its first physical store in the hipster Mile End area of Montr\u00e9al \u2013 but this wasn\u2019t a shop in the traditional sense. \u201cIn the age of the internet, when anyone can buy anything, the purpose of a store has changed,\u201d says Song.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe Frank + Oak coffee shop opened as a place for our community to assemble. It\u2019s designed to reflect the unique experience of its location. Having floor space to sell products isn\u2019t the main objective, and we employed an engagement person to get involved in the community and make contact with local heroes to feature in our magazine,\u201d he says. \u201cIt helps to create a deeper link between customers and the brand.\u201d<br></p> <p>Song says he wanted Frank + Oak to bring people together around spaces and interests, rather than trends, creating culture and community, and this vision pervades all levels of the company: pop into Frank + Oak\u2019s workshop at its Mile End headquarters and you\u2019ll find a stylish bike mounted on a wall. \u201cIt\u2019s from a collaboration we did with local Montr\u00e9al company V\u00e9lo iBike,\u201d co-founder Ratnani told youinc. \u201cIt sits on the wall in the studio, and represents the modern man: simple, sophisticated, and always on the move.\u201d<br></p> <p>After Montr\u00e9al, Frank + Oak opened a store in Toronto. \u201cWe now have 13 Frank + Oak stores across North America, all with the same local ethos as our original Mile End coffee shop,\u201d says Song.<br></p> <p>In addition to the shop, plans are afoot to move into beauty and launch women\u2019s products. Song\u2019s ambition may be to \u201cgo more global\u201d, but he still draws inspiration from the creative, up-and-coming neighbourhood the company calls home: \u201cThere has been a real transformation in Mile End.

  "<p>Montr\u00e9al four-piece <a href=\"http://cstrecords.com/ought/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ought</a> have been variously raved about as \u201cpost-punk\u201d, \u201cart rock\u201d, \u201cdexterous\u201d and \u201celectrifying\u201d. The band also play their part in a thriving and adventurous scene that has earned this Canadian city global recognition as an independent music hotbed. They\u2019re proudly signed to Montr\u00e9al indie label <a href=\"http://cstrecords.com/artists/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Constellation Records</a> (home to diverse acts from Godspeed You! Black Emperor to chamber music outfit Esmerine), and they\u2019re currently writing the follow-up to their acclaimed second album Sun Coming Down (2015).</p> <p>\u201cMontr\u00e9al is definitely a party city,\u201d says genial vocalist/guitarist Tim Darcy, who formed Ought with Ben Stidworthy (bass), Matt May (keyboards) and Tim Keen (drums/violin) when they were attending Montr\u00e9al\u2019s McGill University (whose other musical alumni include electronic starlet Grimes), and sharing an apartment and rehearsal space.</p> <p>He adds that Montr\u00e9al provided a nurturing base for the fledgling band: \u201cWe had a really nice environment at the beginning. I think a big part of it was having the opportunity to play a lot of shows with other bands, and really hone what we were doing. Also, having a supportive framework of people coming to our shows, with friends making art and running spaces. And being able to play in our apartment; we wouldn\u2019t have had the money at that time to rent a rehearsal space. Being able to find these affordable creative spaces is definitely a facet of Montr\u00e9al.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/discover-cool-canada/gallery/2016/sep/09/all-thats-great-about-quebec-in-pictures\">All that's great about Qu\u00e9bec \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ought\u2019s touring schedule now takes them around the world, but the band remain attached to the city that shaped them: \u201cMontr\u00e9al is still definitely where we call home, as three Americans and an Australian,\u201d says May, who grew up in New Jersey before moving to Canada. \u201cEvery time we come back from being away, it\u2019s a very comforting and warm feeling, and something about that definitely resonates.</p> <p>\u201cBy the time I was graduating, we\u2019d been working on this band for about two years, and I didn\u2019t have any desire to leave; it felt like there was a really big and productive scene, and really good energy. People here are still excited about creating and experiencing a really wide variety of music, and there are bands just starting up, alongside artists who\u2019ve been going for maybe 25 years.\u201d</p> <p>So, what three words sum up Montr\u00e9al for Ought?

It\u2019s an interesting neighbourhood socially and creatively, and this is a sweet place where you can go and contemplate.\u201d</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://monastiraki.blogspot.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Monastiraki</a> <br></strong>Stidworthy: \u201cDown the street from Lhasa De Sela park, this is a really cool arts space. It\u2019s in a predominantly Greek area, and it takes its name from a flea market in Athens. There was an antiques and knickknacks shop on this site for 30 years; now it\u2019s run by the son of the original owners, and he curates it more as a community arts space. It\u2019s a very cool place to drop into, and it\u2019s designed with a very quirky sense of humour.\u201d</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://casadelpopolo.com/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Casa del popolo</a><br></strong>May: \u201cThis is a really great venue, co-founded by Mauro Pezzente from Godspeed; it\u2019s very centrally located, and attached to a nice bar, and as far as I know, it\u2019s one of the only rooms around here that\u2019s free to book. At the same time, it maintains a very high level of quality, with a diverse range of music. Probably every Montr\u00e9al band from the last 15 years, including us, has played a show here.

A <em>d\u00e9panneur</em> is a corner store, and someone put a lunch counter in this one. It looks like a normal convenience store, but it has hidden seating all around, and it sells really amazing sandwiches.

  "<p>Hackers are stepping up their cyber-attacks on American democratic institutions. The Open Society Foundations, the global philanthropy I lead, is among many to have been targeted. DC Leaks has posted over 2,500 documents reflecting our grant-making strategies over the last decade, prompting a flurry of press reports from far-right news sites in the US and around the world.<br></p> <p>Earlier this summer, a shadowy organization called DC Leaks, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-11/russian-hackers-of-dnc-said-to-scoop-up-secrets-from-nato-soros\">believed by authorities to be a front for Russian operatives</a>, posted internal communications from the Democratic National Committee. The group also targeted a retired Nato commander, <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/08/12/russian-hacking-campaign-hits-republicans-too/\">Republican state officials</a> and staffers for several US senators. In recent days, there have been reports of attempted hacks of the New York Times and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/fbi-says-foreign-hackers-penetrated-000000175.html\">evidence of a breach of election databases in two states</a> \u2013 prompting the homeland security secretary, Jeh Johnson, to urge state elections officials to shore up security of their voting systems, in anticipation of possible attempts to interfere with US elections in November.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure all of us targeted by DC Leaks feel angry about the intrusion and worried about the damage it may do. Steal enough documents, and you\u2019re bound to find some unguarded speculation and harsh judgments. But most of what DC Leaks is publishing, at least about the Open Society Foundations and our grantees, is work we\u2019re proud to be doing. Indeed, all the targets of the hacks this summer \u2013 Democrats, Republicans, generals, newspapers and election officials \u2013 are champions of democracy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/07/cyberstalking-online-stalking-email-threats-laurie-gough\">What it's like to be cyberstalked: when you can't escape the untraceable threat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These cyber-attacks can be truly damaging, as US General Philip Breedlove, the retired Nato commander, learned when his personal emails were published, including one in which he complained about White House officials. Most famously, the DNC chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, lost her job because the leaks revealed staffers apparently tilting the party machinery against Bernie Sanders. But most of what DC Leaks has publicized is neither sinister nor shameful. The supposed controversies are elevated by being \u201cexposed\u201d through stolen messages and documents, even if what is revealed was already widely known. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Consider the \u201crevelations\u201d with which we at the Open Society Foundations have had to contend since DC Leaks stole documents from an online community of ours. One headline reads: \u201cSoros Paid Al Gore MILLIONS to Push \u2018Aggressive US Action\u2019 On Global Warming.\u201d Indeed, for over a decade the Open Society Foundations have supported several efforts to spur aggressive action on climate change. We were also accused of opportunistically seeking to improve police accountability in Baltimore\u2013 <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-findings-investigation-baltimore-police-department\">an idea endorsed by the Department of Justice</a>. </p> <p>Other headlines decry our work internationally: our support for the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel and fixing the broken European migration system. All true, as is our support for the reform government of the new Ukraine, and our opposition to Islamophobia in both Europe and the United States. This and much more have been \u201crevealed\u201d by DC Leaks, information aptly described in <a href=\"http://www.bostonherald.com/opinion/editorials/2016/08/editorial_cyber_insecurity\">a Sunday editorial by the Boston Herald</a> as: \u201cthe category of just because it\u2019s hacked doesn\u2019t make it news\u201d.</p> <p>Don\u2019t get me wrong: being hacked is a terrible invasion and it does real harm. We are scrambling to protect the lives of grantees working in dangerous places. We also need to repair relationships where our candid views made public may have caused offense. We will work around the clock to safeguard every grantee and heal every breach. But we also know why we\u2019ve been attacked: because \u2013 like the others in the hackers\u2019 sights \u2013 we believe in human rights, democracy and open societies, and we\u2019re willing to act on our principles. </p> <p>Today\u2019s political hackers remind me of the Watergate burglars, only now they\u2019re breaking into servers instead of offices. Now, as then, the political bosses behind these break-ins hope to use the stolen material to embarrass or discredit their enemies. But the lesson of Watergate is that this tactic can easily boomerang, bolstering the democratic credentials of those attacked, and bringing the real discredit back on the dirty tricksters. </p> <p>Think of the organizations whose work has been stolen by DC Leaks as a new \u201cEnemies List\u201d \u2013 reminiscent of the roster President Nixon maintained of 20 journalists, lawyers, politicians and other public figures whom he reviled. It was certainly dangerous to be among the president\u2019s 20 enemies, but as Nixon\u2019s power waned, being on the list became a badge of honor. </p> <p>At least a couple of those included later described it as among their greatest achievements. Yes, you had been under surveillance and perhaps worse: maybe your office was burglarized, your phone calls tapped or your career derailed. But inclusion was also a mark of effectiveness: you had been speaking up enough to disturb a president who himself proved to be the true enemy of American democracy. </p> <p>These recent intrusions, and I expect there will be more, are a symptom of an aggressive assault on democratic principles that is taking place globally. As a private philanthropy, we have the independence to persist. We will learn from DC Leaks and will continue to support open society no matter whose enemies\u2019 lists we land on.</p>",
  "<p>Thursday, 22 October 2015, was the day I realized just how alien I really was.<br></p> <p> I\u2019d come home from work to read the most astounding blog headline I\u2019d ever believed I was misreading: \u201c<a href=\"http://espn.go.com/olympics/story/_/id/13942305/olympic-freeskier-x-games-star-gus-kenworthy-first-openly-gay-action-sports-athlete\">Olympic Freeskier Gus Kenworthy: \u2018I\u2019m Gay\u2019</a>.\u201d </p> <p>I sent my best friend six texts in a row that each said \u201cOH MY GOD\u201d even though, long gone from the homophobic church days of my childhood, I still felt guilt about taking the Lord\u2019s name in vain and still avoided using \u201cOMG\u201d by writing \u201cOMGosh\u201d.</p> <p> An attempt to describe Gus Kenworthy\u2019s good looks would be an insult to God as well as the gods I\u2019d been told were false idols (Buddha, Allah, Katharine Hepburn). Thus, at the risk of being smote, I will simply say that his is an impossible beauty \u2013 Gus is a grinning, blond, jocular jock, a golem of eugenics involving a Disney prince and a Ralph Lauren model. </p> <p>But this resplendence of his wasn\u2019t quite the cause of my paroxysm. Before that moment of revelation, Gus was someone I\u2019d not only fawned over but had studied. Over the years I\u2019d scrutinized even his most casual interviews in the hopes of emulating what he seemed to be: gregarious, kind, chill. </p> <p>In short, he was a dude. </p> <p>When I was a boy, I didn\u2019t know I was gay but I did know I was the opposite of a dude: bookish, sensitive, shy. I was also the son of a minister in the Bible Belt, a place as conservative as it was homogeneous. To adapt, I gradually took on palatable mannerisms and interests until, by the time I\u2019d graduated from the glass-closeted world of an Ivy League school, new acquaintances inexplicably treated me like what I\u2019d once thought was my antithesis \u2013 the bro. </p> <p>Along the way, I\u2019d changed the way I talked and walked and played (I\u2019d taken up rugby, surfing, lacrosse) until I couldn\u2019t quite discern the difference between what was fun and what was survival. </p> <p>And so it was with an alarmed possessiveness, and then an unnerved bewilderment, that I watched as the newly out Gus absorbed global acclaim as he threw off his hard-won dude-isms to appear like other gay guys whose effeminate \u201cpride\u201d I had never quite understood. Somehow, Gus had skipped the quasi-closeted stage of his journey where he and I were finally in the same place: waiting outside a strange house but hoping to be invited in. </p> <p>Instead, Gus was more distant than ever: out, proud, less masculine-acting and a member of the preposterously attractive gay phalanx that made me feel that I had none of the requisite traits that would help me connect with my tribe.</p> <p>It was in these throes of discombobulation that I saw, just two weeks later, a headline on the New York Times\u2019 homepage that read <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/06/arts/marvels-iceman-cometh-out.html\">Marvel\u2019s Iceman Cometh Out</a>. It was not about Gus but, to my tepid delight, a member of the fictional X-Men. </p> <p> Earlier that year, Brian Michael Bendis\u2019s comic book series All-New X-Men \u2013 which brought the original, 1960s-based team of superheroes time traveling to the present day \u2013 featured the adolescent Iceman being outed by a telepathic teammate. What the Times<em> </em>had just reported, though, was a new development: the adolescent Iceman finally meeting back up with his older, present-day self to ask why the hell his adult counterpart had spent his whole life pretending to be straight. </p> <p>At first, adult Iceman is speechless, and then defensive, but then goes silent: there is a panel of adult Iceman looking down; the next panel, teen Iceman waiting for an answer; the next panel, just a shot of adult Iceman\u2019s sneakers; and then, the same panel but with something hitting the floor next to adult Iceman\u2019s shoes and making a \u201ctink\u201d noise as it bounces up. It took me a moment to realize what the falling object was: one of adult Iceman\u2019s tears, frozen before it could even hit the ground.</p> <p>I\u2019d read comics as a kid but didn\u2019t think they had a place in adult life. In fact, I thought their increasing influence on modern art was one of the main causes of what literary critic James Wood referred to as \u201cthe infantilization of our literary culture\u201d. Yet after Iceman\u2019s confrontation with himself, I put a pause on reading Cormac McCarthy\u2019s Blood Meridian \u2013 which I had been boasting to everyone was \u201clikely the <em>great</em><em>est</em> prose I have ever read\u201d! \u2013 to try and uncover every freezing fractal of Iceman\u2019s life. </p> <p>At first, it was merely <em>seeing </em>him: to observe exactly what he had to say, to watch just how the addition of superpowers allowed him to handle the quandaries of life. But then my project broadened to getting a feel for his personality. And the more I read, the more I discovered, with a feeling not unlike pride, that the way I imagined myself was the way Iceman\u2019s writers imagined him, too: hilarious, loyal, agile yet powerful, and willing to acknowledge his sexuality even if he didn\u2019t yet know how to embrace it. </p> <p> In the restless intervals between the release of X-Men issues, I caught up online with reviews of past stories that included Iceman. I learned about the character\u2019s inception and subsequent, more powerful mutations over the decades. I found out that he had a conservative upbringing, too. I even bought a vintage Iceman shirt on eBay.</p> <p>What really entranced me, though, was how the reveal of Iceman\u2019s sexuality intersected with something called retcon (short for \u201cretroactive continuity\u201d), which is when a story\u2019s previously established facts are altered from a later time in the tale\u2019s chronology \u2013 it\u2019s some element of a story, in other words, that\u2019s supposedly always been there even though it\u2019s not revealed until later. </p> <p>After learning of retcon, I spent night after night trying to find a textual causality, from decades of X-Men comics, that hinted at Iceman\u2019s sexual identity. And for every vitriolic comments section of a comic book blog \u2013 in which some commenter would inevitably remark that they were not homophobic but then still ask why a character who seemed straight had to be \u201cmade\u201d gay \u2013 there were also annotated theories from others that supported why Iceman had, in fact, always been a homo. </p> <p>Every time I found one of these particularly compelling theses, sometimes from comic book writers themselves, I felt gratified: \u201cSee\u201d, I would think to the critics in the ether, \u201cthis has always been a part of him, even if he couldn\u2019t show us.\u201d </p> <p>It was a few months into my ice-ploration, after a particularly fruitless Friday night out at some gay bars \u2013 the kind of night where you believe that gay culture\u2019s only viable currency is an extreme, unobtainable beauty \u2013 that I came home alone and dispirited, to really feel the weight of my imagined disconnect from the gay community.</p> <p>There had been other nights like this, even one a few months before that when my sense of isolation was so unbearable that I drafted Gus a note, telling him how similar we were, even though I knew we were now such disparate species that I would never actually send him the message.</p> <p>So on that night I came home alone, with the miasma of tequila still strong at 3am , I appealed to a different idol: I took All-New X-Men #40 from my bookshelf and read the scene that I\u2019d only seen until then in bits and pieces on the internet. It was a six-page conversation of a girl making her friend come out to her. The friend is resistant and angry and ashamed, but he\u2019s also, ultimately, grateful, because he becomes a little less alone. </p> <p>The scene included telepathy and ice walls but it also had the most realistic dialogue I think I\u2019ve ever read and I cried over its words until I fell asleep.</p> <p>Knowing Iceman the way I now know him, what I feel is still not a crush, not even in the playful way readers swoon over Heathcliff or Holden Caufield or even, Christ forgive us, Christian Grey. What I\u2019ve somehow found is a commonality. I can only see very little of Iceman: he\u2019s made up of ink dots and plot points and, in his ice form, is just shades of white with a minimal but evocative smirk. And yet, when I look at him and let myself feel our natural similarities, I don\u2019t mind that neither of us is not the most beautiful one, not yet the dazzling image of a fully fleshed-out form. In the ice of his face what I see is myself reflected. I\u2019m grinning, I\u2019m chilling, I\u2019m mutating.</p> <p><em>Jonah Wynne is a pseudonym for a novelist who lives in New York City.

He sells off his collection of Frankfurt School books, as well as \u201chis feminists, his formalists, his structuralists, his poststructuralists, his Freudians, and his queers\u201d in order to raise money to impress a new girlfriend.</p> <p>Parting with his Frankfurt School books, in particular, though, proves a painful business. \u201cHe turned away from their reproachful spines, remembering how each one of them had called out in a bookstore with a promise of a radical critique of late-capitalist society\u2026 But J\u00fcrgen Habermas didn\u2019t have Julia\u2019s long, cool, pear-tree limbs, Theodor Adorno didn\u2019t have Julia\u2019s grapy smell of lecherous pliability, Fred Jameson didn\u2019t have Julia\u2019s artful tongue.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_School\">Frankfurt School </a>\u2013 those (mostly) dead German Jews who thought and wrote during the Weimar republic, the Third Reich and the cold war \u2013 seemed irrelevant to Franzen\u2019s hero in the new millennium. The critiques of capitalist society developed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Benjamin\">Walter Benjamin</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Horkheimer\">Max Horkheimer</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_W._Adorno\">Adorno</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Marcuse\">Herbert Marcuse</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Fromm\">Erich Fromm</a> and others seemed old hat or at best sophomoric.</p> <p>And so, Lambert, the former lecturer on phallic anxiety in Tudor drama, adapts to the inevitable and trades in his $4,000 library for $65. He puts the proceeds towards \u201cwild Norwegian salmon, line caught\u201d for $78.40 at an upmarket grocery called the Nightmare of Consumption. This is the 1990s, a time, Franzen seemed to suggest, of a consumerism so brazen that it was advantageous, brand-wise, for high-end grocers to appropriate ironically the rhetoric of capitalist critique for their stores\u2019 names [see footnote].</p> <p>It was also a decade in which the nightmare of the Frankfurt School came true. There was, as Margaret Thatcher put it, no alternative. No alternative to capitalism, to what <a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/ebooks/marcuse/one-dimensional-man.htm\">Marcuse called one-dimensional society</a>, to liberal democracy.</p> <p>As if to clinch that point, in the 1990s the American political scientist <a href=\"https://fukuyama.stanford.edu/\">Francis Fukuyama</a> decided to erase a question mark. In 1989, he had written a paper called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/21/bring-back-ideology-fukuyama-end-history-25-years-on\">\u201cThe End of History?\u201d</a>, arguing that there can be no new stage beyond liberal democracy because it is that system which guarantees the greatest possible level of recognition of the individual. Three years later, when Fukuyama published his book <em>The End of History and the Last Man</em>, the question mark had gone. He may have smuggled a neoconservative agenda into his post-ideological thesis, but Fukuyama\u2019s suggestion that the great ideological battles between east and west were over, and that western liberal democracy had triumphed, seemed incontestable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"030f24db79f26dfba0b9608ca4451018f401b265\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/030f24db79f26dfba0b9608ca4451018f401b265/0_74_2608_1565/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Occupy Wall Street\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Occupy Wall Street protesters, 5 October 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KeystoneUSA-ZUMA / Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All that remained was an eternity of what sounded very much like boredom: \u201cThe end of history will be a very sad time,\u201d Fukuyama wrote. \u201cThe struggle for recognition, the willingness to risk one\u2019s life for a purely abstract goal, the worldwide ideological struggle that called forth daring, courage, imagination and idealism will be replaced by economic calculation, the endless solving of technical problems, environmental concerns, and the satisfaction of sophisticated consumer demands.\u201d Perhaps the prospect of that boredom, Fukuyama mused, might restart history.</p> <p>Franzen\u2019s hero, Lambert, is a man of these boring times, one who \u201cno longer wanted to live in a different world; he just wanted to be a man with dignity in this one\u201d. But the dignity Lambert seeks is of a grubby kind. Indeed, if dignity involves a flush bank account and being hooked salmon-like by the gimcrack delusions of late capitalism, is it worth having? Lambert\u2019s dignity seems conceived as an intentionally self-deluded approach; or, as one of the greatest Frankfurt School thinkers, Adorno, put it in <em>Minima Moralia: Reflections from Damaged Life</em>, \u201csuccessful adaptation to the inevitable, an equable, practical frame of mind\u2026 The only objective way of diagnosing the sickness of the healthy is by the incongruity between their rational existence and the possible course their lives might be given by reason.\u201d</p> <p>But the times that Fukuyama supposed were eternal came to an end, thanks not to revulsion at the prospect of an eternity of boredom, nor in disgust at a dignity so degraded it could only be expressed by one\u2019s shopping choices, but due to an old-school capitalist crisis.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d asked the Maoist French philosopher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/may/18/alain-badiou-life-in-writing\">Alain Badiou</a> in <em>The Rebirth of History</em> in 2012. \u201cThe continuation, at all costs, of a weary world? A salutary crisis of that world, racked by its victorious expansion? The end of that world? The advent of a different world?\u201d Badiou was writing about the unexpected consequences of the global financial crisis since 2008, in particular movements such as Occupy and Syriza. He might have added the failure of the US to \u201cdemocratise\u201d Afghanistan and Iraq, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/04/venezuela-election-bolivarian-revolution-maduro\">Bolivarian socialist renaissance in Latin America</a>. Through such movements people demanded what they had been denied under neoliberal capitalism \u2013 recognition, or what Lambert called dignity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the nightmare of consumption that is Tate Modern\u2019s gift shop, there is now a huge section called critical theory</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hence the slogan devised by Occupy activist and anthropologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/david-graeber\">David Graeber</a>: \u201cWe are the 99%\u201d.

Denied recognition by the system, the anarchists of Zuccotti Park found that in self-organisation, and thereby achieved a sense of solidarity.</p> <p>In his 2009 book <em>Valences of the Dialectic</em>, the American Marxist philosopher <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_Jameson\">Fredric Jameson</a> argued that when the fitful apprehension of history does enter people\u2019s lives it is often through the feeling of belonging to a particular generation: \u201cThe experience of generationality is \u2026 a specific collective experience of the present: it marks the enlargement of my existential present into a collective and historical one.\u201d In this, Jameson was disinterring one of the Frankfurt School\u2019s most fruitful thoughts. Walter Benjamin dreamed of exploding the continuum of history; the experiences Jameson described involve that dream\u2019s realisation. The homogeneous, empty time Benjamin associated with the onward march of capitalism and positivism is halted, albeit briefly, and replaced by a more experientially rich and redemptive notion of non-linear time. That, at least, is what Jameson took from Zuccotti Park.</p> <p>In that rebirth of history about which Badiou wrote, Marxism made a comeback. As did Frankfurt School-style critical theory. Perhaps if Lambert had held on to his library until, say, 2010, he might have got two salmon for it. But the hunger for books providing a critique of capitalism continues.</p> <p>In the nightmare of consumption that is Tate Modern\u2019s gift shop, for instance, there is now a huge section called critical theory. Here, the Frankfurt School no longer has a monopoly on the term \u2013 critical theory involves all the disciplines that Lambert once had in his library. A mini-boom in popularising critical theory books \u2013 graphic guides, dictionaries, biographies \u2013 was one consequence of the global capitalist crisis, as was a renewal of critical sociology premised on the Frankfurt School heritage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d11720ef25ce09e65ea7c9d47cd466c8222ff85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d11720ef25ce09e65ea7c9d47cd466c8222ff85/0_169_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese workers are among capitalism\u2019s losers \u2013 overworked and underpaid.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chinese workers are among capitalism\u2019s losers \u2013 overworked and underpaid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STR/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWherever you look these days,\u201d wrote the German sociologists Klaus D\u00f6rre, Stephan Lessenich and Hartmut Rosa, \u201cthe critique of capitalism has become quite fashionable.\u201d Their book <em>Sociology, Capitalism, Critique</em> is not just fashionable: instead it resuscitates critical theory for new times, and takes the side of the losers in the financial crisis. \u201cOur analyses here may be best understood as a critique of the self-debasement, self-disempowerment and self-destruction wrought upon society under capitalism.\u201d</p> <p>In our age, to be sure, anyone reviving critical theory needs a sense of irony. Among capitalism\u2019s losers are overworked, underpaid staff in China, ostensibly liberated by the largest socialist revolution in history, but driven to the brink of suicide to keep those in the west playing with their iPads. The proletariat, far from burying capitalism as Marx predicted, are keeping it on life support. \u201cThe domination of capitalism globally depends today on the existence of a Chinese Communist party that gives delocalised capitalist enterprises cheap labour to lower prices and deprive workers of the rights of self-organisation,\u201d Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, the French Marxist and professor of philosophy at the University of Paris VIII, told me. \u201cHappily, it is possible to hope for a world less absurd and more just than today\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>And our world is absurd. \u201cWhen every person in a train carriage is staring at a small illuminated device, it is an almost tacky vision of dystopia,\u201d argues Eliane Glaser, author of <em>Get Real: How to See Through the Hype, Spin and Lies of Modern Life</em>. \u201cTechnology \u2013 along with turbo-capitalism \u2013 seems to me to be hastening the cultural and environmental apocalypse. The way I see it, digital consumerism makes us too passive to revolt, or to save the world.\u201d</p> <p>If Adorno were alive today, he might well have argued that that cultural apocalypse has already happened, but that we are too uncritical to notice it. His fondest fears have been realised. \u201cThe pop hegemony is all but complete, its superstars dominating the media and wielding the economic might of tycoons,\u201d wrote the New Yorker critic <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/alex-ross\">Alex Ross</a>. \u201cThey live full time in the unreal realm of the mega-rich, yet they hide behind a folksy fa\u00e7ade, wolfing down pizza at the Oscars and cheering sports teams from VIP boxes\u2026 Opera, dance, poetry and the literary novel are still called \u201celitist\u201d, despite the fact that the world\u2019s real power has little use for them. The old hierarchy of high and low has become a sham: pop is the ruling party.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The internet is a hi-tech prophylactic against contamination by ideas that might challenge your world view</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The leading lights of the Frankfurt School, Adorno and Horkheimer, never lived to develop social media profiles, but they would have seen much of what the internet offers as confirmation of their view that the culture industry allows the \u201cfreedom to choose what is always the same\u201d. \u201cCulture appears more monolithic than ever, with a few gigantic corporations \u2013 Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon \u2013 presiding over unprecedented monopolies,\u201d argues Ross. \u201cInternet discourse has become tighter, more coercive.\u201d</p> <p>In the late 1990s, as an arts editor at the Guardian, I commissioned an article to explore the perils of customised culture. The idea was to question the tailoring of cultural products to your tastes, the whole \u201cIf you liked that, you\u2019ll love this\u201d thing. Wasn\u2019t the point of art, I thought then, to blast through the continuum of one\u2019s tastes rather than pander to them? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/may/15/bbc-director-generals-reith-birt-dyke\">John Reith</a>, the BBC\u2019s first director general, once said that good broadcasting gives people what they do not yet know they need. When the piece came in, several of my colleagues wondered: what is so very bad about customised culture? Isn\u2019t getting more of what we know we like a good thing? But, I wailed, good broadcasting and great art offer a kind of serendipity that expands your horizons rather than keeping you in an eternal feedback loop.</p> <p>I now realise that customised culture, which is very nearly ubiquitous today, is a mutation of what Adorno and Horkheimer wrote about in their classic Frankfurt School text <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em> seven decades ago. Their contention was that the freedom to choose, which was the great boast of the advanced capitalist societies in the west, was chimerical. Not only do we have the freedom to choose what was always the same, but, arguably, human personality had been so corrupted by false consciousness that there is hardly anything worth the name any more. \u201cPersonality,\u201d they wrote, \u201cscarcely signifies anything more than shining white teeth and freedom from body odour and emotions.\u201d Humans had been transformed into desirable, readily exchangeable commodities, and all that was left to choose was the option of knowing that one was being manipulated. \u201cThe triumph of advertising in the culture industry is that consumers feel compelled to buy and use its products even though they see through them.\u201d The Frankfurt School is relevant to us now because such critiques of society are even more true now today than when those words were written.</p> <p>\u2022 Stuart Jeffries\u2019<em> <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/grand-hotel-abyss.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Grand Hotel Abyss: The Lives of the Frankfurt School</a></em> is out this month (Verso).

  "<p>David Wagner does not call it heavy metal football. The former Borussia Dortmund reserve team manager, who was convinced to become a coach by his former Mainz team\u2011mate and great friend J\u00fcrgen Klopp, prefers to use a different term for the style of play he has been cultivating at Huddersfield Town since being hired in November with instructions to transform the club.</p> <p>\u201cWe now call it the Terriers\u2019 identity,\u201d says Wagner with a broad smile. \u201cExactly the style of football I love is like a terrier. We are not the biggest dog, we are small, but we are aggressive, we are not afraid, we like to compete with the big dogs and we are quick and mobile and we have endurance. We never give up. This small dog has fighting spirit for sure.\u201d</p> <p>Five games into the season and this small dog is top of the Championship, having sunk its teeth into two of the favourites for promotion, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/13/newcastle-huddersfield-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">winning at Newcastle United</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/16/aston-villa-huddersfield-match-report\" title=\"\">drawing at Aston Villa</a>. No one at Huddersfield is barking about promotion to the Premier League yet, nor even about ending the season higher than Saturday\u2019s opponents, Leeds United, for the first time since 1962. Nor is anyone ruling it out. \u201cI don\u2019t set targets because sometimes targets are limits and we don\u2019t like limits,\u201d says Wagner. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a dreamer, I\u2019m a worker.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/08/charlton-athletic-boycotts-roland-duchatelet-katrien-meire\">Charlton aiming to rise again against backdrop of fury and boycotts | Nick Miller</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wagner makes sure his players work, too, so that they can play at the ferocious intensity he demands. He introduced double training sessions as soon as he arrived, with start times switched to correspond to the kick-off of the next match, whether at 3pm or in the evening. Pundits warned of mutiny but Wagner has found harmony. \u201cThis was one of the biggest surprises and biggest helps for me,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was no resistance, especially from the very experienced players like Dean Whitehead and Mark Hudson. If you deliver professionals something that makes them feel stronger, then they will follow. This was the case and this was the reason why they are very open for the future.\u201d</p> <p>Huddersfield\u2019s performances improved rapidly under Wagner but they appeared to run out of steam towards the end of last season, which concluded with a 4-0 loss at Bristol City and a 5-1 home defeat by Brentford. Wagner knew that his first pre-season with the club would be crucial, especially after he bought or brought in on loan 13 players, including four from Germany, where Wagner was born and bred before playing internationally for the United States, his father\u2019s homeland. Wagner needed to fuse these players rapidly into a unit so on the first day of pre\u2011season training, before any fitness or tactical work, he took them to fend for themselves on a tiny uninhabited island off the coast of Sweden.</p> <p>\u201cWe knew we had a lot of new signings and should never forget that this is a traditional English football club with more than 100 years of history and I am the first manager from outside the British Isles and maybe there are as many foreign players as there has ever been, so we thought: \u2018How can we make the players bind together very quickly?\u2019\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cWe went to Sweden for four days and three nights and we didn\u2019t bring a ball. We were really in the wild, no electricity, no toilet, no bed, no mobile phone or internet. If you are hungry, take your rod and get a fish. If you are thirsty, go to the lake and put your bottle in. If you are cold, make a fire.</p> <p>\u201cWe had three guides with us to help, but if you are always together, in a two-man tent or eight hours a day in a two-man canoe \u2013 and we always rotated the pairings \u2013 then you have to speak to each other. I am convinced that the better you know your mate off the pitch, the more you are able to work for him on it in uncomfortable situations.</p> <p>\u201cThey changed their borderlines over those three days. I can say now, three months later, that it was 100% success, and that is the feedback from the players, too.\u201d</p> <p>Wagner is no hollow sergeant\u2011major. He laughs a lot for a start and his approach is rooted in more than an ability to foster a strong esprit de corps. He has overseen the appointment of a nutritionist and a head of performance services and has had it written into players\u2019 contracts that they must live within 15 miles of the club\u2019s training ground because long commutes hinder recovery. These are basic measures for a man who spent five years gaining a degree in biology and sports science from Darmstadt University after finishing his playing career in 2005.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe I can say I lost my hunger for the football business so I decided to study to understand more about the science side,\u201d he says of that career move. \u201cThose were probably the hardest five years of my life, but I did it.

He was 18 months into the two years of practical work experience required to qualify as a teacher in Germany when, in 2011, Klopp asked him to coach Dortmund\u2019s second team. \u201cI had a few discussions at home,\u201d says Wagner. \u201cThen I decided to take the job.\u201d</p> <p>He thrived at it for four years, taking Dortmund II to the third tier of German football while playing the exhilarating style that Huddersfield\u2019s chairman, Dean Hoyle, would eventually ask him to transplant to Yorkshire.</p> <p>\u201cThe main part of the style here is exactly what we had in Dortmund,\u201d says Wagner. \u201cWe have had to adapt some things to the English environment. For example, referees here do not blow their whistles as much so there are fewer breaks in the game and players get more tired around 70 minutes. Maybe sometimes we have to keep the ball more rather than go for another goal even if you might then concede an equaliser.\u201d</p> <p>Mostly, however, Huddersfield play like a whirlwind. The exciting style was one of the reasons why the club sold a record number of season tickets this summer, more than 15,000 (the other reason was that Hoyle slashed prices). In August, the club enjoyed its highest attendance on an opening day for 46 years and 18,479 fans were thrilled to witness evidence that Wagner\u2019s pre-season had paid off as Huddersfield avenged their heavy loss on the final day of last season by beating Brentford 2-1.</p> <p>That fine start to the campaign has continued. Huddersfield even won 2-1 at Melwood last week when Klopp invited them to play a friendly behind closed doors against Liverpool players who were not on international duty.</p> <p>The question now is whether Huddersfield can sustain their all-action style over a 46-match league campaign without a winter break. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why not,\u201d says Wagner. \u201cThe important thing is to find the right balance between intensity and recovery and everybody knows I have no problem with rotation.\u201d But Wagner reiterates: \u201cThere are a lot of different areas where we have to go forward to be a proper professional football club and we are only at the start of his journey.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cBut we can enjoy our start and be confident as we go into the biggest game of our season, against Leeds United. It\u2019s not just a derby, for us it\u2019s <em>the</em> derby.\u201d Wagner reckons <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/19/leeds-huddersfield-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">March\u2019s 4-1 win at Elland Road</a> could be the highlight of his reign so far. \u201cWe will do our best to make our fans celebrate again,\u201d says a man who is changing his club\u2019s identity, but not too much.</p>",

Critics say zero-tolerance drugs policies and cuts to addiction services have exacerbated the problem.</p> <p>A record 3,674 drug poisoning deaths involving both legal and illegal substances were registered in 2015. Of these, 2,479 involved illegal drugs only \u2013 a 10% rise on a year earlier. Overall, the death rate from drug misuse in England and Wales was the highest ever recorded, at 43.8 deaths per million people.</p> <p>According to the ONS, heroin-related poisonings have more than doubled from 579 deaths in 2012 to 1,201 in 2015. Deaths from cocaine rose for the fourth year in a row and have increased from 112 in 2011 to 320 in 2015. Amphetamine-related deaths, including MDMA poisonings, have risen from 56 in 2010 to 157 in 2015.</p> <p>People aged 30 to 39 were most likely to die from drug misuse, at a rate of 98.4 deaths per million, followed by those aged 40 to 49, at 95.1. Regionally, the worst rate of drug deaths was in north-east England..</p> <p>Even before the latest figures were revealed, the UK as a whole had a drug-related mortality rate almost <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/31/ecstasy-comeback-european-drugs-survey?CMP=share_btn_tw\">three times greater than the European average</a>.</p> <p>Vanessa Fearn, a researcher at the ONS, said the rise in deaths could be partly attributed to a rise in the purity of heroin, following a shortage of the drug that affected global exports in 2011. \u201cAge is also a factor in the record levels of drug deaths as heroin users are getting older and they often have conditions such as lung disease and hepatitis that make them particularly vulnerable,\u201d she said.</p> <p>In a report published to coincide with the data release, an expert group convened by Public Health England and the Local Government Association called for an overhaul of drug treatment. It said a more coordinated approach was needed to address health inequalities, improve access to mental and physical healthcare, and offer help with work and housing. </p> <p>Ian Hamilton, who researches drug treatment at the University of York, said he was disappointed that the report had failed to consider drug consumption rooms. \u201cThe evidence is there to support them, from across Europe and the rest of the world,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cThe UK government is really just dragging its feet and keeps asking for more evidence, when the evidence is there that they reduce overdoses, they engage a hard to reach group into not just health agencies, but a range of other agencies, like homeless services [and] social services.\u201d</p> <p>Drug addiction services have been a victim of austerity cuts, with responsibility devolved in 2013 from the NHS to local authorities, which are not legally mandated to provide any at all. The LGA said a 9% cut to local authority health budgets over the next four years could seriously undermine drug treatment. </p> <p>Shirley Cramer, chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health, reiterated the organisation\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/public-health-bodies-call-for-decriminalisation-of-drugs\">call for the decriminalisation of all drugs</a>.</p> <p>She said: \u201cThe rise in deaths shows the most vulnerable users continue to be stigmatised and pushed to the margins of society, rather than being engaged with the treatment services they need. The decriminalisation of drug use could greatly help to break down these barriers, increase treatment take-up and save lives.\u201d</p> <p>Transform Drugs Policy Foundation said Theresa May should take responsibility for decisions taken in her former role as home secretary. The Home Office sets the overall drug enforcement strategy.</p> <p>\u201cWe all want to keep our communities safe and any of us could be affected by drugs,\u201d said Martin Powell, head of campaigns at Transform. \u201cBut the Home Office \u2013 under Theresa May\u2019s watch \u2013 is responsible for the highest number of drug deaths ever recorded. That the prime minister keeps claiming her drug policy is working should send a chill down the spine of every parent and reasonable person in the country.\u201d</p> <p>Niamh Eastwood, the executive director of Release, criticised what she described as an ideologically driven \u201cabstinence\u201d agenda that had led to an increasing number of people forced to reduce opioid substitution therapy prescriptions or who had had them removed altogether.</p> <p>\u201cThis goes against all the evidence for best practice in drug treatment and is contributing, we believe, to this shameful rise in deaths. Such a hostile environment means people simply don\u2019t want to access treatment,\u201d she said.</p> <p>A Department of Health spokesperson said: \u201cAny death related to misuse of drugs is a tragedy. While overall drug use continues to decline, our approach is to get people off drugs for good, with decisions on treatment based on an individual\u2019s clinical need.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>I was seven years old when my father died. His body was brought home to lie in my gran\u2019s front room. I believed he was my uncle, and could not understand why I had to kiss him every morning and at bedtime. I led the funeral procession, and said goodbye for ever without knowing who he really was. At the time my aunt and uncle were acting as my foster parents after a period of being looked after by my beloved gran and being cared for in a hospital when she could no longer cope. It was 1950 and I was rebellious, described as \u201cimpossible to manage\u201d by my foster parents. I felt unloved and unwanted. </p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until much later in life that I learned my father, who had mental health problems, had been in what was then known as the county asylum for much of the first seven years of my life and when I was just a few months old, my mother had been imprisoned for shoplifting and child neglect. It was decided that I would never be returned to her, or told the truth about my parents. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog/2016/aug/03/social-workers-learn-from-experience-care\">Social workers, please learn from my experience in care</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As I became ever more difficult to control, I was assessed as being in need of prolonged psychiatric and social work help with an urgent recommendation that I should be removed from my foster parents and live where I could experience safety and stability \u2013 the Caldecott Community. Located in a magnificent country mansion in Kent, it had grown from a nursery in London in 1911 to an innovative therapeutic environment headed by its founder, Leila Rendel. It offered a place of safety to distressed children, with the opportunity to grow and take a place in the world.</p> <p>This was well before the recommendations of the <a href=\"http://graham-taylor0.tripod.com/historyoffostercareinenglandandwales19461989/id1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Curtis Report in 1946</a>, which insisted that children\u2019s homes should serve as \u201cplaces of safety and refuge\u201d for children needing assessment, care and protection. In 1947, with the help of the Nuffield Foundation, Caldecott set up the first assessment centre with the intention of providing evidence and experience for local authorities. Before this, children\u2019s homes were mainly provided by voluntary organisations such as <a href=\"https://www.barnardos.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Barnardo\u2019s</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Children\u2019s Society</a>, whereas Rendel, along with Barbara Dockar-Drysdale of the Mulberry Bush in Oxford, proposed a much wider and therapeutic response \u2013 the first of the children\u2019s therapeutic communities.</p> <p>Writing at the time, Rendel was clear, she said: \u201cIt is useless to camouflage a children\u2019s home or foster home as a \u2018home from home\u2019. That it could never be. For these children of misfortune, there could be no adequate substitute.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s true the Caldecott environment was never \u201chomely\u201d. That was its joy and salvation for children like me who felt out of place in a conventional family. It could cope with our impulse to break out, to run away, to act out feelings of anger and distress. We needed to be able to breathe, and do all these things without fear of sanctions, to be understood and cared for whatever we did. </p> <p>The community met these needs exactly. We had space to express ourselves through education, art, literature, music, sport and work in the garden. We rode horses and bikes, went camping and stayed in youth hostels. We made friends, sometimes for life. The discipline, timekeeping, rituals and continuity created the sense of safety. All of this was a far cry from the suffocation I experienced in the domestic family environment. Although my foster parents were blood relatives, I had nothing in common with them, and reacted against their attempts to control me. </p> <p>During my eight years at Caldecott I thrived on the environment, the opportunities for self-expression, especially through music and drama, and learned how to manage my uncontrollable temper, night fears and dreams, and attempted self-destruction. I responded to the discipline, which was reasonable and fair (not hysterical as at home), and the routine of regular meals, clean clothes, and feeling of being important to my peers and those around me. I was rewarded appropriately for success, and my failures were understood. It did not matter that affection was not overt, this would have frightened me, and many others, who had already learned to distrust adults at an early age. The sense of belonging was most important. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog/2016/apr/20/dont-force-young-people-out-childrens-homes-18\">Don't force young people out of children's homes at 18</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Returning to the family home at the age of 16 was a great challenge for me and within months I was literally thrown out into the snow with nowhere to go. By then, I had learned enough skills to survive and never returned to live with the family again. It would be good to record that I lived \u201chappily ever after\u201d but some of the damage left scars that have never healed. Only in recent years have I fully come to understand the truth about my background and parentage, and this has helped a great deal in resolving some of the questions. The sense of loss and abandonment has never left me. </p> <p>In the 1950s Rendel identified not only the needs of the children at the time but in the future, setting out a strategic plan for the future with children always at the heart. An individual response, assessment, fostering where appropriate, a variety of facilities ranging from small family homes, to larger creative environments for those children who needed more space. Finally, support and aftercare for as long as needed. </p> <p>Rendel, Dockar-Drysdale, and others believed that some children are so hurt, so damaged, so vulnerable, that an escape from family life \u2013 not a return to it \u2013 is what is needed. For those who cannot return to families and for whom fostering is not appropriate, skilful preparation for an independent life in the community is a vital part of any programme. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/20/children-in-care-reunification-failure-nspcc\">Research for the NSPCC</a> has shown that about half of the children who go into care because of abuse or neglect suffer further abuse if they return home and and later have to return to care.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard for me to be objective given my own experience, but I think the organisations that have developed the concept of a more personal approach in smaller living units, while retaining the concept of community, have been and are the most successful.</p> <p><em>This is an edited extract from a piece <a href=\"http://www.thetcj.org/in-residence-articles/child-misfortune-cyril\" rel=\"nofollow\">originally published in the Therapeutic Care Journal</a>. </em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/social-care/\">Join the Social Care Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

The last one was in January this year and there was considerable debate about what type of bomb was involved. A very good explainer about this was written <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/north-korea-test-what-is-a-miniaturised-hydrogen-bomb\">here</a> by our own Michael Safi.</p> <p>North Korea claimed then it was a hydrogen or thermonuclear bomb and that the test put NK in \u201cthe front rank of nuclear powers\u201d. Western experts were sceptical, however, because tests put the yield from the blast at around 6-10 kilotonnes \u2013 less than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.</p> <p>The yield from a thermonuclear device would be up to one thousand times greater than that as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon_yield\">this table illustrates</a>.</p> <p>But this explosion is bigger than the one in January, according to experts.

  "<p>\u201cIf you come to this country, you have to learn English.\u201d That old adage. Somehow, it seems to unite bigots and those of a relatively progressive mindset, frequently appropriated as an endnote to what can often be explosive discussions over immigration.</p> <p>If the phrase were a country, it would be Switzerland. In my experience, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/27/more-than-half-of-voters-disliked-tone-of-eu-immigration-debate-report-finds\">when a debate over foreign nationals turns bellicose</a>, the assertion that one has to learn English if they\u2019re going to live in the UK seems to corral everybody into neutral territory, garnering affirmative noises from all camps.</p> <p>As a standalone statement, I don\u2019t dispute it: if you live in another country, be it the UK or otherwise, attempting to learn the language will make life far easier, from both a work and social perspective. Indeed, you as the language learner should have the final say over exactly what you need to learn in order to get by.</p> <p>What I take issue with is this: people seldom debate the details that get overlooked when they insist that foreign nationals learn English. And perhaps more importantly still, because it\u2019s a point that is difficult to dispute, as well as one that can bring closure to an argument, we often miss the opportunity to challenge those who may use it to mask viperous anti-immigration sentiments.</p> <p>The details that the assertion misses pertain to two main ideas. First, it doesn\u2019t quantify how much English one must learn in order to be acceptable in the eyes of those making the demands. For me, it sets the same admonitory precedent as the phrase \u201cI\u2019m not racist, but \u2026\u201d The statement \u201cI\u2019m not anti-immigration, but they should learn English\u201d, if left unchallenged, can become a dangerous criterion by which some people decide which foreign nationals they\u2019ll tolerate, and which they won\u2019t.</p> <p>Therein also lies the possibility that those heard speaking their own language are assumed not to be able to speak English, or to have failed to learn it. Following the recent vote to leave the EU, I\u2019ve had friends from France, Bahrain and Poland tell me they\u2019ve been ordered to speak English by people who\u2019ve overheard them speaking their mother tongue. They can all speak English exceptionally well but are now worried about being heard speaking anything else in case they\u2019re met with abuse. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Even if they could not speak English, it is utterly deplorable to intimidate and scorn somebody on the basis of their language. But worse, it demonstrates how the goalposts are constantly shifting for the non-native speaker; not only do they have to meet an arbitrary standard of English set by the listener, woe betide them if they ever slip into their own language for a few moments.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Not only this, but the demand that people who live here learn English also fails to take account of people\u2019s financial situation, ability and motivation. Even learning the basics of a language takes dedication, focus, incentive, access to resources, time and some sort of financial commitment, be it funding a course or saying no to a shift in order to attend a class. A lot of people coming to the UK \u2013 either for work or to flee war or persecution \u2013 could only dream of enrolling on a five-day-a-week private English course, and have to make do with learning through interaction, on the job, free Esol classes and/or by using applications and books, all while juggling the demands of work and life.</p> <p>While many people do attain a high level of English by these means, some are never really afforded the opportunity to grasp the intricacies (particularly grammatical) that English contains. A friend of mine from Iraq came to the UK to seek asylum six years ago, and in spite of his efforts and hard work, people still assume he has never bothered to learn English properly as he still struggles with his speaking. Because he\u2019s had to rely on sporadic, volunteer-run classes, self-study and simply picking things up, he feels he can only get so far, yet any progress he has made is promptly negated whenever anyone deems his English to be below par.</p> <p>This underlines the danger in having \u2013 at best \u2013 fluid criteria by which to judge how much English foreign nationals ought to learn, and \u2013 at worst \u2013 no criteria at all. My Iraqi friend can get by very well and could certainly get along in a work environment, but this didn\u2019t stop a woman in the post office telling him that he should improve his English if he is going to live in the UK.</p> <p>In the current climate, it is more important than ever that we meet foreign nationals with support and solidarity, rather than unquantifiable expectations and oversimplified demands. We can\u2019t judge people\u2019s efforts to engage in the process of picking up English, nor their dedication to learn, by what we hear in fleeting conversations. Nor can we shirk our duty to challenge any anti-immigration sentiment we suspect is being expressed, just because it\u2019s embedded in seemingly harmless terms.</p>",

Who can blame them? Their offense is loaded with developing talent - Derek Carr, Amari Cooper, Latavius Murray - at the skill positions and boasts exceptional blocking up front. On defense, Khalil Mack now has a pass rushing partner in Bruce Irvin, while the secondary has been upgraded with Sean Smith and Reggie Nelson. And yet, we should not forget that the Raiders went 0-4 in non-conference games last season. Have they yet acquired the maturity to go into an unfamiliar environment like the Superdome and win? The bookies make them a one-point underdog, but I think they match up well. <strong>Raiders to win</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/07/nfl-2016-fans-share-team-hopes-record-season\">NFL 2016: fans share their hopes for their team this season</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Minnesota Vikings @ Tennessee Titans (Sunday 1pm ET/6pm BST)</strong></h2> <p>In medicine, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_Hill_criteria\">the Bradford Hill criteria</a> is a set of guidelines used by epidemiologists to determine whether a causal link exists between a risk factor and the transmission of a disease. In football, \u2018Bradford, Hill, crying, tears\u2019 might be a neat synopsis of Mike Zimmer\u2019s diary entries since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/31/nfc-north-preview-teddy-bridgewater-minnesota-vikings\">Teddy Bridgewater went down injured</a>. There are no established guidelines for choosing between the 36-year-old career backup quarterback who at least knows your playbook, and the once-promising, now widely-disparaged former No1 pick who doesn\u2019t. Tennessee, for all their flaws, looksto be in better hands with Marcus Mariota behind center - not to mention a potentially intriguing one-two punch at tailback with DeMarco Murray and Derrick Henry. Only a strong defense, allied to the enduring excellence of Adrian Peterson, has me leaning Minnesota\u2019s way. <strong>Vikings to win</strong></p> <h2><strong>Tampa Bay Buccaneers @ Atlanta Falcons (Sunday 1pm ET/6pm BST)</strong></h2> <p>Which of these teams is more ready to take a step forward in 2016? Tampa Bay have obvious cause for optimism, with Jameis Winston ready to kick on from his impressive rookie year, and the defense reinforced through both free agency and the draft. First-round pick Vernon Hargreaves III, in particular, impressed in preseason. Atlanta\u2019s margins are more subtle, but even without adding many particularly flashy names on defense (though Derrick Shelby was a nice pick-up) should we not expect further gains in Dan Quinn\u2019s second year as head coach? Overall, I like the Bucs\u2019 prospects for this season better. But at home in week one, I\u2019ll take Atlanta. <strong>Falcons to win</strong></p> <h2><strong>Buffalo Bills @ Baltimore Ravens (Sunday 1pm ET/6pm BST)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a6f6de747968fb5a88e9c53b799f16f5e9fa03b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a6f6de747968fb5a88e9c53b799f16f5e9fa03b/0_150_3082_1850/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Buffalo Bills quarterback Tyrod Taylor took some punishment in pre-season but is fit to face the Ravens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Buffalo Bills quarterback Tyrod Taylor took some punishment in pre-season but is fit to face the Ravens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Tenally/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Ravens welcome some familiar faces back to Baltimore on opening weekend. Both the Bills\u2019 head coach, Rex Ryan, and starting quarterback, Tyrod Taylor, had long stints in Charm City before eventually moving away for a chance to be the No1 guy. Could familiarity be an advantage for them on this occasion? Perhaps, and it is also true that Ryan himself is 5-1 in season openers. But there is also a reason that he was passed over for the top job in Baltimore. John Harbaugh is simply a better coach. <strong>Ravens to win</strong></p> <h2><strong>New York Giants @ Dallas Cowboys (Sunday 4.25pm ET/9.25pm BST)</strong></h2> <p>This will be the fourth time in five seasons that the Giants and Cowboys have met on the opening weekend. Will it also be the fourth time that Dallas emerge victorious? The excitement around Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott is certainly understandable after both rookies starred in preseason, but are they truly ready to carry their team in a game that matters? More specifically, are they ready to outgun Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr \u2013 a partnership that should put up big numbers against a Dallas defense missing both of its starting defensive ends? <strong>Giants to win</strong></p> <h2><strong>Los Angeles Rams @ San Francisco 49ers (Monday 10.20pm ET/Tuesday 3.20am BST)</strong></h2> <p>Will the Rams\u2019 return to LA help to reboot an historic NFL rivalry? Perhaps, though in the short term there is not an awful lot to get excited about here. The 49ers are a popular pick to finish with the worst record in the NFL, but the Rams don\u2019t look all that much better. Todd Gurley is a beast, and the defensive line is stacked, but is that enough - with glaring gaps just about everywhere else on the roster - to justify backing LA on the road against a highly motivated rival who went 5-3 against the spread at Levi\u2019s Stadium last season? There is a part of me that suspects even \u201c7-9 bullshit\u201d might be beyond Jeff Fisher\u2019s team in 2016. <strong>49ers to win</strong></p>",
  "<p>Recent events in the Middle East and Europe seem to breathe fresh life into the \u201cclash of civilisations\u201d thesis. Western incursions into the Middle East have triggered an Islamic backlash that has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/refugees\" title=\"\">driven millions of Muslim refugees westwards</a> and inspired terrorist attacks from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/orlando-terror-attack\" title=\"\">Orlando</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/jul/14/nice-bastille-day-france-attack-promenade-des-anglais-vehicle\" title=\"\">Nice</a>; now the EU is unravelling as European voters abandon multicultural dreams in favour of xenophobic local identities. Allegedly, this has happened because the west has chosen to ignore the deep logic of history. According to the clash of civilisations thesis, humankind has always been divided into diverse civilisations whose members view the world in different and often irreconcilable ways. These incompatible world views make conflicts between civilisations inevitable, and these conflicts in turn fuel long-term historical processes. Just as in nature different species fight for survival, so throughout history civilisations have repeatedly clashed, and only the fittest have survived. Those who overlook this grim fact do so at their peril.</p> <p>The clash of civilisations thesis has far-reaching political implications. Its supporters contend that any attempt at&#xa0;reconciliation between \u201cthe west\u201d and \u201cthe Muslim world\u201d is doomed to failure. They further maintain that the EU can work only if it renounces the multicultural fallacy in favour of an unabashed \u201cwestern\u201d identity. In the long run, only one culture can survive the unforgiving tests of natural selection, and if the EU refuses to save western civilisation from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\" title=\"\">Islamic State</a> and its ilk, Britain had better <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">go&#xa0;it&#xa0;alone</a>.</p> <p>Though widely held, this thesis is misleading. Isis may indeed pose a radical challenge, but the \u201ccivilisation\u201d it challenges is a global civilisation rather than a uniquely western phenomenon. Not for nothing has Isis managed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/16/sanctions-against-iran-to-be-lifted-after-compliance-with-nuclear-deal\" title=\"\">unite Iran with the&#xa0;United States</a>, and to create rare common ground between Israeli PM <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/binyamin-netanyahu\" title=\"\">Binyamin Netanyahu</a> and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. And even Isis,&#xa0;for all its medieval rhetoric, is grounded in contemporary global culture far more than in seventh-century Arabia; it caters to the fears and hopes of alienated, postmodern youth rather than to those of medieval shepherds and merchants. In pure organisational terms, Isis has more in&#xa0;common with a large corporation like Google than with <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Umayyad-dynasty-Islamic-history\" title=\"\">the Umayyad caliphate</a>. The surest sign of a real clash of civilisations is mutual incomprehension. Isis, in contrast, comprehends its enemies only too well&#xa0;\u2013 otherwise, its propaganda would not have been so effective. It is better, therefore, to see Isis as an errant offshoot of the global culture we all share, rather than as a branch of some mysterious alien tree.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Human groups may have distinct social systems, but these seldom endure for more than a few centuries</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Crucially, the analogy between history and biology that underpins the clash of civilisations thesis is false. Human groups \u2013 including human civilisations \u2013 are fundamentally different from animal species, and historical conflicts differ greatly from natural selection processes. Animal species have objective identities that endure for thousands of generations. Whether you are a chimpanzee or a&#xa0;gorilla depends on your genes rather than your beliefs, and different genes dictate diverse social behaviours. Chimpanzees live in mixed groups of&#xa0;males and females. They compete for power by building coalitions of supporters among both sexes. Among gorillas, in contrast, a single dominant male establishes a harem of females, and usually expels any adult male that might challenge his position. As far as we know, the same social systems have characterised chimpanzees and gorillas not only in recent decades, but for hundreds of thousands of years.</p> <p>You find nothing like that among humans. Yes, human groups may have distinct social systems, but these are not genetically determined, and they seldom endure for more than a few centuries. Think of 20th-century Germans, for example. In fewer than 100 years, the Germans organised themselves into six very different systems: <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hohenzollern-dynasty\" title=\"\">the Hohenzollern empire</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic\" title=\"\">the&#xa0;Weimar republic</a>, the Third Reich, Communist East Germany, the federal republic of West Germany, and finally democratic reunited Germany. Of course they kept their language and love of beer. But is there some unique German essence that distinguishes their country from all other nations, and that has remained unchanged from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor\" title=\"\">Wilhelm II</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel\" title=\"\">Angela Merkel</a>? And if you do come up with something, was it also there back in the&#xa0;days of Goethe, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/26/martin-luther-renegade-prophet-lyndal-roper-review\" title=\"\">Martin Luther</a> and of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Frederick-I-Holy-Roman-emperor\" title=\"\">Frederick Barbarossa</a>?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2eed8128952a999f869a98d9827f968f10d46b85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eed8128952a999f869a98d9827f968f10d46b85/27_0_3155_1894/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Proyas\u2019s I, Robot from 2004\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">What will happen when computers replace people in an increasing number of jobs? \u2026 Alex Proyas\u2019s <em>I, Robot</em> from 2004</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2938272.stm\" title=\"\">Preamble of the European Constitution </a>(2004) begins by stating that it draws inspiration \u201cfrom the cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe, from which have developed the universal values of&#xa0;the inviolable and inalienable rights of the human person, democracy, equality, freedom and the rule of law\u201d. This may easily give one the impression that European civilisation is defined by these values. Countless speeches and documents draw a direct line from ancient Athenian democracy to the present-day EU, celebrating 2,500 years of European freedom and democracy. This is reminiscent of the proverbial blind man taking hold of an&#xa0;elephant\u2019s tail and concluding that an elephant is a kind of brush. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_democracy\" title=\"\">Athenian democracy was a half-hearted experiment</a> that survived for barely 200 years in a small corner of the Balkans. If European civilisation for the last 25 centuries has been defined by democracy and human rights, what are we to make of Sparta and Julius Caesar, the Crusaders and Conquistadores, the Inquisition and the slave trade, Louis XIV and Goebbels, Lenin and Mussolini?</p> <p>European civilisation is anything Europeans make of it, just as Christianity is anything Christians make of it. And they have made remarkably different things of it over the centuries. Human groups are defined more by the&#xa0;changes they undergo than by any continuity, but they nevertheless manage to create for themselves ancient identities thanks to their storytelling skills. No matter what revolutions they&#xa0;survive, they can weave old and new into a single yarn. Even an individual may knit revolutionary personal changes into a coherent life story: \u201cI am that person who was once a socialist, but became a capitalist; I&#xa0;was born in Senegal, and now live in France; I married, then got divorced; I&#xa0;had cancer, and then got well again.\u201d</p> <p>Similarly, a human group such as the Germans may come to define itself by the very changes it has lived through: \u201cOnce we were Nazis, but we have learned our lesson, and now we are peaceful democrats\u201d. You don\u2019t need to look for some unique German essence that manifested itself first in Hitler and then in Merkel: this radical transformation itself makes the Germans who they are.</p> <p>Isis, too, may uphold an allegedly unchanging Muslim identity, but their story of Islam is a brand new tale. Yes,&#xa0;they used some venerable Muslim texts and traditions to concoct it, but if&#xa0;I bake a cake from flour, oil and sugar that have been sitting in my pantry for&#xa0;the past two months, does it mean the cake itself is two months old? Conversely, those who dismiss Isis as \u201cun-Islamic\u201d or even \u201canti-Islamic\u201d are equally mistaken: Islam has no DNA. Just as with Christianity, Islam is whatever Muslims make of it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5d2110b0b2cbddd6ba6d6f9c5ab061675aee20f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5d2110b0b2cbddd6ba6d6f9c5ab061675aee20f/21_0_4113_2468/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Palmyra\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isis wrecked the ancient site of Palmyra in Syria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valery Sharifulin/Tass</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet there is an even deeper difference distinguishing human groups from animal species. Species often split, but never merge. About seven million years ago, chimpanzees and gorillas had common ancestors. This single ancestral species split into two populations that eventually went their separate, evolutionary ways. Once this happened, there was no going back. Since individuals belonging to different species cannot produce fertile offspring together, species can never merge. Gorillas can\u2019t merge with chimpanzees, giraffes can\u2019t merge with elephants, and dogs can\u2019t merge with cats.</p> <p>Human tribes, in contrast, tend to coalesce over time into larger and larger groups. Modern Germans were created from the merger of Saxons, Prussians, Swabians and Bavarians, which not so long ago wasted little love on one another.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/10/on-the-origin-of-species-voted-most-influential-academic-book-charles-darwin\" title=\"\"><em> </em></a>The French were created from&#xa0;the merger of Franks, Normans, Bretons, Gascons and Provencals. Meanwhile across the Channel, English, Scots, Welsh and Irish gradually came together (willingly or not) to form Britons. In the not too distant future, Germans, French and Britons might yet&#xa0;merge into Europeans.</p> <p>Mergers don\u2019t always last, as people in London, Edinburgh and Brussels are well aware these days. Brexit may&#xa0;well initiate the simultaneous unravelling of both the EU and the UK. But in the long run, history\u2019s direction is clear-cut. Ten thousand years ago humankind was divided into countless isolated tribes. With each passing millennium, these merged into larger and larger groups, creating fewer and&#xa0;fewer distinct civilisations. In recent generations the few remaining civilisations have been merging into a&#xa0;single global community. Political and ethnic divisions endure, but they do not undermine the fundamental unity. Indeed, some divisions are made possible only by an over-arching common structure.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The process of human unification has&#xa0;taken two distinct forms: weak heterogeneous unification and strong homogeneous unification. The weaker heterogeneous form involves creating ties between previously unrelated groups. The groups may continue to have different beliefs and practices, but are no longer independent of each other. From this perspective, even war&#xa0;is a bond \u2013 perhaps the strongest bond of all. Ten thousand years ago, no&#xa0;tribe in America had any quarrel with Middle Eastern enemies, and no African clan bore grudges towards any European. In contrast, during the second world war, people born on the shores of the Mississippi went to their deaths on Pacific islands and European meadows, while recruits from the heart of Africa fell fighting among French vineyards and Alpine snows.</p> <p>Historians often argue that globalisation reached a first peak in 1913, then went into a long decline during the era of the world wars and the cold war, and recuperated only after 1989. They fear that new conflicts may again put globalisation into reverse gear. This may be true of economic globalisation, but it ignores the different but equally important dynamics of military globalisation. War spreads ideas, technologies and people far more quickly than commerce. War also makes people far more interested in one another.<strong> </strong>Never had the US been more closely in touch with Russia than during the cold war, when every cough in a Moscow corridor sent&#xa0;people scrambling up and down Washington staircases. People care far more about their enemies than about their trade partners. For every US film about Thailand, there are probably 20 about Vietnam. The global \u201cwar on terror\u201d simply continues the process of&#xa0;military globalisation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6166d8782835abdc7f8685fa59fe38acd936bda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6166d8782835abdc7f8685fa59fe38acd936bda/0_0_2200_1467/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Bitcoin (virtual currency) paper wallet with QR codes and a coin are seen at La Maison du Bitcoin in Paris\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Nowadays, the global unity of conflict is perhaps most apparent on the internet, where Isis and the drug cartels are rubbing shoulders with Google and Facebook, and YouTube offers funny cat videos alongside instructions on how to make bombs. Islamic fanatics, murderous drug dealers and geeky hackers don\u2019t exist on unrelated planets; they share the same global cyberspace. All are thrilled&#xa0;by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/07/blockchain-answer-life-universe-everything-bitcoin-technology\" title=\"\">blockchain technology</a> that gave us the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/bitcoin\" title=\"\">bitcoin</a>; all count on easy accessibility via ubiquitous smartphones, and all are antagonised by national governments attempting to wrest control of the net.</p> <p>Yet the world of the early 21st century has gone way beyond the heterogeneous unity of conflict. People across the globe are not only influenced by one another, they increasingly share identical beliefs and practices. A thousand years ago, planet Earth was home to dozens of different political models. In Europe you could find feudal principalities vying with independent city states and minuscule theocracies. The&#xa0;Muslim world had its caliphate, claiming universal sovereignty, but also experimented with kingdoms, emirates and sultanates. The Chinese empire believed itself to be the sole legitimate political entity, while to its north and west tribal confederacies fought each other with glee. India and south-east Asia contained a kaleidoscope of regimes, whereas polities in America, Africa and Australasia ranged from tiny hunter-gatherer bands to sprawling empires. No wonder even neighbouring human groups had trouble agreeing on diplomatic practices, not to mention international laws. Each society had its own political paradigms, and found it difficult to understand \u2013 let alone respect \u2013 alien political concepts.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Today there are nearly 200 sovereign states, which generally agree on diplomatic protocols and common international laws</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Today, in contrast, a single political paradigm is accepted everywhere. The planet is divided between nearly 200 sovereign states, which generally agree on the same diplomatic protocols and on common international laws. Sweden, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea and Paraguay are all marked on our world maps as the same kind of colourful shapes; they are all members of the UN; and despite myriad differences they are all recognised as sovereign states enjoying similar rights and privileges. Indeed, they share many more political ideas and practices, including at least a token belief in representative bodies, universal suffrage and human rights. When Israelis and Palestinians, Russians and Ukrainians, or Kurds and&#xa0;Turks court global public opinion, they all use the same discourse of human rights, state sovereignty and international law.</p> <p>The world may be peppered with various types of \u201cfailed states\u201d, but it knows only one paradigm for a successful state. Global politics follows \u201cthe Anna Karenina principle\u201d: healthy states are all alike, but every failed state fails in its own way, by missing this or that ingredient of the dominant political package. Isis stands out in its complete rejection of this package, and its attempt to establish an&#xa0;entirely different kind of political entity \u2013 a universal caliphate. But it is unlikely to succeed precisely for this reason. Numerous guerrilla forces and terror organisations have managed to establish new countries or conquer existing ones, but they have always done so by accepting the fundamental principles of the global political order. Even <a href=\"http://www.un.org/press/en/1997/19970415.sc6357.html\" title=\"\">the Taliban sought international recognition as the legitimate government</a> of the sovereign country of Afghanistan. No group rejecting the principles of global politics has so far&#xa0;gained lasting control of a significant territory.</p> <p>***</p> <p>In pre-modern times, humans experimented not only with diverse political blueprints, but with a mind-boggling variety of economic models. Russian <em>boyars</em>, Hindu maharajas, Chinese mandarins and Amerindian tribal chiefs had very different ideas about money and taxation, and none was even aware of the existence of such a&#xa0;thing as \u201cthe economy\u201d. Nowadays, in contrast, almost everybody believes in slightly different variations on the same capitalist theme, and we are all cogs within a single global production line. Whether you live in Mongolia, New Zealand or Bolivia, your daily routines and economic fortunes depend on the same economic theories, the same corporations and banks, and the same currents of capital. When finance ministers or bank managers from China, Russia, Brazil and India meet, they have a common language, and can&#xa0;easily understand and sympathise with their counterparts\u2019 woes.</p> <p>When Isis conquered large parts of Syria and Iraq, it murdered tens of thousands of people, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/21/islamic-state-destroyed-ancient-saint-eliane-monastery-syria-says-priest\" title=\"\">demolished archaeological sites</a>, toppled statues and systematically destroyed the symbols of previous regimes and of western cultural influence. Yet when Isis fighters entered the banks and found stashes of US dollars covered with the faces of American presidents and English slogans praising American political and religious ideals, they did not burn these dollars. For the dollar bill is universally venerated across all political and religious divides. Though it has no intrinsic value \u2013 you cannot eat or drink a dollar bill \u2013 trust in the dollar and in the wisdom of the Federal Reserve is so firm it is shared even by Islamic fundamentalists, Mexican drug lords and North Korean tyrants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97eb1359d21a3bf9bfaf6a009db19569faae78b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97eb1359d21a3bf9bfaf6a009db19569faae78b1/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doctors all over the word will dispense similar medicines made by the same drug companies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doctors all over the word will dispense similar medicines made by the same drug companies</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the homogeneity of contemporary humanity is most apparent when it comes to our view of the natural world and of the human body. If you fell sick in 1016, it mattered a great deal where you lived. In Europe, the resident priest would probably tell you&#xa0;that you&#xa0;had made God angry, and&#xa0;that in order to regain your health, you should donate something to the church, make a pilgrimage to a sacred site, and pray&#xa0;fervently for God\u2019s forgiveness. Alternatively, the village witch might explain that a demon had possessed you, and that she could cast the demon&#xa0;out using song, dance and the&#xa0;blood of a black cockerel. In the Middle East, doctors brought up on classical traditions might explain that your <a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/techniques/humours\" title=\"\">four bodily humours</a> were out of&#xa0;balance, and you could harmonise them anew with a proper diet and foul-smelling potions. In India, Ayurvedic experts would offer their own theories concerning the balance between the&#xa0;three bodily elements known as <em>doshas</em>, and recommend a treatment of&#xa0;herbs, massages and exercises. Chinese physicians, Siberian shamans, African witch doctors, Amerindian medicine men \u2013 every empire, kingdom and tribe had its own traditions and experts, each espousing different views about the human body and the nature of sickness, and each offering its own cornucopia of rituals, concoctions and&#xa0;cures. Some of them worked surprisingly well; others were little short of&#xa0;a death sentence. The one thing that&#xa0;united European, Chinese, African and American medical conditions was that everywhere at least a third of people died before adulthood, and nowhere did average life expectancy exceed 40.</p> <p>Today, if you are taken ill, it makes far less difference where you live. In Toronto, Tokyo, Tehran or Tel Aviv, you will be taken to similar-looking hospitals, where you will meet doctors who learned the same scientific theories in not-too-different medical colleges. They will follow identical protocols and use identical tests to reach very similar diagnoses. They will then dispense similar medicines made by the same drug companies. There are still some minor cultural differences, but Canadian, Japanese, Iranian and Israeli physicians hold much the same views about the human body and human diseases. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/09/life-under-isis-raqqa-mosul-giant-prison-syria-iraq\" title=\"\">Isis captured Raqqa and Mosul</a>, it did not tear down the hospitals; rather, it launched an appeal to Muslim doctors and nurses throughout the world to volunteer their services there. Presumably, even Isis doctors and nurses believe that the body is made of cells, that diseases are caused by pathogens, and that antibiotics kill bacteria.</p> <p>And what makes up these cells and bacteria? Indeed, what makes up the entire world? Back in 1016, every culture had its own story about the universe, and about the fundamental ingredients of the cosmic soup. Today, learned people throughout the world believe exactly the same things about matter, energy, time and space. Take, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/irans-nuclear-programme\" title=\"\">Iran\u2019s nuclear programme</a>. The whole problem with it is that the Iranians have exactly the same view of physics as the Israelis and Americans. If the Iranians believed that E=mc\u2074, Israel would not care an iota about their nuclear programme.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Churchill wasn\u2019t more western than Hitler; their struggle defined what it meant to be western at that moment in history</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>People still claim to believe in different things. But when it comes to&#xa0;the really important stuff \u2013 how to build a state, an economy, a hospital, or a weapon \u2013 almost all of us belong to&#xa0;the same civilisation. There are disagreements, no doubt, but then all&#xa0;civilisations have their internal disagreements \u2013 indeed, they are defined by these disagreements. When&#xa0;trying to outline their identity, people often make a grocery list of common traits. They would fare much better if they made a list of common conflicts and dilemmas instead. In 1940, Britain and&#xa0;Germany had very different traits, yet they were both part and parcel of \u201cwestern civilisation\u201d. Churchill wasn\u2019t more western than Hitler; rather, the struggle between them defined what it meant to be western at that particular moment in history. In contrast, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C7%83Kung_people\" title=\"\">!Kung</a> hunter-gatherer in 1940 wasn\u2019t western, because the internal western clash about race and empire would have made little sense to him.</p> <p>The people we fight most often are our own family members. Identity is defined by conflicts and dilemmas more than by agreements. What does it mean to be European in 2016? It doesn\u2019t mean to have white skin, to believe in&#xa0;Jesus Christ, or to uphold liberty. Rather, it means to argue vehemently about immigration, about the EU, and about the limits of capitalism. It also means to obsessively ask yourself \u201cWhat defines my identity?\u201d and to worry about an ageing population, about rampant consumerism and about global warming without really knowing what to do about it. In their conflicts and dilemmas, 21st-century Europeans are very different from their early-modern and medieval ancestors, but are increasingly similar to their Chinese and Indian contemporaries.</p> <p>Whatever changes await us, they are&#xa0;likely to involve a fraternal struggle within a single civilisation rather than a clash between alien civilisations. The&#xa0;big challenges of the 21st century will be global in nature. What will happen when pollution triggers global climate changes? What will happen when computers replace people in an&#xa0;increasing number of jobs? When biotechnology enables us to upgrade humans, extend lifespans, and perhaps split humankind into different biological castes? No doubt, we will have huge arguments and bitter conflicts over these questions. But these arguments and conflicts are unlikely to drive us apart. Just the opposite. They will make us ever more interdependent, as members of a single, rowdy, global civilisation.</p> <p>\u2022 Yuval Noah Harari\u2019s <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/homo-deus.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow</em></a> is published by Harvill Secker. <a href=\"http://www.ynharari.com/\" title=\"\">ynharari.com</a></p>",
  "<h2>1) <strong>New faces for Arsenal means fresh hope</strong></h2> <p>It is almost 30 years since Southampton beat Arsenal away from home in the league, a state of affairs that seems strangely incongruous with their good recent record against Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s team. Saints have won three and lost just one of their past six encounters against Arsenal in all competitions and a maiden win for Claude Puel in this match would give Gooners something new to wail and gnash over following a reasonably satisfactory summer spending spree which saw a central defender, central midfielder and forward, for whom fans have been crying out so vocally, added to the Emirates payroll. How Shkodran Mustafi, Granit Xhaka and Lucas P\u00e9rez will fare in their first Premier League season remains to be seen and we should get our first sight of the German stopper if, as expected, he makes his debut in place of Rob Holding alongside Laurent Koscielny in the heart of Arsenal\u2019s defence. P\u00e9rez is likely to start Saturday\u2019s match on the bench, but will not stay on it for long if Olivier Giroud fails to improve on his reasonable but unremarkable return of less than one goal every two games in Arsenal colours. With so many pieces of his puzzle now in place, one can\u2019t help but feel Arsenal could be just one prolific striker away from winning that elusive league title their supporters crave. No pressure, Lucas. <strong>BG</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2016/sep/08/premier-league-new-signings-weekend-preview\">Premier League: the new signings who could make an impact this weekend</a> </p> </aside>  <blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2016/sep/08/premier-league-new-signings-weekend-preview\">The new signings who could make an impact this weekend</a></li> </ul> </blockquote> <h2>2) <strong>And more arrivals on show in Stoke v Spurs</strong></h2> <p>Both clubs were busy on transfer deadline day, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/31/wilfried-bony-signs-stoke-manchester-city-loan\">Wilfried Bony signing on loan</a> for the Potters from Manchester City and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/31/tottenham-moussa-sissoko-everton-newcastle\">Moussa Sissoko</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/31/georges-kevin-nkoudou-finally-seals-tottenham-transfer-40-days-after-passing-medical\">Georges-K\u00e9vin Nkoudou</a> arriving at White Hart Lane on permanent deals from Newcastle and Marseille respectively. Bony is not the first player to secure a big-money move to the Etihad only to see his career stall, and will be hoping to kickstart it by resuming regular goalscoring duties as a big fish in a comparatively small pond. Sissoko and Nkoudou have been brought in to add some much-needed pace to Tottenham\u2019s attack and it is the \u00a330m man who so often frustrated Newcastle fans with his apparent lack of effort that looks likely to start in place of \u00c9rik Lamela, who may be rested following his late return from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yYjHUoFn9w\">Argentina\u2019s 2-2 draw against Venezuela</a> in M\u00e9rida on Tuesday night. Spurs\u2019 Sissoko acquisition will have prompted both bafflement and the popping of champagne corks at Newcastle, but following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/27/tottenham-hotspur-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">his side\u2019s draw against Liverpool</a>, Mauricio Pochettino spoke of Tottenham\u2019s need for a player who is \u201cmore direct and aggressive\u201d than Christian Eriksen, Son Heung-min and Lamela. So pressing was this need that he paid \u00a330m for Sissoko after a \u00a312m bid for Wilfried Zaha was rejected by Crystal Palace. We can only assume it was those performances at Euro 2016 that convinced Spurs to pay such an exorbitant fee because he did little on Tyneside to suggest he is two-and-half times better than Zaha, as his surprisingly large transfer fee suggests. Only time will tell which version of Sissoko Tottenham have got: the often sullen idler who irritated Newcastle fans or the inspirational player who so impressively raised his game in June. The clock should start ticking this Saturday afternoon at the Britannia. <strong>BG</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/01/13-players-who-broke-club-transfer-records-premier-league-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xype\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2692886\"            data-video-name=\"The 13 players who broke club transfer records in the Premier League \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c83178e4b09a68e9b64ca2\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/01/160901transfers2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/01/160901transfers2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11833823&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/01/13-players-who-broke-club-transfer-records-premier-league-video\">The 13 players who broke club transfer records in the Premier League</a></figcaption> </figure>   <blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/06/christian-eriksen-extends-tottenham-hotspur-contract-2020\"> Eriksen extends Tottenham Hotspur contract to 2020</a></li> </ul> </blockquote> <h2>3) A September Manchester derby</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/08/bext-xi-united-city-manchester-derby\">Who makes our combined United and City XI for the Manchester derby?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With the long international break allowing an unusual amount of attention to be paid to this weekend\u2019s most eye-catching fixture, and with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/02/sergio-aguero-manchester-city-derby-united-three-match-ban-violent-conduct\">the absence of Sergio Ag\u00fcero</a>, the teams\u2019 100% starts to the season and the reunion of Pep Guardiola <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/07/zlatan-ibrahimovic-pep-guardiola-manchester-united-city-barcelona\">with two genuine arch-enemies in Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> providing a panoply of potential excuses for producing princely previews, there is not a lot of ground left uncovered here. However, there is one aspect that has gone \u2013 deservedly, you might argue \u2013 unnoticed: the date. It is a random historical quirk that although one might expect the two clubs to have met most often in the early months of the calendar year, when domestic cups occasionally throw them together (four of their six League Cup meetings and four of their eight FA Cup encounters have been played out in January), or in December, when English clubs are forced to cope with uncommon fixture congestion, September is by a massive margin the most Manchesterderbiful month. Indeed, even before this weekend, precisely 20% of all games between them have been played in this month, more than October and November combined. In the 21 years following the resumption of league football after the second world war, 14 Septembers featured a Manchester derby, in which time the rivals did not meet at all in either November or April, while October and March only got a game each. Perhaps this match signals a return to traditional values, there having been only three previous September derbies in the Premier League era. Though, then again, perhaps it doesn\u2019t. For what it\u2019s worth, compared with games played in other months City and United\u2019s September encounters are slightly more likely to be drawn 0-0 (11.7% to 9.6%, though the last September stalemate was in 1948), slightly less likely to be won by United (38.2% to 41.9%), but massively more likely to be won by the side playing at home (47.1% to 30.9%). <strong>SB</strong></p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/08/jose-mourinho-faith-wayne-rooney-manchester-united-city\">Mourinho\u2019s faith in Rooney faces its biggest test in derby</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/07/zlatan-ibrahimovic-pep-guardiola-manchester-united-city-barcelona\">Ibrahimovic\u2019s contempt for Guardiola still burns brightly</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/06/pep-guardiola-ilkay-gundogan-manchester-city-derby-dilemma\">Guardiola faces derby dilemma over G\u00fcndogan</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/07/pep-guardiola-andres-iniesta-barcelona-tactics-book-extract\">Guardiola: my debt to Iniesta and how he opened my eyes</a></li> </ul> </blockquote> <h2><strong>4) Welcome back, David Luiz</strong></h2> <p>It was rather sweet to see some Chelsea fans embrace <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/31/david-luiz-shock-return-chelsea-34m-transfer-psg\">the return of David Luiz</a> last week. A central defender whose commitment to actual defending might be described as casual, he was nonetheless welcomed back with an enjoyable degree of sentimentality, a little like he was a good-natured but hell-raising old mate you shared a house with aged 21: entertaining to have around, tinged with nostalgia, but not especially reliable. It was a rather curious signing, though: however you rate Luiz (and he seems to be one about whom nobody shrugs and says \u2018no strong feelings\u2019), he is not what springs to mind when one thinks of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/01/david-luiz-not-antonio-contes-first-choice-at-chelsea\">a typical Antonio Conte defender</a>. This is a manager who for most of his previous career had Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci at his disposal, two hunks of Italian granite who embody defensive solidity and ruthlessness. It will be interesting, therefore, to see how Luiz adapts to his new demands, assuming he adapts at all, and indeed how Conte uses him. The manager confirmed this week that, despite other suggestions, Luiz will be played in defence rather than midfield, but life as an ersatz Chiellini could be an adventure for all involved. It begins against Swansea on Sunday. <strong>NM</strong></p> <blockquote> <ul> <li> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/01/chelsea-38-players-loan-who-where\">Chelsea have 38 players out on loan \u2013 who and where?</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/01/david-luiz-not-antonio-contes-first-choice-at-chelsea\">Luiz is not really Conte\u2019s type, but Kant\u00e9 will offer protection</a></li> </ul> </blockquote> <h2>5) <strong>Anfield\u2019s new stand</strong></h2> <p>Following its official opening on Friday, Liverpool\u2019s spanking new \u00a3115m Main Stand will host paying fans for the very first time when the club entertain Leicester City the following day. The 8,500-seat extra capacity has been 17 years in the planning and is expected to contribute an additional \u00a320m-\u00a330m per season to club coffers and help narrow the annual matchday revenue chasm that currently exists between Liverpool and clubs like Manchester United and Arsenal. Liverpool currently earn around \u00a360m per year from their attendances, compared to United\u2019s \u00a390m and Arsenal\u2019s \u00a3100m, and can expect to generate even more money from their new construction once they find a sponsor. The prawn sandwich brigade will be well-catered for with 14 executive boxes and new banqueting facilities available to those with the money to pay for them. \u201cIt will be the most exciting day at Anfield in 2016 when we can welcome the additional supporters to the stadium,\u201d said the chairman Tom Werner in an interview two years ago. That the day will be marked by a visit from the champions is little more than a happy coincidence, although the outcome should give two clubs, whose prospects this season are among the Premier League\u2019s more unpredictable, a reasonable indication of where, in football terms, they stand. <strong>BG</strong></p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/08/jordan-henderson-liverpool-captain-jurgen-klopp-anfield\">Henderson: Last season it was hard to feel like the captain</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/08/jurken-klopp-tells-mamadou-sakho-no-easy-route-back-liverpool\">Klopp tells Sakho: no easy route back into Liverpool side</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/07/andy-king-leicester-city-on-move-liverpool\">King says Leicester are on the up and ready for Liverpool</a></li> </ul> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/07/ruud-gullit-holland-football-euro-2016-johan-cruyff\">Ruud Gullit: \u2018I had the privilege and the luck of having Johan Cruyff in my life\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>6) Moyes in new territory with Sunderland</h2> <p>\u201cThis reminds me a little bit of Everton when I took over,\u201d said David Moyes, upon his appointment as Sunderland manager. \u201cEverton had been in the bottom six, I think, four out of the five years before I came in. In my last eight years, I never finished outside the top eight. Hopefully we can do a bit of an Everton.\u201d The journey to the top eight hasn\u2019t started especially well for the man who\u2019ll face his old club on Monday. Three games, no wins, two defeats, one point, a lot of injuries and not much luck in the transfer market. Moyes obviously did a brilliant job to turn Everton around, but one wonders if the two really are comparable, and whether it\u2019s as realistic to hold a team together with electric tape and bits of string and hope for Premier League survival, never mind progression, in 2016. Perhaps Moyes can repeat the trick, but this is a team who had to ask Fifa very nicely indeed to sign goalkeeping cover in Mika, who have played chunks of this nascent season without a recognised central midfielder and who better hope that Jermain Defoe stays fit, or else they\u2019re in big trouble. Reviving Everton was a big task for Moyes 14 years ago, but doing the same at Sunderland could be much bigger. <strong>NM</strong></p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/02/sunderland-victor-anichebe-free-agent-sign\">Sunderland sign Anichebe to bolster attacking options</a></li> </ul> </blockquote> <h2>7) A foam party in Bournemouth?</h2> <p>Eddie Howe\u2019s meticulous attention to detail has been well documented and during the week, the Bournemouth chairman Jeff Mostyn revealed that a study of training sessions, each of which is recorded for posterity, since the arrival on loan of Jack Wilshere revealed that more scoring opportunities than ever before are being created on the Kings Park training ground. Howe says he has already \u201cseen a difference in our players\u201d and hopes Wilshere\u2019s presence on the south coast \u201cwill inspire us to be better coaches to our players and it will inspire the players onto another level\u201d. In their three Premier League matches to date this season, Bournemouth have scored two goals, with Adam Smith bagging a late consolation against Manchester United and Joshua King scoring the opener in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/27/crystal-palace-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">their 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace</a> just before the international break. Wilshere\u2019s creative mettle should be tested for the first time against West Brom, who kept six clean sheets but conceded two or more goals on eight occasions on their top-flight travels last season. Mostyn says strikers King and Callum Wilson are \u201cfoaming\u201d at the prospect of lining up in the same team as Wilshere. It will be intriguing to see how long it takes them to get on the same wavelength of a provider whose speed of thought may initially leave them a mite bamboozled. <strong>BG</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/31/the-ups-and-downs-of-jack-wilsheres-career-so-far-video-report\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xyx5\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2692229\"            data-video-name=\"The ups and downs of Jack Wilshere's career so far \u2013 video report\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c70aabe4b0df5f040dc06a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/31/160831Wilshere_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/31/160831Wilshere_WebM.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/31/160831Wilshere.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/31/the-ups-and-downs-of-jack-wilsheres-career-so-far-video-report\">The ups and downs of Jack Wilshere\u2019s career so far</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/08/jack-wilshere-bournemouth-arsenal-eddie-howe\">David Hytner: Wilshere has a fighting chance to reboot career</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/01/jack-wilshere-arsenal-bournemouth-best-place-to-develop\">Wilshere says Bournemouth is \u2018best place\u2019 to develop </a><br></li> </ul> </blockquote> <h2>8) Feghouli upstaging Payet</h2> <p>Towards the end of Sofiane Feghouli\u2019s time at Grenoble the club\u2019s director general, Pierre Wantiez, called the winger a \u201cpetit merdeux\u201d \u2013 little shit \u2013 after, amid rumours of an imminent transfer, he played so poorly in a 4-0 defeat against Rennes that he was taken off after half an hour. He was picked for only two more games that season, and five in total, missing the remainder with a knee injury before leaving for Valencia on a free. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I think in all honesty,\u201d Wantiez told the press. \u201cYou can write this, I stand by what I\u2019m saying. I think he is being very badly advised. I think that he has around him people who, to make him feel better about himself, are telling him he\u2019s God\u2019s gift.\u201d Towards the end of his time at Valencia Feghouli was suspended by the club for repeatedly missing training, and for refusing to take part in a post-match warm-down, claiming he had a sore ankle. Feghouli\u2019s agent said Pako Ayestar\u00e1n, Valencia\u2019s coach, was \u201ctrying to build his own career by knocking down others\u201d, but the player was not selected again and ended the league season with one goal and two assists, making it his least productive in Spain, before again departing on a free transfer. Once considered perhaps the most exciting young talent in France, Feghouli is now 26 and whatever is to follow for him at West Ham, it is unlikely to be dull. His first two competitive appearances, against Domzale in Europa League qualifiers, were promising, and having missed five club games with a hamstring injury, as well as Algeria\u2019s 6-0 thrashing of Lesotho last week, he is now ready to make his Premier League debut. He may have picked a good game to do so, with Watford yet to win this season and pockets of space on the right flank likely to open up when the visitors\u2019 wing-back \u2013 probably Jos\u00e9 Holebas \u2013 pushes forward. Should he be chosen in the starting XI, Dimitri Payet\u2019s more hotly-anticipated return from injury could be upstaged. <strong>SB</strong></p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/29/watford-sign-stefano-okaka-five-year-deal-anderlecht\">Watford sign Okaka on five-year deal from Anderlecht</a></li> </ul> </blockquote> <h2>9) <strong>The pressure on Pardew</strong></h2> <p>Were it not for their run to the FA Cup final last season, it\u2019s difficult to imagine Alan Pardew would still be in charge of Crystal Palace. Since Boxing Day, Palace have won only two of 24 Premier League matches, taking eight points from the 22 they failed to win: relegation form by any standards and an apparent inability to arrest such slumps has long been a trait of Pardew\u2019s career in management. Mathieu Flamini has just become Pardew\u2019s sixth high-profile summer signing and although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/08/mathieu-flamini-joins-crystal-palace-free-transfer\">he arrived on a free</a>, the Palace chairman Steve Parish has splurged the thick end of \u00a351m on assorted players. On loan from Chelsea, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/08/crystal-palace-loic-remy-injury-thigh\">Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my has just been ruled out for two months</a> with a thigh injury. While Palace\u2019s appalling league form must be a huge source of concern for Pardew, he can at least take heart from the fact that his team played some of their best football under his watch in the second half of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/27/crystal-palace-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">their match against Bournemouth</a> just before the international break (having played some of their worst in the opening 45 minutes).

  "<p>Social pressure on new mothers to get their babies into a feeding routine and to sleep through the night is a key factor in why the UK has the lowest rate of breastfeeding in the world, an expert has warned.</p> <p>Speaking at the British Science Festival, Amy Brown of Swansea University said not enough was being done to support new mothers to breastfeed. In particular, she said, advice given to mothers to impose a feeding regime whereby babies don\u2019t feed frequently, contributed to why many women felt that they weren\u2019t producing enough milk and abandoned breastfeeding.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the key things about breastfeeding is that you have to feed the baby very regularly,\u201d Brown, a GP and member of the department of public health, policy and social sciences at Swansea University, told the Guardian. \u201cThat\u2019s easily every two hours.\u201d</p> <p>But, she says, that doesn\u2019t chime with common advice.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe are told by so-called experts that you should get your baby in a feeding routine and your baby should not wake up at nights,\u201d said Brown. \u201cBut that is really incompatible for breastfeeding.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommend just breast milk for six months, with breastfeeding to form part of a baby\u2019s diet up to two years of age.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/28/breastfeeding-could-prevent-800000-child-deaths-lancet-says\">Breastfeeding could prevent 800,000 child deaths, Lancet says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe have known that breastfeeding rates aren\u2019t great in the UK for a long time,\u201d said Brown. \u201cWe have about 80% of women starting breastfeeding at birth, but by the end of the first week, over half of those babies have had formula in some way.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking ahead of the publication of her book, Breastfeeding Uncovered, Brown said that while a large proportion of mothers struggle to breastfeed, few of them have underlying conditions that prevent the process.</p> <p>Surveying around 300 women who had stopped breastfeeding in the first six months, Brown found that around 80% cited pain and difficulty as contributing, while 40% referenced public attitudes, 60% lack of support from others and 20% blamed embarrassment.</p> <p>\u201cThe vast majority of women who are having problems, it isn\u2019t really to do with a primary inability to breastfeed, it is to do with their experience,\u201d said Brown. \u201cEighty per cent of women who stop breastfeeding in the first six weeks do not want to. They want to keep breastfeeding but they feel that they can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Among the issues faced by new mothers, Brown criticised aggressive advertising by formula companies, and negative public perceptions of breastfeeding that have seen women<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/dec/02/claridges-hotel-breastfeeding-woman-cover-up\"> asked to cover up</a> when feeding their baby. \u201cBabies have to breastfeed in public \u2013 it is called eating,\u201d said Brown.</p> <p>Duff agrees that breastfeeding should be welcomed. \u201cEverywhere should be parent friendly and baby-feeding friendly,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Pressures on women to return to their pre-baby lives is also part of the problem, said Brown, while cuts affecting funding for breastfeeding peer support groups, as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/28/new-mothers-babies-support-services-cut-england-breastfeeding-midwife\">cuts to midwife services</a> and the NHS more widely, are limiting help for new mothers.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03yQs9tAe3c\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/03yQs9tAe3c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>How you can help to support a breastfeeding mother.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cThe way forward is that we need a complete societal change to how we look at breastfeeding, how we accept it, but also how we accept and value mothering in general,\u201d said Brown, adding that raising breastfeeding rates could save the NHS millions due to a reduction in common infant infections. \u201cWomen should not be held responsible for this, is the key message,\u201d she added. \u201cWe need to raise breastfeeding rates, but it is not their fault.\u201d</p> <p>Rebecca Schiller, director human rights for childbirth charity <a href=\"http://birthrights.org.uk/\" draggable=\"true\">Birthrights</a>, said it is of great concern that many women were giving up breastfeeding sooner than they wished, and criticised a lack of support for new mothers. \u201cI think it is a huge cruelty to women to tell them that there is something wonderful that they should be doing and then to make it very difficult for them to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also don\u2019t think that anyone should be pressured into feeding in any particular way.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Nigel Rollins from the department of maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health at WHO, said it was important to acknowledge that breastfeeding can be challenging, and criticised negative public attitudes to breastfeeding, particularly in England. What\u2019s more, he said, whether a particular routine is adopted varies greatly between babies.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThis sense that \u2018achieving\u2019 or \u2018accomplishing\u2019 breastfeeding is the responsibility only of the mother and therefore [a] judgement as to whether she is \u2018adequate\u2019 or not, I think is one that I would counter strongly,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many things that make it more manageable to breastfeed than not,\u201d he added, pointing out that lack of support from a partner, family, health worker and even negative comments from neighbours can all play a role in making it harder. \u201cAll of those things chip away at a woman\u2019s confidence as to whether she has enough milk,\u201d he said. </p>",
  "<h2>Four months and counting</h2> <p>China and the US\u2019s announcement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/03/breakthrough-us-china-agree-ratify-paris-climate-change-deal\">that they will join the Paris climate accord</a> comes at a time when the UK\u2019s own climate and energy policies appear at best in disarray, and worst at odds.<br></p> <p>Imagine you\u2019re stuck in a burning building. Stay and you perish, but the complexity of the building means that to physically escape you have to work with the others also trapped. If everyone does their own thing, many valiant efforts will be made, but ultimately you\u2019ll all be doomed.</p> <p>Tackling climate change is fundamentally a challenge of first accepting that action sufficient to prevent irreversible warming is non-negotiable \u2013 you need to get out of the burning building \u2013 and then of solidarity and cooperation, you need to make the escape plan happen together.</p> <p>In the UK only the Green party has climate targets roughly in line with what climate science says is needed. Meanwhile, solidarity and cooperation within parties is proving hard enough to achieve after the vote for the UK to leave the EU, let alone presenting the electorate with an undivided progressive choice in elections. </p> <p>Post-Brexit we can expect little of the UK government on sufficient and clear climate action. The great irony of the lobby to leave, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/30/brexit-spirit-crushing-green-directives-minister-george-eustice\">which railed against the \u201cred tape\u201d of Brussels</a>, is that it has triggered probably Britain\u2019s biggest ever open-ended, bureaucratic exercise. Forty years\u2019 worth of legislation and cross-border agreements need rewriting in a more complicated, multipolar world. Not only will this distract, decisively, from achieving much else, but international treaty negotiation will be dictated by the old economics of competition and division.</p> <p>Fortunately, new alliances in the UK are being explored to reverse inequality and live within the Earth\u2019s limits.</p> <p>Caroline Lucas has joined with Lisa Nandy, Labour\u2019s former shadow spokesperson on energy and climate change, and Liberal Democrats including the current leader, Tim Farron, to launch an initiative for greater direct political cooperation, called for in a new book, <a href=\"https://www.bitebackpublishing.com/books/the-alternative\">The Alternative: Towards a New Progressive Politics</a>. The title echoes the name of the mould breaking new political party in Denmark of the same name, <a href=\"http://alternativet.dk/english/\">The Alternative</a>, set up in 2013 to be a fresh, collaborative and progressive voice and change the divisive tone of domestic politics. </p> <p>Writing in the book, Uffe Elb\u00e6k, its party leader, compares the emergence of The Alternative to Syriza and Podemos as a reaction to a failure of the political system so serious that it leaves democracy itself under threat. But, far from strident, their response is to advocate for new, shared values that are the inverse of the emergent chest-beating and fearful nationalism threatening international cooperation on everything, including climate change. They speak instead of political mobilisation based on humility, empathy, courage, generosity and even humour.</p> <p>The scope and ambition of contributors to the UK initiative addresses the appetite and mechanics for cooperation.</p> <p>In a chapter on re-imagining Britain\u2019s approach to the environment, I argue in the book that from government to anti-austerity groups in opposition, there is a kind of denial about the full economic implications of preventing irreversible climatic upheaval. The clamour for a return to growth inevitably results in a kind of business as usual consumerism.</p> <p>In terms of alternative economic visions among progressive circles, if any are discernible they tend toward the vague promise of <a href=\"https://libcom.org/blog/fully-automated-luxury-communism-utopian-critique-14062015\">\u201cfully automated luxury communism\u201d </a>- a world in which technology and redistribution deliver lives of leisure and plenty. </p> <p>But not only does this founder on broken planetary, environmental boundaries, it also contains a kind of impoverished digital disengagement with the real, material world. The alternative is a green, circular and genuinely shared economy of \u201cbetter not more\u201d. In this, reskilled and reconnected, rather than passive, disposable consumerism, we take back more control of our lives making, mending, re-using and sharing more of the things we need. </p> <p>Not only does this bring greater independence, wellbeing, cost and resource savings, but it draws on long-standing working class traditions of self and mutual help that let people and communities flourish in tough economic times. The cultivation of new skills and craft also counter the alienation of much modern work. </p> <p>A new more plural, progressive politics, capable of supporting the changes needed to prevent climate disaster, itself needs a new economic model, judged not by how quickly it grows, but by how well it allows us all to thrive within planetary environmental boundaries.</p>",
  "<p>Would you like to work for a robot? Although the automation of skilled jobs is a <a href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7006734/?reload=true&amp;arnumber=7006734\" rel=\"nofollow\">reality</a>, your boss is probably (still) a human. Even though the most optimistic artificial intelligence (AI) enthusiast would struggle to persuade us that the technology to create non-human leaders is upon us just yet, robots could be managing people in the decades to come. So would a robot leader be much worse than your current boss?<br></p> <p>Most people think of leadership as an occupation or a person who is formally in charge of others, but leadership is really the mechanism that enables a group to perform better. Specifically, leadership is a process of <a href=\"http://amp.aom.org/content/26/4/66.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">influence</a> that enables a group of people to function as a team to achieve more than an individual or a badly led group. Leadership, then, is a <a href=\"http://opr.sagepub.com/content/4/1/74.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">resource</a> for the group, and the critical issue is not what the leaders look like but how they influence the group.</p> <p>The good news for those hoping to automate leadership is that its scientific study is <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=_iqTAwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=judge+leadership+personality&amp;ots=SySjjbhi61&amp;sig=uFGY0fh4c9T8_26Iwn-7nxxnb1M#v=onepage&amp;q=judge%20leadership%20personality&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">well-established</a>. Indeed, 100 years of academic research have enabled us to identify the <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S104898430900174X\" rel=\"nofollow\">key ingredients</a> of leadership, so it is now possible to predict with a relatively high <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/apl/89/5/901/\" rel=\"nofollow\">degree of accuracy</a> whether someone will become a leader and how effectively they will lead if they get there. And once we are able to decode a phenomenon to break it down into its core components, then it is feasible to automate it. As Norbert Wiener, the father of cybernetics and a pioneer in robotics, noted: \u201cIf we can do anything in a clear and intelligible way, we can do it by machine.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Unlike human leaders, a well-programmed robot would be selflessly focused on advancing the interest of its team</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For example, a crucial component of effective leadership is <a href=\"http://search.proquest.com/openview/2a0fc88dd10cf97d2c2440672362ed17/1?pq-origsite=gscholar\" rel=\"nofollow\">technical expertise</a>. Unsurprisingly, leaders make better decisions than their subordinates when they have higher levels of domain-specific knowledge and sometimes higher <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;uid=2004-95165-012\" rel=\"nofollow\">general intelligence</a> than them. To the degree that this knowledge can be reduced to a fixed set of rules and facts, it would be hard for even the most experienced leader to compete with a machine. </p> <p>Furthermore, while the logical and reasoning capabilities of humans tend to peak by the <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/03/06/0956797614567339.abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">age of 30</a>, intelligent machines can continue to learn and get smarter and faster as they process more data. Of course, a robot leader will not be able to replicate human intuition, but there is no real evidence that intuition \u2013 feelings about facts \u2013 makes leaders more effective. On the contrary, when intuition is not grounded on data it can produce <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/emo/13/2/189/\" rel=\"nofollow\">toxic ideas</a> and <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/psycarticles/2013-20587-001\" rel=\"nofollow\">undesirable behaviours</a>, such as prejudice, unconscious bias and discrimination. </p> <p>Another key component of effective leadership is <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/apl/100/3/948/\" rel=\"nofollow\">integrity</a>, which involves putting the team ahead of the leader and displaying consistency between one\u2019s words and actions. There are two main reasons for the importance of integrity in leadership. First, integrity is linked to trustworthiness and unless groups trust their leaders they will not be able (or willing) to perform well. Second, when leaders lack integrity they could engage in a range of unethical and counterproductive behaviours that harm their teams. </p> <p>Given the frequency with which these toxic and destructive behaviours are <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/apps.12024/full\" rel=\"nofollow\">displayed in leaders</a>, including highly qualified and talented individuals at the top of successful and global organisations, it appears that the honesty bar is fairly low, so it should not be difficult to design robot leaders that outperform most of their human counterparts on this score. </p> <p>Needless to say, unlike human leaders, a well-programmed robot would be selflessly focused on advancing the interest of its team \u2013 that would be its only agenda. In contrast, even when people lead effectively they tend to be driven by <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/peps.12072/full\" rel=\"nofollow\">selfish and narcissistic</a> desires (eg the need for status, recognition and power), which explains why they often derail. Indeed, one study estimates that <a href=\"http://www.3minutemile.co.uk/images/uploaded/news_601802.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">up to 67%</a> [pdf] of managers can be expected to fail.</p> <p>A third critical element for effective leadership is <a href=\"http://amle.aom.org/content/2/1/74.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">strategic self-awareness</a> or the capacity to understand how one impacts on others. Self-aware leaders are able to examine themselves from other people\u2019s perspective. They are alert to feedback and able the gauge how their acts and intentions may be interpreted by others, which enables them to proactively manage their reputation. </p> <p>Although self-awareness might appear to be a human characteristic, it can be modelled in robots. Indeed, most AI systems comprise a <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-02161-9_3\" rel=\"nofollow\">feedback loop</a> that enables them to adjust their decisions on the basis of environmental inputs (eg thermostats, chatbots and wearables). Meanwhile the technologies for identifying human emotions from audiovisual content are <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11036-016-0685-9\" rel=\"nofollow\">advancing rapidly</a>. And again, it is not that this ability is particularly refined in leaders, which is why billions of pounds are devoted each year to executive coaching designed to help leaders increase their self-awareness. </p> <p>A final key ingredient for effective leadership concerns good people-skills, often referred to as <a href=\"http://jlo.sagepub.com/content/17/1/5.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">emotional intelligence</a> (EQ). Leaders with higher EQ are able to stay calm and composed, even in stressful circumstances. They can read other people like a book and are capable of predicting and influencing the behaviour of others. </p> <p>Although <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ukqzSRWHV1sC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=video+voice+profiling+emotion+technology&amp;ots=vrT3nlVkLo&amp;sig=iTHS2x_8Dk31Ei5c885u9wA0-kQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">affective computing</a> \u2013 the creation of emotionally intelligent systems - is still in its infancy, it is important to note that robots do not need to be able to feel in order to act in an emotionally intelligent manner. In fact, contrary to what people think, even in humans high EQ is associated with <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886914004851\" rel=\"nofollow\">lower</a> rather than higher emotionality: it is about controlling one\u2019s impulses and inhibiting strong emotions in order to act rationally and minimise emotional interference. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/aug/10/artificial-intelligence-the-new-creative-mind\">What does artificial intelligence mean for the creative mind?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>EQ scores range from very low \u2013 with key characteristics being neurotic, hotheaded and emotionally hypersensitive \u2013 to very high, phlegmatic, impassive and unexcited, so the real challenge would be to create robots with low rather than high EQ. </p> <p>Though the idea of a computer-generated manager may seem far-fetched at the moment, robot leaders could start entering the working environment and begin to outperform bad (or even average) human leaders within the next few decades. </p> <p><em>Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic is professor of business psychology at University College London, visiting professor at Columbia University and the CEO of Hogan Assessment Systems.

Turnbull\u2019s tendency to want 100 flowers blooming simultaneously, his venture capitalist instincts to extend mightily, contract sharply when reaching the limits of a concept and recalibrate instantly into the next thought, looked more unsteady than bold. The brash and the rash collided inelegantly into the punishing demands for simple answers generated by a news cycle that throbs in the thrall of the new, lives to punish, and never sleeps.</p> <p>It also became clear that Turnbull and his treasurer, Scott Morrison, were not really on the same page. There were petty power struggles obvious enough to spill over into the public domain. Then competitive federalism enjoyed a short boom, bust cycle. The states would levy their own income taxes. Actually they wouldn\u2019t, because they didn\u2019t want to.</p> <p>The gloss was coming off, and the stampede to an early election was gathering pace. Magic bullets started to look enticing \u2013 a Senate reform debate, presaging a run to a double dissolution election, that would deliver that magic mandate where everything could become a little easier.</p> <p>The mandate was supposed to be emphatic. It was an illuminated landmark on the horizon, encouraging steady marathon swimming in choppy waters.</p> <p>But of course the mandate didn\u2019t materialise. After an eight week campaign that comprehensively failed to detect and speak to the national mood, Turnbull is back in power by a whisker. His fury at the apparent indifference of fate to what is supposed to be the inexorable rise of Malcolm rang out just after midnight on election night on 2 July: shock, anger, disbelief, utterly unvarnished; the director\u2019s cut. Once seen, never forgotten.\u2019</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6fc7398e1c6bac8e961646f113289074bce2b989\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fc7398e1c6bac8e961646f113289074bce2b989/0_0_4500_3003/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malcolm Turnbull addresses party members during the Liberal party election night event at the Sofitel Wentworth hotel in Sydney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malcolm Turnbull addresses party members during the Liberal party election night event at the Sofitel Wentworth hotel in Sydney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The complexity of governing in the contemporary era swallows prime ministers whole. Being freed of responsibility confers a kind of lightness. While Turnbull has been executing his complex gambit, Tony Abbott has been running his own.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s last term in office tells us all we need to know about the dangers of former prime ministers remaining on in public life, thwarted political ambition metastasising into some hydra-headed monster. We know how the story can go, the recent experience remains visceral.</p> <p>Abbott spent a period lying low after his public execution, watching the Turnbull ascendancy soaring overhead, watching on unhappily as colleagues trashed his period in government as an abject disaster, which, of course, it was. The conservative wing, apart from the loyal old factional generals, Eric Abetz and Kevin Andrews, switched over into post-Tony mode, moving on to next generation options, cutting their losses with a person who had failed their common cause.</p> <p>But Abbott is a politician of vaulting ambition. As a person, he\u2019s driven and hyper-competitive. He pushes himself to physical extremity. The events of last September proved to be not an end, but the opening of a new phase.</p> <p>Abbott\u2019s first cycle of rapprochement with colleagues has been contrition. The second has been public forays that are designed to have demonstration effects: they are designed to show that he can lob simple rhetorical bombs that resonate with the base, and pierce the default distraction of ordinary voters going about their lives. Colleagues are invited by inference to compare and contrast the style with the current occupant of the Lodge. </p> <p>Word around the Coalition is Abbott is writing a book about how to be a conservative political party, a new manifesto post Battlelines. The internal feedback in the Coalition suggests Abbott is currently feeling out the landscape, working out where various people are, building bridges, trying to cultivate networks.</p> <p>But Abbott is not the only person positioning out of a calculation that the Turnbull experiment won\u2019t last.</p> <p>Turnbull\u2019s relationship with his deputy, Julie Bishop, suffered a blow post-election when he very obviously hung her out to dry during the cabinet deliberation about whether or not to anoint Kevin Rudd as Australia\u2019s candidate to lead the United Nations. Bishop is an incredibly hard worker who is assiduous with the backbench, doing what needs doing, being where they need her to be, and in politics, that counts for a lot.</p> <p>Peter Dutton is the most important conservative figure in the parliament. Scott Morrison\u2019s ambition is ever present on Ray Hadley\u2019s morning program on 2GB, more present, in fact, than the consistency of his performance as treasurer.</p> <p>In the next generation Josh Frydenberg is a man on the move if we\u2019ve ever seen one, an relentless networker, a builder of bridges between the moderate wing and the conservative wing. It was notable Turnbull gave Frydenberg climate change when he refashioned his ministry post election, something of a poisoned chalice. A meaty conundrum to occupy a fellow of momentum.</p> <p>Christian Porter also has a lot of fans internally because of his grasp of complex and complicated policy issues. Of the generation beyond, Angus Taylor is one of those parliamentarians who succeeds in putting himself on a travelator, understanding the art of the calculated intervention on issues that colleagues care about.</p> <p>This catalogue of ambition is not meant as one of those dispiriting race call assessments that now pour out of Canberra in substitution for investigations or deep policy analysis, it is not meant to be another manifestation of our apparently endless appetite for instability \u2013 in truth, I\u2019m exhausted by it. The whole system feels diminished and frayed and rudderless.</p> <p>Politicians live to plot, but the political class is also exhausted by the relentless zero sum of the past few election cycles. That exhaustion factor is one component that makes Turnbull\u2019s future hard to predict.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Turnbull has been too preoccupied righting the wrongs of 2009 to understand that he\u2019s now in a wholly different phase</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But a few things are clear one year down the track.</p> <p>There were always people inside the Liberal party who were going to resist the Turnbull experiment, because they view him as an interloper, a person in the wrong party, too centrist, too dismissive of conservative shibboleths, too unbound by the conventions of the institutional game of politics, a person without a power base, a person too intent on a frolic of his own.</p> <p>Those people were never going to shift. They were never going to be pacified by charm, or appeasement, by genuflection, or collaboration, they would take it as weakness, and use the weakness to wear him down before tearing him down.

Reintroduction sites were not included. </p> <p>\u201cOne-third is a substantial decline,\u201d said Ian White, PTES dormouse officer, who contributed to the report. \u201cIt shows we must have a change of approach in what we do and how we think about what sort of wildlife we want for our future. What\u2019s good for dormice is also good for birds and butterflies and many other species.\u201d</p> <p>The report also warns that wetter, warmer seasons and more extreme weather events as a result of climate change are likely to affect dormice, which are extremely sensitive to weather conditions. </p> <p>Dormice hibernate from late October-November to April-May and require cold, dry autumns that allow them to eat as much as possible and store energy for the coming months. They also rely on cold, stable winters that allow them to continue sleeping. If they are disturbed and come out of hibernation early, there may be no food sources available and they will die. </p> <p>White said it is estimated that up to 70% of dormice die in this way. \u201cThis would get worse if the weather was unpredictable in a variable climate,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Breeding success is also susceptible to cold, wet weather at peak breeding times. \u201cOur climate is changing, with wetter springs and hotter summers forecast. The effect on dormice populations remains to be seen,\u201d said the report.</p> <p>Since 1993 reintroductions of captive-bred dormice into the wild have been taking place as part of a national <a href=\"http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/file/6040880402137088\">species recovery plan</a>.

But changes in land use since the second world war have been so drastic that the dormice that remain in southern Britain have limited living space and are increasingly isolated.</p> <p>\u201cThroughout most of our history we have used and managed woodlands, but since the end of the last war that stopped,\u201d said White. \u201cNow woods are mostly used for people to walk their dogs.

She wasn\u2019t responding to a hot issue in British politics. She wasn\u2019t jumping aboard a populist or media bandwagon. Few in her party cared about these issues at all. In almost every serious respect the issues were as dead as dodos in British politics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jul/11/theresa-may-plan-workers-boardroom-reform-extraordinary-tories\">Theresa May's plan to put workers in boardrooms is extraordinary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dust had gathered on terms such as industrial strategy and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/11/the-guardian-view-on-theresa-may-as-pm-triumph-of-a-known-unknown\">workplace co-determination</a> ever since Margaret Thatcher entered Downing Street in 1979. Britain fought hard throughout the 1980s to thwart attempts to develop European company law. Yet here, suddenly and paradoxically, was a senior Tory politician, in the wake of the EU referendum, talking about the strategic failures of British management, and the case for employees and customers to sit on company boards, in ways that raised distinct European echoes.</p> <p>Corporate governance and industrial democracy have been the neglected Cinderellas of British politics and economic thinking for decades. May has shaken that all up with a <a href=\"http://www.ukpol.co.uk/2016/07/11/theresa-may-2016-speech-to-launch-leadership-campaign/\">single speech</a>. Suddenly, the ideas she floated in her brief leadership campaign are part of the mainstream political agenda. You could almost say they have become fashionable \u2013 if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/06/sports-direct-to-ditch-zero-hours-contracts\">an endorsement by Mike Ashley of Sports Direct</a> this week for a worker to sit on his board can be dignified in such a way.</p> <p>The larger question is where this might all be heading. The answer, as with other parts of the May project, is that we don\u2019t yet know. This autumn, business secretary Greg Clark is expected to produce a consultative paper, the first real test of government thinking. Lobbyists will already be hard at work trying to dilute the options. But that\u2019s not a reason for not taking the subjects seriously. And with the TUC congress starting in Brighton next week, the labour movement should engage intelligently too.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>British companies have too often been run by people who think management know best and that employees know nothing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For decades, after all, British companies have too often been run by people, such as Ashley, who think management always knows best, and that employees know nothing and are essentially expendable. The idea that industrial democracy might have something positive to offer British business has effectively been sidelined since James Callaghan\u2019s Labour government shelved the <a href=\"http://www.historyandpolicy.org/trade-union-forum/meeting/democracy-in-the-workplace-the-bullock-report-revisited\">Bullock report</a> in 1977. Such thinking has been routinely dismissed as out-of-date corporatist nonsense or red tape.</p> <p>The unions haven\u2019t always been much better. Hugh Scanlon of the engineering workers\u2019 union, one of the infamous barons of the 1970s, once said he supported management\u2019s right to manage and the unions\u2019 right to stop them doing it. Jack Jones, the transport workers\u2019 leader, took a different view. Jones was always genuinely interested in what used to be called workers\u2019 control \u2013 that\u2019s another phrase you don\u2019t hear much these days \u2013 and sat on the Bullock committee, which recommended \u201ca real, and not a sham or a token share\u201d for employees in company management.</p> <p>British capitalism has been transformed in other ways since those days, of course. Heavy industries have gone to the wall. Service industries now occupy the lion\u2019s share of economic activity. The unions are far less powerful. The nature of work continues to be transformed by women\u2019s employment, part-time and temporary contracts, changes to retirement, home-working and new technology.</p> <p>But industrial cooperation remains a very meaningful principle nonetheless. Last month I went with the TUC\u2019s Frances O\u2019Grady to BMW\u2019s Cowley car works in Oxfordshire and talked to management and workforce representatives. German co-determination rights don\u2019t apply to those working for German companies in other countries. But German management culture does, and the impact is revelatory, in Cowley at least.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec3a1fbdf8b681d8554f2f824dd4aa7db7a00c0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec3a1fbdf8b681d8554f2f824dd4aa7db7a00c0a/0_0_6144_3686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frances O\u2019Grady, centre, visiting the Cowley factory.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frances O\u2019Grady, centre, visiting the Cowley factory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jess Hurd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chris Bond, a senior Unite shop steward, sits on the global works council with BMW and gets plenty of advance notice of company thinking. Longterm strategy, research and development, and workforce training and education are tangible results, he believes. \u201cOn the basis of experience,\u201d he says, \u201cI would far rather be managed by a German manager than a British manager. The British ignore what you say to them. The Germans take it seriously and act on it. When this plant was run by a bloke called Andy I never met him. But Gunther has an open door.\u201d</p> <p>There are lots of reasons why Cowley hasn\u2019t had an industrial dispute since the British Leyland days in, appropriately, 1984. They include fear that the owners would simply take the jobs overseas, tighter industrial relations laws, economic downturns that mean workers don\u2019t want to take risks and, not least, the fact that BMW has invested in the plant so that Cowley is now producing a successful product, in the shape of the latest iterations of the ever-popular Mini.</p> <p>But you can\u2019t talk to either management or workers at Cowley without seeing that corporate culture is a big part of the reason too. Management\u2019s watchwords of trust, respect and integrity may come straight out of a management theory textbook, but it\u2019s a better textbook than in the past.</p> <p>The changes brought in by the German owners mean the workforce are no longer seen as the company\u2019s enemies. Assembly director Gunther B\u00f6hner calls them the company\u2019s greatest asset. The workers \u2013 associates, as B\u00f6hner calls them \u2013 seem to feel they are respected. \u201cWe are a constructive partner,\u201d says one. \u201cWe used to be destructive morons.\u201d</p> <p>May has not unveiled any of her detailed thinking on corporate governance. There\u2019s also a very big question to be answered in any government proposals about whether employee representation means union representation. That was a divisive issue in Bullock nearly 40 years ago. Ministerial instincts are likely to be similar to Mike Ashley\u2019s; he might talk about a worker on the board but he\u2019s having nothing to do with the unions.</p> <p>But that\u2019s not a reason for smart unions to stop thinking about May\u2019s ideas. O\u2019Grady is certainly interested in talking to ministers. While Labour has little prospect of power, they might be better occupied talking to the Tories about ways in which \u201csharing responsibility for the success and profitability of the enterprise\u201d, as Bullock put it long ago, can improve the nature of workplaces across Britain.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 9 September 2016 to correct Gunther B\u00f6hner\u2019s job title to assembly director.</li> </ul>",

  "<p>The UK will fail to meet its targets on renewable energy generation, with take-up of clean fuels for heating and transport falling badly behind aims, MPs have warned.</p> <p>The findings of the influential energy and climate change committee (ECC) show that ministers have little clear plan for meeting the 2020 target to meet 15% of energy needs from renewable sources. </p> <p>This includes a target to generate 30% of electricity from wind, solar and other low-carbon sources by the end of the decade, and to generate 12% of heating energy and 10% of transport fuels from clean sources by the same date. The UK is not legally bound to meet the heat target, which is advisory.</p> <p>These targets were set under the EU\u2019s renewable energy plan, but ministers are still required to meet them despite the Brexit vote. The UK is faring best on renewable electricity, the target for which may be met if current trends continue, but the proportion of renewable energy used for transport has fallen in the last year, and heating remains a significant problem.</p> <p>Angus MacNeil, the Scottish National party MP who chairs the committee, said: \u201cThe experts we spoke to were clear: the UK will miss its 2020 renewable energy targets without major policy improvements. Failing to meet these would damage the UK\u2019s reputation for climate change leadership. The government must take urgent action on heat and transport to renew its efforts on decarbonisation.\u201d</p> <p>The report findings are the latest warning over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/10/uks-attractiveness-for-renewables-investment-plummets-to-all-time-low\">UK\u2019s waning attractions for renewable energy investors</a>.</p> <p>Heating and transport fuels are particular problems because there are few options available other than fossil fuels. For instance, ground source heat pumps are difficult to install, biomass heating can produce soot particles, and biofuels \u2013 made from plants \u2013 are controversial as they can contribute to deforestation if not closely managed.</p> <p>The MPs said that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/15/decc-abolition-major-setback-for-uk-climate-change-efforts\">rearrangement of government departments that has resulted in the closure of the Department of Energy and Climate Change</a>, with its responsibilities bundled into an enlarged Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, could be an opportunity for renewed focus on meeting the targets. However, they also warned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/24/uk-renewables-cuts-risk-slowing-shift-to-clean-energy\">these priorities could be lost</a> as ministers cope with the implications of leaving the EU.</p> <p>Dr Robert Gross, director of the centre for energy policy and technology at Imperial College London, told the Guardian that even in electricity generation, the sector closest to meeting the 2020 targets, progress was slowing because of government policy.</p> <p>He said the Conservative government\u2019s decision last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/18/tories-end-onshore-windfarm-subsidies-2016\">to effectively end public support for onshore wind</a>, which is the cheapest form of renewable energy generation, and to slash support for solar power and offshore wind, were making a major difference.</p> <p>\u201cLeaving the EU does not mean that the UK can simply forget these targets,\u201d he said. \u201cUK legislation is predicated on them. The UK still wishes to take a leading role in the climate debate, and backsliding on targets is not consistent with doing so.\u201d</p> <p>He said there had also been a lack of progress in constructing district heating systems, a feature of many continental European cities, whereby hundreds or thousands of homes are heated from a central source, often reusing the otherwise wasted heat that is a byproduct from fossil fuel power stations or rubbish incineration.</p> <p>Sir Brian Heap, research associate at the centre for development studies at the University of Cambridge, called on ministers to take note. \u201cMore research and effective policy decisions are needed to achieve [the targets] which should be addressed urgently,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A government spokeswoman said: \u201cOur priority is providing secure, affordable and clean energy.

If Storey successfully defends her title, she will be out on her own as the most decorated British female Paralympian of all time.</p> <p>It has been a long time coming, a record 24 years in the making. Having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/06/paralympics-sarah-storey-road-race\">equalled Tanni Grey-Thompson\u2019s tally of 11 gold medals</a> in London four years ago, a new landmark is in sight for Storey. Appearing in her seventh Paralympics, she could reach it on the first day of competition in Rio.</p> <p>However, there is no room for complacency. \u201cI always think people who assume things are a little bit silly because it\u2019s sport and I\u2019m there to be shot at,\u201d said the 38-year-old from Stockport, who made the switch from swimming to cycling at Beijing in 2008. \u201cI\u2019ve been shot at unsuccessfully by a lot of athletes over the last three Paralympic cycles, since I first started in Beijing. Everyone wants to beat me. If you ask the other athletes who they want to beat, they all want to beat me, which is a massive compliment. If I can successfully defend my individual pursuit title again then I\u2019d be absolutely over the moon.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/07/sarah-storey-other-athletes-want-to-beat-me-massive-compliment-cyclist-paralympics-rio\">Read the full interview here</a>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T13:54:13.056Z\">at 2.54pm BST</time></p>  </div>"
