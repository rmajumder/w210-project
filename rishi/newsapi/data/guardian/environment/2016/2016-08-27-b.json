  "<p>In those far-flung outposts of Britain\u2019s influence where diplomats circle the Chesterfields of an evening and gossip over brandy, an old story is never far away. It is the story of a meeting \u2013 never recorded \u2013 that took place between officials of Britain and Norway to discuss the matter of how one might go about depopulating one\u2019s islands. It is whispered that the government of Norway, restored once more following the Nazi occupation of the second world war, approached the UK seeking advice on a robust strategy towards its islands.</p> <p>Happily for future generations of Norwegians, their postwar government ignored what Britain told them, which was to evacuate the islands on the grounds of cost and security and gradually cause them to run down. Norway\u2019s island communities thrived and became a powerhouse, while Britain\u2019s suffered from a policy that has since been described as one of \u201cbenign neglect\u201d. In Scotland, which has 99 populated islands \u2013 two-thirds of the UK\u2019s total \u2013 it wasn\u2019t until the creation of the Highlands and Islands Development Board in 1965 that its islands began to thrive once more.</p> <p>Still, the cost of public services in these areas, per head of population, is higher than anywhere else in the UK.</p> <p>Islands are an economic and administrative nightmare for those countries who were bequeathed them in the Earth\u2019s infant years. So much toil and trouble for so few people: why can\u2019t folk just be sensible and live on the mainland where they can be reached much more cheaply? Don\u2019t they realise how difficult it is to defend these places?</p> <p>Earlier this month, the tiny Hebridean island of Muck (population: 30) <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36956972\" title=\"\">sent out a global appeal </a>via social media for a primary teacher for its seven children. The school\u2019s popular teacher had quit and none of the initial six candidates followed up on their initial interest, as the reality of life on an island without a shop and cut off from the mainland for several months in the year began to dawn on them.</p> <p>Yet following the Facebook appeal, Highland Council has been swamped with applications from all over the globe for the \u00a335,000 a year post, which brings with it a three-bedroom flat and, in the opinion of the last teacher, Julie Baker, \u201ca short commute and stunning views over the sea to Ardnamurchan Point\u201d. These places might be remote and require small triumphs of human endurance, but people will always want to live in them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ebba1b8a0ea379e8985af023ef8b2166113c25a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ebba1b8a0ea379e8985af023ef8b2166113c25a/0_515_5744_3447/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A lesson in progress on Muck in 1966.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A lesson in progress on Muck in 1966.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The hi-tech accoutrements of modern life and the instant gratification that they bestow might once have been considered a threat to an island existence, rendering it all but obsolete; instead it has brought a renaissance in remoteness. The internet and social media have made life on an island that little bit less remote and made the task of running a business on it a lot less costly. In the last census the overwhelming majority of Scotland\u2019s islands saw their populations increase.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/25/snp-veteran-michael-russell-appointed-scottish-brexit-minister\" title=\"\">Mike Russell</a>, Scotland\u2019s new Brexit minister, is the MSP representing Argyll and Bute in the Scottish parliament. He might also reasonably be called the UK\u2019s minister for islands, as 23 of them lie within the boundaries of his constituency.</p> <p>\u201cThe economy and business of the islands is not just important to the people who live and work there,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they are also of crucial importance to the economy of Scotland and the UK. Around two per cent of Scotland\u2019s population lives on our islands and we, as a government, have a moral duty to ensure that they are treated equally and that our public services, which the rest of us take for granted, are accessible to them too.\u201d</p> <p>Russell is married to an islander and lived in the Western Isles for several years. He is acutely aware of the lazy assumptions and mocking antipathy that sometimes characterises mainland attitudes towards islanders. \u201cIn all my years living among islanders and dealing with them I have found them not to be any different than anyone else. The myth of curious and strange island \u2018ways\u2019 is just that \u2013 a myth. Certainly, you need to be possessed of a degree of endurance to prevail in climatic extremes, but there are great rewards too.\u201d</p> <p>Mainland UK, it seems, has never been more attuned to the economic importance of the islands. Last week the Scottish government announced that legislation for its long-awaited islands bill would be brought forward within the next 12 months and that a wide-ranging public consultation would help shape it.</p> <p>Scotland\u2019s island constituency numbers around 250,000 people and they are beginning to make their views known. Like many others during the referendum on Scottish independence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/30/shetland-independence-vote-scotland\" title=\"\">they were engaged and enfranchised by the debate</a>. A common theme running through the hundreds of responses to the legislation was that a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach to legislation, policy and services does not pay heed to the unique requirements of life on Scotland\u2019s islands.</p> <p>Residents want government legislation affecting public services to be \u201cisland-proof\u201d, meaning that it must exhibit greater understanding of island issues. This, according to the Scottish government, would bring \u201cmore sustainability; greater accountability of authorities; empowerment of communities; consistency with European provision; more efficient use of resources; and wider benefits to the Scottish and UK economies\u201d.</p> <p>On Arran, the seventh-largest Scottish island, there is optimism that some recent depressing trends can be reversed. This gorgeous island is bounded by the Ayrshire coast on one side and the Argyll peninsula on the other. It has been described as \u201cScotland in miniature\u201d and a one-hour drive over its sinewy roads tells you why. Mountains, lochs, fields and oceans are gathered in and around an island of breathtaking beauty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a51843e2d5b908e2877a547c6b35984718d26f6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a51843e2d5b908e2877a547c6b35984718d26f6f/561_663_4335_2601/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tourists on the isle of Arran with a view to Goat Fell mountain across Brodick Bay.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tourists on the isle of Arran with a view to Goat Fell mountain across Brodick Bay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Laura Helliwell, born and bred in Arran, had, like many others in her Arran High School class, moved away from the island, but recently returned to manage the Ormidale Hotel, which has been run by three generations of her family since the 1930s. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the hotel that brought me back, it was the opportunity to bring my children up in this environment. The schools on the island are great and there is a real community spirit conveying values that I want my children to be exposed to.</p> <p>\u201cEven if they move away from here I want their values to be shaped by having spent their childhoods here. The vast majority of my classmates growing up have all moved from here but, in recent years, some of them have begun to return, probably for the same reasons as I did.\u201d</p> <p>Like other islands around the UK, Arran has become a haven for retired people. When you add some very tasty house prices on the island into the mix, it doesn\u2019t look like the population will be getting any younger any time soon.</p> <p>The island\u2019s population stands at around 4,600 and the trend is pointing towards further depopulation as the elderly diminish in number and its young people leave. Yet local businessman Derek Shand, who is also a contractor for Business Gateway Services in Arran and Cumbrae, is optimistic about Arran\u2019s future.</p> <p>\u201cLast year we had 41 business startups and 39 are still with us and reporting good outlooks. We have 165 employers employing 1,645 employees. Their biggest challenge is sourcing staff and securing affordable accommodation. The island can also employ almost 500 seasonal staff, and recent tourism trends tell us that the season is growing and the shoulder months are reducing.\u201d</p> <p>In last week\u2019s <em>Arran Banner</em>, the weekly newspaper that has served the island since 1974 and which is bought by more than 90% of the island population, the latest excellent academic achievements of Arran High School are recorded and celebrated and there are signs that, though many will pursue careers on the mainland, some will return with children and try to build a life here.</p> <p>Shand says: \u201cThe current trend shows returning children of islanders buying or leasing their own businesses or taking over from their parents. For the first time in many years we have a very strong young farmers\u2019 club with sons and daughters returning from mainland colleges. There are still 63 registered farms or smallholdings on Arran.\u201d</p> <p>The introduction of the road equivalent tariff, which caps ferry fares at the same rate as bus travel, has been a boon to the Scottish islands. As the ferry fares have reduced, so the footfall has increased. Some businesses, such as the renowned Arran Aromatics and the Arran Brewery, have seen an increase in customers. An island development officer has been appointed and there is a recognition, at last, that a traditional island community can thrive and be fit to meet the challenges of the 21st&#xa0;century.</p> <p>Laura Helliwell is pleased with the bookings she has taken for the season so far. \u201cI think people are now beginning to recognise that new technology and the internet have the potential to be good for remote island communities. It has brought our places to the doorsteps of people living continents away.</p> <p>\u201cThey can see us on their laptop screens and then make a booking without worrying about the language barrier. Prestwick airport is nearby, bringing cheap Ryanair flights, so that helps too.\u201d</p> <p>On a pier surrounded by fields and mountains and where you first encounter Arran, a new ferry terminal is beginning to take shape. Further up the road, land for a new island helipad is being developed. There are four hotels for sale and three restaurants. There are \u201cfor sale\u201d signs on handsome dwellings perched on their own little Edens all over the island.</p> <p>There are opportunities in these places to detach yourself from the world, but to remain in touch all year round.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0768be0ba91bf17133cfcf9b39d40dfb78cd80e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0768be0ba91bf17133cfcf9b39d40dfb78cd80e/0_0_4242_2545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Approaching Lindisfarne castle by foot on the holy island.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Approaching Lindisfarne castle by foot on the holy island.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>OFFSHORE HAVENS</h2> <p><strong>Lindisfarne</strong><br><em>Population: 180</em><br>A tidal island off the north-east coast of England and one of the most famous of the UK\u2019s ancient places of pilgrimage.

  "<p>On the outskirts of a sprawling low compound stands a sun-bleached, hand-painted billboard. It welcomes visitors to the village and proclaims: \u201cEsther is here \u2026 First lady to travel over sea.\u201d</p> <p>Esther Mahlangu is indeed here. She is sitting, legs outstretched, on a reed mat lain across a mud floor, painting careful black lines on a rough piece of paper with her chicken-feather paintbrush, inside an open-sided thatched-roof hut. This is the classroom where she teaches young girls, just as her mother and grandmother taught her \u201clong, long ago\u201d, she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This culture must not die. Our young people are vandalising our traditions. This is why I try to motivate them</p> <footer> <cite>Esther Mahlangu</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At 82 years old, Mahlangu is not only an artist and teacher, but one of the last skilled custodians of the traditions of the Ndebele people. Her painting uses the pigments of her surroundings: the black comes from the mud in the river; the grey from a tree leaf pounded into paste; and there are five colours to be extracted from the African soil nearby. Shop-bought paints also fill giant well-used pots. She is especially fond of an azure, which can be seen in her wild geometric patterns that adorn every cow dung-plastered surface of the surrounding huts, walls and houses.</p> <p>One of the most famous artists in South Africa, Mahlangu is a living tourist attraction, although visitors are few and far between in this far-flung village, two hours\u2019 drive from the nearest city. And she is indisputably the most honoured <em>gogo</em> \u2013 Zulu for grandmother \u2013 of the Ndebele who remain in the Mpumalanga homelands.</p> <p>The tribe\u2019s numbers have dwindled as young people have departed to look for work in the big South African cities. The scourges of poverty, malaria, Aids and TB have also taken their toll. Mahlangu herself, a widow, has outlived all three of her sons and three of her grandchildren. However, she sees the real risk as the extinction of her tribe\u2019s traditions, and it is that which has driven this little old lady to travel the world pushing Ndebele art internationally, in the hope of making the next generation at home also see its worth.</p> <p>\u201cThis culture must not die,\u201d she said. \u201cOur young people don\u2019t wear the clothes or respect their forefathers, the girls have hair extensions and wear western clothes. This does not make me feel comfortable. They are vandalising our traditions. This is why I talk to them, try to motivate them with my travels and teach them too about Aids.\u201d</p> <p>Along with art, the battle against Aids is Mahlangu\u2019s passion now and the two obsessions have led her into an extraordinary collaboration. As part of a campaign promoted by John Legend, she has just created a classic Ndebele design for a special-edition bottle of Belvedere vodka (<a href=\"https://red.org/\">Red</a>). Half of the profits will be donated to the <a href=\"http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/hivaids/\">Global Fund</a> to be used in tackling HIV/Aids, malaria and TB.</p> <p>Red\u2019s strategy of partnering with big-name, luxury and designer brands to produce a bespoke product, sales of which generate donations to the fund, has been criticised for being too consumerist. It is a division of <a href=\"https://www.one.org/international/\">Bono\u2019s One charity</a>, but is run separately.</p> <p>Charles Gibb, president of Belvedere vodka, is happy to acknowledge the PR benefits for his brand, but is also proud of his relationship with the most famous artist of the Ndebele people, whom he calls \u201ca very special woman\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/19/under-shadow-dirty-hiv-south-african-children-offered-refuge-charlize-theron-whizzkids\">Under the shadow of 'dirty' HIV, South African children offered a refuge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFor celebrities and artists, it\u2019s as important to do something as much as it is for anyone else,\u201d said Gibb. \u201cAnd most of them have something they care about. So everyone is tapping into something and at the end of the day it\u2019s people relying on the Global Fund who benefit.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s an unlikely alignment. A little great-grandmother from a yellow-dusted African village and a Polish luxury spirit drunk in some of the world\u2019s more upmarket bars and hedonistic nightclubs. Mahlangu doesn\u2019t drink alcohol and she certainly doesn\u2019t drink vodka.</p> <p>\u201cI am very proud of her,\u201d says her son, William. \u201cShe is our queen, queen of Ndebele, and our happy mascot.\u201d</p> <p>Mahlangu perches cheerfully on the chair, feet dangling, enjoying the role of dignitary. A tiny woman, her body is from the top of her head to her sandalled feet swamped by strips of beadwork, tapering metal and coloured bands. A heavy wool blanket in bright stripes of primary colours completes her plumage.</p> <p>In 1986, when she was \u201cdiscovered\u201d by a passing French art dealer, Aids was still unknown. It is still a taboo subject and Mahlangu will touch only briefly on it but is passionate about educating young people on prevention.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2bd0176747f3b6881dab12a429aa91111ea83b65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bd0176747f3b6881dab12a429aa91111ea83b65/44_0_4232_5290/800.jpg\" alt=\"Esther Mahlangu\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I love to travel, but I love most to come home\u2019: Esther Mahlangu</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonx Pillemer/(RED)</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Weltevreden clinic, the local health centre, there are signs already of prevention. They have not seen a baby born with HIV since 2008. \u201cIt\u2019s very different now, less people are dying,\u201d said Sister Bathabile, who runs the clinic for a population of 9,500, of whom almost one in 10 are HIV positive. \u201cIt\u2019s 15km to the hospital and our clinic is very, very small, too small,\u201d she said, indicating the packed waiting room and queue of patients outside on the grass. \u201cThe doctor comes once a week, so it\u2019s not ideal, but we never have a shortage of medicines at least. It is very rare for us to not have antiretrovirals.\u201d</p> <p>But charities stress that the real danger in South Africa is in slipping backwards. While the government and the Global Fund are supporting HIV/Aids work, the epidemic can be controlled, but eradicating it is still a pipe dream. Mahlangu still hopes it will happen in her lifetime. In October she will be in London for the opening of the British Museum\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/south_africa.aspx\">exhibition of South African art,</a> which will run from 27 October to 26 February. The only thing that fazes Mahlangu about such a long trip is airport security. Not because of the large bag of mealie meal she insists on carrying with her to combat her fear of being stuck with foreign food, but because of the metal detectors.</p> <p>\u201cThey are always trying to make me take off my wedding bands,\u201d she said, showing the rows and rows of brass rings on her wrists and ankles that are carefully tapered to accentuate the limbs. Given to her on her wedding day by her husband, her neck rings came on the same day from her parents.</p> <p>\u201cI say no, I cannot, these are from my husband. And oh they get very upset. Maybe they want me to sit on the X-ray machine.\u201d She goes off in gales of laughter.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I love to travel, but I love most to come home again. It makes me happy if people like Ndebele art.\u201d And now, by buying it, people can contribute to battling the scourge that has blighted her homeland\u2019s recent history.</p> <p><em>The limited edition Red bottle, designed by Esther Mahlangu, is available from September.

  "<p>The life of a committed football supporter in the UK could never be mistaken for a bowl of cherries. Since that first day, long in the planning, when his mother or father decided finally to inaugurate him into the sacred mysteries he has been condemned to be viewed with suspicion, fear and loathing by the government, civic authorities and the men who actually run the game.</p> <p>Each of these estates has benefited greatly in the decades since the first rules of association football were drawn up. There is national prestige, free foreign travel with first-class accommodation and the opportunity to take a wee \u201cclip\u201d now and then when success causes its light to shine upon them all. None of them ever really experiences that peculiar numbness that comes with defeat for they only ever follow the money and the glory.</p> <p>In those spaces between the big matches where global fame and marketing opportunities are at stake these three estates seem to spend their time either giving football supporters a right good kicking or dreaming up new ways of doing so. In their fantasy world, football success and the prestige that comes with it can be achieved without having to share it with the scum punters.</p> <p>No one ought to be surprised by this. The state and its attendant offices have never been comfortable when large groups of mainly working-class men gather together in a common purpose. When you add alcohol and political fervour into the mix the result can sometimes be a little too saucy for the governors.</p> <p>Games, along with military adventures and royal fecundity, have remained the favoured way of keeping the minds and bodies of the punters occupied while they are being cheated and exploited. But this football malarkey and the sheer numbers of its adherents, well\u2026 we must always keep an eye on them.</p> <p>To civic Scotland and Holyrood, football supporters are regarded as occupying a position somewhere just above drug-pushers and just below crime lords: you can do business with organised crime but you can\u2019t do business with football supporters. They are unpredictable and are driven by strange currents and deep emotions that a politician will never understand. Even after decades of being overcharged and made to watch the game in gulags these football fans remain true to their club.</p> <p>That\u2019s why small armies of policemen are deployed to kettle them and frogmarch them to and from matches. It\u2019s also why the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act was drawn up. This is the act, unique in world law, where an innocent sentiment uttered at a rugby match in Edinburgh becomes a criminally offensive one when espoused in the vicinity of a football match in Glasgow.</p> <p>So it was surely a welcome development when a group of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/22/celtic-fans-raise-45000-for-palestinian-charities-after-flag-protest\" title=\"\">Celtic fans deployed crowd-funding</a> to raise money for two respected relief organisations operating in Palestine. When it was announced that Celtic would play the Israeli champions, Hapoel Be\u2019er Sheva, in a Champions League play-off match, some of their fans wanted to use the game as an opportunity to make a small and peaceful protest about the Israeli government\u2019s treatment of Palestinian people living in the West Bank.</p> <p>So around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/23/celtic-fans-warned-not-to-fly-palestinian-flags-at-match-in-israel\" title=\"\">100 Celtic fans</a> in a crowd of 60,000 waved Palestinian flags at the game in a show of solidarity with the Palestinians. They knew the game would be beamed live around the world and they simply wanted to communicate to an oppressed people that, in a small corner of Glasgow, they were not forgotten. The Israeli players were treated respectfully throughout, as was Celtic\u2019s midfielder and Israeli international player Nir Bitton, who was given a standing ovation when he left the field.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/aug/24/palestinian-refugees-chant-thank-you-to-celtic-fans-for-donations-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5x5k3\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2681076\"            data-video-name=\"Palestinian refugees chant thank you to Celtic fans for donations \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Lajee Center\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57bd80f5e4b0fe30498a44be\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/24/160824refugees_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/24/160824refugees.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/24/160824refugees_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/aug/24/palestinian-refugees-chant-thank-you-to-celtic-fans-for-donations-video\">Palestinian refugees chant thank you to Celtic fans for donations</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Uefa, the organisation that runs European football, has deemed the Palestinian flag to be an \u201cillicit banner\u201d when it is waved at a football match and has begun disciplinary proceedings against Celtic. This will probably end in a fine approaching six figures as there have been several previous instances of unwarranted political behaviour by Celtic fans.</p> <p>These supporters launched a #matchthefineforpalestine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/23/celtic-fans-palestinian-flags-fundraising\" title=\"\">campaign</a>to raise funds for two relief charities operating in the West Bank. Their reasons for doing so were eloquently expressed in a GoFundMe page. In this, they stated their aim of raising \u00a375k to match any Uefa fine and then distribute it to the two nominated charities. At the time of writing they are comfortably past the \u00a3200k mark and will be approaching \u00a3500k by the time of the Uefa hearing on 22 September.</p> <p>Uefa, hardly the most impressive organisation on Earth, doesn\u2019t want politics to contaminate the beautiful game. If it did, there might have been more scrutiny of the way in which it operated as a global mafia, helping itself to the fruits of ordinary supporters\u2019 love for football. Yet, often, football and its mass participation is an ideal place for angry young men and women to gather around and express solidarity.</p> <p>During the fascist regime of General Franco in Spain, to display the Catalan flag was to risk death or imprisonment. The only place where the Catalans could safely fly these fags was Barcelona\u2019s Nou Camp stadium. Barcelona FC now embodies Catalan identity and pride. Wherever there is oppression in the world, football, by its very nature, can provide a vehicle for expressing pride in a national cause. It was never only ever about football.</p> <p>Celtic supporters know this too. Their club was founded in 1887 and played its first game in 1888 to raise funds for the relief of the poor Irish who had gathered in the East End of Glasgow. When they arrived in the city they initially faced resentment, discrimination and squalor.

However, he goes on to put the blame on Thatcher, Reagan, globalisation and the end of the cold war, when he should perhaps be looking for causes that occurred, or at least started, before 1972.</p> <p>On 15 August 1971, President Nixon ended the Bretton Woods system by breaking America\u2019s promise to redeem dollars for gold, beginning the disastrous experiment of world-wide fiat (unbacked) currencies. This did not directly cause neoliberalism, Thatcherism, inequality and so on, but it was the necessary change that enabled them.</p> <p>It allowed permanent trade imbalances to exist that permitted the removal of industries to countries that allow maximum freedom to exploit workers and trash the environment. It also enabled the creation of unlimited debt and persistent monetary inflation, increasing the rewards to capital compared to labour and creating instability in the financial system.</p> <p>If neoliberalism is now coming to its end, we need to understand the monetary structures that allowed it to happen.<br><strong>Martin Lyster</strong><br>Oxford</p> <p>Martin Jacques argues that the postwar era was much better than what he calls the neoliberal era. Yet the share of GDP in leading democracies taken by the state in the 1950s was about half that of the share taken by the state from the 1970s onwards, up to today. &#xa0;Is neoliberalism the right term to describe a state that gets bigger and bigger?</p> <p>He is right that white, working-class, union-organised males did well between 1950 and 1970 but what of women, immigrants or gay people? &#xa0;The 1966 TV play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/may/20/legacy-cathy-come-home-fury-homelessness\" title=\"\"><em>Cathy Come Home</em></a>, exploring the issue of homelessness, and Ken Coates\u2019s study <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Poverty-Forgotten-Englishmen-Ken-Coates/dp/0851243967\" title=\"\"><em>Poverty: The Forgotten Englishmen</em></a><em>,</em> about working-class poverty in Nottingham published in 1970, painted a different picture.</p> <p>Jacques quotes in support of his thesis Francis Fukuyama who told us in 1989 that history had ended. As the Brexit vote, the rise of Islamism and the geo-political posturing of China and Russia show, it may only just be beginning.<br><strong>Dr Denis Macshane</strong><br>London</p> <p>I agree with Martin Jacques that the pattern of inequality that emerged between 1972 and 2013 in Britain and the United States has provoked a populist reaction of which Brexit was a major example. However, I question his tendency to elide populist discontent with class analysis in which he almost exclusively addresses the predicament of \u201cthe working class\u201d. In fact, the data he cites shows a sharp relative decline in average income relative to the top 10% in the United States, presumably calculated with the inclusion of&#xa0;those generally regarded as the middle class. &#xa0;</p> <p>The practical point is that the centre left has a large electoral target group to aim for that would benefit from policies of infrastructure investment&#xa0;and significant income (and wealth) redistribution from the top 10%, especially the top 1%.<br></p> <p><strong>Mike O\u2019Donnell</strong><br>East Finchley</p> <p>While no one could claim that the Blair and Brown governments were perfect, Martin Jacques\u2019s claim that \u201cthe party deserted\u201d the \u201cless fortunate, the unfortunate, the underprivileged and the losers\u201d is ludicrous. Labour invested massively in the NHS, new and improved schools, reducing child poverty, the provision of education maintenance grants and, at the other end of the age range, bus passes for pensioners, while introducing the national minimum wage. Add to this free entry to museums, devolution, regional development agencies and improvements in the social housing stock and there is a record of achievements to set against the shortcomings, real or imagined, which&#xa0; are the only things Jacques and other critics choose to recall.<br><strong>Jeremy Beecham, Labour</strong><br><strong> </strong></p> <p>House of Lords</p> <p>Congratulations to the <em>Observer</em> for examining the scandal of neoliberal economics . But the theory has caused greater damage than was even reported. Its adherents took advantage of major upheavals to undermine democracy and turn economies neoliberal in Indonesia, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Russia and Iraq. The idea is behind the European punishing of Greece and Spain for not submitting to its precepts and was the cause behind the 2008 collapse of the world\u2019s banking system. Let us hope that we really are witnessing the beginning of the death of neoliberalism.</p> <p><strong>Michael McLoughlin</strong></p> <p>Wallington</p> <p>Martin Jacques\u2019s historical analysis of the coming demise of neoliberalism has more in common with <em>Don Quixote</em> than Karl Marx. Neoliberal thinkers and Jacques\u2019s political bogeymen described globalisation, rather than brought it into being. Antiestablishment populism is nothing new, nor is a xenophobic reaction to competition for jobs.</p> <p>Jacques says nothing about gender, ethnicity and nationalism as independent forces generating the reactions he describes. Scotland does not want to leave the UK because of Brexit, but because of nationalism. Indeed, the vote to leave in the UK was not merely a <em>cri de coeur</em> from the propertyless, but was engineered and led by the very neoliberal elites and their media whom Jacques thinks are about to be vanquished.</p> <p>I also doubt that Marx would have agreed with Jacques\u2019s lament for the new government\u2019s supposed thinking about China: \u201cIt looks as if the new prime minister may have an anachronistic hostility towards China and a willingness to undo the good work of George Osborne.\u201d&#xa0; I hope so, but good to see the ex-chancellor still has some mates.</p> <p><strong>Phelim J Brady</strong></p> <p>Surrey</p>",
  "<p>The case of the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/25/vogue-brazil-criticised-for-photographs-of-able-bodied-actors-di/\" title=\"\"><em>Vogue</em> <em>Brasil</em> Paralympics</a> photoshoot demonstrates how sometimes the road to hell is not only paved with good intentions, but also tarmacked with misfiring empathy. In the shoot, able-bodied actors Cleo Pires and Paulo Vilhena, ambassadors for the Brazilian Paralympic Committee, are shown with limbs digitally removed. Pires has an arm missing while Vilhena has a prosthetic leg. In the vexed ethical domain of cultural appropriation, it\u2019s difficult to know how to classify this (Medical appropriation? Infirmity appropriation?) so perhaps best not to try.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the shoot\u2019s message: \u201cWe are all paralympians.\u201d Eh? Why are \u201cwe\u201d all paralympians \u2013 it surely couldn\u2019t be because someone got busy with an airbrush? Thus did <em>Vogue Brasil</em> manage to pull off the remarkable feat of being well-meaning and hopelessly insulting at the same.</p> <p>Why didn\u2019t they use actual paralympians, or disabled models, in this shoot? Weren\u2019t they considered photogenic enough? Was there a fear that genuine disability might crack the camera lens, melt the lights, or just generally be too much of a \u201cdowner\u201d? So much better to draft in a couple of sexy thespians, lob off any surplus extremities and joints (\u201cYou won\u2019t be needing that today, honeybun!\u201d). And after the shoot, everyone gets to go home with a lovely warm \u201cinclusive\u201d feeling \u2013 perchance to write in their diaries (saintly tears splashing the ink): \u201cI was a very good, kind, thoughtful person today and I hope everyone noticed.\u201d Instead, the entry should have read: \u201cToday, I thoughtlessly diminished and patronised not only paralympians, but also every disabled person on the planet.\u201d</p> <p>The shoot managed to portray disability as some kind of \u201cfashion quirk\u201d, a trend even, that, given the right lighting and makeup, the hot and able-bodied can pull off \u2013 in a \u201cwork that infirmity, baby!\u201d kind of way. It implied that evoking the harsh complicated reality of disability is just a matter of rubbing out the malfunctioning body part with a cute computerised eraser, and perhaps adding a prosthesis or two. It propagated the notion that disability has no social, emotional or psychological components; it\u2019s a mere physical (and visual) peculiarity, and one that can be effortlessly faked for the amusement, entertainment, and benefit of the able-bodied world.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t saying that disability has no place on the pages of a glossy magazine, or in the fashion world. It\u2019s fake disability masquerading as empathy that has no place in any real-world setting. While ordinary disabled people might find such fakery offensive, it\u2019s hard to imagine the reactions of paralympian athletes.</p> <p>These are people whose fitness and expertise led to them representing their countries in the most high-profile of global sporting arenas. But never mind all that \u2013 could they do as good, as photogenic, a job of \u201clooking hot-disabled\u201d as an able-bodied person could? Seemingly without malice (it must be noted), <em>Vogue Brasil</em> blundered into endorsing the idea that, even in the real world, disability is better portrayed, made more palatable and attractive (sanitised, if you will) by \u201cnormal\u2019 people. However well-intentioned, this wasn\u2019t being inclusive, or making a genuine attempt to place themselves into the world of the disabled \u2013 a world that could only ever be unimaginable to a privileged, able-bodied person.</p> <p>This was about replacing a disabled person with an \u201cupgrade\u201d \u2013 some looker who\u2019s only pretending. It was saying that disability is too important an issue to be left to actual disabled people, who might screw it up by not photographing well. There was also the presumption that disabled people would be grateful for the solidarity and attention, when I suspect that one commodity that disabled people aren\u2019t short of is high-handed condescension. Paralympian or otherwise, it would seem that disabled people already have quite enough to be getting on with in their lives without the able-bodied wanting a piece of the action, too.</p> <h2>This is not a pedigree chum - this is a tyrant</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"929e9c4e8677d0f60392fce2c05ebb6aefd0705e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/929e9c4e8677d0f60392fce2c05ebb6aefd0705e/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A maltese.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A maltese.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last Friday, it was National Dog Day, but it\u2019s always National Dog Day in our house.

  "<p>Venice, first of the big autumn film festivals, is the most glamorous, attracting big stars to Europe\u2019s most beguiling location. But this year, virtual reality technology could steal the limelight from all the talent posing on the Rialto.</p> <p>The film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/29/jesus-christ-virtual-reality\"><em>Jesus VR \u2013 The Story of Christ</em></a>, to be unveiled at the festival on Thursday, marks the biggest investment so far in bringing the immersive world of virtual reality to mainstream cinema. The US-backed film will be 90 minutes long when it is released this Christmas, but 40 minutes are to be previewed in Venice for anyone quick enough to grab a headset. Filmed in 360 degrees, it places its audience as spectators at the nativity, and takes them right through to the resurrection. The film is Venice festival\u2019s way of saying that the future has arrived.</p> <p>\u201cJust as 3D cinema offered a way to draw audiences that had been lost to television back to the cinema, in the 1950s, so VR provides a unique selling point in the battle against the ubiquity and accessibility of online content,\u201d said film and gaming expert Michael Pigott of Warwick University. \u201cVR certainly offers a form of entertainment experience that is new and striking, but perhaps of equal importance is the fact it is tied to technology. Entertainment companies can market a unique experience that audiences can only have if they go to a VR-capable cinema or purchase the requisite headset and hardware.\u201d</p> <p>Although Imax cinemas are billing their VR theatres as alternatives to the solitary headset experience, up until now consumers have had to shell out for a VR system like Oculus Rift, Google Cardboard or the HTC Vive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3895524444957785e71da93425e17c655ddb50b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3895524444957785e71da93425e17c655ddb50b3/79_30_551_331/500.jpg\" alt=\"Invasion!, according to Madagascar co-director Eric Darnell, is in a \u2018brand new language\u2019.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Invasion!, according to Madagascar co-director Eric Darnell, is in a \u2018brand new language\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Baobab Studios</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This spring, the Cannes film festival also gave more space than usual to VR, showing more than 35 new short films. But it is Venice that has really welcomed the format, setting up a special viewing salon. So, despite deciding to call off the festival\u2019s opening celebrations out of respect for the Umbrian earthquake victims, Venice will still be watched closely in the wider film world to see how sceptical critics react to VR.</p> <p>The big question remains: does anything yet bridge the divide between the worlds of gaming and cinema? At Cannes, Steven Spielberg was not convinced. He said he felt VR was even potentially \u201cdangerous\u201d because it let the viewer \u201cforget the story\u201d.

They haven\u2019t succeeded,\u201d he said last year.</p> <p>Videogaming, he believes, is the natural home for the technology. \u201cIt\u2019s its own art form, though, and it\u2019s not the same as a linear narrative.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Pigott points out there are two ways that VR is already providing new kinds of storytelling: experiments in a kind of \u201clight\u201d interactivity that allows the viewer limited control over their point of view within a film; and a stronger version, where the viewer can explore a fictional world \u2013 something that many video games, such as GTA 5 or The Last of Us, already permit, if only in an animated form, rather than a photographic world.</p> <p>Lucasfilm has played around with Google\u2019s Cardboard headset kit, making a short VR video called <em>Jakku Spy</em>, which it released before <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em>, while newcomer Baobab Studios has made a six-minute film called <em>Invasion!</em> It was presented at Cannes by Eric Darnell, the co-director of animated hit <em>Madagascar</em>, who told reporters it was not an extension of cinema, but \u201ca brand new language\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb4a1f595ce2ed3e1eb41adec5fe4d34e30111fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb4a1f595ce2ed3e1eb41adec5fe4d34e30111fb/0_133_4428_2657/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oculus owner Mark Zuckerberg emphasises VR\u2019s impact on health, education and the watching of sport.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oculus owner Mark Zuckerberg emphasises VR\u2019s impact on health, education and watching sport.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lluis Gene/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This month, a pop-up event in Los Angeles showcased <em>The Turning Forest</em>, an adventure made by Oscar Raby in which the viewer partners up with strange creatures to activate musical cues together.

  "<p>Scientists have warned that potentially deadly fungal infections are acquiring resistance to many of the medicines currently used to combat them. More than a million people die of fungal infections every year, including about 7,000 in the UK, and deaths are likely to increase as resistance continues to rise.</p> <p>Researchers say the widespread use of fungicides on crops is one of the main causes of the rise in fungal resistance, which mirrors the rise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/mar/14/antibiotic-resistance-nhs-fda-agriculture-health-pfizer\">resistance to antibiotics</a> used to treat bacterial infections in humans.</p> <p>\u201cThere are close parallels between bacterial and fungal resistance, though the problems we face with the latter are particularly worrying,\u201d said Prof Adilia Warris, a co-director of the newly opened <a href=\"https://www.mrc.ac.uk/news/browse/new-mrc-centre-for-medical-mycology-at-the-university-of-aberdeen/\">Centre for Medical Mycology at Aberdeen University</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere are more than 20 different classes of antibacterial agents. By contrast, there are only four classes of anti-fungal agents. Our armoury for dealing with deadly fungi is much smaller than the one we have for dealing with bacteria. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe cannot afford to lose the few drugs we have \u2013 particularly as very little funding is being made available for research into fungi and fungal infections.\u201d</p> <p>Fungi cause a range of illnesses \u2013 such as thrush, athlete\u2019s foot and dandruff \u2013 that can be treated relatively easily. <br></p> <p>Other illnesses have more serious consequences. Individuals who are receiving bone marrow transplants and who are immune-suppressed can die of aspergillus and candida fungi infections, for example.</p> <p>Another example of their grim potential was highlighted last week when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/22/wind-musicians-warned-over-hygiene-as-fatal-case-of-bagpipe-lung-reported\">doctors reported that a bagpipe player had died because deadly fungi had infected his pipes</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The total global number of fungal deaths is about the same as the number of deaths from malaria</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cFungi are everywhere,\u201d said Prof Gordon Brown, head of the Aberdeen mycology centre. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe breathe in more than 100 spores of aspergillus every day. Normally our immune systems mop them up but, when our disease defences are compromised \u2013 for example, during cancer treatments or after traumatic injuries \u2013 they lose the ability to fight back. <br></p> <p>\u201cFungi can spread through patients\u2019 bodies and into their spines and brains. Patients who would otherwise survive treatments are dying every year from such infections.\u201d</p> <p>This point was also stressed by Prof Neil Gow, another Aberdeen researcher. \u201cEssentially fatal fungal infections are diseases of the diseased,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>In addition, premature babies and patients with the inherited condition cystic fibrosis are also vulnerable. <br></p> <p>However, the problem is even worse in developing countries. In sub-Saharan nations, where millions are infected with HIV \u2013 which causes severe depletion of patients\u2019 immune systems \u2013 infections with cryptococcus and pneumocystis fungi account for more than half a million deaths a year.</p> <p>\u201cThe total global number of fungal deaths is about the same as the number of deaths from malaria but the amount that is spent on fungal infection research is only a fraction of the cash that goes on malaria research,\u201d added Gow.</p> <p>A vaccine that could protect against fungal disease has yet to be developed, while the rise of resistance to the class of medicines known as azole drugs is causing alarm among doctors.</p> <p>Recent reports from the US and Europe indicate that resistance to azole drugs is increasing in both aspergillus and candida fungi. The widespread use of agricultural fungicides to protect crops and their use in some paints and coatings has been linked to the rise of this resistance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/gallery/2016/may/20/time-for-action-drug-resistant-microbes-jenny-rohn-antibiotics\">It\u2019s time for drastic action on drug-resistant microbes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Doctors have recently uncovered another worrying development: outbreaks of fungal infections \u2013 mainly cryptococcus \u2013 that have appeared in previously healthy people. In one outbreak, in the northwest US, dozens of people died.</p> <p>In the wake of these developments, it was decided by Britain\u2019s Medical Research Council to open its Aberdeen mycology centre earlier this year. <br></p> <p>It will employ experts in the field to gain new understanding of how fungi move into the human body and survive there. It will also work on the development of new drugs and tests for pinpointing specific fungi that are infecting patients.</p> <p>\u201cFungal infections are going to be an increasing problem in coming years and we need to develop the best defences,\u201d said Brown. \u201cWe aim to do that here.\u201d</p>",

In a post-Leicester Premier League, we are desensitised to surprise. But Hull forming a temporary Big Four with Chelsea and the two Manchester clubs was on the WTF side of unexpected. Those four teams are the only ones with 100 per cent record in this season\u2019s Premier League, and two of them - Hull and Manchester United - meet in the evening game at the elegantly named KCOM Stadium.</p> <p>Hull know this won\u2019t last, and that life begins at 40 \u2013 the points total that usually guarantees safety. United don\u2019t know their exact target, but they do know it\u2019s a big one. In the two seasons that Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola did battle in La Liga, they finished second with 92 and 91 points respectively. </p> <p>After last season\u2019s endearing, old-fashioned competitiveness, when anyone could at least draw with anyone, it seems likely that the bar will be raised this year. The highest total by a team that did not win the English top flight was Manchester United\u2019s 89 in Sergio Aguero season. If only they hadn\u2019t drawn with Stoke in September. </p> <p>It was Mourinho who made everyone in England, particularly Sir Alex Ferguson, realise that the points you win in August are worth the same as the ones you win in April. He won\u2019t be happy unless United get three of them today. </p> <p><strong>Kick off</strong> is at 5.30pm.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/26/hull-city-14-players-premier-league-miracle\">The Hull City 14: the players tasked with performing a miracle</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-27T15:37:33.757Z\">at 4.37pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

She was captured in August 2013, before the group had risen to global prominence, having travelled to Aleppo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/19/kayla-mueller-boyfriend-new-details-isis-kidnapping-aleppo\">with her boyfriend</a>, Syrian photographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/19/kayla-mueller-boyfriend-new-details-isis-kidnapping-aleppo\">Omar Alkhani</a>, to help fix a satellite at an MSF hospital. The job took longer than expected and the two stayed overnight. The next day, they were abducted while driving in an MSF vehicle to a bus stop to return to southern Turkey, where Mueller was based.</p> <p>After a failed rescue attempt on the weekend of 4 July 2014, and botched negotiations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/10/family-kayla-mueller-confirms-aid-worker-killed\">Mueller died in captivity</a>. Questions remain about the cause of her death: Isis says she was killed in a coalition airstrike, which the US denies.</p> <p>The Muellers discussed their daughter\u2019s 18 months in captivity in an hour-long documentary. On Wednesday, in anticipation of the release of the program, MSF released <a href=\"http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/msf-statement-abc-news-2020-documentary-kayla-mueller\">a statement</a> that explained its version of events. The group has maintained it would never have permitted Mueller to come to Aleppo had it known of her intentions. It had already banned some foreign workers from operating in Syria, as kidnappings had become rife.</p> <p>\u201cMSF\u2019s security policy therefore forbid people from certain countries, including the US, from working at or even visiting the hospital,\u201d the organization said. </p> <p>Five MSF workers were taken hostage in northern Syria after Mueller\u2019s abduction. Two of them, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/white-house-obama-donate-kayla-mueller-charity-41675254\">Frida Saide and Patricia Chavez</a>, told ABC they were held with Mueller in a cell that was guarded by the notorious British Isis fighters that other hostages named \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/fourth-member-of-isis-beatles-identified-el-shafee-elsheikh-london\">the Beatles</a>\u201d. </p> <p>The women, who had not spoken out before, described Mueller as strong and said that she would exchange letters with another American hostage, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/steven-sotloff\">Steven Sotloff</a>. The hostages created a makeshift game of Trivial Pursuit, they said. In September 2014, Sotloff was beheaded.</p> <p>Mueller\u2019s family said she was tortured from the start of her captivity, her fingernails being ripped out and her head shaved.

About four, including the one on Margate high street, are still empty seven years on.</p> <p>Soult points out things are likely to be more difficult for BHS, partly because of the large size of its branches but also as a result of a tougher business climate in which retailers are closing stores as shoppers switch to buying online.

Many retailers used that to plug the gaps in their portfolio.\u201d</p> <p>Will Thomas of retail property consultancy KLM believes 15% to 20% \u2013 or about 33 BHS stores \u2013 are likely to be very difficult to shift. \u201cIt is quite an obsolete portfolio. BHS hasn\u2019t really kept up with the fashions and retail pitches have moved away from its stores. In many locations, it is really the last store in town and not attractive to many,\u201d he says.</p> <p>More than a decade of underinvestment means that many branches will require major refurbishment, including the removal of asbestos, which could cost up to \u00a3500,000 per store.</p> <p>With little demand for the average 45,000sq ft stores BHS occupied, many branches are likely to be divided up in the same way that former C&amp;A outlets were split to house shops including Zara, Primark and New Look.</p> <p>Extensive upper floors, once used for stock rooms, staff canteens and managers\u2019 offices, are likely to be even trickier to deal with.

  "<p>One of my favorite technological myths is, like all the best stories, both ancient and urgent. It\u2019s about usurpation and seduction. In Greek mythology, the sculptor Pygmalion falls in love with his own supremely beautiful creation, Galatea. In Ovid\u2019s telling, there\u2019s a happy ending. The goddess of beauty, Aphrodite, takes pity on him and breathes life into the marble. The statue\u2019s lips grow warm under his kiss; they fall in love, marry.<br></p> <p>The tale has an unhappier classical cousin: that of Talos, the artificial man. Created by the divine smith, Hephaestus, Talos is often depicted as a bronze giant striding through the seas around Crete. Immensely strong, almost invulnerable, Talos renders all human might redundant.</p> <p>Skip forward two thousand years and we find Galatea and Talos dovetailing into one of the 1990s\u2019 most iconic science fiction films: Terminator 2: Judgment Day, James Cameron\u2019s masterpiece of action and exquisitely honed musculature. In the second half of the film, there\u2019s a quiet moment where Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s titular Terminator \u2013 an artificial killer reprogrammed to act as the perfect protector \u2013 is hanging out with his young protectee, John Connor.</p> <p>John\u2019s mother, Sarah, watches from a distance as the cyborg plays with the 10-year-old. Arnie has flipped from one polarity to the other: from perfect assassin to perfect playmate. </p> <p>\u201cIt was suddenly so clear,\u201d she says in voiceover. \u201cThe Terminator would never stop. It would never leave him, and it would never hurt him, never shout at him, or get drunk and hit him, or say it was too busy to spend time with him. It would always be there.

Or at least, we don\u2019t want to want these things. Our myths warn us about the weakness of human desire and judgment. To become entirely human, as in Pygmalion\u2019s tale, is one thing. But to supplant the human is quite another. Arnie is there to help humans do human things: save the world, blow stuff up, chase around in trucks and on motorbikes. Then, conveniently enough, he terminates himself.</p> <p>Myths themselves are seductive. They structure time and the world in ways we understand. They resonate. They are about human vulnerability and greatness; our fragility and hope. They are all about us \u2013 and, unfortunately, they have little to say about our current crop of technologies that isn\u2019t misleading in one way or another.</p> <p>For a start, the most tantalizing thing out there isn\u2019t technology at all. It\u2019s other people, served up ceaselessly for our delectation in the form of status updates, images, likes, tweets, blogs, news and numberless other fragments. We aren\u2019t so much being sucked in by screens as reaching through them to grasp algorithmic accounts of each other: miniature performances and unending encores. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Machinery doesn\u2019t wake up one morning and decide to destroy jobs.

Aren\u2019t people being made redundant by technology even as you read these words \u2013 neural networks learning to read legal case histories; cars and trucks learning to drive themselves; factories and farms automated to an unpeopled efficiency? Yes, and no. As the original Luddites knew in the 19th century, machinery doesn\u2019t wake up one morning and decide to destroy jobs. People and corporations do \u2013 and precisely how far the pursuit of productivity and profit is or isn\u2019t restrained is at root a political and ethical question. </p> <p>Above all, however, most technological myths mislead us via something so obvious as to be almost unexamined: the presence of human forms at their heart, locked in combat or embrace. The exquisite statue, the bronze warrior, the indestructible cyborg \u2013 the drama and pathos of each plays out on a resolutely individual scale. This is how myths work. They make us care by telling us a story about exemplary particularities. </p> <p> It\u2019s a framing epitomized not only by poems and movies, but also by the narratives of perkily soundtracked adverts. You sit down and switch your laptop on; you slip into your oh-so-smart car; you reach for your phone. \u201cWhat do you want to do today?\u201d asks the waiting software. \u201cWhat do you want to know, or buy, or consume?\u201d The second person singular is everywhere. You are empowered, you are enhanced, your mind and body extended in scope and power. Technology is judged by how fast it allows you to dash in pursuit of desire. </p> <p>This is the digital dream, for those who can afford it. Yet it barely begins to describe how the information revolution is transforming our world. The internet, the world wide web; search engines, social media; global telecommunications networks, mass manufacture, identical transistors stamped on silicon in their billions and trillions. The machine world is a network of networks. It girdles the human, beneath and beyond our attention, connecting not only person to person but also object to object through petabytes of shifting data. There is no interloping body or mind to square up against. The solicitous individualism depicted time and time again in myth and media is a consumerist category error. The \u201cyou\u201d that matters most, like its machine extensions, is strictly plural.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/20/humans-machines-technology-digital-age\">What does it mean to be human in the age of technology?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The author Thomas Rid puts it neatly in his recent book Rise of the Machines (2016). \u201cThe connective tissue of entire communities has become mechanized.

First, Copernicus and Galileo demonstrated that the Earth was not the unique, unmoving center of our universe. Like the other planets, it orbited the sun; and these planets in turn were orbited by their satellites, indifferent to human claims of exceptionalism. Second, Darwin showed us humanity not as the fixed pinnacle of a hierarchical creation, but as one among countless lifeforms produced by blind selection. Third, Freud suggested that we are far from transparent even to ourselves \u2013 that our self-knowledge is at best tenuous and provisional. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Copernicus, Galileo, Darwin, Freud: each revolution is a downward revision of our place in the order of things</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Each of these revolutions is in a sense a demotion: a revision downwards of our place in the order of things. We are neither the lords of creation nor even masters of our own minds. What\u2019s next to lose? The fourth revolution, Floridi suggests, is one in which we must surrender our claim to be the universe\u2019s sole site of analysis and insight. Our creations approach or exceed our capabilities in areas long believed to be uniquely human: deduction, recall, reasoning, pattern recognition, the processing of language, the modelling and prediction of the world.</p> <p>If you are still feeling mythologically inclined, this sequence of shocks looks somewhat like a bildungsroman \u2013 a novel of painfully won maturation.

  "<p>If you\u2019ve ever visited an iconic national park like Yellowstone, Yosemite or Glacier, your first glimpses of arresting, postcard-perfect vistas were probably framed by a car window. That\u2019s how I first glimpsed Yosemite\u2019s Half Dome. After driving through the tunnels on Big Oak Flat Road, the road curved and the valley came into view. Angels sang. I was so overwhelmed by that monolith\u2019s grandeur and beauty that I had to pull over onto the shoulder and have a good cry.</p> <p>Years later, I stuffed my backpack with supplies and headed out my front door, Yosemite bound once again. I walked 10 minutes to the nearest San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (<a href=\"https://www.bart.gov/\">Bart</a>) station, which I rode east, to the Richmond station, and transferred to Amtrak. I used the train\u2019s free Wi-Fi to get some work done during the scenic two-hour and 40-minute ride to Merced, California, where I waited a half hour for a Yosemite Area Regional Transportation System (Yarts) bus up to Yosemite, another two-hour trip.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/aug/24/10-least-visited-us-national-parks\">10 of the least-visited US national parks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In total, my fares were double what I\u2019d have paid in gas, but bus riders are exempt from the park\u2019s entrance fee ($20 then, $30 now). The trip took more than an hour longer than driving would have, though slogging through Bay Area traffic could have evened that scale. One less car in the crowded, summer-packed Yosemite Valley that day made an imperceptible difference to the park\u2019s clogged roads and parking lots. But once I was inside the park, the free park shuttles and my own two feet took me everywhere I wanted to go. I experienced zero road rage and could have wept over Half Dome to my heart\u2019s content without worrying about swerving off the road.</p> <p>One hundred years ago, former US president Woodrow Wilson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/national-parks-at-100\">signed the legislation that created the National Park Service</a> (<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/index.htm\">NPS</a>) to manage 35 parks and monuments. Since then, the number of national parks has swelled along with crowds. Back in 1916, a few hundred thousand people would visit those parks each year. But by the late 1990s, visitation to the hundreds of landmarks within the park system rose to around 280 million, and by last year it reached 307 million. The popularity of the country\u2019s national parks has risen along with the number of highways and privately-owned vehicles.</p> <p>Between the 1965 and 1985, visitation to the NPS grew 122%, and the crown jewels of our collectively-owned landscape started to suffer from congestion, which degraded air quality \u2013 not to mention the quality of the experience. </p> <p>Some parks, including Denali National Park in Alaska and Zion National Park in Utah, started to restrict vehicular access, requiring visitors to take shuttles through the park, due to safety issues or congestion problems, or to reduce impacts to wildlife. But many parks responded to increased traffic by building bigger parking lots. That has a smaller price tag, at least in the short term, than creating systems for alternative transportation, which national parks have struggled to pay for.</p> <p>The benefits of limiting cars to minimize environmental impact aren\u2019t straightforward, however, says Francesco Orsi, an assistant professor of geography at Kansas State University and the editor of<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=fQwtCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=nps+transportation+planning+guidebook&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mDvRHHKqy4&amp;sig=KEQXdvn9zvP9nSOkYg_d5814oQo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAjIqbxcbOAhUIw2MKHUrcDYIQ6AEIQDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=nps%20transpor\"> Sustainable Transportation in Natural and Protected Areas</a>. Cars may be a big source of air pollution and carbon emissions, but they also limit the number of people wearing out trails and trampling through areas with sensitive habitats.</p> <p>\u201cIn Rocky Mountain National Park, they introduced buses and realized they were bringing in more people,\u201d Orsi says. \u201cWith buses, there was more capacity and (that creates) more demand on the trail system. So they had to find a balance between buses and cars.\u201d</p> <p>During the next 100 years, Orsi says the biggest impact our cars will make to national parks won\u2019t come from the tailpipes. \u201cIn the future [thanks to electrification], cars won\u2019t emit carbon. The big issue is that cars occupy space.\u201d That means building parking lots on land that would otherwise remain wild and leave behind visual scars. Orsi has seen this in his native Italy. \u201cIn the Dolomites, when you climb a mountain, you look down and see an ocean of cars.\u201d</p> <p>In 2010, the Federal Transit Administration launched Transit in Parks, a granting program that directed $80m to transit programs for the NPS. This seeded some promising projects, but funding was axed in the 2012 federal transportation bill. This, and its own addled budget, led the NPS to rely more on state and municipal authorities, as well as private businesses, to develop and support public transit projects.</p> <p>The NPS has had mixed success trying to ease congestion while still making public lands accessible. Here, we profile three of the service\u2019s most promising programs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06db2cdc09525d0fa3a0a4288f83b3e929ee3edf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06db2cdc09525d0fa3a0a4288f83b3e929ee3edf/0_120_3342_2006/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Yosemite National Park YARTS bus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Yosemite National Park YARTS bus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerald Robinson/Yosemite Area Regional Transportation System</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Golden State success story</h2> <p>Yosemite Area Regional Transportation System (<a href=\"http://yarts.com/\">Yarts</a>) is a government agency funded mostly by the counties it serves and by Yosemite National Park \u2013 in fact, the park provides around 36% of Yarts\u2019 operating budget. Yarts, which passed its one-millionth rider mark in 2014, also has contracts with Amtrak and Greyhound, which many riders use to connect to the buses. Revenue from fares accounts for 18% of its budget. (A round trip between Merced and Yosemite is $25.)</p> <p>Businesses in the gateway communities near Yosemite also benefit from Yarts, says its manager Dick Whittington. \u201cWe have an excellent relationship with hotels. And the RV parks on Highway 120 are big Yarts promoters, because guests come in, hook up their RVs [to water, power and sewer lines] and then don\u2019t want to unhook them to drive up to Yosemite, so they take the bus. We also have folks who come on Amtrak, ride the bus to their hotel and then into the park the next day.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, Yarts launched a new summer route to Fresno, California\u2019s fifth largest city. With its international airport, the Fresno link opens up a direct transit route for visitors flying into the state. Even though it was a new service, Yarts picked up almost 700 people at the Fresno airport last summer.</p> <h2>Lessons from Yellowstone</h2> <p>Driving and traffic congestion weren\u2019t always part of the national park experience, says Jan Brown, the former executive director of the Yellowstone Business Partnership (YBP), a now dissolved nonprofit that worked to introduce the principles of sustainable business practices to the communities around Yellowstone National Park.</p> <p>When Yellowstone was founded in 1872, public transit \u2013 provided by a horseman and a coach \u2013 was the only way to see that park. Later, guests arrived via rail. But once cars took over the roads, they came to define access to public lands.</p> <p>In 2011, the YBP, along with seven different public transportation providers in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, launched a co-operative, dubbed Linx, to provide bus services into the park from surrounding communities. The project, launched with a $500,000 federal grant, envisioned shuttles every 20 minutes linking regional airports in Idaho Falls, Salt Lake, Bozeman and Billings to Yellowstone.</p> <p>\u201cThe Transit in Parks programs were controlled by the park service and needed their approval, but our idea was to not start a new public transit system \u2013 that was very important,\u201d says Brown. \u201cWhat we wanted to do was support [transportation] businesses all around the park.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2016/aug/24/yellowstone-tourism-animals-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5vxdg\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2658301\"            data-video-name=\"Animal jams and selfies: Yellowstone deals with record number of tourists \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57b205bbe4b0178756b5cf86\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/15/160810Yellowstonev2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/15/160810Yellowstonev2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/15/160810Yellowstonev2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2016/aug/24/yellowstone-tourism-animals-video\">Animal jams and selfies: Yellowstone deals with record number of tourists</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Linx provided rides from mid-June through September for three years. Single day tickets were $20, or $80 for a five-day pass. In 2012, Linx ran a pilot program, sponsored by New Belgium Brewing, in which bike racks were mounted on select buses. Many Linx users used the service as a shuttle, allowing them to undertake a long day hike or multi-day backpack trip and then return via bus.</p> <p>Steeped in debt and unable to find financial support, Linx, as well as the YBP, went under in 2014.</p> <p>Brown believes Linx may have been ahead of its time. She says mobile phone apps, which back in 2011 were more expensive and difficult to deploy, would have made scheduling and advertising the service far simpler. In the end, most Linx riders were park employees, not the tourists that the providers were targeting.</p> <p>\u201cWe had urged Yellowstone National Park to support our mobility plan,\u201d says Arthur Kull, who was president of Linx. \u201c[But former] Yellowstone Superintendent Dan Wenk refused to allocate any funds to our project.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2c2bfa91343f9ce6d6666abeb7b627f32ed7d20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2c2bfa91343f9ce6d6666abeb7b627f32ed7d20/0_0_1600_959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Acadia National Park\u2019s Island Explorer bus service.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Acadia National Park\u2019s Island Explorer bus service.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gregg TeHennepe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Maine\u2019s gold standard</h2> <p>For nearly two decades, the<a href=\"http://www.exploreacadia.com/\"> Island Explorer bus service </a>in Maine\u2019s Acadia National Park has provided some relief to the park\u2019s congestion problems while also linking tourists to hotels, restaurants and other businesses outside the park.</p> <p>Downeast Transportation, a private nonprofit, operates the Island Explorer. During its 1998 pilot year, the Island Explorer served park campgrounds and charged $2 fares. The next year, says general manager Paul Murphy, \u201cWe asked the Friends of Acadia [a park advocacy group] to do an experiment. We asked: what would happen if we removed fare?\u201d Padded with a $3,500 grant from the group, the bus trips became free and ridership grew by 600%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/22/climate-change-national-parks-threat\">Climate change will mean the end of national parks as we know them</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the onset, the service aimed to transport 1,000 passengers per day. Now, with a far wider route map and more busses, the Island Explorer regularly moves 5,000-6,000 people each day during the park\u2019s peak season. That number has reached 8,000 on busy days. By providing an alternative to driving, Downeast Transportation estimates that the service has replaced 2.3m vehicle trips and reduced 21,504 tons of greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>Acadia uses half of each park visitor\u2019s entry free to help the Island Explorer \u2013 the park provides more than 40% of the bus system\u2019s funding. The Federal Transit Authority\u2019s rural transit funds and the Maine Department of Transportation cover the second largest portion, followed by Maine-based outdoor gear seller LL Bean, which has sponsored the bus system with $4m over the years. Businesses outside the park that host bus stops also contribute. Plus, donation boxes inside the buses generate $50,000 each year.</p> <p>Tourists arriving via the airport at Bar Harbor, a quaint town just outside of Acadia, can jump on the Island Explorer right from the terminal, though the vast majority of out-of-towners drive to Acadia and then switch to the bus service, Murphy says.</p> <p>Tom Crikelair, a transportation planning consultant who helped develop the Island Explorer program, says there is no silver bullet to developing a sustainable transportation system.</p> <p>\u201cJust because it works here, you can\u2019t necessarily do the same thing elsewhere. It all depends on convenience: if you want someone to get out of their car, you\u2019ve got to give them something better than their car,\u201d Crikelair says.</p>",

Anyone here remember Tottenham Hotspur? Decent side, almost won the league last season, played the best football by a Spurs team since the 1980s. They were a breath of the fresh stuff. Yet nobody is talking about them this season, such is the slightly childish focus on all things new in the Premier League. </p> <p>That\u2019s probably a good thing for Spurs, who can go about their business quietly for the time being. Although the bar has been raised this season, there is every chance their superb young side - with a few carefully chosen additions like Victor Wanyama and Vincent Janssen - will challenge for the league again.</p> <p>This afternoon they meet Liverpool, who continue their August road trip: they will not play at Anfield until mid-September due of the expansion of the main stand. After high-scoring wins at Arsenal and Burton, and a high-possession defeat at Burnley, we don\u2019t really know what to expect from Liverpool. At their best they are perhaps the most scintillating team in the country; at their worst they are a gift to lovers of schadenfreude.</p> <p>They are nonetheless one of six potential title winners, seven if you count the actual champions, Leicester, which not many people have done. The upshot of that is there will be lots of Big Games (don\u2019t you dare call them six-pointers, don\u2019t you dare get me started on that) early in the season. This certainly falls into that category.</p> <p><strong>Kick off</strong> is at 12.30pm.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-27T11:54:30.343Z\">at 12.54pm BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>The UK is putting elephants at risk of extinction through its broken promises on the ivory trade, according to campaigners. Before the last election, the Conservative party pledged to shut down the UK\u2019s domestic ivory market: at the time 30,000 elephants a year were being slaughtered for their tusks. But no action has been taken.</p> <p>While bans on the international trade in ivory exist, a failure to observe similar measures at a national level is being exploited by criminal gangs who smuggle ivory into the UK, where it can be passed off as antique. Now, in the run-up to a major conference, <a href=\"https://secure.avaaz.org/en/global_ivory_ban_loc_en2/?pv=95\">more than 1.6 million people have signed a petition on the Avaaz activist website</a> calling for the world\u2019s domestic ivory markets to be closed down for good.</p> <p>\u201cThe government\u2019s broken promises to ban ivory sales in Britain are being paid for in the blood of African elephants,\u201d said Avaaz campaign director Bert Wander. \u201cAs one of the world\u2019s most vocal advocates against the illegal wildlife trade, the UK must now practise what it preaches. Otherwise, China and other ivory hotspots will see no reason to put in place the permanent ban on ivory we need to stop elephants being wiped from the face of the Earth.\u201d</p> <p>Avaaz hopes the petition will put pressure on politicians, wildlife experts and conservation groups attending next month\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cites.org\">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora</a> in Johannesburg, where they will consider a range of measures to protect endangered species.</p> <p>\u201cThe existence of these domestic markets definitely has had a negative impact on African elephant populations,\u201d said Susan Lieberman, vice-president of international policy at the Wildlife Conservation Society. \u201cSimply put, if it were illegal to sell ivory \u2013 whether in China, Japan, the US, or the UK \u2013 there would be far less incentive for traffickers and organised criminal syndicates to traffic ivory, making it much harder for them to launder illegal ivory, and giving far less incentive to poachers.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2016/apr/30/kenya-burns-largest-stockpile-of-ivory-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4tnvd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2496838\"            data-video-name=\"Kenya burns largest stockpile of ivory - video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP/ Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5724d0b3e4b0f300275c806a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/04/30/160430Ivory_KP-27847177_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/04/30/160430Ivory_KP-27847177.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/04/30/160430Ivory_KP-27847177_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11461808&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/04/30/160430Ivory_KP-27847177_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2016/apr/30/kenya-burns-largest-stockpile-of-ivory-video\">Kenya burns largest stockpile of ivory</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The Conservatives gave manifesto commitments to close down the trade in ivory in the UK in 2010 and 2015 and the government promoted a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/12/illegal-wildlife-trade-50-nations-london-summit\">conference on the illegal wildlife trade</a> in February 2014 which pushed for the measure.</p> <p>A large number of African nations have promised to outlaw domestic ivory markets, while France, the US and, crucially, China have introduced their own bans or are in the process of doing so.</p> <p>Between 2009 and 2014, 40% of all customs seizures in the UK were ivory items. Last year about 110kg of ivory was stopped at Heathrow alone. \u201cThe UK is really lagging behind,\u201d said Jonathan Baillie, conservation director at the Zoological Society of London. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to understand why exactly. We were in a very strong leadership role. There are some potential barriers to introduction, but the Americans seem to have been able to deal with all the issues.\u201d</p> <p>Ivory is prized for a variety of reasons. In Japan it is used to make family seals; in the Philippines it is used for religious artefacts. Baillie said elephants would be protected only if all nations observed a domestic ban. \u201cTo take the economic value out of ivory it really requires everyone to play ball. If you have a number of countries that don\u2019t go along with it, it really weakens the incentives for those nations to maintain their commitments.\u201d</p> <p>Lieberman said a UK ban would be symbolically important. \u201cI personally have had Chinese government officials say to me, \u2018Why should we close our markets, when we can find ivory very easily across London?\u2019 The UK needs to show it is serious about stopping poaching of elephants and trafficking in ivory.\u201d</p> <p>Under the ban, owners of ivory could hand it on to others but not sell it. There would be exceptions \u2013 such as the sale of particular antique instruments that use ivory.</p> <p>Experts say the ban is urgently needed. There are about 450,000 African elephants left. But 30,000 a year are being slaughtered. \u201cI worked in central-west Africa in 2001,\u201d Baillie said. \u201cIf I went back there would be less than half the number now than were there then. If we can close the international trade and the domestic markets there is going to be no reason for people to go in and kill these elephants.\u201d</p> <p>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the government was working on its pledge to implement a total ban on ivory sales. \u201cThe illegal wildlife trade is a global issue and will only be solved through global cooperation. That is why we continue to lead the international community to protect the world\u2019s most iconic wild animals and to stop the organised criminal networks behind this brutal and unnecessary trade.\u201d</p> <p>Lieberman conceded that prohibition was not a magic bullet. \u201cCertainly it won\u2019t stop smuggling 100%, into the UK or elsewhere, but if the UK closes its market it will be far harder for illegal ivory to be laundered as legal.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>As Darren Clarke uses this weekend to ponder his wildcard picks for the European team, with the announcement to be made at Wentworth on Tuesday, the nuances of Ryder Cup captaincy will play a part in his thinking.</p> <p>Clarke has one opportunity to enhance his status by presiding over a successful European tilt. For all the Northern Irishman and others in his position, past or future, can speak of legacy, how they are portrayed \u2013 be it lauded or dismissed as outright disaster \u2013 revolves around three intense days.</p> <p>This is especially pertinent in Clarke\u2019s circumstances. Were he a long-term captain, or a manager in other sports, he would have scope to plan meaningfully. Instead the former Open champion has been dealt a batch of nine automatic qualifiers who include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/21/ryder-cup-european-team-five-rookies\" title=\"\">five who will be making their Ryder Cup debuts at Hazeltine</a>. Many have already looked on with a passing nod of \u201cgood luck\u201d.</p> <p>Perhaps experience is overstated. In 2004, a Europe team including five rookies thumped the United States 18\u00bd to 9\u00bd at Oakland Hills. From that group, Ian Poulter was to emerge as a Ryder Cup talisman over a decade. \u201cRookies aren\u2019t what they used to be,\u201d Paul Casey, a Ryder Cup refusnik but educated onlooker, said this week. \u201cRookies aren\u2019t scared any more.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the received wisdom is Clarke is in tricky territory by taking so many players untested in this environment to an away match. There have inevitably been changes in European teams but a serious move away from the core who have delivered an outstanding recent run has glaring risk.</p> <p>With that in mind, Martin Kaymer and Lee Westwood are expected to receive the nod from Clarke. Westwood has impressively hauled himself into contention since the spring, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/24/lee-westwood-doubted-game-second-masters\" title=\"\">his tie for second at the Masters </a>sufficient to demonstrate he can still mix it with the best. Westwood\u2019s outstanding Ryder Cup record, added to popularity and compatibility with other players, means he should always have been worthy of selection if showing a modicum of form.</p> <p>Kaymer\u2019s run has been more of a slow burner. With the German playing so much in Europe this year there have been five top-10 finishes since mid-April but no scent of victory. Kaymer\u2019s intense focus on the Olympic Games probably was not appropriately rewarded by a share of 15th but the two-times major champion at least closed with a 66, continuing his fine form from the US PGA Championship. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/30/ryder-cup-2012-europe-comeback\" title=\"\">holing of that crucial, clinching putt at Medinah in 2012 </a>would never have been enough to secure Kaymer a 2016 place but that positive strand of history can only help.</p> <p>Beyond this, the fun starts. In a fair world, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/08/russell-knox-ryder-cup-hazeltine-pga-tour-travelers\" title=\"\">Russell Knox\u2019s victory at the Travelers Championship</a> this month would equal a pick. Knox won a WGC event before he was eligible for European qualification \u2013 and, to be fair, before he thought it attainable \u2013 but pressed home his candidature with a wonderful winning putt in Connecticut. Knox is ranked world No20, above Rafa Cabrero-Bello, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Andy Sullivan and Chris Wood, who have qualified for Hazeltine, plus Westwood and Kaymer.</p> <p>Knox\u2019s character means he is unlikely to express any annoyance but were any other debutant named he would have legitimate cause to do so. Clarke\u2019s opening rounds pairing with the in-form Thomas Pieters at the Made in Denmark event means the captain has a Belgian in his thoughts, which applies, likewise to Paul Lawrie, one of the vice-captains, having Soren Kjeldsen and Shane Lowry for company.</p> <p>Knox stands apart as a regular PGA Tour player, surely beneficial for an away Ryder Cup, and while Lowry is arguably the most gifted player of that group, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/aug/09/shane-lowry-wins-bridestone-invitational-akron-bubba-watson-justin-rose\" title=\"\">his WGC success at Akron is now more than a year old</a>.</p> <p>The danger to Knox lies in that supposedly crucial commodity of background. Luke Donald and Graeme McDowell, apparently from nowhere, have come into Clarke\u2019s view. Whatever else can be said of that duo\u2019s recent struggles, Clarke will know he can trust them in a Ryder Cup environment. Donald would have a particular point to prove after missing out two years ago.</p> <p>The under-appreciated name in this mix has been Francesco Molinari. The Italian, like Knox, has focused on the PGA Tour, and played for Europe in 2010 and 2012, although his own figures are hardly startling. For Molinari to feature, he surely had to fare better than a missed cut on Friday at the Barclays Championship in New York.</p> <p>Clarke\u2019s mind is not yet set. When it is, the importance of 2016 over anything else is understandable. The captain\u2019s reputation is at stake.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cPea green is what it looked like, I certainly wouldn\u2019t have wanted to dive in it,\u201d says Dawn Airey, as she remembers the strange case of the Olympic pools turning green in Rio earlier this month.</p> <p>The chief executive of Getty Images chuckles at the thought, but however unappealing the murky waters may have been for the swimmers, it gave Getty, the official picture agency of the Rio Olympics, a chance to show off the capabilities of its state-of-the-art underwater robotic cameras. </p> <p>\u201cIt did present a challenge, not one we expected, it was particularly unpleasant for photography. You want crystal clear water.\u201d</p> <p>For Airey, whose impressive CV includes top jobs at ITV, Channel 5, Sky and most recently Yahoo, the Olympics provided the first chance to really see her Getty colleagues in full flow since joining last October. </p> <p>Getty had 120 staff in Rio, 40 of them photographers, with every snapper given a 360\u00b0 camera to post extra images to Getty\u2019s site. That\u2019s as well as two underwater rigs and 20 other robotic set-ups across the Games.</p> <p>\u201cIt gave me a great opportunity to see our guys doing what they do in the most technically advanced Olympics ever from a photographic point of view,\u201d says Airey.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cbf15c98634a223d7013f886a15c6079c9276deb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbf15c98634a223d7013f886a15c6079c9276deb/0_322_4962_2977/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Phelps of the United States, Zhuhao Li of China and Joseph Schooling of Singapore compete in the men\u2019s 100m butterfly final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Phelps of the United States, Zhuhao Li of China and Joseph Schooling of Singapore compete in the men\u2019s 100m butterfly final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Pretty/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But with 1.5 trillion photos a year being taken (Airey\u2019s figure) - including runaway social media hits such as the \u201cworld\u2019s best selfie\u201d of Usain Bolt with Jessica Ennis-Hill and fellow heptathletes \u2013 is Getty\u2019s position as a photographic giant being eroded one shot at a time?</p> <p>\u201cThe defining image of the Games was probably Usain Bolt smiling down the lens of Cameron Spencer\u2019s camera,\u201d she says, referring to the image from the 100m semi-final likened to a smug Roadrunner taunting a hapless Wile E Coyote. </p> <p>\u201cWe are in the age of selfies, and that\u2019s great, but the fact that everyone has a phone doesn\u2019t necessarily make them a photographer. Just like me having a pen doesn\u2019t make me Shakespeare.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow did that shot happen? It wasn\u2019t a freak occurrence. It was a very skilled photographer slowing his shutter speed down and knowing at what point Bolt tends to surge ahead. That isn\u2019t luck, it is a high degree of skill and is one of the best Olympic shots of all time. That does not diminish user-generated photography of course.\u201d</p> <p>Airey, a sports fan who was a national judo champion at school, clearly relished her time teambuilding, networking and catching Olympic events on her five-day Rio trip.</p> <p>She caught Andy Murray\u2019s gold medal victory over Juan del Potro and in a match beforehand one of Getty\u2019s tennis photographers let her take a shot, for which she is credited in the online archive.</p> <p>\u201cI certainly won\u2019t get a royalty cheque,\u201d says Airey, whose relaxed demeanour belies the nicknames of Scarey Airey and Zulu Dawn she relished earlier in her career.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3732be11e9d810694158da62366f5651554d3c40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3732be11e9d810694158da62366f5651554d3c40/817_337_988_593/500.jpg\" alt=\"Dawn Airey (right) with US Olympian Kim Rhode at Rio 2106.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dawn Airey (right) with US Olympian Kim Rhode at Rio 2106.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Scarnici/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Prior to joining Getty Airey spent two-year transforming her TV roots into digital shoots as Yahoo\u2019s top European executive.

While the government\u2019s exploration of a potential privatisation this time round, she believes a sale will be a recurrent threat to the broadcaster.</p> <p>\u201cThe battle seems to be done and dusted and [C4 chief executive] David Abraham and team did a good job of seeing off the barbarians at the gate so to speak,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think that [threat] will come back again and again in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Airey has business challenges of her own to face with sporadic negative articles about the performance of parts of the business, particularly against rivals in what is called the mid-stock market such as Shutterstock, the rate at which the company goes through cash and its level of debt.</p> <p>Her response to the coverage is blunt: \u201cThat\u2019s just a load of bollocks. We do have a lot of debt. But every business should. The question is can you service it. Do we have enough cash to run the business? Yes we do.\u201d</p> <p>Airey\u2019s latest career incarnation couldn\u2019t seem further removed from TV where she has spent most of her career, yet in some ways she feels like she has gone full circle, harking back to her early years at the launch of Channel 5 in the 1990s where she infamously referred to its content as \u201cfootball, films and fucking\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think I will like being \u2018Getty\u2019s Dawn Airey\u2019 for a long time,\u201d she says. \u201cIt feels a lot more like TV than Yahoo for me. It\u2019s more creative. It feels in some ways like a big family. Like Channel 5 was which in some ways was when I was at my very best. </p> <p>\u201cIt is generally a fabulous business with great people. We are in rude health. We are everywhere. It is a pretty famous brand. I just want it to perhaps resonate more than what it does with consumers by getting Getty everywhere.\u201d</p>",

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin told the Guardian that the sale was \u201cpart of a 10b5 plan\u201d. Typically, executives and directors of public companies who want to sell their stock establish a written 10b5 plan to do so.

At the time, Devlin called the report \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/10/mylan-shares-slide-after-analysts-raise-concerns-over-pricing-strategies.html\">flawed</a>\u201d. </p> <p>The report came months after Marti Shkreli, former chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/21/entrepreneur-defends-raise-price-daraprim-drug\">increased prices</a> of HIV medicine Daraprim 5,000%. In his attempts to defend the decision, Shkreli become notorious and was even summoned before the US Congress to justify the price hike. </p> <p>As a result, in June, Maris of Wells Fargo noted that price hikes could lead to similar trouble for Mylan. </p> <p>\u201cWe believe that given the regulatory environment, these pricing actions could bring greater regulatory scrutiny and headline risk,\u201d he wrote in his analyst note. </p> <p>The price hikes of Mylan\u2019s products were covered by media outlets such as <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/10/mylan-shares-slide-after-analysts-raise-concerns-over-pricing-strategies.html\">CNBC</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-10/mylan-falls-as-wells-fargo-says-it-may-face-price-hike-scrutiny\">Bloomberg</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/recent-mylan-price-hikes-are-beacons-for-scrutiny-report-says\">FiercePharma</a>.

The last of the hikes took place after the Bloomberg story was published. Overall, since Mylan acquired Merck KGaA \u2013 the maker of EpiPen and 400 other products \u2013 its price had gone up 461%. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/24/epipen-ceo-hiked-prices-heather-bresch-mylan\">EpiPen CEO hiked prices on two dozen products and got a 671% pay raise</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On 8 July, Slate <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/moneybox/2016/07/epipen_costs_have_soared_450_percent_in_the_past_12_years_for_no_good_reason.html\">ran a story</a> with the headline: \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no reason why an EpiPen should cost $300\u201d. EpiPens are usually sold in packs of two for more than $600. </p> <p>A month after Slate\u2019s story was published, Bresch sold 100,200 of her shares. The transaction took place just weeks before more coverage of the EpiPen price hike caused the Mylan share price to drop from $49 on 18 August to $42.91 on 26 August. Bresch also received a 671% pay increase over the past nine years. She still holds 828,318 shares of Mylan.</p> <p>The trouble for Mylan is far from over. Earlier this week, Bresch was invited to testify before the US Senate to explain the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/24/epipen-ceo-hiked-prices-heather-bresch-mylan\">price hike</a>. Sarah Jessica Parker, the actor best known for Sex and the City, terminated her relationship with Mylan. Parker was previously a spokeswoman for the company, helping increase awareness of anaphylaxis \u2013 an allergic reaction that causes one\u2019s airways to swell and close. EpiPen quickly delivers a proper dose of epinephrine to those suffering from anaphylaxis. </p> <p>Similarly to Parker, Kelly Rudnicki was a paid spokeswoman for Mylan until she resigned this past Wednesday . For days, she was reading about the issue trying to make a decision. </p> <p>\u201cThere is absolutely no way that I could align myself with a company that is really not taking care of its consumers,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cIt was a very easy decision for me to make once I came to that conclusion.\u201d</p> <p>Rudnicki was working with Mylan for about two years, but had been a food allergy advocate and blogger for about 10 years. When she first heard that the company had increased EpiPen prices by 461%, she said she \u201cfelt like I was punched in the gut. I felt betrayed\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI believe the CEO must step down,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce that trust is broken, she really cannot lead this company.\u201d </p> <p>A mother of an allergic child, Rudnicki has been buying EpiPens for the past 13 years. Since she has a high deductible, sometimes they would be covered by insurance and sometimes they were not. </p> <p>There is no justification for the high prices, she said. </p> <p>On Thursday morning, Bresch <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/25/mylan-expands-epipen-cost-cutting-programs-after-charges-of-price-gouging.html\">went on CNBC</a> and in an interview said that one of the reasons why Mylan hiked EpiPen prices was because of the US healthcare system. </p> <p>\u201cI am hoping that this is an inflection point for this country,\u201d she said. \u201cOur healthcare is in crisis. It\u2019s no different than the mortgage financial crisis back in 2007.\u201d<br></p> <p>According to Bresch , the price is that much higher because it has to pass through four or five \u201chands\u201d such as retailers and pharmacy benefit managers before it gets to the patient at the counter. </p> <p>\u201cWhat Mylan takes from that, our net sales is $274, so $137 per pen,\u201d she said. </p> <p>As a result, on Thursday, Mylan announced that in addition to issuing $300 savings cards for consumers in need, it was also going to start selling EpiPens directly to consumers.</p> <p>Rudnicki said that coupons and other financial are essentially just a \u201cBand Aid\u201d for a very serious situation and that the company should decrease its prices. </p> <p>Tyrone Gayle, spokesman for the Clinton campaign, also called on the company to \u201cimmediately lower the overall price of EpiPens\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cDiscounts for selected customers without lowering the overall price of EpiPens are insufficient, because the excessive price will likely be passed on through higher insurance premiums,\u201d he said.</p>",

It was, McNuff assumed, her first big adventure - but by year five, the sheen had worn right off. \u201cI started to feel a bit caged by the rules and regulations. I wanted to feel passionate about what I was doing again and I had a big idea,\u201d she says.<br></p> <p>After nine months of full-time work combined with an exhausting weekend job working in a bike store, McNuff left corporate life to begin the challenge of cycling 11,000 miles through all 50 states of America \u2013 from Alaska to Hawaii \u2013 within six months.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d never felt so much like myself as on that trip \u2013 and subsequent ones,\u201d she says. \u201cRiding down the big road, wind everywhere, singing at the top of my lungs. I was so happy, creative and free.\u201d She felt like she had a purpose, and took time in each state to visit schools and talk to pupils, hoping to educate and inspire the next generation about the importance of sport and adventure.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The trip itself was, of course, full of challenges. But overall it was a delight \u2013 coming home was not easy. \u201cI had no idea about the post-adventure blues,\u201d says McNuff. \u201cIt was such a huge shock. The initial novelty of seeing friends and family fell away fast. I just felt so odd. So alien. On the trip I would been allowed to spread my wings so wide, but going back into an office everything was too narrow. I felt really uncomfortable.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Two weeks after cycling up the longest paved road ascent in the world \u2013 Mount Haleakala in Hawaii \u2013 McNuff found herself back in London lining up Powerpoint presentations. What had happened to her, she wondered? It was becoming very clear that this working environment was not sustainable; she wasn\u2019t really interested in marketing and another adventure was already playing on her mind. She wanted to run the length of New Zealand, a six-month trip even more ambitious than the previous one, particularly since McNuff suffered injuries from five kilometre runs three times per week.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5770e5f9e3ad72303ac2e11b4783a1463badc783\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5770e5f9e3ad72303ac2e11b4783a1463badc783/0_188_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cycling in minus 15c in Arkansas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cycling in minus 15c in Arkansas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: personal photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It took five months and a lot more saving, but McNuff\u2019s Antipodean adventure \u2013 1,911 miles along New Zealand\u2019s Te Araroa trail \u2013 began in January 2015. She was travelling alone for 148 days. \u201cIt was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d she says. \u201cI broke bits of my body, cried loads and experienced loneliness like I never have before. But I also reconnected with the person I was supposed to be.\u201d<br></p> <p>At the end of this very long run, McNuff returned to England where she sat in a coffee shop and placed Post-it notes around her with all the things she wanted to do in the next five years. Not one of them related to her supposed career. How could she possibly spend so much of her life doing something that held no appeal? She asked herself. Her plan to split her year down the middle between high-earning office work and intrepid trips abroad no longer seemed feasible.<br></p> <p>\u201cFinishing an adventure is like a breakup,\u201d McNuff explains. \u201cThe first stage is relief. Then there\u2019s hyperactivity \u2013 I could hardly sit still for the first two weeks afterwards \u2013 and then a period of high confidence and a desire to move forward.\u201d<br></p> <p>But then the depression hits. \u201cThis time it took around three months after returning home for McNuff to fully feel its impact: six weeks of uncontrollable crying (\u201ccycling down the Edgware Road with tears pouring down my face\u201d) feeling totally alone and like she didn\u2019t want to get out of bed. \u201cI had spent so long wishing for the challenge to be over, looking forward to the triumph at the end, but then I just felt lost. I had to process it all, realise that it was gone, accept it and grieve it.\u201d<br></p> <p>Only after experiencing the full impact of her adventures, with all the stress, elation and exhaustion that ensued, was McNuff able to move forward. In January this year she decided to carve out a different kind of life for herself.

Going into remote places and extreme situations changes a person, such as in Colorado where, during a huge flood, McNuff had to pull a couple out of a river after their car flipped off the road. \u201cPeople had died and lost their homes,\u201d she says. \u201cIt puts the panic, worry and anger that office workers bring into meetings into stark relief. I guess my adventures accelerated the emotional ageing process - now I have a much greater range of feelings and a better sense of perspective.\u201d<br></p> <p>But adventure doesn\u2019t always have to mean <em>epic, </em>as Mcnuff is keen to make clear. \u201cSome of my favourite trips have been only a few days long \u2013 like the time a friend and I tried to rollerblade 100 miles around Amsterdam, or when I decided to run the length of Hadrian\u2019s Wall dressed as a Roman soldier!\u201d This October, however, McNuff will be going big, with a bike ride across the Andes via as many peaks as possible (approximately 89,000 metres of ascent).</p> <p>Yet whatever your goal \u2013 be it humble or grandiose \u2013 be sure to ignore the patronising, negative types \u2013 the \u201cdream-dumpers\u201d who try to talk you out of your dreams or tell you they are impossible. \u201cDispense with what others might think of you, and remember this is your life,\u201d she advises. \u201cKnow that fear is an emotion to be embraced and understood, not one to shy away from.\u201d<br></p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>One day, when he was 25 years old, Park Sang-hak was strolling around a huge square in the North Korean port of Wonsan. It is a drab place, with just a few flags and painted propaganda posters providing splashes of colour. But, as a trusted party worker and the son of a top spy, Park had been given rare dispensation to travel to the city along the bumpy roads from the capital, Pyongyang, and he had made plans to see a friend from university.</p> <p>The pair talked animatedly as they walked around on that autumnal day in 1993. This was a break from the usual repetitive routine of life in the world\u2019s most repressive nation: ceaseless work broken by Monday political classes and Saturday self-criticism sessions. The square was packed as they mingled with men in spartan clothes and women with regulation hairstyles. They passed an imposing statue of Kim Il-sung, the state\u2019s founder, who landed in the city after its postwar liberation from Japan. Suddenly, they saw hundreds of leaflets raining down from the sky.</p> <p>\u201cThere were about 800 people there and just five security men, so I grabbed one and put it quickly in my pocket,\u201d recalls Park, now 48, showing me how fast he stuffed away the piece of paper as we chat over fruit in a Seoul cafe. His friend was too scared to do the same; they could have faced party expulsion, exile to the countryside, even execution. Later, they read the story on the leaflet about a family of defectors who had fled to South Korea, and looked with wonder at pictures of escaped women in bikinis on a beach.</p> <p>The flyer was sent by the South as part of a propaganda war being waged on both sides of the divided nation. Once, Park would have been sceptical about its message: he was from a privileged family and had been told since birth that his great leaders were wise, their nation the world\u2019s finest, that jealous enemies such as South Korea and the US sought to overthrow their glorious system. When, as a teenager, he discovered a neighbouring family had disappeared in the night, he was disturbed, but he accepted they must have done wrong.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/jul/03/pyongyang-holds-rally-in-honour-of-north-korean-leader-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4njmj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2592937\"            data-video-name=\"Pyongyang holds rally in honour of North Korean leader \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5778ef95e4b0794b412fbf37\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/07/03/160793nkorea_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317612&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317612&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317612&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317612&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/jul/03/pyongyang-holds-rally-in-honour-of-north-korean-leader-video\">Pyongyang holds rally in honour of North Korean leader</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>But first Park\u2019s grandmother, on a rare visit from Japan, told him how much happier people seemed in other places, although he warned her against spreading rumours about the regime. Then fellow students, chosen to study in communist countries, whispered stories about life outside. \u201cOne had been to Berlin, where he had access to the west. I was shocked to learn some people had free access, since, if you travelled to South Korea and were caught, you went to a concentration camp. And I discovered in Europe people did not have weekly self-evaluation sessions [where citizens must confess to \u2018wrongdoings\u2019], which were a source of great stress for our people.\u201d</p> <p>Yet, as a young bureaucrat rising in the system, Park had no desire to leave; not until one day in the summer of 1999, when he received a message from a Chinese man. He had come on behalf of Park\u2019s father, who was working in Japan for the government. His father had realised the family were in danger; he wanted them to leave. \u201cThis was the moment my dreams crashed,\u201d Park says. \u201cI was sad and scared, but I knew I had no choice.\u201d As entire families are held culpable for offences, he says, \u201cIf I stayed, I would be sent to a prison camp, since my father was not coming back.\u201d</p> <p>His father had discovered the horrific scale of famine in North Korea and feared fresh purges. Huge numbers had starved to death due to the loss of financial aid after the collapse of the Soviet Union, followed by a series of natural disasters. But even to say the word \u201cfamine\u201d was a crime, because it implied state failure. Park, suspecting a trap, demanded proof that the message was genuine, asking for photographs of his father. This took two months to arrange, \u201cbut felt like 20 years\u201d. A week later, he bribed a border guard to defect across the Yalu river to China with his mother, brother and sister.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b254e6e542f815d213fd3a0d5a6120515d17878\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b254e6e542f815d213fd3a0d5a6120515d17878/0_1672_4002_4328/925.jpg\" alt=\"Park Sang-hak portrait\" width=\"925\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I was sad and scared, but I knew I had no choice\u2019: Park Sang-hak fled after his father defected to Japan and sent news home about the scale of famine in North Korea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jun Michael Park/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the first weeks of a new century, he arrived in Seoul, aged 32, to start his new life. He quickly found a job in a university\u2019s technology department, where he was able to use his engineering skills. But many defectors do not integrate so easily. Often, they struggle to settle in a world they find so strange, with its personal freedoms and paralysing choice. They are, after all, emerging from an Orwellian land where life is determined by a rigid hierarchy dependent upon family history, where the state controls everything under a despotic dynasty that has ruled though three generations since 1948.</p> <p>Today, this diminutive man dedicates his life to bringing down the brutal regime that brainwashed him and 25 million fellow citizens. Park quit his job in 2003 after learning his fiancee had been beaten so badly following his escape that she was left unrecognisable, that his two uncles had been tortured to death and that his teenage cousins were reduced to street begging. \u201cI had to do something,\u201d he says. \u201cI was mad that these innocent people had been tortured and killed.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Park - dubbed 'enemy zero' - has survived an assassination attempt by an agent armed with a torch that fired bullets</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Park does not fight with bombs and bullets, but with flyers such as the one that once floated down beside him. This year, he has dispatched 2m leaflets attacking the dictatorship in homemade balloons sent across the barbed-wire border. The leaflets are sent in packages alongside dollars, declarations of human rights, booklets about South Korea, sweets, soap operas and even comic films such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/12/the-interview-review-stoned-anally-fixated-funny\">The Interview</a> that ridicule North Korea\u2019s leadership. Park believes that information can break down the walls of the world\u2019s toughest totalitarian state and that truth can free citizens from their cocoon of total censorship.</p> <p>\u201cAll defectors ask the same question: how could our country lie so completely to us?\u201d he says when we meet again two days later. It is a cloudy July night and we are driving to Gimpo, by the North Korean border, so he can send over 10 balloons, 150,000 leaflets, $2,000 (\u00a31,500) in cash and a cartoon banner mocking \u201csupreme leader\u201d Kim Jong-un. Park\u2019s team \u2013 comprising his wife, his brother and his sister-in-law \u2013 work silently but systematically as they fill agricultural tubes with hydrogen, then release them with dangling parcels attached. \u201cObviously, we have no idea how many get in,\u201d Park says, \u201cbut at least there is no risk to people smuggling the information in.\u201d</p> <p>Watching the balloons disappear into the night, it is hard not to think that these are flimsy weapons with which to fight the maverick nuclear power that lies a mile north. Yet Park\u2019s missions seem to have stung North Korea. He has been named \u201cEnemy Zero\u201d. Five years ago, he survived an assassination attempt by an agent armed with two poison-tipped pens and a torch that fired bullets. The would-be killer asked to meet, but the police went in his place; now Park has permanent bodyguards. Missiles have been fired back over the border in response to his balloon launches, and at times of tension South Korea has deployed the police to prevent his efforts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25ebded0e11760e944d3d26c92b15af4c747fb6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25ebded0e11760e944d3d26c92b15af4c747fb6c/0_0_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"North Korea banner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Park launches a banner across the border, which reads: \u2018Humanity condemns Kim Jung-un, who squeezes blood out of the people and fires Musudan ballistic missiles.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jun Michael Park/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Park is far from alone. Dozens more defectors, dismayed by international inertia towards a dictatorship that enslaved an entire population for seven decades, are trying to topple tyranny with similar tactics. Aided by non-profit organisations such as the New York-based <a href=\"https://humanrightsfoundation.org\">Human Rights Foundation</a>, activists are using drones to send memory sticks from China loaded with books, encyclopedias and films. Others bribe border guards or use boats and fishermen to send banned data, documentaries and radios.</p> <p>The risks are high: three women were executed after being caught circulating a South Korean drama about a defector last November. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/kim-jong-un\">Kim Jong\u2011un</a> has cracked down hard to consolidate his position since becoming leader five years ago, and only two of the other seven people who stood beside his father\u2019s coffin are still thought to be alive. He has toughened border controls, warning that people who aid illegal crossings face the death penalty and offering rewards for soldiers who stop them. Those with cash and luck can still get through, but in the past two years alone the cost has doubled to $14,000 (\u00a311,000).</p> <p>In such a closed culture, even the most banal items can seem revolutionary. One prominent defector told me how watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/05/titanic-review\">Titanic</a> made her realise the restrictive nature of North Korea and the real meaning of love. Another described being transfixed by Chinese television commercials for products she had never seen before, such as bottled water. A third man told me how he smuggled in DVDs of Desperate Housewives \u2013 its glossy view of life in the US runs counter to the official line. A fourth was fascinated by Jane Eyre, so different from the censored version shorn of any sexual frisson or societal critiques.</p> <p>For five years, Kim Heung-kwang was among the party cadres seeking to stem the flow of such seditious material. A computer-science professor at Hamhung University, he was recruited to join the state censorship team and study seized electronic devices. He went on searches, took bribes from terrified families and confiscated \u201ccapitalist\u201d materials. Afterwards, he would read captured books and watch banned films at his leisure, then lend them to friends \u2013 until the day he was denounced in 2003. He was tortured, stripped of his post and sent to work on a farm. Thanks to his wealth, however, he was able to flee the country a year later.</p> <p>Arriving in South Korea, Kim sought to subvert the system he had once followed so fervently by setting up a group of intellectual defectors. He made videos, such as one showing the inside of a bookshop that told viewers to look at the number of volumes on sale; another featured taps with hot and cold water, so rare north of the border. He loaded them on to \u201cstealth\u201d memory sticks, designed to seem empty if checked by officials, along with books and essays. Thousands were sent through secret smuggling pipelines that date back to the deadly famine two decades ago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e48b49cdfb395c60ea4dc1640575460e4eae0f78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e48b49cdfb395c60ea4dc1640575460e4eae0f78/0_380_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kim Heung-kwang\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former party cadre Kim Heung-kwang served in North Korea\u2019s cyber unit, but fled after being denounced.

Her family were able to use their connections to get her out after a year, claiming that she suffered a severe illness. They smuggled her to China as soon as she was released, but the broker they paid to get her over the border sold her as a slave. The young woman was sent to the countryside, forced to work in fields and barely fed before escaping months later for South Korea.</p> <p>Now Jung has joined the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean_People%27s_Liberation_Front\">North Korean People\u2019s Liberation Front</a>, a quasi-military group in the South, waging information war against the Kim regime and preparing for its collapse.

After hearing that a South Korean family was offering a $10,000 reward for contact with a kidnapped man, he searched the North to find him, successfully. But when he took the man to China to claim his reward, the family held a press conference and revealed publicly what Choi had done. \u201cThe regime ordered my execution,\u201d Choi says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go back.\u201d Two years ago, he survived an attempt on his life by a female agent posing as a defector.</p> <p>We speak in the group\u2019s Seoul headquarters, a nondescript office with its logo on the wall and so many pairs of army boots under the table I have to push back my chair to sit down.

Finding out what the government had been doing changed my life. That\u2019s why I work so hard to get information in.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>More than two-thirds of the 28,000 defectors in South Korea are women, most of whom endured terrible traumas after fleeing. Many others are trapped in China, forced into marriage or slave labour, at risk of repatriation if caught. If they are sent back, they face abuse from prison guards or are sent to work in mines or political camps. Suicide rates are high among defectors, even in the South. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34710403\">Official figures indicate that one in seven defector deaths are suicides</a> \u2013 a legacy of abuse, the impact on family members left behind and the struggle to survive in a free society.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even if women in North Korea are sexually abused or raped, they do not know that these are violations of their rights</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This inspired <a href=\"http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/issues/2016/04/178_203015.html\">Lee So-yeon</a>, 40, to fight for fellow North Korean female defectors. A former soldier, Lee worked as a cleaner after escaping, before pursuing a degree with the aim of turning her personal pain into action against the men behind atrocities. Now she runs a human rights group making videos in which abuse victims tell their stories, accusing high-ranking assailants and detailing locations and dates of attacks. These are loaded on to USB sticks with information about women\u2019s rights, then smuggled into North Korea and scattered on the ground in public places.</p> <p>When we meet, Lee shows me a leopardskin makeup bag with a sly smile. Inside are several freshly smuggled North Korean mobile phones that contain pictures of people watching banned content. Already this year, her New Korea Women\u2019s Union, which also helps new arrivals settle, has sent more than 1,200 memory sticks north. \u201cWe accuse specific offenders of carrying out sexual offences,\u201d she says. \u201cThe videos tell them they will be subjected to punishment after reunification.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1168fb0a65c590f3bb2de52be3f879a8977539b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1168fb0a65c590f3bb2de52be3f879a8977539b3/0_1925_4002_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lee So-yeon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee So-yeon, head of the New Korea Women\u2019s Union, which helps female defectors settle in the South.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jun Michael Park/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of her key challenges is to explain basic human rights. \u201cThe big problem with women in North Korea is that even when they are sexually abused [or] raped or their rights are violated, they do not know these are violations. They are really emotionally damaged. Then, when defecting, they are often put through more trauma \u2013 and because they do not know these things are wrong, they suffer badly from depression.\u201d</p> <p>Lee\u2019s own story is typical. She enlisted for the army after leaving school. Famine was starting to bite: corpses littered the streets and the government stopped supplying free food to citizens. Soldiers\u2019 rations were cut in half; some resorted to stealing from villagers.</p> <p>Lee served for a decade; discharge was not an option. There was widespread sexual abuse. \u201cOne company commander had 120 female soldiers under his command and he raped 30 of them,\u201d says Lee. Was it her unit? \u201cYes,\u201d she replies. \u201cIn North Korea, there is a form of social stigma, so if a woman were to step up and say: \u2018I was sexually abused,\u2019 she would be the one blamed. And, because power was so prized, lower ranks could not step up over such matters.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Lee never doubted the system. She had seen leaflets sent from the south, but she dismissed them as psychological warfare. \u201cWe were trained all our lives to worship the Kim regime. Even when people were dying all around me, I never thought the leaders were the problem. I just wondered if I was going to die.\u201d</p> <p>After finally being discharged in 2001, she ended up selling black-market goods near the Chinese border. Buyers seeking items from abroad would ask for something \u201cfun\u201d. Listening to banned radio, watching foreign films and talking to people who had crossed the border, she began to learn about the outside world and slowly understand the scale of state duplicity. \u201cOne time I heard a radio broadcast with a defector woman talking about what her life was like in South Korea. That was when I got the desire to leave.\u201d</p> <p>Lee\u2019s first attempt at escape in 2006 ended in failure. She was caught, beaten and sent to prison for a year of re-education. Two years later, she tried again. After bribing a border guard with $500 (\u00a3380), she was successful. She spent six months in China, hiding until she could find a broker to take her to South Korea. She tells me she had bad experiences in China that she cannot bear to talk about.</p> <p>Many defectors are badly scarred by their experiences, especially the children. One teacher tells me they struggle to cope with simple things, such as seeing pupils talk back to teachers, or even seeing pizza for the first time. \u201cThe other day, we played a couple of North Korean songs and they reacted very badly. They still suffer such trauma,\u201d the teacher says.</p> <p>Yet young South Koreans show surprisingly little interest in their cause. One poll at a Seoul university found that eight out of 10 students had never met a defector, although many refugees hide their backgrounds. \u201cThe youth in South Korea today show total apathy towards their brothers and sisters in North Korea,\u201d says Cho Myung-chul, the first defector to become a South Korean MP. \u201cIf this lack of awareness and interest is not addressed, our society is doomed.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I saw a public execution aged seven, the victim's brains exploding with machine-gun fire. For us that was normal life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His government has passed a human rights act, after more than a decade of fierce debate, that will log atrocities and fund local groups. But it is a polarising issue. Two years ago, one far-left group of five MPs was disbanded by a court after accusations of pro-North activities. For many years following the famine, liberal South Korean governments pursued a \u201csunshine policy\u201d of aid and engagement with the North (technically, the two nations remain at war: when conflict ended in 1953, they merely signed a truce). The past two South Korean presidents, both on the right, have taken a tougher line, demanding an end to the North\u2019s sabre-rattling and nuclear aggression.</p> <p>South Korea sees reunification as a core policy, with a special government ministry and programmes to assist defectors. But many are sceptical about the practicalities, especially given the growing economic disparity between Asia\u2019s fourth biggest economy and its poor, isolated neighbour. \u201cWe are not going to war,\u201d says Lee Jung-hoon, South Korea\u2019s ambassador for human rights, who supports defector activism. \u201cThe change has to come from within. So, they have to hear information. They need to understand the situation outside their walls.\u201d</p> <p>The efforts of defectors to subvert a state that once controlled them seem to be having an impact. A leaked North Korean security report from September 2014 revealed that \u201cinappropriate recordings and propaganda publications\u201d were on the rise, with mobile phones proving difficult to control. Citizens were ordered to disable Bluetooth on phones to stop data transfers, and searches have been increased in schools, factories and offices. One school was singled out for praise after insisting on daily reports from all students and staff to prevent suspicious activities such as \u201cwatching and circulating illegal content\u201d.</p> <p>But these attempts to empower citizens can do only so much: the key to the disintegration of the regime can come only from China, which supports Pyongyang as a buffer against the west.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Perhaps the most haunting story of escape and defection I hear is from Hyeonseo Lee, whose gripping biography <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/girl-with-seven-names.html\">The Girl With Seven Names</a> has become a global bestseller. \u201cI saw a public execution aged seven, the victim\u2019s brains exploding from machine-gun fire,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople cannot believe how these things happen, but for us that was normal life.

When her family\u2019s home burned down following an accident, her father ran back to grab their most precious possessions: portraits of Kim Jong\u2011il and Kim Il-sung. Without them, even in such circumstances, the family might have been carted off to prison \u2013 all families must display them in their homes.</p> <p>She crossed an icy river the following year to reach China and her mother sent a message telling her not to return. Lee spent years underground, during which she was kidnapped, narrowly escaped being forced into a brothel and survived police interrogation by pretending to be Chinese. Eventually, she reached South Korea \u2013 then, 11 years after she last saw her family, returned to the border on a daring, successful mission to smuggle her mother and brother across the border. Her father had died several years earlier, after falling out of favour with the regime and facing interrogation and beatings.</p> <p>I first meet her at dinner with a dozen other people. She arrives late, laughs a lot and generally lights up the room. Yet, talking alone the next day in a cake shop, Lee confesses her struggles, that she keeps busy to avoid awful memories. \u201cWhen I meet people, I forget the pain. I want to keep positive and show that North Koreans can be positive people. But when I am on my own, I think about the past and it gives me more trauma.\u201d Sometimes she cries at her computer; even sympathetic messages on social media remind her that she is a victim. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to enjoy your life,\u201d she says. \u201cKeeping busy is my escape.\u201d</p> <p>She believes it is her duty to spread the word about \u201cthis alien life\u201d. She plans to send back videos of her success as an inspiration to others. \u201cMany female defectors are successful. It can be difficult to adjust, but this is still better than staying in hell.

But Narcos always had an ace up its sleeve. There are criminals. And then there is Pablo Escobar.</p> <p>If fictional, Escobar\u2019s story would seem absurd.

Escobar\u2019s Medell\u00edn drug cartel was responsible for 80% of the global cocaine trade, raking in such colossal quantities of money that it spent $2,500 a month just on rubber bands to bunch banknotes together. Making money faster than he could launder it, Escobar allegedly buried it in barrels. Rumours of immense stashes persist to this day. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/sep/15/full-immersion-tv-is-narcos-too-intense-to-binge-watch-netflix\">Full-immersion TV \u2013 is Narcos too intense to binge-watch?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Losses of $2.1bn a year, due to water damage or rats eating the bank notes, <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/pablo-escobar-and-rubber-bands-2015-9\">were written off as acceptable</a>, because such numbers were a mere drop in the ocean.

The problem was, Moura didn\u2019t speak Spanish. When playing Escobar in a show in which half the dialogue is Spanish, this was a concern. So Moura spent months away from his family in Medell\u00edn on a Spanish-language course. Worried that he didn\u2019t look like the pot-bellied Pablo, he piled on 40lbs (\u201cYou just eat delicious things.

Escobar had girls, cars, planes, houses and status. But, far from glamorising it, we see the grimy depths he had to plunder to get them, and how easily they\u2019re lost. No one could ever say this is a tale preaching a moral that crime pays. Season two deals with Escobar on the run: paranoid, cornered, hunted. Any residual glamour is gone. For obvious reasons, there will not be a third season, at least not in the current guise. Most people know exactly how Escobar\u2019s story ends, and Narcos finishes in the very same way, right down to using the same building where it happened.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/aug/22/tv-series-film-colombia-drugs-kingpin-pablo-escobar\">Myth and fact mix in summer of Escobar as narco king\u2019s life hits the screen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Escobar of Narcos is every bit as antiheroic as Walter White or Tony Soprano, and making you invested in him in a similar way to those layered creations is probably the show\u2019s biggest achievement.

  "<p>Last Christmas Ian Dyson got a call from his bank. Was he really in a Travelodge, ordering takeaway pizzas? No, was his answer, he was at home with his family. Like millions of others, Dyson had fallen victim to card fraudsters stealing from his account. But Dyson is not like everyone else \u2013 he is the commissioner of the City of London police, with the job of protecting not just London but the whole country from fraud. And the depressing reality is, like so many other frauds, the criminals got away with it.</p> <p>Dyson is disarmingly honest about the explosion in online fraud and cybercrime, and what realistically the police can do about it. \u201cEvery month Action Fraud [the national fraud reporting service] receives 40,000 reports, half a million a year, and we know from the ONS stats that\u2019s only a small percentage of what is going on. There were 3.8 million frauds and two million cyber offences. You cannot enforce your way out of this. It\u2019s physically impossible.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s partly because the perpetrators are abroad, with around half of all cybercrimes reported to Action Fraud originating overseas, says Dyson, citing Indian call centres and Russian and Ukrainian websites. The City of London police have a specialist officer permanently stationed in Wall Street, and worked with the Spanish police to swoop on 110 conmen operating a \u201cboiler room\u201d fraud targeting elderly investors.</p> <p>But Russia? Do the London police receive any help from their counterparts in Moscow? \u201cNo, not at all. Ukraine is limited too. You\u2019ll be aware of the limitations of some foreign jurisdictions.\u201d</p> <p>Another limitation is budgets. \u201cPolicing has taken a 20% hit in its budget so I\u2019ve got to do what I can with what I\u2019ve got,\u201d he says, while noting that virtually everyone else in the public sector has faced similar cuts.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to be realistic with the volumes [of crimes] you\u2019ve got, [and] about the global nature of the crime issue. I cannot possibly sit here and say I am going to investigate every crime. You can\u2019t. But policing has never investigated every crime.\u201d</p> <p>The 40,000 reports to Action Fraud every month are whittled down to ones where the police think there are \u201cactionable leads\u201d. Some go up to the National Crime Agency or the Serious Fraud Office, some are pushed out to the other 43 police forces across the UK, while the City of London police tackle the rest.</p> <p>\u201cThere are 700 cases the City of London police are investigating at the moment. That\u2019s me rather than ones disseminated to other forces. In the top 10 there is about half a billion pounds worth of fraud being investigated.\u201d</p> <p>What he dubs \u201cCEO fraud\u201d is the latest online crime wave City of London police are facing. It\u2019s when a junior person in the finance department of a big company receives an email from the chief executive officer of the firm, asking him or her to move money from one account to another. The email is fake; somehow the fraudsters have hijacked the boss\u2019s email account, or created one that is near identical.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are 700 cases the City of London police are investigating at the moment</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cOne major company lost three lots of \u00a3250,000 this way,\u201d says Dyson, noting that the culture in some big businesses is such that junior staff are too nervous about confronting their bosses when they receive an email which appears to be from them.</p> <p>Dyson notes that the other worrying online crime wave is \u201cmandate fraud\u201d. You receive an email from your builder, who\u2019s doing your extension, politely telling you he has changed his bank account details, and could the next \u00a320,000 payment for the extension go into this account? Again, the email has been hijacked, and the householder hands over their life savings \u2013 never to be seen again, as banks do not take responsibility. Guardian Money has highlighted numerous sad tales of how people have been conned this way.</p> <p>Have online fraudsters caught the police napping? Did we put bobbies on the beat when we should have been investing in fighting online fraud? In a frank admission, Dyson says: \u201cTo be honest, who\u2019d hold up a bank these days? Who would rob a bank now when you can make it all online in seconds?\u201d His office is just yards from the Bank of England, yet about the only robberies he sees are of betting shops, one of the last major cash-handling businesses around.</p> <p>He acknowledges that the public think that when they report an online crime, nothing seems to happen. \u201cThere is a public perception that PC Plod is losing the war against these highly sophisticated cybercriminals. It\u2019s a perception I\u2019m trying to address.</p> <p>\u201cLast year 180,000 websites, phonelines and bank accounts involved in fraud were closed down following police intelligence. So disruption is a big thing\u2026 Your report, combined with hundreds of others could lead us to close down that website and prevent people from becoming victims of fraud. While you might not get your money back, it will go at least some way to stopping others [from being a victim].\u201d</p> <p>Disruption is a word Dyson uses a lot. He reckons the best approach for his force is to gain intelligence from the public and other government agencies, and use that to intervene before more victims are conned. It\u2019s why he\u2019s investing heavily in a new IBM project for Action Fraud that should turn it into the world\u2019s most sophisticated anti-fraud intelligence system in the world. The quicker the police can see the signs, the more rapidly they are able to respond, he says.</p> <p>But the public have to do more: \u201cThe public have to shift their mindset around crime. The public have to understand we cannot enforce our way out of this, [given] the volume of crime, the fact that it is global and happening so fast, and that money can be moved so quickly. It has to be about prevention and protection.\u201d</p> <p>Don\u2019t use \u201cpassword\u201d as your password, he says. If that email arrives asking you to pay the money into another account, ring the builder, he adds. There are many, many more simple measures the public can take, he insists. In September, the government will begin a public information campaign, which Dyson says will evoke the message of the 1970s \u201cclunk-click, every trip\u201d campaign to get the public to use seatbelts in cars. We need the same thinking when it comes to transacting online, he says.</p> <p>But shouldn\u2019t the banks be doing more? Can the public really protect themselves from genius hackers determined to break into their accounts?</p> <p>Dyson is reluctant to criticise the big banks, though he says insurance companies have a much better record than high-street banks at cooperating in fighting fraud. The insurers have paid for 35 police officers in the City of London force alone to battle fake insurance claims and have had a string of prosecution successes.</p> <p>He would like the banks to be rather more intelligent when an elderly customer walks into a branch and demands to withdraw nearly all their savings when they have never taken out more than \u00a3100 before in one go. It\u2019s usually because they are being conned.</p> <p>Banks may often fail to report a fraud, in part because of the odd way in which crime is recorded. When Dyson\u2019s own card details were stolen, he was fully compensated by the bank. That means, according to Home Office rules, that the bank was the victim of the crime, not Dyson. \u201cIt\u2019s something we are talking to the Home Office about,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05ef38aafe153279c1860221bf1451a732739ba2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05ef38aafe153279c1860221bf1451a732739ba2/0_249_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Insurance companies have a much better record than high-street banks at cooperating in fighting fraud.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Insurance companies have a much better record than high-street banks at cooperating in fighting fraud.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Critics say that police fraud-busters are just not technically competent and resourced to catch cybercriminals. Dyson bridles: \u201cI\u2019d like to disabuse anyone of the view that they are all smart computer geeks, the archetypal spotted teenager hacking into US military computers. They are not. You have some people who are business people who before the internet would have been conning people out of investments. They are doing the same now but are doing it online. Then you have the people with a slightly smarter mate who have found a quick way to make money.\u201d</p> <p>The boiler room criminals in Spain are the type who were breaking into cars before the advent of the internet, he says. But in 33 years of policing, he says criminals are changing. They used to specialise in a line of business \u2013 armed robberies, drug dealing, etc. Now, Dyson says, everybody tries a bit of everything.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the police have their own geeks. Dyson says the City of London force have staff seconded to them from Google and Microsoft whose internet expertise is a match for any cybercriminal in Russia: \u201cMy guys will understand the forensic footprint of these crimes in the same way detectives are aware of forensic opportunities at the scene of a burglary.\u201d</p> <p>He is proud of his force\u2019s work to fend off pension fraud, which was widely expected to balloon in the wake of the new pension freedoms, but has so far been suppressed by the police working with the pension providers. The force was also instrumental in stopping BT from keeping lines open after a phone is put down, a frequent tactic used by fraudsters to convince people who called back that they were speaking to their bank.</p> <p>More money would help, Dyson says. For every pound invested in fighting fraud \u201cwe are preventing about \u00a360 worth of fraud\u201d. Meanwhile he\u2019s behind a pilot project in which private law firms will be hired by police to help seize the proceeds of crime and repay victims earlier.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re an innovative police force,\u201d he says. \u201cThe investment in the last 10 years was in neighbourhood policing and the visibility of police officers. We are shifting, in fairness, policing is shifting to deal with online.\u201d</p> <p>Unfortunately, as he looks out of his offices over the towers of London, while fighting fraud fills much of his time, there is another more serious threat. \u201cMy number one priority at the moment is counter-terrorism. We are quite a target-rich environment.\u201d</p> <h2>How to protect yourself <br></h2> <p>There were more than 5.8m incidents of cybercrime in the past year, enough to nearly double the headline crime rate in England and Wales, <em>writes Patrick Collinson.</em></p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said last month that one in 10 adults have been victims of cybercrime and online fraud over the previous year in the first official estimate of the scale of scams, virus attacks, thefts of bank details and other offences. An initial ONS estimate in October last year put the annual figure at 3.8m, or 40% of all crimes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/fraud_breakdown-zip/giv-31075ozknd7eRwW63/\" data-alt=\"fraud incidents\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/fraud_breakdown-zip/giv-31075ozknd7eRwW63/\">fraud incidents</a> </figure>  <p>Costing an estimated \u00a3193bn a year, cybercrime is nearly as big as all other crime, such as home burglary, car thefts and violence against the person. The ONS added that the chance of being a victim is the same regardless of social class or whether you live in a deprived or affluent, urban or rural area.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the figures for crime excluding online offences dropped in the year, falling by 6%. The long-term trends in traditional crimes such as burglary, car thefts and criminal damage showed that the fall in crime since its 1995 peak had slowed down since 2005. The survey found there had been no change in the overall level of violent crime compared with the previous year.</p> <p>So what are the easy steps to protect yourself from online crime that Commissioner Ian Dyson recommends?</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Never disclose security details, such as your pin or full banking password</strong><br>Banks and other trusted organisations will never ask you for these in an email, on the phone, by text or in writing. Before you share anything with anyone, pause to consider what you\u2019re being asked for and question why they need it. Unless you\u2019re 100% sure who you\u2019re talking to, don\u2019t disclose any personal or financial details.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Don\u2019t assume an email or phone call is authentic</strong><br>Just because someone knows your basic details (name and address, even your mother\u2019s maiden name), it doesn\u2019t mean they are genuine. Fraudsters may try to trick you and gain your confidence by telling you that you\u2019ve been a victim of fraud. Fraudsters can also make any telephone number appear on your handset, so even if you recognise the number or it seems authentic, do not assume they are genuine.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Don\u2019t be pressured into a decision</strong><br>Under no circumstances would a bank or organisation force you to make a financial transaction on the spot; they would never ask you to transfer money into another account for fraud reasons.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Listen to your instincts</strong><br>If something feels wrong, it is usually right to question it. Fraudsters may lull you into a false sense of security when you are out and about or rely on your defences being down when you\u2019re in the comfort of your own home. They may appear trustworthy, but they may not be who they claim to be.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Stay in control</strong><br>Have the confidence to refuse unusual requests for personal or financial information. It\u2019s easy to feel embarrassed when faced with complex conversations, but it\u2019s OK to stop the discussion if you do not feel in control of it.</p>",

Its rich chocolate fur looked luxuriant and it was easy to see why <a href=\"http://www.fashionintime.org/history-fur-fashion-10th-19th-century/\">it was prized in the middle ages as a trimming for robes of state</a>. </p> <p>This female also had a very large throat patch, or bib, which was, unusually, almost apricot in colour.

Government explains that we need to reduce the budget deficit. Which, of course, we do.</p> <p>2. Government calls their own solution \u201creform\u201d, because that suggests it is unquestionably worthy and good, and then insists this is, in fact, the only possible solution to the problem.</p> <p>3.

Government chastises the voting public for enjoying now unaffordable benefits and for failing to comprehend the problem and for not backing the government\u2019s policies to fix it.</p> <p>5. Policies don\u2019t pass the Senate. Nothing happens.</p> <p>6. Repeat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/24/bill-shorten-offers-malcolm-turnbull-compromise-on-superannuation-changes\">Bill Shorten offers Malcolm Turnbull compromise on superannuation changes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We\u2019ve been around this same circuit so many times no-one is listening any more. We all know some of the savings about to be presented have been rejected by the electorate as inequitable and will almost certainly continue to be. We all know there are alternatives and compromises to be had, with broad support, if this was really just about finding solutions. <a href=\"http://www.acoss.org.au/media_release/summit-makes-for-diverse-allies-to-reform-economy/\">Business and civil society have already had summits to pave the way.</a> Think tanks have written reports. We\u2019ve been talking about it for years.</p> <p>There\u2019s every sign the voting public is prepared to consider alternatives and would almost certainly reward a government that tried to tackle budget \u201crepair\u201d in a cooperative or bipartisan way. There was no great voter backlash against the winding back of negative gearing proposed by Labor, for example, despite the Coalition\u2019s best efforts, nor a groundswell of opposition against reduced superannuation tax breaks. That was more a problem in the Liberal\u2019s own branches.</p> <p>There was certainly plenty of self-serving political tactics in Bill Shorten\u2019s National Press Club offer of a superannuation compromise last week, but as Liberal backbencher Russell Broadbent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/liberal-mp-criticises-scott-morrison-should-reach-out-to-labor-on-superannuation\">was brave enough to say to my colleague Katharine Murphy</a>, there were also a lot of good reasons for the Coalition to consider it. Morrison, battling internal dissent on the issue, ruled it out immediately, preferring the simplistic rhetorical binary of spending cuts versus higher taxes, to the possibility of an outcome.</p> <p>So the policy debate continues to do donuts. Lots of screeching about looming trillion dollar deficits. Lots of blowing smoke. Little progress. And budget repair isn\u2019t the only policy going around in circles.</p> <p>Again it\u2019s possibly pre-positioning, or expectations management, but the new environment minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/28/josh-frydenberg-australias-use-of-coal-is-falling-and-that-is-not-a-bad-thing\">Josh Frydenberg\u2019s first pronouncement in his new portfolio </a>was that there would be no substantive changes to Direct Action. Once again, we\u2019ve been through this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/27/election-2016-greg-hunt-coalition-emissions-trading-scheme\">so very many times</a> before. Without substantive changes the policy cannot meet Australia\u2019s promised emission reduction targets. Insisting that it can, over and over, does not change this fact. Not even if you change the minister. Labor\u2019s 2016 election policy held out the prospect of a bipartisan compromise, based on the Direct Action model. It\u2019s just unclear whether there can be a sufficiently long cease fire in the climate wars for the government to take it. </p> <p>Similarly the terrible dilemma posed by offshore detention of asylum seekers requires the government and the opposition to be slightly flexible with solutions.</p> <p>These political stand-offs are major practical problems in themselves, but they also have a broader impact on the system as voters tune out of \u201cdebates\u201d that have no obvious conclusion. Who can blame them?</p> <p>There\u2019s been much written about the low primary votes for both major parties in 2016 and the fact that nearly a quarter of the electorate opted for minor parties or independents \u2013 the populist offerings of some of those parties, the economic anxieties in parts of the electorate. </p> <p>Even before the election a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/now-for-the-big-question-who-do-you-trust-to-run-the-country-58723\">survey</a> by the the <a href=\"http://moadoph.gov.au/\">Museum of Australian Democracy</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.governanceinstitute.edu.au/\">institute for governance and policy analysis</a> at the University of Canberra showed levels of trust in government and politicians were at their lowest levels since 1993 and that 74% of the electorate thought people in government would look after their own political interests, rather than do the right thing.</p> <p>Perhaps the election result was also a simple reaction to the inability of the parliament to get things done, to enunciate a problem and then make the compromises necessary to get on and fix it. To do its job. To find the \u201csensible centre\u201d instead of just talking about it. Reciting the same economic arguments with slightly reworked catchphrases will probably mean the policies hit the same walls as last time. That would only exacerbate the disillusionment spiral.</p>"
