  "<p>There are six good reasons to be discomfited by what\u2019s turning out to be a very messy and public divorce for Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt \u2013 their kids. Apart from those innocent and vulnerable souls (and however much the Jolie-Pitt brood strut through their gilded, red-carpeted lives, they remain innocent and vulnerable), it seems to be a case of grab your popcorn and enjoy the spectacle.</p> <p>Let\u2019s not kid ourselves. At base level, this is just a venal hiss of: \u201cOoh, very rich, very pretty people falling out!\u201d Celebrity divorce reimagined as a disaster movie. Pathetic rubberneckers, like myself, gobbling up the gossip, accusations and fury. Perhaps a little snort at Jennifer Aniston photographed \u201clooking solemn\u201d, as though she had imposed a smiling ban on herself, lest normal cheeriness be mistaken for spiteful joy at the news.</p> <p>It\u2019s a PR universe away from the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin, who strove to \u201cuncouple\u201d with so little acrimony or, indeed, emotion, that there were times that it came across as less a split, rather a kind of squeaky pulling apart of weak Velcro.</p> <p>But good for Gwynnie and Chris, right? However much we mock their efforts (leastways, the vocabulary), they behaved with dignity and protected their family. Most would agree that co-operation and mediation are best, especially when kids are involved. Sure, but on the other hand, just like regular divorce, perhaps there are some celebrity divorces that just couldn\u2019t (and maybe shouldn\u2019t) end quietly.</p> <p>Where the Jolie-Pitt divorce is concerned, whatever the conjecture, right now, there\u2019s no way of knowing what\u2019s true or false. However, it\u2019s widely accepted that it was Jolie who initiated the divorce and in such a determined manner that there could be no hope of pretending that it was amicable. In this way, it\u2019s reminiscent of 2016\u2019s other Big Blockbuster Divorce \u2013 between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. Then, Heard was widely branded a \u201cgolddigger!\u201d, scrabbling for a \u201cbig pay day\u201d. Such was the venom directed at her, I felt at the time that I\u2019d inadvertently signed up for a crash course in synchronised global misogyny. A big cheer, then, for Heard, the big ol\u2019 golddigging slut, for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/18/amber-heard-donates-divorce-settlement-charity-abused-women\">announcing</a> that all her settlement money would go to charity.</p> <p>The Jolie-Pitt divorce is totally different. (Just one of the ways it\u2019s different is that no one could pelt \u201cgolddigger\u201d mud at Jolie.) However, there could be said to be a core similarity in the way that both women initiated divorce proceedings and both seemed defiant about making a lot of noise. While ugly celebrity bust-ups are nothing new, there still seems to be a fresh feminist-flavoured attitude, a sense of rebellion here.</p> <p>It\u2019s a little acknowledged fact that sometimes huge status and wealth can trap a person. Put into context, this is a world where fame and money tend to calm things down, smooth things over, at least on the surface. The main (lawyered/PR-ed/micromanaged) onus is on control and its smiling twin, damage limitation \u2013 managing and protecting the famous faces and their highly lucrative brands. Even when both parties are famous, it takes a certain courage to use that very fact not to soothe, calm and conceal, but almost as an accelerant.</p> <p>This is why, while there\u2019s much to be said for the measured, mediated approach (not least for any children involved), I find Heard and now Jolie\u2019s brand of bolshiness noteworthy and fascinating. I\u2019m not suggesting they have anything in common with the powerless or penniless who divorce, but that\u2019s the point \u2013 women like them appear to be rebelling against the controlling A-list status quo (speak no evil/tweet no evil\u201d?) and accepting the public censure that comes with that.</p> <p>Maybe I\u2019m just a sucker for women with fiery gobs and a refusal to go quietly, indeed, do <em>anything</em> quietly. Messy it might be, but there\u2019s no denying the spirit.</p> <h2>In Liverpool, it seems, you\u2019ll never walk alone<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f31abedcb4157c11f233ae71caa629833a2165a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f31abedcb4157c11f233ae71caa629833a2165a/0_195_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The 96 victims of the Hillsborough disaster are posthumously awarded the freedom of the city last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 96 victims of the Hillsborough disaster are posthumously awarded the freedom of the city last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 96 victims of the 1989 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/apr/13/hillsborough-disaster-police-south-yorkshire-liverpool\">Hillsborough stadium disaster </a>have been given the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/22/hillsborough-victims-posthumously-awarded-freedom-of-the-city-of-liverpool\"> freedom of the city of Liverpool</a>.

I bet it was.</p> <p>These honours are a lovely gesture that says a lot about Liverpool. The most bittersweet of \u201cvictories\u201d, Hillsborough wasn\u2019t only about getting justice for those who were killed, it was also about spirit in the face of impossible odds and Liverpool showed it had guts to burn.</p> <p>Time and again, over the years, Liverpudlians have received stick for being over-emotional, melodramatic and the rest, when it seems to me that all the people there do is try to stick up for each other.</p> <p>Liverpool is a true flagship city for community spirit and should be applauded for that.</p> <h2>Whingers should try self-control too</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0a50aae158d0b2e1af008f4ca8a4d7e4413ca3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0a50aae158d0b2e1af008f4ca8a4d7e4413ca3d/28_35_4179_2508/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Emirates airline was the subject of a complaint by a passenger about his overweight neighbour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Emirates airline was the subject of a complaint by a passenger about his overweight neighbour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kamran Jebreili/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An Italian man has brought a case against the Emirates airline after being forced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/30/traveller-sues-etihad-back-injury-obese-passenger\">sit next to an obese passenger on a nine-hour flight</a>.

Obviously space can be an issue on planes and it\u2019s uncomfortable feeling squashed, especially on a long flight. However, hasn\u2019t this got a lot more to do with some airlines not giving passengers enough room in the first place?</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the ethical dimension of whether people want to place their temporary personal comfort above basic decency, by insulting and humiliating another human being in this way. I\u2019d rather plunge my face into boiling tar than be the reason an overweight person gets to feel terrible about themselves that day.</p> <p>Overweight people are always being told to exercise self-control over their eating habits \u2013 how about their tormentors thinking about exercising their own self-control, over their manners?</p> <p>I\u2019ve written before that such levels of intolerance could swiftly get out of control both on aircrafts and in wider society. (Overweight people first, then start on the next vulnerable group?)</p> <p>Generally, it\u2019s often suggested that the obese person needs to buy an extra aeroplane seat to accommodate their girth, as if money was no object. How about flipping this so that the people complaining are the ones who need to buy the extra seats, to accommodate their bad attitudes?</p> <p>If the thin and judgmental are so precious about their \u201cpersonal space\u201d, then they should be the ones shelling out for extra seats.</p>",
  "<p>Britain has blocked European Union efforts to establish an independent international inquiry into the war in Yemen, prompting dismay among human rights groups.</p> <p>The Netherlands had hoped to garner broad support for its proposal that the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) in Geneva set up an inquiry to examine civilian deaths in Yemen, where the Saudi Arabia-led coalition is accused of committing war crimes.</p> <p>Instead, with the UK refusing to give its backing, the Netherlands\u2019 proposal for an international inquiry \u2013 submitted on Friday by Slovakia on behalf of the EU \u2013 was replaced with a much weaker one that the office of the UN high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) dispatch a mission \u201cwith assistance from relevant experts, to monitor and report on the situation ... in Yemen\u201d. This falls far short of what human rights groups and the OHCHR had wanted.</p> <p>In an open letter to the HRC, Human Rights Watch and other campaign groups claim an international inquiry would help to \u201cestablish the facts, collect and preserve information related to violations and abuses with a view to ensuring that those responsible for crimes are brought to justice in fair trials\u201d.</p> <p>Foreign secretary Boris Johnson last week rejected the need for such an inquiry, arguing that the UK was \u201cusing a very, very wide variety of information sources about what is happening to acquaint ourselves with the details\u201d about Yemen.</p> <p>But the revelation that the UK neutered EU attempts to bring about such an investigation is likely to raise questions about its motives. Since the conflict began, the UK has sold more than \u00a33bn worth of weapons and military equipment to the Saudis and defence contractors hope more deals are in the pipeline.</p> <p>\u201cBlocking attempts to create an international inquiry is a betrayal of the people of Yemen who have suffered so much during this conflict,\u201d said Polly Truscott of Amnesty International. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking. The UK ought to be standing up for justice and accountability, not acting as a cheerleader for arms companies.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade said: \u201cFor 18 months now, UK arms have been central to the destruction of Yemen.

The groups have documented more than 70 \u201cunlawful\u201d coalition airstrikes \u2013 on homes, hospitals, markets, civilian factories and schools \u2013 some of which, they say, may amount to war crimes, and which have killed at least 913 civilians.</p> <p>An airstrike on a Doctors Without Borders hospital in August, the fourth during the war, prompted the group to withdraw its staff from six hospitals in northern Yemen and declare a \u201closs of confidence in the coalition\u2019s ability to avoid such fatal attacks\u201d.</p> <p>At least 30 civilians were killed when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/aug/20/bombing-vital-port-yemen-children-serious-risk-un-warns\" title=\"\">Saudi-led airstrikes </a>attacked a civilian neighbourhood in Yemen\u2019s central port city of Hodeida last Wednesday.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch also claims that the Houthi armed group and forces allied to it, including those loyal to the former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, have committed numerous violations and abuses of international human rights and humanitarian law.</p> <p>Growing disquiet about the UK\u2019s policy on Yemen has seen more than 200 doctors and health professionals sign an open letter to the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, himself a doctor, calling for the UK to suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Fox has been touring Gulf states looking to boost UK exports. He is due soon in Saudi Arabia, where there are hopes he will broker a new deal for British-made Typhoon jets.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.medact.org/campaigns-actions/open-letters/end-uk-arms-sales-yemen/\" title=\"\">letter, co-ordinated by the campaign group Medact</a>, states: \u201cAs health professionals, we have a duty to speak out against all causes of ill health in Yemen. This must include the sale and export of UK weaponry that is fuelling the conflict.\u201d</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \u201cThe UK is working closely with all parties to secure agreement on a resolution that will help the situation on the ground in Yemen.

  "<p>In my head, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/29/roberta-flack-soundtrack-of-my-life-fugees-killing-me-softly\" title=\"\">Roberta Flack</a> was singing: The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face when my eyes met hers and, though I never got to know her name, I feel sure it must have been something like Penelope or Ursula or Francesca. She was way, way out of my league and during our two years together she would occasionally remind me of this. She drank like a fish, went like a train and flirted with all my friends.</p> <p>Before her, I\u2019d never previously considered myself a man for the fancy cars. I had an Audi once, which was mainly used by a former partner, and that was about it. I simply didn\u2019t appreciate cars enough to spend much time and money on them: they were functional beasts and driving them was a reminder that you weren\u2019t drinking last night and would not be tonight either. The most tedious and pointless conversations I\u2019ve ever had have been about cars.</p> <p>Then, one fateful afternoon, having agreed not to renew the lease on an unprepossessing wee member of the Volvo family, I was persuaded by a friend to test-drive a five-year-old Jaguar XK. \u201cI don\u2019t really know why I\u2019m doing this,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not me and I won\u2019t be able to afford it unless I take a mortgage out on it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s not as expensive as you think and I can get you a deal on it.\u201d</p> <p>I can get you a deal on it. Is there a more meaningless phrase in the English language or a crueller one? Only unworldly and credulous naifs fall for that sort of patter and I considered myself to be neither of these. My friend, though, knew what he was doing. The sound of the engine as I switched it on acted like a narcotic. It growled like that Maserati Ghibli you hear in those radio adverts. A chap couldn\u2019t fail but to feel good about himself driving a car like this. The fix was in. I didn\u2019t even take her for a test drive; she took me.</p> <p>By the end of our first day together, I\u2019d convinced myself that I needed to take her for a spin through one of those moody Highland glens where all the best car adverts get filmed. I was becoming a petrol-head. On one occasion, I rebuked my daughter when I overheard her telling her sister that Dad\u2019s new car was \u201cgreen\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s racing green,\u201d I hissed. For some reason, I felt compelled always to wear sunglasses when driving her, even on grey and sodden days.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t long, though, before guilt\u2019s long and icy fingers began to beat his baleful timpani on my back. \u201cYou\u2019re nothing but a champagne socialist,\u201d he whispered. It was like the Catholic guilt you experienced as a child for dodging Mass and the terror of expecting your sin to be disinterred at any moment.</p> <p>On one occasion, reporting for an early morning BBC news programme to discuss inequality and food banks, I was spotted clambering indecorously out of this low-slung machine. As my broadcasting chums gently chided me for my bourgeois, automotive proclivities I retorted that it was \u201cthe People\u2019s Jag\u201d and that, come the revolution, everyone would be driving cars like this.</p> <p>I even found myself doing that thing where you tell your friends that your car is nowhere near new just in case they thought you were being reckless with your personal finances. But then I was persuaded (with alarming ease) to purchase a private number plate so that people wouldn\u2019t know just how old it really was. Is this how it feels to be a Tory? I wondered. At this rate, I mused with a degree of mortification, I\u2019ll soon be asking my accountant about offshore tax havens and telling people that there are too many immigrants and that Britain is going to the dogs.</p> <p>On another occasion, I offered to give my journalist chum Alex Massie, the acceptable face of Scottish unionism, a lift into town. He shot me a glance that conveyed something between \u201cyou\u2019re kidding\u201d and \u201cyou surely don\u2019t expect me to keep quiet about this\u201d.</p> <p>Once, I noticed with a thrill, two pretty, young women with nice coats looking admiringly at the Jag as I pulled up to a set of traffic lights. This, though, was swiftly followed by a barely discernible look of disappointment when they saw who was driving it.</p> <p>On an assignment for the<em> Observer</em>, when approaching a housing scheme in one of Glasgow\u2019s disadvantaged neighbourhoods, I suddenly panicked: \u201cI can\u2019t be seen driving a car like this up there. It\u2019ll undermine my leftie credentials.\u201d It was then that I knew deep inside that she would have to go. In some of Glasgow\u2019s edgier neighbourhoods, there are stories of traffic lights that have been doctored and controlled remotely from the upper rooms of nearby flats. Whenever a decent car pulls up, the lights are kept at red long enough for a team of masked urchins to remove all tyres, wheels and exhausts and leave the vehicle marooned on brick stilts. I began to grow paranoid that just such&#xa0;a fate must surely be mine, a condign punishment for my unconscionable hypocrisy.</p> <p>I know that, as an official leftie, I\u2019m supposed to care deeply about global warming, carbon reduction and other environmental stuff. In truth, I\u2019ve cared little for it all. This car changed all that; it was about as fuel efficient as a private jumbo jet. My carbon footprint, which had been reducing nicely to a seven or eight, was now approaching 15. You would have needed to plant enough trees to cover half the Caledonian forest to counteract the damage to the planet wrought by my car.</p> <p>And so, last week I traded in my gorgeous, racing green Jag for a nice but unremarkable saloon much more appropriate to my age and station. I admit to stealing one last look at her long, sleek curves but already she was sizing up a younger, fitter and altogether more affluent-looking suitor, the capricious minx.</p>",

These are native birds in our countryside, and it beggars belief that Natural England, the government agency tasked with protecting England\u2019s wildlife, should issue a license to a gamekeeper to shoot up to 10 buzzards. This will encourage farmers, who raise thousands of pheasants, to believe that they too can kill buzzards with impunity.</p> <p>In the autumn, when these foreign birds are released in order to be killed for fun, they stream into our garden and wood where for free they feast on insect life and any slow-worms, grass snakes or lizards that have not yet hibernated.

  "<p>The BBC\u2019s coverage of the EU referendum was highly regarded by the critics who matter most to us: the public. Our audience research shows that the BBC was the most trusted reporter of the referendum. In fact, our scores for trust rose as the campaign progressed. Complaints were low. And more than 90% of people in the UK<strong><em> </em></strong>came to the BBC during the campaign for the news. That said, there have been two strands of criticism of our coverage. On the one hand, some Leavers have said the BBC reported impartially and accurately through the course of the campaign, but, since the vote of 23&#xa0;June, we have returned to what they say are our true EU-luvvie colours and our reporting of the prospects for Brexit Britain has been gloomy or hysterical.</p> <p>On the other, some Remainers have complained that we have been too impartial \u2013 that our unthinking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/03/bbc-impartiality-skewers-evidence-based-facts\" title=\"\">insistence on balance</a> meant we treated Remain and Leave arguments with equivalence, giving the same treatment to respected experts as to know-nothings and lightweights. Worse, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/29/tvs-failure-to-properly-scrutinise-boris-johnsons-eu-claims-a-criminal-act\" title=\"\">the criticism has gone</a>, we abandoned our duty to inform the public: the Leavers\u2019 exaggerations, distortions and downright lies, they say, were given the same airtime as the Remainers\u2019 evidence-based judgments. Impartial reporting, this argument goes, is contributing to the problem of post-truth politics.</p> <p>It is easy to dismiss these critics as regular BBC bashers or sore losers. But the BBC has no business being complacent. It is worth making a few points that, I hope, show that we are alive to our critics.</p> <p>The Leavers\u2019 complaint will, in no small part, be answered by what happens next and how we report it. The fact is that, since the EU referendum, there has been a revaluation of sterling, the Bank of England cut interest rates because it says the outlook for economic growth has weakened markedly and the government\u2019s plans for Brexit are unclear. But consumer confidence has bounced back and manufacturing and services sectors have rebounded accordingly. In the months ahead, our job is to understand what Brexit actually means \u2013 without relish or alarm.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The BBC was abundantly clear that the overwhelming weight of expert economic opinion advised people to vote Remain</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Remainers who grieve at the result have blamed the BBC. But they know that the BBC did not choose to hold the referendum, frame the question, decide the timing of the vote, agree the reform package with Brussels or set the terms, tone and talking points of the campaign. Nor was the BBC responsible for the approach of the big political parties to the campaign. Labour chose to operate separately from Stronger In. Downing Street refused to send out Conservative cabinet ministers to rebut arguments made by prominent Tory Leavers live on air, because they insisted that \u201cblue on blue\u201d arguments would turn the national debate into a Westminster soap opera. Unsurprisingly, the BBC did not carry water for the government: our job is to challenge politicians, not to serve as a rebuttal unit or advocate the alternative argument.</p> <p>One other point: inasmuch as the EU referendum was about the economy, it was about forecasts more than facts. It was not a contest of hard truths but an argument over whose predictions of the future you preferred. The BBC was abundantly clear that the overwhelming weight of expert economic opinion advised people to vote Remain. But the BBC, at all times, should be open to those who may challenge a consensus \u2013 not all such opinions stand the test of time. (And, for the avoidance of doubt, that does not mean any crank heretic can come along and think they can take a pop at a point of historical, scientific or social fact.)</p> <p>The fundamental charge \u2013 that BBC reporting resulted in a false balance in which fanciful claims got the same billing as serious insights \u2013 is not true. We were keenly aware of this risk, precisely because the BBC had been so roundly criticised by the scientific community over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/02/mps-criticise-bbc-false-balance-climate-change-coverage\" title=\"\">climate change</a>.</p> <p>For the uninitiated: \u201cfalse balance\u201d means thinking wrongly that you have to give pro and anti equal airtime, regardless of the facts, editorial judgment and the expertise of the interviewee. The BBC\u2019s rules are clear. We have to deliver \u201cdue impartiality\u201d and \u201cbroad balance\u201d, terms designed to ensure that we are free to make judgments on the validity of stories, that we challenge facts and figures, that we acknowledge that different people speak with different levels of authority on a subject.</p> <p>The editorial guidelines that we spend a great deal of time thinking through make clear that balance is not measured with a stopwatch. So, if you go back, you will see that the squeakier claims made by politicians were challenged again and again by our presenters and correspondents. Go back and look at <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36380980\" title=\"\">Evan Davis take on Douglas Carswell</a> over the claim that voting Leave would bring \u00a3350m a week back into UK coffers; watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/15/michael-gove-on-question-times-eu-referendum-special-the-verdict\" title=\"\">David Dimbleby take on Michael Gove</a>\u2019s dismissal of the IFS; read what <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36073201\" title=\"\">Reality Check said about George Osborne\u2019s forecast</a> that voting Leave would cost each home \u00a34,300; watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSQT7QnbWI\" title=\"\">Andrew Neil pick apart Nigel Farage\u2019s numbers</a> on immigration. Or Kamal Ahmed on the 6pm and 10pm bulletins saying: \u201cThe economic consensus is on one side of this debate.\u201d I could go on and on.</p> <p>The Remainers\u2019 criticism does not stand up. No one who watched the BBC during the campaign could have been left in any doubt that President Obama, the governor of the Bank of England, the IMF, OECD, IFS, CBI, prime minister, chancellor and, yes, both David Beckham and Jeremy Clarkson believed Britain should remain in the EU. People who voted out made up their own minds and did so knowing that all those people thought it was a bad idea. If some people who believe in the benefits of EU membership think they lost the referendum because their case was not sufficiently heard on the BBC, I can\u2019t help feeling they may be missing the point of the 52%. It is impossible to generalise on what 17.5&#xa0;million voters were saying, but it was a vote for a change.</p> <p>We plainly do not get everything right. We make mistakes and, I hope, move quickly to grip them. More than that, there is a real issue about how newsrooms can get beyond the noise to the news. This means thinking differently about reporting stories, the resources we put into data analysis, and the prominence we give to context. But no one wants paternalistic news. The BBC\u2019s job is not to preside over the democratic process \u2013 it is to report, to host the argument and to interrogate the participants. We aim to inform our audiences, not seek the approval of politicians or pundits. That is what we sought to do in this difficult and contentious contests. And it is what we continue to do.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cThis is the story of this country\u2026 generations of people who felt the lash of bondage, the shame of servitude, the sting of segregation, but who kept on striving and hoping and doing what needed to be done so that today, I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves.\u201d The most powerful speech of the Democratic convention in Philadelphia earlier this summer was made not by the party\u2019s presidential nominee, nor the president, but by the first lady, Michelle Obama. <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/michelle-obama-speech-democratic-convention-dnc-2016-full-text-video/\">Her words</a> remind us of the extent to which the slave trade \u2013 and the terrible legacy it left the United States \u2013 is part of that country\u2019s national consciousness.</p> <p>Not so in Britain. Our political leaders hardly make reference to the dominant role this country played in the global slave trade. British slave traders generated immense spoils by transporting 5.5 million African slaves to its Caribbean colonies, forcing them to work in terrible conditions on plantations in Jamaica, Barbados and beyond. A new <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/\">database</a> launched last week by academics at UCL, cataloguing the details of 20,000 British slave owners, illustrates the extent to which the historic wealth of the slave trade extends its reach into modern Britain: in the Georgian architecture of cities such as London, Liverpool and Bristol; in businesses such as Greene King and the Royal and Sun Alliance; in the several recent or serving <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/britains-colonial-shame-slave-owners-given-huge-payouts-after-abolition-8508358.html\">MPs with slave owners in their family history</a>.</p> <p>The extraction of this wealth came at terrible cost. Slaves were shackled and transported in appalling conditions aboard disease-ridden ships. Those who survived the journey were often treated with unspeakable physical and emotional cruelty. Countless lives were lost: by the time of abolition, the African slave population in the Caribbean stood at a small fraction of the total number of slaves who had arrived over the years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Britain is portrayed as a benevolent benefactor rather than a country with a burden of debt</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The scars are still visible across Britain\u2019s former colonies. After abolition, former slaves were left in abject poverty, a legacy from which no country has recovered. In Jamaica, Britain\u2019s largest slave colony, 80% of its population lacked functional literacy at the time it was granted independence in 1962. In Britain, the wealth extracted from African slaves has continued to contribute to our society flourishing long after slavery was abolished.</p> <p>But unlike in the United States, the horrors of British slavery unfolded on plantations on distant shores and its legacies affect populations Britain has long washed its hands of. So our role in this dark period has been all to easy to obscure. Tony Blair was the first British prime minister to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/nov/26/race.immigrationpolicy\">address this grim period of Britain\u2019s past</a>, but only after decades of political leaders ignoring it altogether. When David Cameron visited Jamaica last year, he called for Jamaica to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/30/jamaica-should-move-on-from-painful-legacy-of-slavery-says-cameron\">\u201cmove on\u201d</a> from its past and spoke positively of Britain\u2019s role in abolition. He neither acknowledged Britain\u2019s role as a perpetrator, nor the fact that even the act of abolition was itself a terrible injustice. While British slave owners were paid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/12/british-history-slavery-buried-scale-revealed\">huge amounts of compensation</a> by the government \u2013 between \u00a316bn and \u00a317bn in today\u2019s prices; 40% of government expenditure in 1834 \u2013 their slaves were forced to work for a further four years without pay in order to further compensate their owners.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s true role in the slave trade must feature more prominently in our collective history and our national consciousness: not so that our political leaders should constantly apologise for Britain\u2019s past wrongs, or that contemporary descendants of slave traders should bear an ongoing burden of shame, but so that we view Britain\u2019s role in the modern world in the context of our history.</p> <p>Our international responsibilities cannot be understood devoid of that context. They are derived not just from the deep injustice of the structural inequalities that divide global north from global south but from the fact that in the past Britain has helped create those very inequalities.</p> <p>Few would disagree with this principle in abstract. Yet it is rarely played out in concrete debates about international aid, migration and refugee policy. Too often, Britain is portrayed as a benevolent benefactor rather than a country with a burden of debt to some of the world\u2019s poorest nations. We cannot understand our role in the world using only a sanitised version of our history.</p>",
  "<p>Trust \u2013 or rather, the absence of it \u2013 stands suddenly top of journalism\u2019s talking shop. Gallup in the US releases another of its annual polls that shows trust in the mass media \u201cto report the news fully, accurately and fairly\u201d has dropped to its lowest level in polling history \u2013 with only 32% saying they have a great deal or fair amount of such confidence.</p> <p>Those findings are down eight percentage points from last year. Compare and contrast a whopping 72% trust rating on parallel Gallups in 1972, opinions sampled directly after the Watergate heroics: different reputations, different times.</p> <p>And as for Britain, the ambitious director of the Impress regulation project has been setting out his stall recently. \u201cThe press is sitting on a trust timebomb,\u201d claims Jonathan Heawood. He cites Ipsos Mori results showing that a mere 25% of the UK public trust journalists to tell the truth \u2013 and he produces wider European research to reveal that we\u2019re flat bottom for reverence right across the continent. \u201cOnly 22% of the British public say they tend to trust the press, the lowest rating in Europe. 73%, nearly three-quarters of the public, say they tend not to trust the press, the worst trust rating by a long way \u2013 beyond Greece on 65%, and Serbia on 63%\u201d.</p> <p>Impress, naturally enough, doesn\u2019t let such disquieting perceptions lie. It contrasts newspapers\u2019 ratings\u2019 mire with the somewhat higher confidence levels that broadcasters enjoy. Why? Because they\u2019re monitored by Ofcom rules on evidence checks, fairness, balance and the rest \u2013 an underlying ring of confidence. And now, Heawood claims, the press and attendant websites can choose the same higher ground \u2013 by signing up for Impress regulation and displaying its \u201ctrust mark\u201d on their front pages.</p> <p>But let\u2019s not wander too far into the rivalry between Impress and the Independent Press Standards Organisation for custom post-Leveson charter protection (by one group that Ipsos Mori finds even less beloved: politicians). Simple issues can get very misty on that road. Trust itself, though, is an issue that can\u2019t be avoided.</p> <p>Does it matter? Of course it does \u2013 especially to many journalists. Trust is their obvious key to self-esteem. It says what they do is appreciated and respected. And there\u2019s some occasional evidence of reality here: see the swell of interest in serious newspaper sales and websites in moments of electoral or referendum crisis. But don\u2019t get carried away.</p> <p>Codes and kitemarks of purity are only a tiny piece of this equation. The same public opinion survey Impress commissioned and relies on begins by pointing out that regulation \u201cis not a particularly salient topic and there are generally low levels of engagement with the issue of press misconduct\u201d. Ipsos Mori, one bad news bearer, can\u2019t find room for post-Leveson reform in its list of the top 36 issues facing Britain.</p> <p>No, the problem doesn\u2019t start in newspaper offices or television studios. It\u2019s outside in the wider world. Last week, one major US poll reported that 44% of voters under 35 are choosing to vote for the Libertarian candidate, who hadn\u2019t heard about Aleppo, or the Green nominee. If Trump wins, in short, it will reflect millennial anger over and apathy towards Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Does that remind you of a Brexit result that saw too many young voters stay at home? Or the Brexit surge from voters who did turn out far below the metropolitan media radar? Has a notably antagonistic US posh press dished Trump\u2019s chances?</p> <p>More immediately this weekend, whatever happened to the stop-Corbyn surge in the press and on TV? You can unload many doubts over Labour and Momentum. You can run twin exposures back to back on two different TV channels. But, curiously, very little seems to bite. After a week of ratcheting debate about the death of the liberal centre, fragmentation around the peripheries proceeds at a rate of knots.</p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn has momentum in every sense. The new forces of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/podemos\" title=\"\">Podemos </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/13/ciudadanos-podemos-of-right-political-force-spain-albert-rivera\" title=\"\">Cuidadanos</a> have helped to keep Spain in government stasis since December 2015. From Italy to Greece to Austria to Edinburgh, fresh initiatives from left and from right are making their own pitches for history.</p> <p>Now the difficulty of writing in terms like these is that, inevitably, vividly different ideologies don\u2019t accept they may be part of the same broad phenomenon. But here\u2019s a study of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/19/opinion/its-not-too-late-to-fix-fox-news.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">Fox News power (by Bruce Bartlett in the <em>New York Times</em>) </a>that rings many bells. Why do \u201cFox News viewers score low on general news knowledge, lower even than people who consume no news, on questions like whether the stimulus caused job losses or whether President Obama was born in the US?\u201d</p> <p>Because \u201cFox had become so influential among conservatives that many refused to believe any news or opinion that wasn\u2019t vetted by the network (an effect I called \u2018self-brainwashing\u2019). Those who inhabit this world live in a kind of bubble sometimes called \u2018epistemic closure\u2019, where they won\u2019t believe many things taken for granted by people who get news from other sources.\u201d</p> <p>And epistemic closure, succoured by algorithmic selection, trusts only what it sees plonked in front of it. Trust what Facebook and Google put on your plate. Trust the view of the world that most fits your needs. Trust what you see as \u201cyourself\u201d. No kitemark is going to offer a different sort of closure there.</p> <p>The whole concept of trust is changing. How do you deal with fairness and balance in an era of post-factual politics (except, like the <em>New York Times</em>, by finally gagging on too many lies and spreading \u201cTrump Gives Up a Lie But Refuses to Repent\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/images/2016/09/17/nytfrontpage/scan.pdf\" title=\"\">across page one</a>)?

  "<p>Perry, a five-year-old African grey parrot, is for sale on a well-known pet trade website for \u00a3750. She looks in good condition with her large black bill, red tail and white mask and her owner says she can whistle the tune of Flower of Scotland, does a passable imitation of R2D2 and is \u201cvery clever and funny\u201d.</p> <p>What Perry\u2019s Scottish owner does not tell prospective buyers is that the African grey is close to extinction in the wild largely because of the international pet trade.</p> <p>Although there have been restrictions on the export of these small and intelligent birds since 2009, dealers pay a pittance for tens of thousands of them to be trapped every year in the rainforests of west and central Africa and smuggled out.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to catch them, say researchers from <a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">Birdlife</a>, a global grouping of conservation groups. A team of hunters will use decoys or go to the birds\u2019 water and mineral licks in the forests where flocks gather. They then throw nets over them and take dozens at a time.</p> <p>Once caught they will be smuggled over borders, stuffed in tiny cages and flown illegally to Europe, South Africa, the Middle East and China, where they may fetch up to \u00a31,000 each. All this makes the African grey probably the most highly traded bird in the world, causing their numbers to plummet from Nigeria to Cameroon, and from Ivory Coast to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Some conservationists estimate only 1% of their historical numbers remain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/30/7-billion-people-how-protect-wildlife-endangered-species\">In a world of 7 billion people how can we protect wildlife?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This week moves are afoot that could give hope to the African grey\u2019s future. Nine African states, the European Union and others will ask world governments and EU at the triennial meeting of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/30/7-billion-people-how-protect-wildlife-endangered-species\">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites) in Johannesburg</a> to give the highest international protection to the bird. But it is far from the only species whose future hangs in the balance and whose fate could be determined at this year\u2019s meeting. The Cites convention, signed by more than 180 countries and the EU, is the best hope the world has of stemming the growth in the \u00a3150bn a year wildlife trade and of reversing catastrophic animal and plant losses.</p> <p>Against the backdrop of a surge in African elephant and rhino poaching, and continuing deforestation and habitat losses, governments will come under intense pressure in Johannesburg to increase protection for many hundreds of endangered species. Ministers will hear from scientists, technical experts and conservationists that the fate of wildlife is at a crossroads, with populations crashing and a slow-motion extinction taking place.</p> <p>The precipitous decline of the African grey echoes what is happening to hundreds of other plant and animal species, including the African elephant, the tiger, rosewood trees, pagolins, banggai cardinal fish and many others, say conservationists.</p> <p>Last month the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) revised its animal danger lists. Sixty-eight species are said to have become extinct in the wild; 5,107 are critically endangered; 7,600 are endangered; and 16,000 are \u201cvulnerable\u201d or \u201cthreatened\u201d.</p> <p>Within a human generation, the meeting will hear, species such as the African elephant, tiger, gorilla and lion could be on the verge of extinction in the wild as a result of illegal hunting, habitat loss and the pet trade. The trade in illegal ivory has more than doubled since 2007.</p> <p>\u201cAfrica\u2019s overall elephant population has seen the worst declines in 25 years, mainly due to poaching over the past 10 years,\u201d the IUCN\u2019s director-general, Inger Andersen, will say. \u201cTheir plight is truly alarming. Poaching has been the main driver of the decline, while habitat loss poses an increasingly serious, long-term threat to the species.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a340216eb91cf6969244f9a68e2a34dc3e806d35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a340216eb91cf6969244f9a68e2a34dc3e806d35/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An old African elephant bull with a broken tusk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The trade in ivory has attracted the opposition of Prince William, who has has lobbied President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping to take action against it.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beverly Joubert/Getty Images/National Geographic Creative</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cites protects about 5,000 animal and 30,000 plant species, and ministers will be asked to change the protection status of more than 500. Some, like the lion, African elephant and pangolin, are high profile, but many reptiles, coral and fish, such as the banggai cardinal fish, are barely known.</p> <p>Nearly all the 62 proposals put forward by governments will be to increase protection. But a few species, like the panda and peregrine falcon, are no longer considered to be in danger and could have their protection reduced.</p> <p>Many countries will be admonished for allowing the illegal trade in animal parts and plant species to flourish. Laos has pledged to phase out its controversial tiger farms, which supply neighbouring China with bones and other parts for traditional medicine. But international animal trade inspectors will report in Johannesburg that rhinoceros horn, elephant ivory and many other wildlife specimens are being regularly smuggled through the country both to China and other south-east Asian countries. \u201cLaos is being targeted by organised crime groups as a transit point,\u201d says wildlife trade monitoring network Traffic. \u201cNo arrests or prosecutions related to illegal trade in rhino horn, elephant ivory and other wildlife specimens have occurred in the country since 2012. Significant loopholes still exist in national legislation.\u201d</p> <p>South Africa, the host country, is certain to be embarrassed, having lost nearly 6,000 rhinos to poachers since 2007, including more than 700 this year.

Better to legalise it | Simon Jenkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis crisis is not just about animals \u2013 this crisis is about people. It is some of the world\u2019s poorest peoples who will suffer when their natural resources are stripped from them illegally and brutally,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Last week Joanna Lumley weighed in to voice dismay at a proposal at Cites to allow the trade of horns from rhinos that have died from natural causes, or recovered poached horns. \u201cThis iconic species should not be reduced to a commodity that can be plundered for human indulgence,\u201d said the actress.</p> <p>Since the last meeting, in 2013, governments, too, have found a new reason to crack down on wildlife crime. According to the London international affairs thinktank Chatham House, wildlife crime can lead to international terrorism, and the destabilisation of vulnerable democracies. The Somali militant Islamist group al-Shabaab is said to generate its funding from illegal ivory sales.</p> <p>But everyone knows that the international trade restrictions which Cites can impose on countries are limited and nowhere near enough to stop the \u00a3150bn a year trade. The measures, say conservationists, are complicated, difficult to enforce, do not take the place of national laws, and are implemented in different ways by different countries.</p> <p>Moreover, court fines are nowhere near enough to deter poaching or smuggling. The street value of ivory is now more than \u00a31,500 a kilogram in Beijing, and rhino horn can sell for \u00a350,000 per kilo \u2013 far more than the price of gold or platinum \u2013 on the Chinese black market. Meanwhile rosewood can sell for many thousands of pounds a cubic metre.</p> <p>The UN environment programme says that 88 countries must strengthen their laws if they are to implement Cites decisions and combat illegal trade in wildlife. Many, including Bolivia, Guinea-Bissau, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Liberia, Mauritania and Mozambique must to do it urgently, says the UN body.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45d02113ff6efed34e38c520472cfd6c6d72f000\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45d02113ff6efed34e38c520472cfd6c6d72f000/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A demonstration against the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild, Fauna and Flora (CITES) in Johannesburg on September 24, 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Activists demonstrate against the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild, Fauna and Flora (Cites) in Johannesburg on September 24, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marco Longari/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Animal welfare groups say that Cites pays no attention to the treatment of animals. \u201cEvery year it rubberstamps the trade in thousands of live animals from Africa, but corruption and a complete disregard for the wellbeing of these animals means that most will suffer mistreatment, and many will experience unimaginable cruelty during their capture and transport,\u201d said David Barritt, Network for Animals\u2019 chief campaigner.</p> <p>\u201cInternational trade bans are critical to saving wildlife, but without rigorous efforts to prevent poaching and trafficking they are never enough on their own. Organised criminal networks will continue to target threatened species, as we have seen with rhinos, elephants and tigers,\u201d said the WWF.</p> <p>The Johannesburg meeting will be the largest ever, with more at stake than ever before, said John Scanlon, Cites secretary-general. \u201cCites is critical to fight the illegal trade in wildlife. Thousands of species are internationally traded and used by people in their daily lives for food, housing, healthcare, eco-tourism, cosmetics or fashion.\u201d</p> <p>If countries agree to protect the grey parrot, either by consensus or by a two-thirds majority, an outright ban will be placed within 90 days on its international trade. It would also mean that all owners in Britain and elsewhere will have to register their birds.</p> <p>The exotic pet trade, which has powerful political support in many tropical countries, will lobby, but with backing for a total trade ban also likely from Washington and Brussels the parrot is almost certain to join 1,000 other species, such as tigers, rhinos and gorillas, on what is known as Cites Appendix I, the list of most endangered species. If it stays on Appendix II, which includes sharks, polar bears and lions, some limited trade will continue to be allowed.</p> <p>\u201cCites has remarkable power. It is a pragmatic and honest convention. Discussions can be robust and intense. If there is no consensus on a request, it goes to a vote. The stage is set for a remarkable two weeks,\u201d said Scanlon.</p> <p>But whether Cites really saves the African grey parrott, the pagolin and the rosewood tree from vanishing is far from certain.</p> <h2>African lions</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7905e67647cd16fc62324a2eb816784628b9cb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7905e67647cd16fc62324a2eb816784628b9cb4/0_0_5899_2770/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lioness and adolescents lying down in Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya\" width=\"1000\" height=\"470\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Numbers of lions in west Africa have declined by about 60% in the last 20 years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anup Shah/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many west African countries are seeking a total ban on the commercial trading of lions. Numbers have declined by about 60% in the last 20 years in some countries as a result of habitat loss and the spread of human settlement, but lion populations have increased in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe thanks to good wildlife management. Countries that promote trophy hunting will object to an upgrading of lions\u2019 protection. The probably outcome is that western and central African lions will be placed on Cites\u2019 Appendix I, while other populations remain on Appendix II.</p> <h2>Sharks and rays</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95c8fb5efa4a42534ec0d457c17b7c6148246586\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95c8fb5efa4a42534ec0d457c17b7c6148246586/832_623_4381_2628/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mobula rays gathering for migration around the Yucatan Peninsula, Contoy Island, Quintana Roo, Mexico\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nine species of Mobula ray could be put on Cites\u2019 Appendix II for the first time.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>South Africa, whose waters are home to a quarter of the world\u2019s 400-odd shark species, has proposed with other countries that protection of many more species of shark be strengthened. The silky shark, three species of thresher shark and nine species of mobula ray could all be put on Appendix II for the first time because all are said to have seen declines of more than 70%.</p> <h2>African elephants</h2> <p>Countries will consider several proposals to clamp down on the ivory trade, destroy stockpiles, close legal domestic ivory markets, restrict live animal exports and create a mechanism for a future ivory trade. Currently, all African elephants are included in Appendix I, except for those in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, which are in Appendix II. One contentious proposal from Namibia and Zimbabwe seeks to move the populations of all four countries to the most stringent Appendix I level. Along with South Africa, they also propose to adopt a mechanism to permit commercial exports of ivory from lesser protected Appendix II range states. Conservation groups were encouraged this month when the IUCN World Conservation Congress voted by a 90% majority to pass a resolution urging countries to close their domestic markets for commercial trade in raw or worked elephant ivory. Last week Britain pledged to ban all domestic trade in ivory that could not be at least 70 years old.</p> <h2>White rhino</h2> <p>Swaziland has submitted a highly controversial last-minute proposal to be allowed to sell its stockpile of around 330kg of valuable southern white rhino horn and some 20kg annually from animals that died naturally. The proceeds from a one-off sale to traditional Chinese medicine hospitals would, it says, raise nearly $10m which, placed in an investment fund, could earn enough to pay for conservation and cover the $2m annual costs of running the country\u2019s three national parks. It argues that the 39-year-old worldwide ban on the sale of horn has clearly not worked, with more than 1,200 rhino killed a year in Africa, and that there is little likelihood of demand in China reducing. Far better, it says, to strictly control poaching and to trade judiciously with selected partners. The proposal has dismayed conservationists, who say that the animals are critically endangered and that any legal trade would provide cover for poaching and undermine existing international and domestic bans.</p> <h2>Pangolin</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca1e1f45a937c57f1c4986753920c7164b6b7fad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca1e1f45a937c57f1c4986753920c7164b6b7fad/0_0_3771_2263/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pangolin searching for ants\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The critically endangerd pangolin is poached for meat and its scales and skin, which have become luxury fashion materials.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These burrowing, armour-shelled anteaters with sticky tongues are critically endangered and ranked as the world\u2019s most hunted mammals, with possibly a million illegally poached in the past 10 years for their meat, plus their scales and skins, which have become luxury fashion materials.

For many it is a circle versus a straight line: the former, a rehashed version of all the failed talks that has preceded it; the latter the route to somewhere new.</p> <p>Much is at stake. Under the ever-unpredictable Erdo\u011fan, an increasingly authoritarian Turkey might decide to press ahead with plan B in the event of failure.</p> <p>\u201cUltimately, if these talks fail, there is a very real possibility that Turkey will simply annex the north,\u201d said James Ker-Lindsay, a specialist on Cyprus at the London School of Economics.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the real danger.

  "<p>John Prine walked onstage around 10.40pm Thursday holding a vinyl copy of his 1971 debut album. \u201cI had to pay $7.50 on eBay to get this thing!\u201d he told the audience. What happened next was priceless: two sets of music that spanned his 45-year career including, for the first time, a performance of the album, John Prine (Atlantic), in its entirety.</p> <p>That album allowed the former Chicago mailman to quit his day job, move to Nashville, and become one of the pre-eminent songwriters of his generation. You can hear why in its 13 story songs, which quietly eavesdrop on the lives of marginalized Americans: a Vietnam vet turned heroin junkie, an elderly couple forgotten by the world, a convict eating Christmas dinner behind bars, a Kentucky town ravaged by a coal company, a wife caged by a small town and loveless marriage who yearns for the rodeo. </p> <p>The album helped launch the singer-songwriter era of the 1970s and remains a touchstone for how empathy, ordinary language and minimal detail can produce the weight of an entire novel.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/30/best-americana-country-music-albums-fall-2016\">The best Americana and country this fall: Jack White, Wilco and Bruce Springsteen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The night was also an unexpected break for Prine, who has been touring large theaters across the US behind a new album of duets, For Better or Worse (Oh Boy). But on Thursday, abandoning his formal suit for denim and a black T-shirt, Prine performed for about 200 people at the Station Inn, Nashville\u2019s legendary den for bluegrass musicians. The wood panelling, folding chairs, and yellowing showbills on the wall fit the humble lyrics, but the music, with guitarist Jason Wilber inflecting celestial-sounding textures, measured up to Bob Dylan\u2019s take on Prine: \u201cPure Proustian existentialism. Midwestern mind trips to the nth degree.\u201d</p> <p>The concert, part of the Americana Music Festival and Conference, was a highlight among panel discussions and special events around the city. In a city where songs are currency, at a conference where songwriters are king, and in a venue championed as a showcase for both, the night was like Christmas, New Year\u2019s Eve and the Fourth of July wrapped into one.</p> <p>Prine turns 70 in October and has survived two bouts with cancer, with scars visible on his neck. Yet Prine growls his words softly, his voice ragged but not rough. When he delivers the grim coda of Six O\u2019Clock News \u2013 \u201cHis brains were on the sidewalk and blood was on his shoes\u201d \u2013 it is with matter-of-fact resignation, the saddest kind of horror. </p> <p>With Wilber and longtime bassist Dave Jacques at his sides, Prine expanded his touring band with a Jack White sideman, Fats Kaplin, on fiddle, accordion and pedal steel guitar, the singer-songwriter Pat McLaughlin on mandolin, and the drummer Kenneth Blevins. On Hello in There, their playing brought the room to silence. As Jacques stretched a long bow across his acoustic bass and Kaplan let notes hover in the air from his accordion, Prine sang the heartbreaking lyric of an old man and his wife, forgotten by their children. On Angel From Montgomery, a song made ubiquitous by Bonnie Raitt (\u201cIf you go into an igloo and there\u2019s a girl singer on the stage, if you sit there long enough, she\u2019ll sing this song\u201d), Kaplan\u2019s fiddle and Wilber\u2019s guitar called back and forth to one another as they swirled around the lyrics.</p> <p>Prine noted that, despite their 45 years, many of his earliest songs hold special relevance today. Sam Stone, written in the throes of the Vietnam conflict, could easily be written about today\u2019s veterans returning home from the Middle East. Your Flag Decal Won\u2019t Get You Into Heaven Anymore, another Vietnam-era throwback skewering self-righteous war hawks. \u201cThis one I really thought wouldn\u2019t last for six months,\u201d he said. \u201cI bring it out whenever we have an election.\u201d But the song that holds personal relevance to this day is Paradise, written for his parents, both originally from Muhlenberg County, coal-mining territory in western Kentucky.</p> <p>Prine\u2019s lyric about Peabody Energy Corp, which stripped the area for mining decades ago, has infuriated the company for years : in court documents filed last year against environmental activists, the company described the song as inflammatory.</p> <p>\u201cTo me, it wasn\u2019t a protest song, but when Peabody heard it, they went apeshit,\u201d Prine noted said. \u201cThat\u2019s what started the war between us.\u201d In April, he noted, the company filed for bankruptcy.</p> <p>The second set featured another hour of music from Prine\u2019s career. Jason Isbell and his wife, Amanda Shires, joined him on guitar and fiddle for three songs, including a haunting version of Unwed Fathers. Between two songs, Prine mentioned that the guitar he was holding was the same one pictured leaning against a stack of hay bales on the cover of that 1971 debut.</p> <p>\u201cI bought it new in 1968 and wrote every song on it,\u201d he said. The guitar received its own round of applause.</p>",

Many are awaiting the results of a Saturday night meeting of the party\u2019s national executive committee, which will discuss the rules for choosing a future shadow cabinet.</p> <p>Tom Watson, the party\u2019s deputy leader, has called for a system of elections that would allow MPs to have a say in who serves on Corbyn\u2019s frontbench, and could tempt back some who resigned over the summer.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Any agreed rule changes could be ratified by conference, but Corbyn\u2019s team believes it can beef up the shadow cabinet without the need for elections and would like to see the question discussed alongside other issues, including how to give the membership more of a say in policymaking.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Party sources said talks involving the chief whip, Rosie Winterton, had taken place and would continue later in the day to try to reach a consensus on shadow cabinet elections.</p> <p>John McDonnell, Corbyn\u2019s campaign director, said the leader\u2019s team hoped to work with MPs from across the party, but would be happy if those critical of his leadership wanted to campaign on issues from the backbenches, citing Yvette Cooper\u2019s role in fighting for support for refugees.</p> <p>Len McCluskey, the general secretary of the Unite union and a key Corbyn backer, said MPs must fall into line. \u201cWe urge Labour MPs to heed the signal sent by the members, twice now in one year, about the direction they want for the party. This includes respecting and supporting the elected leader and his team; no more sniping, plotting and corridor coups,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Jon Ashworth, the Leicester South MP and shadow cabinet member who sits on the NEC, said: \u201cWe have got to unite, but we have also got to recognise that substantial numbers of people didn\u2019t vote for Jeremy.\u201d </p> <p>He said a deal on shadow cabinet elections would help Corbyn to beef up his frontbench team. \u201cIf we want a fully functioning frontbench, we need a way of bringing colleagues back. Various shadow teams have not got their full complement. This seems to me to be a way of doing that.\u201d</p> <p>In Corbyn\u2019s acceptance speech he promised that attacking Theresa May\u2019s plan to bring back grammar schools would be at the heart of his effort to reunite Labour.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThis time next week we will hit the streets united as a party. I am calling on Labour party members to join us in a national campaign for inclusive education for all next Saturday,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Addressing the party\u2019s annual women\u2019s conference late on Saturday afternoon, Corbyn called for Labour to unite in the name of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/jo-cox-obituary\">Jo Cox</a>, the MP who was killed during the EU referendum campaign.</p> <p> The Labour leader said that Cox\u2019s death was a \u201cmurder of democracy\u201d, adding: \u201cShe was adamant that there was much more that united than divides us and there is no better way to honour her memory than ensuring we reunite and we are resolute in making the world a better place.\u201d</p> <p>Cox nominated Corbyn for the leadership in 2015 but later wrote of her regret, claiming that he was a weak leader with poor judgement.</p> <p>Corbyn also offered his backing to the MP for Rotherham, Sarah Champion, who has been embroiled in a public row with her former husband in recent days. </p> <p>The Conservatives, meanwhile, launched a multimedia campaign highlighting the divisions in the Labour party with the slogan: \u201cWe have a winner, but it isn\u2019t Britain.\u201d</p> <p>Tory chairman Patrick McLoughlin said: \u201cLabour are too divided, distracted and incompetent to build a country that works for everyone.

They were at the World Transformed festival, set up by Momentum, the grassroots group that has been closely involved in Corbyn\u2019s campaign.</p> <p>Dozens were kitted out in Team Corbyn or Momentum T-shirts. Others also wore their politics on their chests with slogans urging an end to the siege in Gaza and justice for the families of those who have died in police custody.</p> <p>For the most part, however, those who had turned up to watch Corbyn\u2019s victory were not diehard or longstanding activists. Roisin Vere, 27, and Tom Logan, 29, both live in the city and were planning to go to watch a football match rather than hang around at a political conference.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in our lives that we\u2019ve had someone in politics who represents our beliefs,\u201d said Vere, who was a Labour and sometimes Green voter before joining as a member. Logan likened it to watching politics come out of the dark ages.</p> <p>Lucy Page, 50, was another relatively new member. Also from Liverpool, she said she had always admired Corbyn since seeing him on television opposing the war in Iraq during Tony Blair\u2019s leadership.</p> <p>\u201cI joined the Labour party last year to support him. I\u2019m impressed by the membership numbers and the way he has stood up to the Tories, getting them to stop so many things. I think he can win, but I think the media and the MPs are doing a great disservice to him and the country,\u201d she said.</p> <p>As the crowd warmed up for Corbyn\u2019s expected victory, a choir from Liverpool Socialist Singers sang a song about being part of Momentum.</p> <p>Stalls sold Corbyn-related merchandise and books about socialism. Later there would be sessions about \u201cbrandalism\u201d, challenging the corporate takeover of communal space, and a panel discussing public ownership.</p> <p>The atmosphere became electrified when the BBC news channel appeared on a big screen showing videos of the candidates, attracting boos at a mention of Smith\u2019s career in big pharma and cheers for the leader. Chants of \u201cJeremy, Jeremy\u201d and \u201cCorbyn, Corbyn\u201d broke out in different parts of the room.</p> <p>Silence descended as Paddy Lillis, the chair of the NEC, read out the result. At the confirmation Corbyn had won, there was a burst of jubilation. A group of middle-aged men in suits in the front row jumped around, while two women waving Momentum T-shirts danced as the cameras snapped.</p> <p>As a poet performed verse about Corbyn\u2019s treatment by the media, Majid Mehdizadeh, 26, said he was pleased with the result because he admired the leader\u2019s principles and honesty.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never see a single interview where he has dodged the question. I joined after Ed Miliband lost last year, but before Jeremy Corbyn \u2026 I voted for him then and I voted for him again,\u201d he said.</p>",

In a speech which conveyed notably more confidence and authority than the one he delivered after his victory last year, he appealed for unity, saying it was time to wipe the slate clean. He also used a phrase, \u201cmore in common\u201d, coined by Jo Cox, the Labour MP killed in the summer who had been one of his critics. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Elections are passionate and partisan affairs things are often said in the heat of the debate on all sides that we later regret.</p> <p>But always remember in our party, we have much more in common than that which divides us.</p> <p>As far as I\u2019m concerned the slate is wiped clean from today.</p> <p> We are proud as a party that we\u2019re not afraid to discuss openly, to debate and disagree that is essential for a party that wants to change people\u2019s lives for the better that isn\u2019t prepared to accept things as they are</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn has said that \u201clots of MPs\u201d are now willing to support him ahead of compromise talks which may thrash out a deal that could lead to shadow ministers who resigned because they had lost confidence in Corbyn agreeing to work for him again</strong>. Around 60 shadow ministers resigned over the summer; a few have indicated publicly that they would be willing to return to the front bench, but many are still resisting. The party\u2019s national executive committee is meeting this evening to discuss the impasse. Corbyn wants the dissidents to return to the front bench so he can run an effective opposition in parliament. His critics want him to agree to shadow cabinet elections. As the Herald\u2019s <strong>Kate Devlin</strong> reports, MPs are under pressure not to go back until Corbyn has compromised.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/_katedevlin/status/779638486727098368\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What happens now?

But I do not understand how almost an entire generation of mainstream Labour MPs can throw their hands up in horror at the prospect of trying to recruit more members than a far-left fringe that has just emerged from the woods.

Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn said that \u201clots of MPs\u201d had been in touch offering to support him, implying that they would be returning to frontbench roles</strong>. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think you will see a sense of unity around the party. I\u2019ve already had messages from ... lots of people who want to get on board and get out there and do the campaigning. And that\u2019s just what we are going to be doing.</p> </blockquote> <p>When asked if he was referring to MPs, he said he he was talking about \u201clots of MPs\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He said that there would be \u201ca lot of changes\u201d to party rules being proposed soon.</strong> This is what he said when asked if he would introduce shadow cabinet elections.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a need to strengthen the democracy within our party. We are a party of more than half a million members, and so there has to be a discussion about democracy in the party. And that includes the proposal for elections to the shadow cabinet. That is absolutely in the mix. That is what we are discussing at the moment with colleagues in parliament, with the parliamentary committee and with many others on the national executive committee. So I think you will see a lot of changes over the next few weeks.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He played down the prospect of MPs being deselected.</strong> Asked why he would not rule out deselections, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is not my decision on who is selected for a place or not. I am not a leader who imposes things on constituencies. The new boundaries will probably come in in 2018 ... Obviously all sitting MPs go automatically on the the shortlist. And I hope the local parties will recognise that and support them. </p> </blockquote> <p>In the past, while not actually encouraging deselections, Corbyn has pointed out that the boundary changes will lead to new selections taking place. Today, by saying that he hoped local parties would support sitting MPs, he sounded more keen to quell concerns about MPs being deselected than he has done in the past.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e68f02e4b0f55a9f402d2a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-24T14:35:10.806Z\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is from the Financial Times\u2019 Jim Pickard.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PickardJE/status/779645918232604676\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Statistic of the day is that Owen Smith got more votes than Ed Miliband did six years ago.<br><br>Smith, 2016: 193k<br>Miliband, 2010: 175k</p>&mdash; Jim Pickard (@PickardJE) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PickardJE/status/779645918232604676\">September 24, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e68d65e4b03598d1ce8336\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-24T14:30:03.637Z\">3.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Further to his earlier tweet (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/24/labour-leadership-election-result-jeremy-corbyn-owen-smith-appeals-for-unity-politics-live?page=with:block-57e685d2e4b0831a51401e7d#block-57e685d2e4b0831a51401e7d\">3pm) </a>ITV\u2019s <strong>Chris Ship</strong> has posted another one saying that, when Jeremy Corbyn talked about a shadow cabinet reshuffle happening \u201cimminently\u201d, he did not quite mean imminently.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/chrisshipitv/status/779685511548002304\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Been given some guidance on what Jeremy Corbyn meant by &#39;imminent&#39; positions to Shad Cabinet in my interview.

McLoughlin said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Labour are too divided, distracted and incompetent to build a country that works for everyone. 172 Labour MPs don\u2019t think Jeremy Corbyn can lead the Labour party - so how can he lead the country?</p> <p>Instead of learning lessons from the past, they have engaged in a bitter power struggle that will continue even after they\u2019ve picked a leader.</p> <p>While Labour row amongst themselves, this Conservative government will continue to deliver a country that works for everyone, not just the privileged few.</p> </blockquote> <p>There has been little discussion of the no confidence vote in Liverpool today, understandably, but while it stands the Tories will find campaigning against Corbyn quite easily.

Here\u2019s an excerpt.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>MPs could say they\u2019re overturning the vote of no confidence for two reasons: firstly, to accept the democratic decision of the membership, but secondly, in exchange for concessions. These concessions would be conciliation with Corbyn opponents (making a distinction between the irreconcilables from the critics), as well as a strategy for winning a general election (or, frankly, avoiding a disastrous rout). Mandatory reselection should continue to be opposed by the leadership (it is unlikely to be endorsed by the NEC, in any case) and the existing arrangements for selections after the boundary changes should be maintained. Some believe that this is waving a white flag of surrender. But if MPs believe that they will be deselected \u2014 which they may think is inevitable however they behave \u2014 it won\u2019t force them into line: they will simply have no incentive whatsoever to cooperate. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e67222e4b0f55a9f402cac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/anushkaasthana\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-24T12:32:53.528Z\">1.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is my colleague <strong>Anushka Asthana</strong>\u2019s analysis of the election result.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/24/jeremy-corbyn-leadership-win-shows-labour-is-now-a-changed-party\">Corbyn leadership win shows Labour is now a changed party</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And here is an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One other piece of evidence that will be raked over by the \u201cmodernisers\u201d who wanted to topple Corbyn is a Yougov \u201cexit poll\u201d of the election, commissioned by the psephologist Ian Warren.</p> <p>The poll predicted that Corbyn would win by 59% - reasonably close, although slightly below Corbyn\u2019s actual result.

(A more detailed set of figures may be released later.)</p> <ul> <li><strong>Jeremy Corbyn has increased his majority and his grip on the party is getting stronger</strong>. The number of people voting was just over 80,000 higher than it was in 2015, and so the key figure to look at is percentage of first-preference votes. Last year Corbyn got 59.5% of first-preference votes when he was up against three candidates, Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall. This year he got 61.8% of the votes. That is not a dramatic increase, but it is an increase. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn has a clear majority with all three groups voting in the contest.</strong> Last year he had had an overwhelming lead amongst registered supporters and affiliated supporters, but amongst members he only had 49.6% of first-preference votes, meaning that Burnham/Cooper/Kendall beat him collectively. (Admittedly, if Kendall\u2019s votes had been re-allocated, he might have crept over the 50% threshold on the second round.) This time Corbyn won 59% of the members\u2019 votes. That probably reflects the extent to which the party membership has changed, with Corbyn supporters joining after his election last year and those opposed to him leaving. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn again was best at getting registered supporters to back him, but he did not win amongst this group as overwhelmingly as he did last time.</strong> In 2015 Corbyn was much better than other candidates at actively recruiting registered supporters and he won by 84% in this category. This year he won with 70%, reflecting the fact that this year Corbyn\u2019s opponents made an active effort, through groups like Saving Labour, to get their own people to sign up. The fact that people had to pay \u00a325 to be a registered supporter, not \u00a33, may also have deflated Corbyn\u2019s support a bit.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn\u2019s support amongst affiliated supporters (union members) was up, but not by much, from 58% to 60%.</strong> This group may have been the most stable of the three groups in the selectorate (ie, least changed from 2015). There was some anecdotal evidence in the spring suggesting that some people who backed Corbyn in 2015 were starting to have doubts about him. If so, it is possible that any loss he suffered in support may have been outweighed by people rallying to him because they disapproved of the actions of those MPs plotting against him.</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-24T17:10:36.956Z\">at 6.10pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e663c1e4b03598d1ce8291\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-24T11:34:25.250Z\">12.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Owen Smith says he will 'reflect carefully' on what role he will play with Labour in future</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Owen Smith </strong>has issued a statement about the result. I can\u2019t find it on the web, so here it is in full.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I want to congratulate Jeremy Corbyn on his clear win in this leadership contest. There is no doubt that the Labour party has changed under his leadership, he has mobilised huge numbers of people over the last 12 months, many of whom are here at Conference in Liverpool, and he deserves the credit for that, and for winning this contest so decisively. </p> <p>I am humbled by the more than 193,000 members, supporters and trade union members who have put their faith in me and I want to say a big thank you to them. It has been a privilege to meet so many of you, who have given so much of your lives to Labour, and I promise to continue to work for what we all believe in. It has been a huge honour for me to stand for leader of our great party and I am also deeply grateful to my Parliamentary colleagues for nominating me. </p> <p>I entered this race because I didn\u2019t think Jeremy was providing the leadership we needed, and because I felt we must renew our party to win back the voters\u2019 trust and respect. However, I fully accept and respect the result and I will reflect carefully on it and on what role I might play in future to help Labour win again for the British people. </p> <p>I have no time for talk of a split in the Labour movement - it\u2019s Labour or nothing for me. And although today\u2019s result shows that our movement remains divided, it now falls primarily to Jeremy Corbyn, as Labour Leader, to heal those divisions and to unite our movement. We have to turn round our dire opinion poll ratings and take on this right wing, failing Tory government. Jeremy has won this contest. He now has to win the country and he will have my support in trying to do so.</p> <p>Above all, despite present divisions, we have to stick together in for the long term.

Many of Jeremy Corbyns\u2019s supporters believe that the party bureaucracy has been actively trying to help Owen Smith by excluding potential Corbyn voters, and even<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/05/corbyn-investigating-claims-leadership-contest-is-being-rigged\"> Corbyn has suggested that this could be happening.</a></p> <p>Labour officials do not accept this and earlier this month they released figures apparently showing that only a tiny fraction of the selectorate were being excluded by the national executive committee panels that have been vetting voters to make sure they support Labour values. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/3107-people-purged-from-labour-leadership-election-nec-figures-show_uk_57d079a6e4b0d45ff870bc34\">Only 3,107 people, or 0.48% of those entitled to vote, had been \u201cpurged\u201d, Labour said.</a></p> <p>But this figure ignores two other categories of people who have excluded from voting.</p> <p>1- Around 130,000 people who joined Labour after 12 January were not allowed to vote because the party imposed that date as a cut-off point. Technically these people have not been \u201cpurged\u201d because they are still party members, and some of them will have paid the \u00a325 to vote as a registered supporter. And it is not unusual for parties to impose a cut off point for voting in a leadership contest, to stop last-minute entryism. But a six-month cut off is unusually long - in the Conservative leadership contest the equivalent period was three months - and when the national executive committee took this decision, it was widely interpreted as an anti-Corbyn move.</p> <p>2 - Around 50,000 registered supporter applications were rejected for technical reasons. This does not mean that these people were \u201cpurged\u201d, because the Labour party says the applications were invalid in the first place. And some were multiple applications, meaning we are not necessarily talking about 50,000 individuals. But the scale of the exclusions has made Corbyn supporters suspicious. This is what Labour said in August explaining why 50,000 applications were rejected.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are currently approximately 129,000 registered supporters who will be able to vote in this contest. Out of the 183,000 applications to become a registered supporter (at a one off payment of \u00a325), over 50,500 were rejected for technical reasons such as:</p> <p>\u00b7 Duplicate applications \u2013 for example, a number of people hit refresh multiple times on the final page or submitted a number of applications (for example, one person applied 117 times).

It has become commonplace to point out that Michael Foot thought he might win the 1983 general election because of the vast crowds turning up to his rallies, only to discover on polling day that they were not representative of national opinion.</p> <p><strong>Andy Burnham</strong> made a similar point on the Today programme this morning. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whoever wins needs to be given time to get their message over to the public. That is what you have earned the right to do as leader of the Labour party. However, also it is the case that that leader, whoever it is, has to be able to show progress - progress with the public, progress at local elections, progress in the polls. </p> <p>We cannot measure our success by the size of the membership or indeed the size of the rallies that we are holding. No-one gets the right to take Labour down to a devastating defeat.</p> </blockquote> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2016/09/new-times-john-harris-why-labour-losing-its-heartland\">a New Statesman article this week</a> my colleague <strong>John Harris</strong> also makes a good point about rallies, warning against the \u201cJohn Peel fallacy\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Those mass rallies by which Jeremy Corbyn sets such store could be the first stirrings of a social movement, some of which may play a part in an eventual left renaissance. But for now, they say nothing about Labour and the left\u2019s basic predicament. (In its own way, in fact, the idea that they augur well for Corbyn\u2019s electoral prospects is reminiscent of what I call the John Peel mistake. Circa 1969, the DJ wondered why one of his favourite albums was not in the charts: \u201cEveryone I know\u2019s got a copy,\u201d he said. Back came the reply: \u201cNo \u2013 you know everyone who\u2019s got a copy.\u201d)</p> </blockquote> <p>But on the Today programme this week <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> claimed that the huge crowds attending his rallies were evidence that Labour could win a general election and that this would start to show at next year\u2019s local elections. He said tens of thousands of people had attended his rallies over the summer. That showed there was a real \u201cinterest in politics\u201d, he said. The crowds were \u201cpretty diverse\u201d, he went on, and quite different from the sort of people who used to turn up to hear him speak before he became Labour leader.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That then becomes, surely, a very strong campaigning basis for the Labour movement, becomes a campaigning factor in towns and cities where there\u2019s never been very much activity before. That does begin to change the debate and national mood. I think you\u2019ll begin to see that play out, particularly in local elections next year and after that.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been at political rallies all my life, of various sorts. What I find exciting and nice, but slightly depressing, is when I know half the people at the meeting I go to. I go to these events all over the country, and some of them, I don\u2019t know anybody. I don\u2019t know anybody at all, and they\u2019re people who come up to me who say \u2018I\u2019ve never been involved in politics before, I\u2019m interested in what you have to say, because I\u2019m interested particularly in the economic argument that you have to rebalance society away from inequality towards equality\u2019.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-24T09:44:52.419Z\">at 10.44am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e63e93e4b03598d1ce81f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-24T08:59:44.672Z\">9.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are two of the Labour stories around this morning that are worth reading.</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-leadership-results-live-jeremy-corbyn-owen-smith-poll-incompetent-working-class-voters-a7326486.html\">Joe Watts at the Independent says new polling shows how unpopular Jeremy Corbyn is with working-class voters.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The extent of the challenge facing Jeremy Corbyn if he is named Labour leader has been laid bare by a detailed study showing broad negative views of him among working-class voters.</p> <p>Exclusive BMG Research polling for <em>The Independent</em> reveals almost half of the unskilled workers and manual labourers that Mr Corbyn needs in order to become Prime Minister believe him to be \u201cout of touch\u201d and an \u201celection loser\u201d.</p> <p>More than a third thought him \u201cincompetent\u201d and \u201cnaive\u201d, with middle-class voters sometimes holding slightly more positive views of the Labour leader.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/i-will-say-and-do-as-i-think-my-job-is-not-to-pander-to-corbyn-hv5nwpw39\">The Labour MP Jess Phillips tells the Times (paywall) that she will not pander to Corbyn if he wins and that she does not think he can win an election.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But she is not going to fall into line behind Mr Corbyn. \u201cNothing has changed.

That would be an even bigger win than last year when Corbyn got 59.5% of first preference votes. A result like this would be a big disappointment for Owen Smith, the former shadow work and pensions secretary who is challenging Corbyn and who, at the very least, hoped to make a dent in Corbyn\u2019s lead.</p> <p>Last night Corbyn issued a statement appealing for unity.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We must win the next general election so that Labour can rebuild and transform Britain \u2013 so that no one and no community is left behind. We can and must do that together.</p> <p>That includes those who have voted, volunteered and campaigned for Owen Smith.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also claimed that the election campaign had been \u201coverwhelmingly respectful in tone\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This summer, we have had a debate about the future of Labour and the future of Britain. It has been robust, and at times difficult, but it has been overwhelmingly respectful in tone.</p> </blockquote> <p>That will surprise many whose view of the contest has been shaped by the abusive debate on social media. But just as David Cameron once correctly said that Twitter is not Britain, Twitter is not the Labour party either and, as reports like <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v38/n16/tom-crewe/we-are-many\">this one in the London Review of Books</a> and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/sep/22/labour-and-liverpool-the-city-that-reveals-cracks-in-party\"> this one by the Guardian\u2019s Ewen MacAskill</a> point out, the Corbyn supporters attending events generally have nothing in common with the angry Corbynites who have been spewing venom online. (There has also been some online abuse from anti-Corbynites, although generally it has been much harder to find.)</p> <p>But nevertheless the division within the Labour party is real \u2013 quite possibly as deep as it has ever been \u2013 and Corbyn\u2019s appeal for unity seems optimistic, to put it mildly. That\u2019s because Labour increasingly looks like two parties: a leftist Corbyn faction, which is taking over the party at grassroots level and which rejects much of what Labour stood for when it was in office; and a centrist, parliamentary faction dominated by the 75% of MPs who backed a motion of no confidence in Corbyn because they think he is incapable of winning an election. The centrists believe the Corbynites are hopelessly naive, or even malign. The Corbynites think PLP-led Labour is discredited, reactionary, elitist and undemocratic. A marriage guidance counsellor would have given up trying to reconcile these two ages ago, but Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system makes launching a new party pointless and and so these two tribes who despair of each other seem condemned to co-exist.</p> <p>The result of the leadership contest will be announced during Labour\u2019s women\u2019s conference. The main conference opens tomorrow and will run until Wednesday afternoon, when Corbyn will close the conference with a speech.</p> <p>Inevitably the next five days will be dominated by reaction to Corbyn\u2019s likely re-election. It has been said that the 60-odd frontbenchers who resigned over the summer because they lost confidence in Corbyn face a choice of \u201csulk or serve\u201d, and we will start to find out who intends to return to the front bench, and who intends to carry on refusing to cooperate with Corbyn.</p> <p>More generally, by Wednesday we will know whether Labour looks like a party that is beginning to reunite \u2013 or the fractures are continuing to deepen.</p> <p>I\u2019m in Liverpool and I am just heading off towards the conference centre now.

  "<p>As Burberry models wafted down the catwalk at London fashion week in outfits inspired by Virginia\u2019s Woolf\u2019s <em>Orlando</em>, it wasn\u2019t the ornate drummer-boy jackets and ruff-collared shirts that stole the show.</p> <p>The hottest runway trend was instant shopping, as the British brand turned its catwalk into a living and breathing shop window. Fans were suddenly able to buy the equestrian-inspired leopard-print bridle bags or shearling jackets that previously they could only have coveted on social media straightaway \u2013 albeit for price tags larger than the average monthly mortgage payment.</p> <p>\u201cI think this can be seen as significant in the sense that when Burberry said it was going to do this, it was essentially rewriting how things are done [in fashion] and the point of a traditional catwalk show,\u201d says Graeme Moran, head of content at the fashion-industry bible <em>Drapers</em>.</p> <p>\u201cIf you go back 100 years, catwalks used to be small, private events that brands put on to show buyers, and eventually the press and clients, what they were doing. It can be argued that the catwalk has now become a platform to speak to customers, rather than the industry,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Burberry \u2013 along with brands such as Tom Ford, Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren, which also proffered their own shoppable runway collections at New York fashion week \u2013 is at the vanguard of what the fashion industry refers to as the \u201csee now, buy now\u201d model.</p> <p>It might not sound like a phenomenon to most people, but this is not how the fashion industry has traditionally worked. There is normally a six-month time lag between catwalk shows and designer clothes arriving in department stores and boutiques around the world. The delay means that fashion editors are usually writing about next year\u2019s shorts and sundresses just as the rest of us are digging out our winter coats.</p> <p>This interregnum also enables nimble high-street chains to piggyback on emerging trends and get cheaper versions of standout styles into store.</p> <p>The backdrop to all this has been the rise of digital media, which has turned runway shows into powerful consumer marketing events that brands cannot cash in on if products have not yet even been produced.</p> <p>Burberry\u2019s chief executive, Christopher Bailey, described the show as a \u201cspecial moment\u201d that was the \u201cculmination of a series of important changes we made, designed to bring our collections closer to our customer.</p> <p>\u201cThe changes we are making will allow us to build a closer connection between the experience that we create with our runway shows and the moment when people can physically explore the collections for themselves,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The usual fashion business cycle sees buyers examining new collections in the wake of the runway show and then placing their orders. But, this year, Burberry let important buyers and press view its new designs back in July, provided they agreed to keep its secrets. Rather than the world\u2019s most beautiful women parading the key looks around the room, it is understood the industry\u2019s power brokers studied mannequins on a rotating carousel in a showroom at its London headquarters.</p> <p>\u201cOur brand is about moving forward,\u201d Bailey told the <em>Financial Times</em> after Monday\u2019s show. \u201cBut we\u2019re testing things out, seeing what we will be able to [do] better in future. We\u2019ve had to look at every facet of the business, from the suppliers, factories, media, every level of the process, to see how it works. And we\u2019ll learn from this and build from there.\u201d</p> <p>Despite its 160 years in fashion, Burberry has not resisted the encroachment of technology. It was one of the first luxury brands to embrace digital and social media, with a ground-breaking runway show streamed on Facebook, as well as YouTube and WeChat.</p> <p>But it may be harder for smaller brands to follow Burberry\u2019s lead. The FTSE 100 trenchcoat maker, which has a market value of around \u00a36bn, is able to shake up its supply chain because it has a lot of control: the company owns a number of factories and has an extensive company-run store network.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"363db9dfc4c4c51029150326b7d2b749e2481a41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/363db9dfc4c4c51029150326b7d2b749e2481a41/0_278_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Burberry shop in central Manchester.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Burberry shop in central Manchester.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By closing the time gap and effectively hanging price tags out on the runway, Burberry is primed to cash in on the latent sales potential within the social media buzz. But other brands may struggle to follow suit because of the upheaval involved, says Moran. \u201cAll the brands definitely can\u2019t,\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019d spoken to a number of people who said \u2018I\u2019d love to but it just doesn\u2019t work for us\u2019 and others who said \u2018I wouldn\u2019t want that to be how we worked\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cBurberry is a global brand with a huge network of stores and its own e-commerce platform. A small-to-medium-sized brand working from a studio in east London can\u2019t physically do it. Making people change the way they work is only something that brands of Burberry\u2019s influence can do. Burberry has the power to say, \u2018You\u2019re not in charge any more\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Smaller brands have started to test out what this new faster fashion model can do for sales, with British designers Alice Temperley and Oliver Spencer using fledgling social media platform Vero to enable fans of their designs to purchase pieces from their recent fashion-week collections. Temperley, who is on the British Fashion Council advisory board, said the tactic had enabled the brand to get closer to its customers: \u201cThis is a dynamic industry and we need to embrace change.\u201d</p> <p>Vero\u2019s chief executive, Ayman Hariri, says that rather than have an algorithm lobbing ads at its members, users have chosen to hear from brands they like in their news feeds, so companies are pushing on an open door.</p> <p>\u201cWhereas in the noughties the website was the method brands used to connect with their audience, today it is social networks and apps,\u201d he says. \u201c\u2018See now, buy now\u2019 is a big step into the future and it will take time for brands to come to terms with it, as it requires a lot of investment ahead of time in order to have the stock ready. Time will tell how it shapes up.\u201d</p> <p>While the Burberry show had a romantic, ethereal quality in keeping with Woolf\u2019s classic novel, the company\u2019s dealings with investors are more down to earth amid tough market conditions. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/18/burberry-cut-jobs-product-range-save-100m-a-year-profit-fall\" title=\"\">profits were down 10%</a> as a result of flagging demand for luxury goods in markets such as China and Russia, and it is cutting costs to improve its financial performance.</p> <p>The point of \u201csee now, buy now\u201d is ultimately to sell clothes and the City will be poring over its next set of figures to get a sense of how far this leap into the unknown has taken the brand.</p> <p>\u201cI think the jury is out on this model, even though the logic is sound,\u201d says Lorna Hall, head of market intelligence, at trend forecaster WGSN. \u201cWhy wait six months to sell your products when you\u2019ve just spent millions of pounds creating a big hullabaloo?\u201d</p> <p>Hall points out that the whole industry has not jumped on the bandwagon, with the major Italian and French labels yet to get involved. \u201cBurberry and Tommy Hilfiger have a position because they are very digitally focused and that has pushed them further into this space than anybody else,\u201d she explains. \u201cI think it will be evolution, not revolution. Everyone will wait and see what kind of impact it has on Burberry\u2019s sales.\u201d</p> <p>Moran confesses that the day after the Burberry show, he popped into a store to try on a shirt that caught his eye on the runway. \u201cI had been hooked in by \u2018see now, buy now\u2019 and went in to try it on \u2013 and it was sold out. I had been sucked in and obviously a number of other people had been, too.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>For a brief moment back there, I thought Labour had a chance to reconnect with the power supply of the British public. The jolt of Brexit had energised politics; half the country was distraught and desperate for effective opposition; and people at every level of our party recognised a responsibility to bring Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s experimental retro-70s leadership to a swift end.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6fee56f39fe8bd218d37512bb7087534c4c7d8d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fee56f39fe8bd218d37512bb7087534c4c7d8d8/378_75_2357_2945/800.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Baldwin\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Baldwin</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But in the weeks that followed, we went back to talking to ourselves about ourselves, as the public turned away in disgust. Supporters of Corbyn plot to complete their project to change the party \u2013 not transform the country \u2013 with threats to deselect MPs. His opponents whine that too many people are voting in leadership elections and obsess over procedural manoeuvres to thwart them.</p> <p>The solution is not to paper over the cracks, \u201cget the band back together\u201d or to concoct a face-saving formula allowing MPs to resume their shadow cabinet careers serving a man in whom they have declared no confidence.</p> <p>Instead, we need to find an honest, dignified way of opening our party and our thinking up to the millions of voters worried about the future of our economy, democracy and country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/24/labour-leadership-election-result-jeremy-corbyn-owen-smith-appeals-for-unity-politics-live\">Jeremy Corbyn sweeps to victory increasing his mandate as Labour leader - Politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>MPs who refuse to sit on the frontbench do not need to sit around moaning about Corbyn nor limit their ambition to avoiding deselection. They should organise within the PLP a 2020 group to do the hard policy work needed if Labour is ever to form a government again. Far too much mainstream Labour policy thinking is as trapped in the 1990s as Corbyn is trapped in the 1970s. So we need to reapply our values to the modern challenges of a global, digital world, where the populist right is on the march.</p> <p>The 2020 group should launch properly-funded policy commissions on subjects ranging from migration to the changing nature of work, with findings published before next year\u2019s conference. This will give MPs a serious platform for necessary debate that is not interpreted purely through the prism of parliamentary plotting against the leadership.</p> <p>Indeed, the best \u2013 perhaps only \u2013 way to remove Corbyn is by fighting on the same set of rules he has exploited so successfully. That means signing up more members than Momentum. Those who want the chance to be leader in the future need to earn it by beginning a national campaign to sign up half a million mainstream Labour members over the next two years.</p> <p>It is no small task. But I do not understand how almost an entire generation of mainstream Labour MPs can throw their hands up in horror at the prospect of trying to recruit more members than a far-left fringe that has just emerged from the woods. Presumably, they went into politics because they felt they had some skill in winning support. Now is the time they need to demonstrate such talents by expanding, not shrinking, the selectorate.</p> <p><em>Tom Baldwin is a former director of communications and strategy at the Labour party </em></p>",
  "<p>Scientists have pinpointed a promising new source of antibiotics: ants. They have found that some species \u2013 including leaf-cutter ants from the Amazon \u2013 use bacteria to defend their nests against invading fungi and microbes.</p> <p>Chemicals excreted by the bacteria as part of this fight have been shown to have particularly powerful antibiotic effects and researchers are now preparing to test them in animals to determine their potential as medicines for humans.</p> <p>Doctors say new antibiotics are urgently needed as superbug resistance to standard antimicrobial agents spreads. More than 700,000 people globally now die of drug-resistant infections each year, it is estimated \u2013 and some health officials say this figure could be even higher.</p> <p>Last week, UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/20/un-declaration-antibiotic-drug-resistance\" title=\"\">speaking at the first general assembly meeting on drug-resistant bacteria</a>, said antimicrobial resistance was now a fundamental threat to global health.</p> <p>This was reiterated by Professor Cameron Currie of the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, one of the scientists involved in the ant research.</p> <p>\u201cAntibiotic resistance is a growing problem,\u201d he said last week. \u201cHowever, pinpointing new antibiotics using the standard technique of sampling soil for bacteria is tricky. On average, only one in a million strains proves promising. By contrast, we have uncovered a promising strain of bacteria for every 15 strains we have sampled from an ant\u2019s nest.\u201d</p> <p>Only a very specific group of ants are proving useful in this work, however. These are species that farm fungi in tropical regions in North and South America.</p> <p>\u201cThese ants forage for plant material, which they bring back to their nests and feed to a fungus,\u201d said Professor Jon Clardy of Harvard Medical School. \u201cThe fungus breaks down the plant material and the ants feed on the fungus.\u201d</p> <p>The strategy evolved around 15&#xa0;million years ago, and has proved highly successful. There are now more than 200 ant species that farm fungi. Most fungus-farming ants simply forage for bits of old leaf or grass on the ground, however. A few, like leaf-cutter ants, cut leaves from trees and bring them back in pieces to their nest. \u201cPlants are hard to digest, but fungi are good decomposers and break down plant material so ants can feed easily,\u201d said Ethan Van Arnam, also of Harvard Medical School.</p> <p>However, scientists have recently discovered that these nests are sometimes attacked by hostile fungi. \u201cThey kill off both the nest and its farmed fungus,\u201d said Clardy. \u201cIn turn, ants have developed defences revealed as white patches on their bodies. They look as if they had been dipped in powdered sugar. These patches are made of bacteria which the ant stores on its body. Crucially, these bacteria produce powerful antibiotic and antifungal agents.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/20/un-declaration-antibiotic-drug-resistance\">UN meeting tackles the 'fundamental threat' of antibiotic-resistant superbugs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In this way, ants nurture bacteria which in turn make antifungal and antibacterial agents that defend nests. More to the point, these bacteria are similar to the ones used by pharmaceutical companies to make antibiotics. A typical example is Apterostigma ants, whose bacterial strains have been isolated in Panama and brought back to Harvard by Van Arnam. Many show promising antibiotic activity, he told the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>\u201cThe ants don\u2019t always win,\u201d added Clardy. \u201cYou occasionally come across nests that have been overcome by invading fungi. But it is clear ants and their bacteria put up a very good fight, one that has been going on for millions of years. The result has been the production of some very interesting antibiotics.\u201d</p> <p>Clardy said foreign bacteria also attacked the ant\u2019s microbe defences. \u201cThe bacteria in the nests get a really good deal. They are protected and fed by ants. Other strains of bacteria want to take over that comfortable niche. It is the bacterial equivalent of <em>Game of Thrones</em>. Everyone is trying to kill off everyone else and get to the top. The result has been the development of some very powerful antibiotic weapons. These are the end products of an arms race that has been going on for 15&#xa0;million years. Our trick is to isolate the best of these weapons and use them to make new antibiotics for humans.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/19/englands-chief-medical-officer-warns-of-antibiotic-apocalypse\">England\u2019s chief medical officer warns of \u2018antibiotic apocalypse\u2019</a> </p> </aside>",

While that\u2019s well above the year\u2019s low of sub-$30 for both types of oil, prices are far under where they were in late 2014 when Opec embarked on its goal to seek market share.

That\u2019s because Opec is already overproducing about 1.5m barrels a day above its stated daily quota of 31.5m barrels. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a huge difference between maintaining production and cutting it,\u201d Hatfield said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/libya-civil-war-future-dark-fate-government-sealed-uk-cameron\">How Libya is slowly becoming 'Somalia on the Med'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Except for a few countries like Libya and Nigeria, which have reduced production because of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/libya-civil-war-future-dark-fate-government-sealed-uk-cameron\">internal strife</a>, many Opec producers are nearing maximum production, they said. So agreeing to a freeze at current high levels won\u2019t change the fact that Opec is the main reason why there\u2019s still an oversupply of oil globally. That overproduction means there\u2019s no need to tap the bulging inventories around the world, either. And without an agreement from non-Opec producers such as Russia, Opec likely won\u2019t budge because it doesn\u2019t want to lose market share, they said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb5f5a37611f077544f9dbfc9bb57bcedd7108f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb5f5a37611f077544f9dbfc9bb57bcedd7108f6/0_0_5103_3062/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unless Opec meaningfully cuts production, oil prices aren\u2019t likely to move out of their current $40 to $50 range this year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unless Opec meaningfully cuts production, oil prices aren\u2019t likely to move out of their current $40 to $50 range this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Geographic/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unless Opec meaningfully cuts production, oil prices aren\u2019t likely to move out of their current $40 to $50 range this year. It\u2019s possible that values may stay at the lower end of that level in the short-term because demand is looking shaky. Although US gasoline use was a record this year, Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at US Bank Wealth Management, said it still wasn\u2019t enough to draw down inventories. </p> <p>Those inventories won\u2019t come down anytime soon, either. Haworth, Roberts and Hatfield said the US is about to enter the \u201cshoulder season\u201d where people don\u2019t drive as much as they do in the summer and the weather is mild enough to not require heating oil. </p> <p>Then there\u2019s the International Energy Agency\u2019s reduced forecast for global oil demand for 2017, citing economic uncertainty, which may mean the imbalance between supply and demand will likely continue for now. </p> <p>For oil supply and demand to balance, Haworth said global production will need to drop enough that users start to tap the world\u2019s voluminous inventories, which he believes won\u2019t occur until 2017. Roberts said the earliest that may happen is spring 2017. If so, oil prices may finally rise above $50, he said. But not by much.</p> <p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we go back to $100 oil.

In 2003, his studio moved its headquarters from Berlin to New York, when Libeskind was selected as master planner for the World Trade Center redevelopment</em></p> <p>I grew up in a dreary industrial city called Lodz, where all the greyness of postwar Poland, conformity and communism shaped my childhood. We lived on a main street in a crumbling tenement building.</p> <p>When I went to see it recently, I realised what a limited environment it was. It had two small rooms and a kitchen, which also housed the bathtub. My parents slept in one room, and I slept in the living room with my sister. The only view we had was of the other side of the building, over a dismal little courtyard where people would beat their carpets. As a small boy, I\u2019d look out of the window and watch the dust.</p> <p>When I was 11, we moved to Israel, where I lived for three years on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/13/kibbutz-100-years-old-uncertain-future\">kibbutz</a> without my parents, who had gone to Tel Aviv to find work, and later in downtown Tel Aviv, in a white, square building that was inspired by Bauhaus ideas. On the kibbutz, I shared a dormitory with kids my own age and we studied or worked together, picking potatoes in the fields. It was a strange experience for me, moving from an intimate, hidden existence in Lodz to this open, beautiful landscape in Israel where I had the freedom to think and be myself on this collectivist farm.</p> <p>We emigrated to New York when I was a young teenager, and I found myself in the Bronx, living in one of the first social housing projects in the US. It was a tiny apartment with no air conditioning and everybody sat out on the fire escape at night. It was here that my interest in architecture began. We had a Formica kitchen table with curved edges and, when I started to study, I worked with a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-square\">T-square</a>; but because the table had a curved edge, I could never tell at precisely what point the angle was no longer a right angle. Perhaps this had a subliminal impact on my future thinking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b83bf18f5c01dea729183659b217bf611c2455a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b83bf18f5c01dea729183659b217bf611c2455a/9_59_1234_740/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Libeskind childhood home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018All the greyness of postwar Poland shaped my childhood\u2019: Libeskind back where he grew up, in Lodz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Libeskind</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nowadays, I live with my wife in Lower Manhattan, in an apartment that bears little resemblance to my childhood home. It\u2019s on the seventh floor of a former bank that was built in the early 1900s<strong>.</strong> Working with architects, I\u2019ve completely transformed the interior \u2013 all the walls have been removed and small windows replaced so we now have spectacular views of the New York skyline. There\u2019s little clutter. Natural light and good acoustics are important, as is the flow of space.</p> <p>There is only one room in the apartment with a door, and that\u2019s my daughter\u2019s bedroom: that argument I could not win. Our bedroom doesn\u2019t have a door \u2013 it is not a private space. I shared a dormitory in Israel so I grew up with a communal sense of space. I like it; my wife is not so keen.</p> <p>What I love about this apartment is that it is part of the bustle of New York. When I look out the window, I can see thousands of people on the streets, in the park and in buildings. Day and night, there\u2019s never a quiet moment. And our building is right on top of the subway line, so you can feel the vibrations travelling up from deep inside the building. I find it one of the most beautiful feelings. It\u2019s the same subway line I took to school when I was living in the Bronx. It\u2019s where I live and work \u2013 a place I continue to be deeply connected to.</p> <h2><strong>Julia Barfield </strong><br></h2> <p><em>Barfield, 63, is a director at </em><a href=\"http://www.marksbarfield.com/#/projects/\"><em>Marks Barfield Architects</em></a><em>.

Growing up, I lived with my parents and sister in a late-Victorian, four-bedroom mansion block flat in West Kensington. The flat was T-shaped and all of the rooms to the right-hand side of the central corridor looked out on to the street. At the end of the T was a small kitchen, where we held all our birthday parties and made dens. I would run up and down the corridor, playing with the cat. We shared the flat with two lodgers; I shared a room with my sister until our early teens.</p> <p>I remember looking out of our bedroom window one afternoon, watching prefabs coming off the back of lorries and being slotted together. It was the early 1960s, so there were still quite a lot of bomb sites in our neighbourhood. To watch these houses being built, with people moving in the very next week, was amazing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"233e10897e6ba153071c43064651db314312bd5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/233e10897e6ba153071c43064651db314312bd5c/12_25_2589_1553/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julia Barfield childhood home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The fact that I grew up in a flat made me unafraid of them\u2019: Julia Barfield in her parents\u2019 kitchen, at her fifth birthday party.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julia Barfield</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fact that I grew up in a flat made me unafraid of them. We didn\u2019t really have any outdoor space, apart from balconies that my father filled with flowers, so we played on the street or took the bus to Holland Park, to one of London\u2019s first adventure playgrounds.</p> <p>My husband and I moved to our current home in south London, in the 1970s, when we were students. Back then, it was virtually derelict, so there was a lot of self-build involved. It\u2019s an end-of-terrace built in the 1840s. In the early 1980s it was under threat of demolition, but eventually the planners decided to make it a conservation area.</p> <p>When we started having children, we built a shed on the side, which served as an office, then a playroom. But then we built the London Eye and eventually had enough money to transform the house. Now, it is as green as can be: highly insulated, with an air-source heat pump, double glazing, underfloor heating and two green roofs to encourage biodiversity. The kitchen is still the heart of the house.</p> <p>Our firm hasn\u2019t done a lot of residential work, but in 2002 we did propose a tower called <a href=\"http://www.marksbarfield.com/#/projects/skyhouse/?null\">Skyhouse</a>. It was our suggestion for solving London\u2019s housing crisis: high-density with mixed tenancies, renewable energies and communal facilities. It was slightly ahead of its time. Towers were still associated with council blocks, so we never got to build it; but we put it out there as an idea. It has contributed to the discussion about high-density living \u2013 perhaps it\u2019s something we will revisit in the future.</p> <h2><strong>John Pawson </strong><br></h2> <p><em>Pawson, 67, is renowned for his minimalist buildings.

I\u2019m not against it, but it means different things to different people. In my terms, minimalism doesn\u2019t mean painting it white and not having any possessions; for me, it\u2019s about clarity \u2013 trying to get to the essence of things.</p> <p>I grew up in the house I was born in. Looking back, I can see where my minimalist aesthetic came from. The house was near the edge of the Yorkshire moors, a treeless landscape. Growing up, we were encouraged not to set much store by material things. Of course, that\u2019s easy to say, coming from a comfortable middle-class family. And we didn\u2019t live in a minimal place \u2013 my mother liked antiques, but she also promoted a very attractive modesty. She tended to wear one suit, but it was a Chanel suit.</p> <p>My parents bought the house after the second world war. It was part 16th-century and it incorporated a Norman arch, so it had a lot of character. My father was in the rag trade. He manufactured women\u2019s dresses, so he loved quality. In fact, I think he built the most expensive orangery, probably ever. I now know where I get it from.</p> <p>These days, most people want what I had when I was growing up: one room in which everything happened. For us it was the kitchen. It seemed there was always an architect laying out plans on the kitchen table, always workmen around, always a project.</p> <p>My room was the smallest, and each time one of my sisters left home my dad would knock a wall down between rooms. In the end, I had a giant room with nothing more in it. And aside from the orangery, my father also renovated a cottage and the lodge on the property. At 16 or 17 I moved into the cottage and, of course, I changed it. I simplified it, stripped it out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3ace3c881fef70a72b22ef2e12628e581e96cd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3ace3c881fef70a72b22ef2e12628e581e96cd9/5_15_1757_1054/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pawson childhood home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We didn\u2019t live in a minimal place\u2019: Pawson\u2019s childhood home dates back to the 16th century.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pawson House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I now live in a 19th-century row house in Notting Hill, west London. My wife, Catherine, found it and put in an offer before I had even seen the place, because the setting is so unusual \u2013 there are uninterrupted views over communal gardens. It\u2019s in a conservation area, so we had to keep the facade, but I opened up the back and redrew the floor plans. The interiors are designed around the way we live, with everything we need and nothing we don\u2019t. As in my parents\u2019 house, the kitchen table is the main gathering place \u2013 it\u2019s where we talk, eat, work and sit down with family and friends. Whatever else is different, I like to think my parents would recognise the atmosphere of the place, and feel at home.</p> <p>I never intended to be an architect. I came to the profession late, after working for my father for six years. I remember him saying: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just hire an architect? Why would you want to be one?\u201d But I think he knew that it was where I found pleasure.</p> <p>I\u2019ve spent the past few years working on London\u2019s new Design Museum. The existing building is fairly iconic from the outside; I wanted to slightly calm it down so that the objects become more potent than my work inside the building.</p> <p>People say I am uncompromising and detail-orientated, and I am \u2013 qualities I definitely got from my father. And I tend to attract clients who are even more so \u2013 they are happy to push me up a mountain if necessary.</p> <h2><strong>Adam Willis </strong><br></h2> <p><em>Willis, 29, is a founding member of </em><a href=\"http://assemblestudio.co.uk/\"><em>Assemble</em></a><em>, a collaborative practice of young artists, designers and architects based in London.

The oldest part of the house was a cottage that dates back to the early 1600s. There is a more recent, 19th-century, timber-framed structure that was badly adapted before my parents bought the house in the early 1980s. They erected new timbers, replaced the roof and built a small extension and a studio for my dad to work in. I grew up around building work.</p> <p>My father is a sculptor, so he was hands-on with the work around the house \u2013 and you can see his involvement. The floor is intricately laid, for example: it\u2019s made from different widths and lengths of elm notched together. I have strong memories of my father laying and oiling those boards.</p> <p>Building was an early obsession. I used to ask my mum to make me packed lunches so I could eat lunch with the builders on site. By the age of about 14, I had become obsessed with woodwork. I was given some wood for my birthday, which I used to build a workbench that is still in the studio \u2013 I go back and use it.</p> <p>At 18, I built a modern timber and glass extension with my dad. The house now shows a progression of timber-framed construction: from the old cottage at one end to that extension at the other.</p> <p>The home I am currently living in couldn\u2019t be more different. I\u2019m renting a flat on the 31st floor of a tower block in the Barbican, in the City of London, with three other architects and a fashion designer. We\u2019ve been here for two years, and it\u2019s an incredibly uplifting place to live.</p> <p>The flat has most of its original features: the kitchen, cupboards and fittings. I\u2019ve made a few pieces of furniture, such as a simple elm dining table. The bedrooms are arranged along one side and each opens out on to a balcony that wraps around the entire flat. It has generous proportions, with a large, open-plan living and dining room that overlooks north and east London. There\u2019s a solidity to everything that is satisfying. And being up so high is an amazing experience in itself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c56f2395c4d1684c703169903f647c5725461276\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c56f2395c4d1684c703169903f647c5725461276/25_303_5569_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Willis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s an incredibly uplifting place to live\u2019: Adam Willis at his flat at the Barbican, London \u2013 his block is identical to the one he overlooks here.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s striking is that the singular vision of the architect is apparent throughout the estate, from the master-planning right through to the kitchen taps.

They bought it in 1955 for \u00a32,500. They were the first generation of gentrifiers to move to Islington. The house they bought in Canonbury had been a rooming house. Every room had a Yale lock on it and there were stoves on the landing. They turned it back into a family home.</p> <p>My father, Gordon, was an architect. He combined the main living rooms into one enormous room, replacing the central main wall on the ground floor with two amazing <a href=\"http://www.wood-database.com/pitch-pine/\">pitch pine</a> columns that were beautiful. He ripped out the fireplaces, installed a downstairs toilet and replaced the florid, Victorian cornices in the main living room with a sleek and simple design of his own. There was a sense of modernising it and adapting it to suit the needs of a growing family, but keeping elements of its period.</p> <p>He also designed and built us a second home in Hampshire, inspired by the early work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jul/20/frank-lloyd-wright-and-the-zombie-building-boom\">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>. It was a brick box surrounded by courtyard gardens. It was open plan, with exposed brick walls, flat roofed and low lying in the landscape. It was built when I was about eight, and we went there every summer. My father talked about it obsessively.</p> <p>I loved that building, but we lost interest in the house when we were teenagers, so my parents sold it. It has been added to, so it has lost that essence of being a simple holiday house. Likewise, when we sold the London house, my friend saw my father\u2019s pine pillars in a skip \u2013 the new owners had stripped them out. I was upset to hear that.</p> <p>In a way, the two homes are combined in the Straw House, in London, where I live and work. We\u2019ve got the open-plan living space that my father created in my childhood home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"515bc39bd0072335b38ba7837136feaad1d3ec6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/515bc39bd0072335b38ba7837136feaad1d3ec6d/84_174_5335_3201/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Wigglesworth childhood home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I loved that building\u2019: the Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired home where Wigglesworth spent many of her childhood summers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Wigglesworth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Growing up, one thing I enjoyed about my home was its hybridity.

It was a village with utopian ambitions; a vision of what rural India could look like after independence. People from all over the world came through the village, drawn by Gandhi\u2019s legacy. Education was at its heart.</p> <p>My father was an art teacher and my mother a nurse. The house we lived in was a simple, symmetrical structure with a deep veranda, two good-sized rooms, and a bathroom and kitchen. On summer days, we closed the windows and hung dampened vetiver mats over the doorways, so the hot winds turned into a cool, scented breeze that filled the house.</p> <p>On summer nights, we would sleep out in the open. I have a fond memory of my mum pointing out the constellations before we fell asleep. In the winter it was the other way round \u2013 taking the sun in the day and sleeping inside at night.</p> <p>The walls were made of wattle and daub, and we had timber-trussed roofs, plain interlocking tiles and wide eaves. The house was raised off the ground to keep it dry during the monsoons. These, and the summer heat, took their toll on the house, so every spring there was a celebratory redecoration. The walls were coated with a slurry of mud and a sterile cow dung derivative, which repelled insects.</p> <p>The house sat in the middle of a rose garden surrounded by fields. Seasonally, there would be sweet potatoes and bananas on one side and an orange grove on the other. There was also a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delonix_regia\">gulmohar tree</a>, which had fern-like branches and beautiful red flowers.</p> <p>The community thrived in the mid-50s and our house was very much in the middle of that. My father built an art school next door \u2013 his passion. One of my first memories is pointing the flagstones in the veranda when I was four; I was given a little trowel. It\u2019s nice to think that this was the beginning of my architectural career, further encouraged by the Meccano set my father found in a junk shop.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"eed0c56277e2f5d70e26769d0cb61f0c8ba34e3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eed0c56277e2f5d70e26769d0cb61f0c8ba34e3e/2_20_339_203/339.jpg\" alt=\"Sunand Prasad childhood home\" width=\"339\" height=\"203\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018On summer days the hot winds turned into a cool, scented breeze\u2019: the house where Sunand Prasad grew up, in rural India.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sunand Prasad</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Looking back, it was a truly sustainable lifestyle: simple, enjoyable and stylish. All those things were influential to me.</p> <p>Of the places I have lived in, the most comparable since was a home friends and I built in east London using recycled materials, as part of a housing co-operative. We raised our children there. It linked with other houses across back gardens and had a sense of community reminiscent of my childhood. I would love one day to build a house that is as regenerative as nature, wasting nothing.</p> <h2><strong>Terry Farrell </strong><br></h2> <p><em>Farrell, 78, founded </em><a href=\"http://farrells.com/\"><em>his own practice</em></a><em> in 1980.

I grew up the child of a postman and then went to grammar school, so I was part of that transition.</p> <p>I was born on the outskirts of Manchester. When I was eight, we moved to the Grange council estate three miles north of Newcastle upon Tyne. We lived there from 1946 to 1954 in a prefab and a brick house. The prefab was well-designed: a lightweight aluminium frame clad in asbestos. It had an image problem, though. After four years, we moved into a brick house on the other side of the estate. It was handcrafted rather than factory-made, but it had smaller windows and the kitchen wasn\u2019t as functional.</p> <p>I still live in the middle of a housing estate. Thirty years ago, I bought a disused factory in a deprived ward in Westminster. It was built in the 1920s and requisitioned during the second world war by a tyre and aeroworks company. I bought it for \u00a310 a square foot.</p> <p>My offices occupy the ground and first floors, and for the past 15 years I have lived with my wife in the roof. It\u2019s a steel-framed, rough-and-ready space of 3,500 sq ft with no separate bedroom or study. I\u2019ve never adjusted to a desk, study or studio \u2013 my home is my workplace.</p> <p>Although it is industrial, there are lots of plants and trees inside, and on my roof terrace.

  "<p>A small town in Ontario, Canada, has prompted fresh scrutiny of the bottled-water industry after its attempt secure a long-term water supply through the purchase of a well was outbid by the food and drinks multinational Nestl\u00e9.<br></p> <p>When authorities in Centre Wellington, population of about 30,000, learned that Nestl\u00e9 had put a bid on a spring water well in their region, they scrambled over the summer to counter with a competing bid. The goal was to safeguard a water supply for the township\u2019s fast-growing population, Kelly Linton, the mayor, told the Guardian. \u201cBy 2041, we\u2019ll be closer to 50,000 so protecting our water sources is critical to us.\u201d </p> <p>Using a numbered company, the municipality submitted what Linton described as an \u201caggressive bid\u201d for the five-hectare site. \u201cWe put in more money than they did and we removed all conditions.\u201d He declined to specify the exact amount of the bid. </p> <p>An agreement forged with Nestl\u00e9 after its initial bid, made 18 months earlier, gave the company the right to respond. \u201cThey had the opportunity to match our offer and that\u2019s how we lost on that on that one,\u201d said Linton. </p> <p>The news was met with disappointment in the community. \u201cAs you can appreciate we aren\u2019t going to be outbidding Nestl\u00e9,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a small town we\u2019re using taxpayer dollars, so we have to be good stewards of that.\u201d</p> <p>Nestl\u00e9 Canada currently has permits that allow it to extract up to 4.7m litres of water a day from sources in Ontario. <a href=\"http://www.nestle-waters.ca/en/water-sources-n-quality/middlebrook-project/your-questions-our-answers\">On its website,</a> the company noted that its latest acquisition \u2013 the well also sought by Centre Wellington \u2013 would be a source to supplement other operations in the region, as well as support future business growth. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/sep/2016-09-23T21:22:01.html\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/sep/2016-09-23T21:22:01.html\">map</a> </figure>  <p>In a statement to the Guardian, Nestl\u00e9 Waters Canada said it wasn\u2019t aware that the counter-offer was from the township of Centre Wellington until well after the purchase was made.</p> <p>The site, noted the statement, was formerly a permitted water bottling facility. \u201cThe former owner had the property on the market for over 10 years.\u201d </p> <p>Ontario\u2019s ministry of the environment and climate change has yet to approve their application to carry out a pump test, said the company. \u201cAny decision whether to draw from the source will not be made until we have conducted testing, validated by a third party, on the quality and quantity of the water. Nestl\u00e9 wants to ensure there is no negative impact on the watershed and surrounding ecosystem.\u201d</p> <p>The company, added the statement, would continue its \u201congoing dialogue\u201d with the community of Centre Wellington. </p> <p><a href=\"http://wellingtonwaterwatchers.ca/\">Wellington Water Watchers</a>, a volunteer-run organisation dedicated to the protection of water resources, said it would seek to block the company as it moves forward with its plans. \u201cWe are fighting tooth and nail to not allow that pump test to go ahead,\u201d said Mike Nagy of the group. </p> <p>The water in the well is artesian spring water, he said, making it particularly valuable to consumers outside of Canada. </p> <p>The failed bid comes amid growing calls for the Ontario government to reevaluate how it grants permits to the bottled-water industry. Last month, after a severe drought triggered questions about the millions of litres a day of water being sold to bottled-water companies in the province, Kathleen Wynne, Ontario\u2019s premier, promised a government review into the practice. </p> <p>Government policies, she noted, had failed to keep up with the times. \u201cThirty years ago, we wouldn\u2019t have envisioned an industry that took water and put it in plastic bottles so that people could carry it around,\u201d she said.</p> <p>On Friday, she reiterated her view that bottled water companies should be considered differently from other industries that use water, such as mining or construction. \u201cI think we have to look very closely at what those companies are paying, what they\u2019re allowed to take, and that\u2019s exactly the work the ministry of environment and climate change is doing right now,\u201d she told reporters. </p> <p>The province currently charges C$3.71 for every million litres of water, along with a permit fee of up to C$3,000 depending on the risk of environmental impact. </p> <p>Nagy, whose organisation is calling for an eventual ban on permits for the bottled-water industry, cautioned that price shouldn\u2019t be the only focus of the government\u2019s review. \u201cIf I stood on top of an aquifer and threw $100 bills on the ground, it\u2019s not going to create anymore water,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the levy and charges in the world will not create more water.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><strong>My kitchen is \u2026</strong> a corner of our living room.

There is clearly an overlap between certain aspects of work on security and climate change but such a significant shift suggests this is more about a political agenda to satisfy other ministers who have designs on DfID\u2019s budget.\u201d</p> <p>Mark Lowcock, DfID\u2019s permanent secretary, <a href=\"http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/international-development-committee/the-work-of-the-department-for-international-development/oral/38446.html\">told the committee last week</a> that internationally set rules governed what counted as aid, and that activities such as peacekeeping could count as such.</p> <p>\u201cWhether it passes through the MoD budget or the FCO budget or our budget is irrelevant to whether it scores as aid or not,\u201d he added.</p> <p>\u201cThe rules were broadened very slightly at the beginning of this year, because there was a wide agreement that there are some things that should appropriately be scored as development assistance, like training the military on human rights and sexual crime, which was not being scored as aid and was creating a perverse incentive. Both the MoD and we are doing more of that, but it only scores as aid because it fits within the rules.\u201d</p> <p>Saira O\u2019Mallie, interim UK Director of the ONE Campaign, said: \u201cBritish taxpayers must be assured that any department spending UK aid will adopt the same high standards of transparency as DfID, with a focus on the poorest countries. </p> <p>\u201cWithout that guarantee we would exercise caution because ODA\u2019s primary purpose is to tackle extreme poverty. Our aid budget cannot be diverted to countries or areas solely for our strategic interests.</p> <p>\u201cDfID spending is among the most transparent in the world, while the MoD and FCO have previously come under fire, having ranked poorly by international standards.

  "<p>I started trampolining when I was six. I\u2019m the youngest of five, and all three of my sisters did gymnastics. Once, when we were bouncing on the trampoline in our back garden, I accidentally did a tuck-back \u2013 basically, a backflip. My mum was worried I\u2019d get injured, so she took me to classes. I\u2019ve now represented Great Britain at three world championships.</p> <p>A typical competition routine consists of 10 moves. There are a lot of elements the judges are looking at, including how high you jump, where you land on the trampoline, your shape and the difficulty of the routine. I\u2019m usually pretty out of breath after finishing: 10 times you push yourself as high as you can in the air, spinning as hard as you can.</p> <p>When you\u2019re at the top of the jump, there\u2019s a brief feeling of weightlessness. Everything slows down, everything is calm and it feels like you\u2019re flying. It\u2019s amazing. Then, on your way back down, you can feel the air rushing back up. We jump so high that, when we hit the trampoline, we experience the same amount of G-force as a Formula One driver going around a corner.</p> <p>It feels great, but it puts a lot of stress on your bones and muscles. I\u2019m currently recovering from a stress fracture in my right foot. The stronger you are, the higher you can jump and the easier it is to hold your positions, so I do a lot of strength and conditioning training \u2013 gym-based workouts that target specific muscles.</p> <p>My friends think it\u2019s cool. I show them videos and they\u2019re like: \u201cWow, what was that flippy, twisty thing?\u201d This year, Bryony Page won a silver medal at the Rio Olympics \u2013 Britain\u2019s first in trampolining. That was amazing to watch. A lot of people see trampolining as a way to muck around in the garden; now they can see there\u2019s actually a whole sport behind it. Hopefully that will inspire a lot more people to get involved. </p> <h2>My weekend workout</h2> <p><strong>How often do you train?</strong> Four to five times a week.</p> <p><strong>Proudest achievement?</strong> Winning a silver medal in my age group at the 2014 world championships.</p> <p><strong>Hardest move?</strong> A Miller \u2013 a double backwards somersault with three full twists.</p> <h2>Five ways to get started</h2> <p><strong>1</strong> If you wanted to jump on flat ground, you\u2019d bend your knees slightly and push into the floor. It\u2019s the same in trampolining: keeping a slight flex in your legs, push the trampoline down, which in turn will push you up.<br></p> <p><strong>2</strong> The key thing is to land with flat feet: this gives you a greater surface area in contact with the equipment, so you can push the trampoline properly and gain more height.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> The trampolines we use have small holes on the surface and you don\u2019t want to catch your toes in them. Olympic gymnasts wear specialist shoes; for beginners, thick socks are a must.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Trampoline gymnastics isn\u2019t just for kids. The adult classes I used to run in Sheffield had a waiting list. It\u2019s one of the best forms of full-body fitness you can do, and it\u2019s great fun.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> The best way to learn is in a club under supervision. Things can go wrong, so it\u2019s better to do it in the safest environment possible.

  "<p>Earlier this week British activist and researcher Andy Hall was found guilty of criminal defamation and computer crimes in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/20/british-activist-found-guilty-thailand-report-alleging-labour-abuses\" draggable=\"true\">shock ruling by a Bangkok criminal court</a> in Thailand. He was given a three-year prison sentence, suspended for two years, and fined 150,000 baht (\u00a33,330).<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The charges related to the publication of a report based on the worker interviews that he carried out in 2012 for Finnwatch, the Finnish civil society organisation of which I am the director. Migrant workers interviewed by Andy alleged that rights violations were occurring during the production of the pineapple juice products made by Natural Fruits that have been sold in Finland and other European countries. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Without people like Andy, who exposes challenges and proposes solutions, Thailand's export industries are at risk</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Natural Fruit denies the allegations in the report. But rather than fully engaging with us as we prepared it, they instead sued Andy for his research. He was personally accused of defaming Natural Fruit, distributing Finnwatch report\u2019s findings on the internet and creating serious business impacts and loss of face for the company. <br></p> <p>During the long court hearings over this summer, Finland\u2019s largest retailer, S Group, who had stopped purchasing from Natural Fruit, testified that their decision had not been because of the Finnwatch report, but because Natural Fruit refused internationally recognised social responsibility audits. Thai companies testified that Andy\u2019s research was beneficial to improving labour practices. I testified that Finnwatch was responsible for both writing the report and publishing it \u2013 not Andy Hall. Still, in a surprise to the whole world, Andy was found guilty, even seemingly for events that didn\u2019t appear on the charge sheet he was indicted for. </p> <p>The court verdict is a clear sign that Thailand wants to stop Andy\u2019s work and his criticism of conditions in the country\u2019s labour-intensive export industries, which contribute so much to the Thai GDP. Andy is everything that a good human rights activist is: loud, persistent and undoubtedly annoying to those who end up on the wrong side of his criticism. He has lived in Thailand for more than 10 years and knows the domestic media, key civil society and business actors well. He is just as comfortable at the grassroots level, listening to migrant workers talk about their real-life challenges, as he is working within international forums, and on high-level diplomatic and media terrains. He is just as convincing in Thai as he is in English.</p> <p>The exposure of human rights violations, human trafficking and forced labour has cast a shadow over Thailand\u2019s reputation over the last decade. Diminishing trust has led to business enterprises changing their attitudes towards the country, which has become subject to increased scrutiny. Independent auditing of Thai factories has become more frequent. Some companies have stopped purchasing from the country altogether.</p> <p>But boycotts do not help to solve the problems and Thailand is too big an exporter for most businesses to replace in the short term. Thai and international companies have therefore turned to civil society for assistance \u2013 and one of those people they have asked for assistance is Andy Hall. He has been instrumental in building a dialogue between European companies and Thailand\u2019s labour intensive export industries. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/15/activists-terrorists-foreign-puppets-mohammad-halabi\">Human rights activists are being portrayed as terrorists and foreign puppets  | Danny Sriskandarajah</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maina Kiai, a UN special rapporteur, <a href=\"https://www.boell.de/en/2016/09/13/interview-maina-kiai-our-ideas-keep-living\">has warned</a> about closing space for people to engage with governments. He says that civil society can play a role like unlocking the lid on a pressure cooker, just as the heat is increasing and the cooker is about to explode. Andy has been keeping an eye on Thailand\u2019s own pressure cooker, voicing the concerns of millions of migrant workers, who are invaluable to the Thai economy but remain unorganised and without their own voice. Without people like Andy, who exposes challenges and proposes workable solutions, Thailand\u2019s export industries are at risk and that ambition to reach consumer markets in Europe is unlikely to be achieved.</p> <p>Several organisations in Europe have publicly stated their support for Andy. The UK\u2019s Ethical Trading Initiative expressed \u201cserious concerns\u201d over the guilty verdict. The Foreign Trade Association, which represents 1,500 European companies, said it considered his guilty verdict \u201ca sad setback for human rights\u201d. That business enterprises take a stand in support of a human rights defender is unprecedented.</p> <p>When I spoke with Andy, he was adamant that we should not think that this case was just about him. Many migrant workers with whom he works closely with have been devastated by the verdict. If this can happen to Andy, who has a British passport and the support of the world behind him, what chance do they have to stand up for their rights, they ask?</p> <p>Thailand should wake up and realise before it\u2019s too late that the justice system and medieval laws that can be abused to stifle freedom of expression are about to lose the keys to the solution.</p> <p><em>Sonja Vartiala is executive director of Finnwatch </em><br></p>",
  "<p>Were Syrians wise to revolt? Aren\u2019t they worse off now? Such questions misapprehend the situation. Syrians didn\u2019t decide out of the blue to destroy a properly functioning state. The state had been destroying them, and itself, for decades. In <em>No Knives in the Kitchens of This City</em>, Khaled Khalifa, poet, screenwriter and Syria\u2019s most celebrated contemporary novelist, chronicles this long political, social and cultural collapse, the \u201cincubator of contemporary demons\u201d.</p> <p>The story stretches back to the first world war and forward to the American occupation of Iraq, but our narrator\u2019s \u201cill-omened birth\u201d coincides with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1963_Syrian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat\">1963 Ba\u2019athist coup.</a> The regime starts off as it means to continue. The maternity hospital is looted and emptied of patients. The schools and universities are purged; only pistol-toting loyalist professors survive. Public and individual horizons shrink as the president\u2019s powers grow through emergency law, exceptional courts and three-hour news broadcasts covering \u201csacred directives made to governors and ministers\u201d.</p> <p>The novel follows a large, well-drawn cast \u2013 a family, their friends, enemies and lovers \u2013 back and forth across three generations. This multiple focus and enormous scope turns the setting, Aleppo, into the novel\u2019s central character. \u201cCities die just like people,\u201d Khalifa writes. So ancient neighbourhoods are demolished and fields give way to spreading slums.</p> <p><em>No Knives in the Kitchens of This City</em> won the <a href=\"http://www.aucpress.com/t-nmmdescription.aspx?template=template_naguibmahfouz\">Naguib Mahfouz medal for literature</a>. As in many of Mahfouz\u2019s novels, Khalifa\u2019s urban environment develops a power somewhere between metaphor and symbol: \u201cThe alley was witness to the destruction of my mother\u2019s dreams, and the idea of this alley grew to encompass the length and breadth of the country.\u201d</p> <p>During the early 1980s war between the regime and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/muslim-brotherhood\">Muslim Brotherhood</a>, Aleppo became \u201ca place of retribution\u201d. This conflict was the setting for Khalifa\u2019s earlier prizewinner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/14/in-praise-hatred-khaled-khalifa-review\"><em>In Praise of Hatred</em></a>, but here the focus moves from political violence to the social and psychological violence \u2013 harassment, rape and suicide \u2013 that comes in its wake.</p> <p>The narrator\u2019s uncle, Nizar, is one of several gay characters. Scorned by half the family, once imprisoned for \u201csodomy\u201d and raped in jail by an imam, he finds brief freedom in Beirut, until his money runs out. Khalifa believes \u201cit is the duty of writing to help break down taboos and clash with fixed and backward concepts\u201d. He is by no means the first Arab novelist to write about homosexuality, but he treats the topic with greater sensitivity and sympathy than, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jan/23/alaa-al-aswany-interview-politically-egyptian-revolution\">Alaa al-Aswany</a> does in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/feb/17/fiction.featuresreviews\"><em>The Yacoubian Building</em></a>.</p> <p>Nizar\u2019s niece, Sawsan, who is \u201cirrepressible\u201d, swings between the extremes available. As a student, she joins a regime militia, informs on her friends and forcibly removes hijabs. After sojourns in Dubai and Paris, she returns home, has her hymen repaired and immerses herself in prayer. Her brother, Rashid, an accomplished violinist, experiences a similar trajectory. At first he wears earplugs and disdains \u201cthe herd\u201d; later, he throws himself into it, pursuing jihad in occupied Iraq.</p> <p>Shame is a key theme, and the general rage for orthodoxy: sexual, religious and political. A woman is stripped naked in the street for refusing to wear a badge bearing the president\u2019s face. And Aleppo\u2019s \u201ccapitulation to shame [is] made manifest in the posters and slogans and symbols hung on its walls\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The writing is superb \u2013 a dense, luxurious realism pricked with surprising metaphors</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is not surprising, in this context, that the characters are often depicted toiling hard to forget their desires, ugly compromises or snatches of happiness. But their willed forgetfulness contributes to the city\u2019s destruction: \u201cAleppo itself was as ephemeral as the act of forgetting; anything which remained of its true form would become a lie, reinvented by us day after day.\u201d</p> <p>So, argues Khalifa, people must commit to a desperate remembering. The past is \u201cthe sole reason for living\u201d, narrated \u201cin revenge for a present\u201d too terrible to contemplate. The novel (and Khalifa too, writing from Damascus) recalls Aleppo\u2019s cinemas and haute cuisine, music recitals and bar culture, prostitutes and shrines. It often sounds like an elevated form of gossip, each story generating more stories, every anecdote opening into further digression. It has the sense, too, of a lament: four out of five chapters, with an obsessive circularity, begin with the narrator\u2019s mother\u2019s death.</p> <p><em>No Knives in the Kitchens of this City</em> is intricately plotted, chronologically complicated and a pleasure to read. The profusion of characters defuses its narrative urgency, but gives it psychological and social depth. The writing is superb \u2013 a dense, luxurious realism pricked with surprising metaphors. It is lyrical, sensuous and so semantically rich that at times it resembles a prose poem, an effect occasionally marred by slightly clumsy translation.

  "<p>When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/12/david-cameron-to-stand-down-as-mp-for-witney\">David Cameron announced last week that he was resigning as an MP</a>, the nation\u2019s initial reaction was vague surprise that he was actually still around, followed swiftly by outrage that he was soon no longer to be so. That big quitter, I fumed, shocked that the tedious, glory-free grind of being an MP should hold few charms for a man whose idea of roughing it was taking a summer holiday in Cornwall instead of Tuscany. How on earth would Britain cope without that political titan on the back benches? Why, mere hours after he made his announcement, it emerged that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/12/bbc-loses-great-british-bake-off\">the Great British Bake Off was leaving the BBC</a>. The country was already falling apart!</p> <p>I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about Cameron\u2019s legacy this past week. Not his political legacy, because the closer you try to examine that, the faster it slips away, like grains of sand on a Padstow beach spraying behind you as you rush to make your reservation at Rick Stein\u2019s restaurant. One defender claimed last weekend that Cameron had left Britain \u201cstronger and fairer\u201d (had they not heard about Bake Off?), and cited as proof of Cameron\u2019s political nous his \u201cexhausting capacity for decision-making\u201d. This is like saying the best thing about a bad date was his \u201cstrong personality\u201d.</p> <p>So let\u2019s leave the politics to one side. Culturally, Cameron was epoch-defining. Partly this is because he played a double game throughout his time in office: in reality, he was part of an upper class, even aristocratic world; for the purposes of electability, he self-consciously tried to mute himself down to a humble upper middle class. He set about this the way anyone without an actual personality does: by making liberal reference to various cultural signifiers, something a country as class-obsessed as Britain picks up on keenly.</p> <p>Cameron was Downton Abbey meets Boden Man, and that anachronistic combination alone is indicative of how dated he already feels. Nothing makes 2010 feel longer ago than reading about Cameron\u2019s television boxset collection the year he moved into 10 Downing Street, details of which were proudly released to the press at the time (24, Desperate Housewives). Sure, anyone\u2019s TV preferences from six years ago would sound anachronistic, but I can\u2019t think of another politician who has appropriated so much and so shamelessly, from Angry Birds to Lana Del Rey to Game Of Thrones. Cameron thought the way to prove his modernity was to be a person composed of things, as opposed to a politician driven by convictions. A former PR man, he always seemed more brand than prime minister. And when Cameron went down, he took a whole load of those cultural signifiers with him.</p> <p>Most obviously, there\u2019s the Bullingdon Club. Last week it was reported that the Buller, as literally no one now calls it, had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/14/bullingdon-club-oxford-david-cameron-boris-johnson\">dwindled in membership from 30 to two people</a>. It seems that Cameron\u2019s brief involvement managed to do what two centuries of a reputation for extreme privilege and vandalism failed to achieve, and embarrassed the club into near nonexistence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/10/hadley-freeman-fashion-skinny-models-eating-disorders-body-image\">Don\u2019t blame the fashion world for the cult of skinny \u2013 even Roald Dahl plays his part | Hadley Freeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Eton, too, isn\u2019t looking so hot. An Old Etonian once explained to me that what the school gave its students was manners and confidence. But when its most high-profile graduate referendummed himself into political oblivion, this latter quality seemed diminished. Boris Johnson\u2019s appointment as foreign secretary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/14/maybe-the-brits-are-just-having-us-on-the-world-reacts-to-boris-johnson-as-foreign-minister\">was greeted as a global joke</a>, while Tom Hiddleston, who acts for a living, couldn\u2019t even convince the public he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/15/taylor-swift-tom-hiddleston-dating-rumors-photos-beach\">in an actual relationship with Taylor Swift</a>. Recent photographs of current Etonians hanging out with Vladimir Putin suggest that the old confidence is returning, but for a moment it looked as if Cameron broke Eton.</p> <p>These were David Cameron\u2019s aristocratic signifiers, the ones he didn\u2019t overtly brag about \u2013 and if there\u2019s one thing we know about the aristocracy, it\u2019s that it always survives. Instead, it is all the upper-middle-class stuff, which he clunkingly dropped into the public sphere to prove his aspirational-but-relatable realness, that he has ruined by association: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/apr/22/kitchen-suppers-francis-maude\">kitchen suppers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jun/11/david-cameron-daughter-behind-pub\">the Sunday lunches in gastropubs</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/aug/20/david-cameron-cornwall-fourth-holiday\">the summer breaks in Cornwall</a>, <a href=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/08/04/15/36D4B6F600000578-3723500-He_s_in_fashion_David_Cameron_has_showed_off_his_style_credentia-a-22_1470322673749.jpg\">the posh Orlebar Brown swimming trunks</a>.</p> <p>It is quite something to see how quickly the political waters have closed over Cameron\u2019s head since his departure, as the Tories rewind to their pre-Cameron Euroscepticism and enthusiasm for grammar schools.

The conclusion, roughly, was \u201cProbably not, but you never know\u201d, which is all one can ever say safely. The only problem was the word \u201cbubble\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofEngland/south-sea-bubble\">The South Sea Bubble</a>, the all-time benchmark for market irrationality, lasted one year \u2013 1720 \u2013 when shares in the South Sea Company rose tenfold and then collapsed. The London property market has been rising, with brief interruptions, since the end of the second world war, when top-end houses cost around \u00a35,000.</p> <p>In the past 20 years, an era of low general inflation, the <a href=\"http://www.halifax.co.uk/house-price-index\">Halifax house price index</a> shows that values in London have multiplied by almost six. <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/housepriceindex/previousReleases\">The Office for National Statistics figures</a>, which started later but dig deeper, suggest that in some of the richest areas of inner London, the 20-year increase is tenfold. Over 70 years, that \u00a35,000 house might have gone up to \u00a35m or \u00a310m \u2013 one or two thousand-fold. This long ago ceased to be a bubble. A hot-air balloon? A barrage balloon? The metaphor doesn\u2019t work.</p> <p>It has become an entirely different phenomenon: a ceaselessly rising tide, occasionally drawing back after one wave breaks, but only to regather force for the next, even stronger, surge. This tide has not lifted all boats, but it has lifted a great many: metropolitan middle-class members of the baby-boom generation in particular, but others too. (Some have of course been drowned, but there you go.)</p> <p>It has sent ripples across the country, and down the class hierarchy. The Thatcherite council house sell-off created many more winners, particularly in London, and a new cockney diaspora cashed up and moved out, creating space \u2013 albeit nowhere near enough \u2013 for vast numbers of new Londoners: the hopeful young pouring in from across the UK and the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"492451d5985406a8f08489de1052f0fe90e5694a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/492451d5985406a8f08489de1052f0fe90e5694a/0_166_7184_4312/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A basement conversion underway in Holland Park, west London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A basement conversion underway in Holland Park, west London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The outlines of this phenomenon have become so familiar that only rarely does anyone stand back and consider quite how astonishing it all is, and the extent to which the consequences have permeated every aspect of British life.</p> <p>Three years ago, the London-based American journalist Michael Goldfarb did stand back, for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/opinion/sunday/londons-great-exodus.html?_r=0\">an op-ed column</a> in the New York Times, which went viral, pointing out something that had not then been widely understood: how the most expensive London homes had ceased to be places to live and had become a store of global money. \u201cAlmost nothing has changed,\u201d says Goldfarb now, \u201cexcept that all the stresses in the system have got deeper. It will take an epochal catastrophe \u2013 like the great depression followed by a war \u2013 to allow ordinary people to get into the housing market. But no one will say this. It will be a London without Londoners.</p> <p>\u201cThe one thing that has changed is that people will now rent rather than buy. But has there been anything done to protect tenants? Nothing.

From a base of 100 in 1983, the UK-wide index passed the 700 mark earlier this year. The separate Greater London index was still below 200 in 1996, towards the end of the negative-equity crisis, and under 700 in early 2013, but reached 1,128 in the second quarter this year. The average property sold in London fetched \u00a340,000 in 1983; the figure is now \u00a3449,000. (The next set of figures may show a slight post-Brexit dip, but only a slight one.)</p> <p>The structural facts have not changed. Supply and demand for homes in London are out of kilter because Britain is so over-centralised, and the road to success in almost every field of endeavour leads through the capital; because the UK is run by people who have made massive tax-free gains from the boom and have a mindset that the merest blip is a catastrophe; and because successive governments have had no coherent policy on anything relevant \u2013 certainly not on housing, regional policy or immigration.</p> <p>There are also strange sub-phenomena now taking place, designed to keep the mad times rolling. Parents are sinking their profits back into the market to help their children into the game. Well-off baby-boomer provincials are downsizing and moving to London to be near their children. Old houses that were subdivided into flats decades ago are now being undivided again, further reducing the stock of homes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"389286d529ecd16ce7460c51737785b67aa3035d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/389286d529ecd16ce7460c51737785b67aa3035d/0_0_6654_4490/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sign announcing the opening of a new branch of Foxtons estate agents on Rye Lane in Peckham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"675\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sign announcing the opening of a new branch of Foxtons estate agents on Rye Lane in Peckham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At street level, it is possible to see other subtle developments taking place \u2013 none of them intended, some of them astonishing. Each district, each sub-district, or even each street, has its own nuances and variations. It cannot just be said that the top 1% are gaining at the expense of the 99%, which was never the whole truth. Now the 1% are themselves finding themselves overmatched by the 0.1% or the 0.01% or the 0.001%.</p> <p>Take Chelsea, an area that has been in fashion, with artistic tendencies, since at least Victorian times. In this portion of London, the wealth has now entirely submerged the raffishness and even the trendiness. \u201cYou won\u2019t find any Sloane Rangers anywhere near Sloane Square,\u201d reflected Michael Stephen, the former MP who is now chairman of the <a href=\"http://chelseasociety.org.uk/\">Chelsea Society</a>\u2019s planning committee. \u201cThey can\u2019t afford to live there.\u201d</p> <p>Fewer and fewer people are doing anything as quaint as actually living in Chelsea. The signs are obvious from the streets: constant darkness at dusk and closed blinds at noon are the outward indicators of an empty flat, ownership likely foreign and opaque. And there is anecdotal evidence that this is starting to make local businesses unviable.</p> <p>Close to Chelsea Green is <a href=\"http://www.savethesuttonestate.co.uk\">the Sutton Estate</a>, a not unhandsome collection of 15 Edwardian red-brick blocks \u2013 originally 500 flats in all \u2013 now in urgent need of an upgrade. Affinity, the housing association that owns the estate, plans to knock down all but two of the blocks and rebuild: the result will be 316 flats at \u201csocial\u201d rent (much cheaper than the misleadingly titled \u201caffordable\u201d rent), to be funded by building 106 for private sale.</p> <p>The Chelsea Society has been closely involved, and is sympathetic to Affinity\u2019s problems. \u201cThey can choose to spend their money anywhere in the country. And they can build four social housing units somewhere else for the price of one in Chelsea,\u201d says Stephen. Nonetheless, the quantity of social housing in central London will decrease even if the quality improves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d88592232cdeabda17e07ed54508f0711a3c297a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d88592232cdeabda17e07ed54508f0711a3c297a/0_0_7039_4793/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cobbler Matthew Childs, who works in Chelsea, but lives in Surrey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I don\u2019t think there are any kids here now\u2019 \u2026 Cobbler Matthew Childs, who works in Chelsea, but lives in Surrey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Round the corner is the Chelsea Green Shoe Repairs, run by Matthew Childs, a bubbly bloke who still serves the kind of Chelsea resident who buys shoes classy enough to be worth repairing.

This is something equally apparent at the other end of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, on the north side of Holland Park Avenue, in the Norland conservation area.</p> <p>Holland Park was once far from posh, but in the 1950s these Victorian homes were colonised by the kind of artistic types who went to Chelsea a century earlier. They were then replaced by barristers, doctors and managers at levels that would never be able to fund a house there now.</p> <p>There are fewer empty homes here, but some residents wish there were. Many newcomers\u2019 first act is to apply to start digging towards the earth\u2019s core to create new basements.

The Academy (formerly the Crown) had gone gastro and wine bar-ish long ago, but, she insisted, it was still very much a local. \u201cThis is where the pensioners had their lunch, where the bridge club met, and we had our Christmas party and our local meetings \u2026 \u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/gentrification_holland_park/giv-1406gJ24dkPCzTDH/\" data-alt=\"Holland Park gentrification stats\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/gentrification_holland_park/giv-1406gJ24dkPCzTDH/\">Holland Park gentrification stats</a> </figure>  <p>Not least, meetings to protest against pub closures. The Norland Arms is now an estate agents; the Portland Arms is a beauty salon; the Prince of Wales, the Unicorn, the Star and the Earl of Zetland are all private houses. The only pub left inside the conservation area is the Stewart Arms, which, counter-intuitively, is the traditional council-estate pub, with big-screen TV and music on Saturdays.</p> <p>Opposite the Academy is a row of what were once, quite obviously, neighbourhood shops. Only one is still functioning: a dry cleaners, a business that has not yet transferred to the internet. But it is not technology that has killed these shops; it is house prices. How can you run a newsagents if closing it makes the building worth \u00a32m?</p> <p>\u201cWe were one of the first areas to have a neighbourhood plan,\u201d says Kinmonth, \u201cand the whole idea was to keep the feel of the place. If you look at a meadow, it has amazing biodiversity. We had that here and we\u2019re losing it.\u201d</p> <p>Variations on the theme are happening across London. Even a decade ago, transport zones 1 and 2 were full of areas whose very name would make one\u2019s mother faint. (\u201cYou\u2019re going to live in <em>Hoxton</em>?!\u201d) Now the respectability-map is being infilled. One of the last remaining pieces of the jigsaw is Peckham, best known to the outside world as the home of Del Boy.</p> <p>In 1966, the architectural critic Ian Nairn <a href=\"https://chorltonhistory.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/unquenchable-vitality-has-pulsed.html\">delighted in the \u201cunquenchable vitality\u201d of Rye Lane</a>, the shopping street outside Peckham Rye station, \u201cone of the last cockney streets in London\u201d.

The next phase is on its way. Whitfield took me into a narrow alley leading to the huge Bussey Building, a former sporting goods factory. When dereliction came, the shell became a hangout for prostitutes and drug addicts, then home to a dozen or more African churches. Now it is an informal <a href=\"http://www.clfartcafe.org/\">arts centre</a>, with a <a href=\"http://www.timeout.com/london/film/rooftop-film-club-peckham-rye\">rooftop cinema</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jul/25/restaurant-review-franks-cafe-campari-bar\">bar</a>, 60-odd studios for the kind of artists who would once have gravitated to Chelsea or Holland Park, and loads of \u201cprofessional co-working spaces\u201d where wannabe creatives and techies can ply their trade sociably.</p> <p>\u201cIt all seems wonderful,\u201d I remark to a manager, who is disinclined to give his name, but happy to extol the glittering future that awaits Peckham. \u201cBut if Peckham comes up as you say, this won\u2019t be an arts centre for long. It\u2019ll be worth too much for housing, won\u2019t it?\u201d He raises his eyebrows a little and smiles an enigmatic smile. But less cryptic answers are available. Not far away, a sign announces the impending arrival of the famously aggressive chain of estate agents, Foxtons.</p>",
  "<p>In a small building in the foreboding shadow of Jerusalem\u2019s Mount Zion, Rabba Tamar Elad-Abblebaum looked upon a crowd sitting attentively before her. \u201cWe have had a long way to go to prepare for this evening,\u201d she said with a soft smile. \u201cToday we all do something very brave.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/peace-between-israel-palestine-iran-deal-guide\">Want peace between Israel and Palestine? The Iran Deal is a good guide | Wardah Khalid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Certainly this congregation was unlike any she, the leader of an Orthodox Jewish community in Jerusalem, was used to addressing. As well as the usual modest dress and kippah worn in her synagogue, there were some crosses worn around necks. Others sat in the traditional black robes of the Copts, another in the Muslim hijab and several nuns in their habits gathered together at the back of the room. Many were wearing no religious garb at all. But they were all there to pray.</p> <p>Last week, and for just eight days, a music school in the lowest valley of Jerusalem was transformed into a communal house of prayer, named Amen, bringing together Jewish, Muslim and Christian religious leaders and their congregations to worship together in one room. It was a sight rarely seen in this segregated city. </p> <p>The project, part of the Jerusalem season of culture, was initiated by Elad-Abblebaum and the Muslim Sufi Sheikh Ihab Balah almost a year ago. They reached out to six other religious figures \u2013 two rabbis, a Franciscan monk, a Catholic priest, a Coptic deaconess and a female Muslim community leader \u2013 who were very traditional in their beliefs and practices, but also open to discussions with other faiths.</p> <p>Elad-Abblebaum said: \u201cI never believed something like this would be possible in my lifetime. Jews who live in the territories publicly praying together with Palestinians, this is a big risk and a huge step. But this is not a political project; we wanted people to come from the right and from the left and to show that faith is beyond ideology. Here, we are reshaping reality and we are doing it through prayer.\u201d</p> <p>She emphasised how Amen not only brought together Israel\u2019s discordant religions, but also men and women, which is almost unheard of in such inter-religious gatherings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e20868b9f75702048ed302df2d4d0d14ae105ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e20868b9f75702048ed302df2d4d0d14ae105ce/0_264_3960_2376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Waida Ibtisam Mahmeed ties up the strips of muslin that hang from the ceiling in preparation for an evening of prayer and song\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Waida Ibtisam Mahmeed ties up the strips of muslin that hang from the ceiling in preparation for an evening of prayer and song.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michal Fattal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018We were all speaking the same language\u2019</h2> <p>Over the previous six months, all eight leaders had met once a week to discuss how the project could be realised and even travelled together to the desert to rehearse praying together. For most, this was a completely new experience. Catholic Rev Rafik, who has used a different name in the programme to prevent a backlash against his family, who are originally from Lebanon, admitted he had not met anyone from the Coptic church before. Fr Alberto Fer, the Franciscan monk, had never spoken with a female rabbi. </p> <p>Instead of merging prayers and traditions, each night the prayer house was hosted by a different religious figure, and most of the prayer done through music and song, a common uniter. The prayer book handed out was in Hebrew, Arabic and English.</p> <p>Speaking after the first night\u2019s event, Elad-Abblebaum said she was already working to make sure the project lived on beyond its eight days. \u201cYou realised suddenly we were all speaking the same language,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can\u2019t just be a memory, this has to be the energy for the next step. We will use this as the seed to build Jerusalem a permanent place where all faiths can come and pray alongside each other.\u201d </p> <p>In a first step towards giving Amen longevity, the eight religious leaders all met again on Wednesday for a special ceremony to mark International Peace Day.</p> <p>Particularly significant was the cooperation of three imams, including one from al-Aqsa mosque \u2013 the most important site for Muslims in Jerusalem \u2013 and another Palestinian imam who travelled from the West Bank city of Nablus to participate in one of the prayer evenings. </p> <p> In a climate where Arab involvement in any activity involving Jews leads to accusations of \u201cnormalisation\u201d, such interfaith unity can be dangerous. The imams asked not to be named on the programme.</p> <p>Ihab Balh admitted that building the project had been a \u201cchallenging step\u201d, but that his work with these imams over the past decade had laid the groundwork to bring them into Amen and made it seem \u201cmore acceptable\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis project is a milestone because it shows other imams that there are devout religious Muslims who can play a role in projects like this,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, accusations of normalisation are a challenge and the reality of Jerusalem today is hatred and people fighting, but it\u2019s important at the same time to plant the seeds of people coming together and seeing each other. That\u2019s what I am doing here.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abf70b97c9ea2446cc83cfe255d2bea78d050b11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abf70b97c9ea2446cc83cfe255d2bea78d050b11/525_316_3348_2009/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The eight religious leaders, alongside coptic musicians, sit before the congregation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The eight religious leaders, alongside musicians, sit before the congregation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michal Fattal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Location, location, location</h2> <p>In a city where geography is politics, the location of the communal house of prayer was essential to ensuring the residents of Jerusalem accepted Amen. Elad-Abblebaum admitted it had been a formidable task, having been refused again and again by places in both the east and the west of the city \u2013 and on Mount Zion itself \u2013 for fear the project would incite anger.</p> <p>The leaders eventually settled on the small music school, which teaches both Jews and Arabs and sits adjacent to Mount Zion, a holy site for all three religions. The building, which directly faces the poverty-stricken Palestinian neighbourhood of Silwan, is also directly below the secret zip wire once used to smuggle injured Israeli soldiers over the green line from East to West Jerusalem.</p> <p>Modesty governed the interior design of the prayer house. Thin strips of white muslin hung from the ceiling, each bearing a quote from the bible, the Torah or the Qur\u2019an in both Hebrew and Arabic and the religious leaders, and their accompanying musicians, sat on wooden chairs.</p> <p>Rafik admitted he had been extremely sceptical when first approached by Elad-Abblebaum about the prayer house and had met some resistance in his community.</p> <p>\u201cTo say the truth, I wasn\u2019t really convinced at the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea was very nice but I did not see how it could happen. But when we started meeting up, I was surprised at how real relationships developed between us all and I discovered there was something interesting there. And that friendship between us, I think, is the humble beginning we need to change people\u2019s hearts and from there, their minds.\u201d</p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/19/israeli-police-stabbed-amid-fears-of-resurgence-in-palestinian-attacks\">increasingly tense and sporadically violent political climate</a>, Amen has not been an easy project to be publicly attached to. </p> <p>But Waida Ibtisam Mahmeed, one of the eight organisers and a respected Muslim community leader in the Israeli Arab town of Fureidis, said she was unafraid of her participation being perceived as political.</p> <p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted that a devout Muslim woman leaves her husband and her children and her community for a week to do anything, let alone this,\u201d Mahmeed said, and her eyes filled with tears as she indicated her hijab.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes people, when they see the way I\u2019m dressed in the street they are afraid of me because they think that every Muslim has a knife to stab a Jew. It is important to emphasise there is a difference between what I read in the Qur\u2019an and how people act in the name of the Qur\u2019an. God didn\u2019t tell me to stand up and kill people. I feel a lot of hurt and sorrow because of what\u2019s going on between Israelis and Palestinians.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cFor me Islam, Christianity, Judaism, it is all interconnected. We may pray in different ways with different texts but in the end we are all reaching for same thing.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>I\u2019m sure that a fair few of us have had \u201ca River Cottage moment\u201d over the years. To wonder, even fleetingly, what it would be like to learn to live off the land; to grow and rear your own food; to become less reliant on buying everything in and have a stab at a much simpler, potentially more satisfying and wholesome existence.</p> <p>But how many of us can cope with the total loss of a regular income? Who can give up everything and scratch a living far from the city, often with kids in tow (some more willing than others)?</p> <p>Some Guardian readers may recall <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/may/14/downsized-family-budget\">my own efforts at a major downshift</a>, chronicled in the Money pages. I have also interviewed a lot of smallholders and the truth is that most are not completely self-sufficient anyway, and \u2013 unless society completely collapses any time soon \u2013 neither would they want to be.</p> <p>Total downshifting is not for the faint-hearted. <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/eden\">Channel 4\u2019s Eden show</a> kicked off in July with 23 volunteers keen to get back to nature on a remote Scottish peninsula for 12 months. Several quit early on, not least, reportedly, because of the midges.</p> <p>The truth is that such shows are a far cry from the reality of most downshifters\u2019 lives. Many make a modest income as small-scale producers, while more than you might imagine still set off to work in an office every day.</p> <p>My family and I downshifted to west Wales more than six years ago. For the first few years we ate almost entirely seasonally from much of our own produce and lived extremely frugally, learning to repair and make most of what we needed, and that was fine. Actually, more than fine, it was an adventure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5d03b31cdc1c78a24fdc3bd84bebacbe0d969e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5d03b31cdc1c78a24fdc3bd84bebacbe0d969e5/298_89_5443_3266/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kim Stoddart and her family in the garden of their Welsh cottage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kim Stoddart and her family in the garden of their Welsh cottage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Phillips</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But with a mortgage to pay it wasn\u2019t financially sustainable. Nowadays we have a lesser degree of self-sufficiency, but one which is realistic to us as a working family. I grow fruit and vegetables for enjoyment rather than necessity, so it\u2019s on a smaller scale than before. We keep chickens for eggs and have a small number of sheep. This way it\u2019s a genuine pleasure rather than an all-consuming chore.</p> <p>Yet what we\u2019ve learned has stayed with us, given us a greater resilience and down-to-earth appreciation of food and the material goods that, prior to our move, we\u2019d just taken for granted. And it\u2019s heartening to note that we are certainly not alone in having downshifted, with people all over Britain having chosen to live a more simple life.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.canonfromecourt.org.uk\">Canon Frome Court</a>, for instance, is a farming co-operative in Herefordshire, with 19 self contained units for singletons, couples and families. Many residents have independent jobs, but all help out on the community farm. Ellie Chowns moved there in 2003 with her husband and two children.</p> <p>\u201cThis was the first place we\u2019d ever bought and we paid about \u00a3160,000 for a large three-bedroom property,\u201d she says. \u201cAccommodation here is valued in line with local property prices but it\u2019s an amazing amount of space for the money, and you get all the extras that go with it, including the 40 acres of land along with a beautiful walled vegetable garden. It\u2019s an amazing place for children to grow up. A survey was done a few years ago and all the kids gave it 10 out of 10.</p> <p>\u201cLiving here comes with responsibility for helping out with the community farm, where we grow our own organic food and help to tend the animals (though there are no set hours that we have to help). My husband and I both work full time \u2013 I\u2019m a university researcher in Sheffield and he works in London \u2013 so families like ours have more limited input, while others that are retired, or those with young children, tend to have more time to give. It\u2019s so well organised but in a really nice collective way.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a super cheap way of living, but we generate a lot of our own electricity from solar panels and our water comes from the bore holes, for which we pay a small maintenance fee each month. Plus there are a lot of ways to save cash and co-operate such as buying wholefoods in bulk, lift shares and helping each other out with childcare. Around 30%-40% of our food is home produced in the summer and in winter maybe 10%.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The attraction of a community like Canon Frome is that you can have a foot in both worlds</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe live in separate units and have a lot of personal space, coming together once a week to share meals, as well as on special occasions or for activities such as haymaking. Decisions tend to be made by consensus which is great in a lot of ways, but sometimes there can be a stalemate. It\u2019s important to have a degree of give and take.\u201d</p> <p>Applicants can try before they buy by staying at Canon Frome in its guest rooms. Clare Murphy spent three weeks there in 2013 with her two children. \u201cI hadn\u2019t milked a goat before I went, but if you presented me with one now I could have a reasonable stab at it,\u201d she says. \u201cWe stayed in the \u2018playroom\u2019, a fantastic experience for all of us. We helped with gardening and planting crops, feeding and milking animals, collecting eggs and making cheese. And we met some lovely people. It was a great way to glimpse that kind of life. If you\u2019re interested in living green and producing most of your own food, without the relentless slog of being a sole smallholder, this could be for you.</p> <p>\u201cThe attraction of living in a community like Canon Frome is that you can have a foot in both worlds. You get to produce and eat incredible organic food, but as the work is shared you can have a job outside and take weekends and holidays away. You are surrounded by like-minded people who care about the environment, but can escape to your own space when you need to. There\u2019s a shared meal each Saturday, but otherwise it\u2019s up to you how much you socialise with the other members.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not for everyone. You have to be prepared, quite rightly, to pull your weight and feed those animals or dig those spuds when you\u2019re on the rota to do it, even if it\u2019s pouring with rain. You have to be willing to discuss decisions, sometimes at length, and go with the consensus, even if it\u2019s not your preferred choice. It didn\u2019t quite fit in with our circumstances in 2013, but we\u2019re still thinking about it.\u201d</p> <p>One major drawback of downshifting is that it\u2019s often a middle-class thing; you need money in the first place to be able to do it, as buying a smallholding in the UK is far from cheap. But there are more affordable routes.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.oneplanetcouncil.org.uk/\">One Planet Council</a>, an independent voluntary body in Wales, helps applicants find land and build simple, sustainable and affordable homes, with entry prices in developments such as the <a href=\"http://lammas.org.uk\">Lammas Eco Village</a> of around \u00a335,000-\u00a340,000. Erica Thompson from One Planet Council says: \u201cNormally, you need to inherit land or buy a smallholding for upwards of quarter of a million pounds. Most people aiming at small-scale land-based enterprise don\u2019t have that kind of capital. One Planet Development [a local planning policy] offers a way for them with a much smaller \u2018entry fee\u2019. The trade-off, of course, is the ongoing commitment to a low-impact lifestyle and monitoring to ensure you meet that commitment.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://ecologicalland.coop/\">Ecological Land Co-operative</a> in England and the <a href=\"http://www.crofting.org/\">Scottish Crofting Federation</a> also offer affordable options in their respective regions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e2ec9c1e46a869d831f38493b5a665538245622\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e2ec9c1e46a869d831f38493b5a665538245622/80_219_1030_618/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leander Wolstenholme: \u2018W\u2019ve got hot water, our own water supply, a shower phone line and broadband internet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leander Wolstenholme: \u2018We\u2019ve got hot water, our own water supply, a shower, phone line and broadband internet.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amanda Jackson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elsewhere, botanist and forager Leander Wolstenholme lives with his wife, Katie, and their three children in <a href=\"http://lammas.org.uk/\">Lammas</a> in Pembrokeshire. Their community received planning permission by way of Policy 52 (a forerunner to One Planet Development) which stipulates they had to make 75% of their functional livelihood needs from the land by the end of year five. This goal was achieved, but Wolstenholme says: \u201cIt surprised me how much pressure it put on us all. There have been a number of arguments and fallings out among the smallholders, so now we prefer to work with people on an individual basis instead.</p> <p>\u201cWe are very much in the set-up phase despite being here for more than six years. We\u2019re desperately focused on building our house at the moment \u2013 it\u2019s become really pressing. Our eldest daughter is now 15 and we\u2019re essentially all living in just one big room.\u201d</p> <p>The couple bought into the Lammas community in April 2010, obtaining a six-acre plot for \u00a335,000 with money Katie inherited from her grandfather. Their involvement in the eco-project also provides them with a share of the 19-acre woodland and use of the community\u2019s facilities such as the village green and community hub building. \u201cIt\u2019s a safe place for kids,\u201d says Wolstenholme. \u201cIn Liverpool we lived on a busy road, and though there was a playground across the way we couldn\u2019t leave the children alone for a minute.</p> <p>\u201cWe now have a hydroelectric turbine that provides electricity for us all, but for the first two years we were using just one solar panel, which meant in winter the lights would often go out at eight in the evening. We\u2019ve got hot water, a compost toilet, our own water supply and, since March, a shower housed in a shed outside. We also have a phone line and broadband internet. To be honest I don\u2019t feel that we\u2019ve started yet. Once the house is ready we can really begin.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Visit <a href=\"http://www.diggersanddreamers.org.uk/\">Diggersanddreamers.org.uk</a> for a full list of UK smallholding communities.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Pick your moment to talk. </strong>There are all sorts of reasons people stop having sex \u2013 stress, illness, worry about performing, low libido, age, menopause and lack of body confidence. It\u2019s easy to let your sex life drift, but bringing up the subject is difficult so try to pick the right moment when you\u2019re both relaxed and unlikely to be interrupted. But not in bed and especially not while trying to persuade your partner to have sex or feeling angry or frustrated because they\u2019re not interested.</p> <p><strong>Pick your moment to listen.</strong> Do your best not to take it personally. Don\u2019t assume they no longer fancy you or put words in their mouth. It can be hard enough to talk about without extra needless emotional layers being added so listen to what is being said and how the situation makes your partner feel. It really isn\u2019t about you being a bit plump or growing older or not taking pride in your appearance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/24/are-you-in-a-sexless-marriage-share-your-story\">Are you in a sexless marriage? Share your story</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Be honest with yourself and each other.</strong> Have you both stopped making an effort, do you take each other for granted and think nothing of rolling into bed in a grubby T-shirt without even brushing your teeth? No one\u2019s suggesting you should aim for supermodel or totally buffed body status, but if you don\u2019t love yourself enough to have a little pride in your appearance, it\u2019s not going to be that easy for other people to love you too. You might feel rather shallow admitting that the extra two stone or constant farting in bed isn\u2019t exactly what you signed up for, but you can do that tactfully, especially if admitting areas where you are also no longer quite the person they fell for.</p> <p><strong>Decide whether sex is a deal-breaker for either of you.</strong> Would you be willing to sacrifice sex for the \u201cother stuff\u201d? Some people are perfectly happy having no sex in their marriage and Relate\u2019s research shows that the importance people place on sex decreases with age. Often intimacy is what\u2019s most important, but if it\u2019s not enough, say so.</p> <p><strong>Be patient.</strong> If sex is a deal-breaker, it\u2019s important for the \u201ckeen\u201d partner to be patient while the two of you unpack what is causing the block. This is also not the best time to suggest an open relationship as a possible solution.</p> <p><strong>Seek help together.</strong> Sex therapy can help you with working out what the underlying problem is and can also give you a sense that you\u2019re sorting this out together. At the beginning of a relationship, sex can feel so easy, natural and exciting that it can feel a little sad that you might have to work at it, but the results can be well worth it.</p> <p><strong>Kindness is sexy.</strong> Go out together, have fun, make time for each other. When both parties feel truly heard and understood, often intimacy increases along with the desire to have sex.</p> <p><strong>Ban sex.</strong> Many therapists often suggest that couples in sexless relationships start by taking the pressure off sex entirely. This may sound counterintuitive but creating a temporary ban can stop feelings of anxiety about needing to perform, making relaxation more likely.</p> <p><strong>Small steps.</strong> Reintroduce intimacy slowly \u2013 start with something as small as holding hands or giving your partner a peck on the cheek before you head off to work. You can then build up to massages, cuddling, lingering kissing and intimate touching and oral sex, but keeping full sexual intercourse off the table until you both feel like you want to do it. The idea behind this is that it allows you to rediscover one another\u2019s sensual sides and increase desire in a pressure-free environment. It\u2019s important that you regularly discuss how you\u2019re both feeling and don\u2019t push your partner to go further than they are comfortable with.</p> <p><strong>Drink is not the answer.</strong> True, but a relaxing dinner and an easy chat over a couple of glasses has led to other things since time began.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019re not alone.</strong> Research by <a href=\"https://www.relate.org.uk/\">Relate</a>, <a href=\"http://www.marriagecare.org.uk/the-way-we-are-now-by-relate-marriage-care-and-relationships-scotland/\">Marriage Care</a> and <a href=\"http://www.relationships-scotland.org.uk/\">Relationships Scotland</a> found that fewer than half of UK adults say they are satisfied with their sex life (45%) and 51% say they have not had sex in the past month.</p> <p><em>With thanks to Relate, Marriage Care and Relationships Scotland</em></p>",
  "<p>For our first 29 years in this house we didn\u2019t see a single red squirrel in the garden, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/28/country-diary-solved-mystery-absent-red-squirrels\">but since May this year they have become daily visitors</a>. The wooden feeder boxes on the apple trees have been a big attraction, and watching the squirrels push up the lids with their heads and reach in to get the peanuts can often be amusing. </p> <p>However, some of them persist in visiting a wire feeder that was put out for birds, despite the difficulty of getting the nuts out. When the squirrels are at the feeders, I have noticed that a couple of <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/m/mallard/index.aspx\">mallard</a> immediately head over to the bottom of the tree, to pick up any nuts or fragments they might let drop. </p> <p>Someone in the strath told me that they had seen squirrels gnaw discarded deer antlers. On the <a href=\"http://www.isleofrum.com/\">Isle of Rum</a> I had observed red deer, both stags and hinds, doing this to get calcium and other minerals \u2013 but squirrels? That intrigued me. So I took a <a href=\"http://stagantlers.co.uk/deer-antlers/red-deer/\">red deer antler</a> from my collection and tied it to the apple tree between the two feeders. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/23/roe-deer-doe-transforms-scene-country-diary-highlands\">A roe deer doe transforms the scene</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nothing happened for a few weeks until, one September morning, a squirrel at one of the wooden boxes suddenly darted along the branch and started gnawing away at the antler. Since then, I have seen two different squirrels getting their mineral \u201cfix\u201d there. </p> <p>The apples on this tree are still small and green looking but, given the way the <a href=\"http://www.garden-birds.co.uk/birds/blackbird.htm\">blackbirds</a> have been attacking the ones that fell off in the high winds, they are clearly ripe enough for them. Last week, to my surprise, I saw a squirrel pull an apple off a branch and disappear with it. </p> <p>I am now experimenting with larger apples split in two and pinned near the antler. Hopefully, the squirrels will take to them, as it means that once this tree\u2019s crop has gone over we can buy some and put in their place.
