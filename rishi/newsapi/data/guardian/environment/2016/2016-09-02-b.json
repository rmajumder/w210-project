  "<p>Almost every group with a financial, intellectual or ethical interest in salvaging a workable climate policy is now deep in an urgent debate about how Australia can break a decade of policy paralysis. Everyone except the Turnbull government, that is.<br></p> <p>The debate, involving big business, small business, investors, the government\u2019s own independent climate advisers, academics, environmentalists, the welfare lobby and the unions, is predicated on the obvious conclusion that our policy \u2013 as it stands \u2013 cannot deliver the cuts to greenhouse emissions that are domestically necessary and which Australia has promised internationally. </p> <p>But like the emperor with no clothes, continuing with the grand parade even after the whole crowd has finally declared him naked, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/australia-needs-two-emissions-trading-schemes-climate-change-authority-says\">new environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, still insists Australia is \u201ctransitioning successfully with the policies we already have in place\u201d. </a></p> <p>Every stakeholder is hoping \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/27/election-2016-greg-hunt-coalition-emissions-trading-scheme\">based on plenty of nudges and winks from Frydenberg\u2019s predecessor Greg Hunt</a> \u2013 that a review scheduled for next year will turn the existing Direct Action policy into a workable policy, probably a type of emissions trading scheme. Labor\u2019s election policy edged closer to what the Coalition\u2019s policy could eventually become, offering, according to the Business Council of Australia, a \u201cbridge to bipartisanship\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/australia-needs-two-emissions-trading-schemes-climate-change-authority-says\">Australia needs two emissions trading schemes, Climate Change Authority says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Frydenberg has now described the 2017 review as a \u201csit rep\u201d (situation report), insisting no major changes are under consideration. His language is stuck back in the \u201cclimate wars\u201d, like the late night rerun of a particularly bad movie. This week he revived the long-discredited claim that Labor\u2019s proposed higher greenhouse gas reduction target would increase electricity prices by 78%. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/27/why-coalition-climate-scare-campaign-is-not-credible-and-makes-no-sense\">The supposed authors have described that calculation as \u201cincorrect\u201d and \u201cweird and misleading\u201d.</a></p> <p>It was just another example of the gaping chasm between the government\u2019s lines and the argument everyone else is having. </p> <p>The government\u2019s own independent advisory body, the Climate Change Authority, released a report on Thursday, which was also based on the premise that policy will have to change very significantly, and it has recommended a version of emissions trading for the electricity sector and a much more rigorous \u201cDirect Action\u201d style policy for high-polluting industry.</p> <p>This was not the musing of what conservative warriors like to deride as the \u201cgreen left\u201d but rather the first report from the authority since Tony Abbott made several appointments to its board, including John Sharp, a former Nationals minister; Wendy Craik, a former National Farmers Federation executive director; Kate Carnell, a former chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry; and Danny Price, the economist who modelled Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s old climate policy and was on Greg Hunt\u2019s advisory panel.</p> <p>In the real world, the report sparked a furious discussion about whether the recommendations were aiming for sufficiently ambitious targets. The Business Council of Australia (BCA) and other business groups welcomed it, but as Guardian Australia revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/30/climate-change-authority-splits-over-ets-report-commissioned-by-coalition\">two CCA board members, Clive Hamilton and David Karoly, will release</a> a dissenting report arguing that its recommendations were inadequate to meet Australia\u2019s international obligations. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-climate-change-authoritys-gamble-on-political-pragmatism-64745?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Latest%20from%20The%20Conversation%20for%20September%202%202016%20-%205533&amp;utm_content=Latest%20from%20The%20Conversation%20for%20September%202%202016%20-%205533+CID_6557c80e56cf4887f5662e7a7c065ff8&amp;utm_source=campaign_monitor&amp;utm_term=The%20Climate%20Change%20Authoritys%20gamble%20on%20political%20pragmatism\">Many other respected analysts and some environment groups made similar criticisms.</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/27/election-2016-greg-hunt-coalition-emissions-trading-scheme\">Hunt plays the long game on his glaringly obvious emissions trading scheme | Lenore Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But while this argument raged, Frydenberg implied there was no need for any change at all, insisting the report was just something the government had been forced to commission to get the votes of the Palmer United party for its \u201cDirect Action\u201d, a policy that was working just swimmingly.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the \u201cclimate roundtable\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/29/australian-climate-policy-paralysis-has-to-end-business-roundtable-says\">an unprecedented alliance of business, welfare and environmental groups, and trade unions, which began secret meetings in 2014 </a>to try to break the political impasse over climate policy and emerged publicly in 2015 \u2013 is again actively lobbying both major parties.</p> <p>The group, which includes the BCA, the AI group, the Australian Aluminium Council, the Climate Institute, the Australian Council on Social Service, the Investor Group on Climate Change, the Australian Conservation Foundation, WWF, the Australian Energy Council and the ACTU, has recently written to Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten, reminding the leaders that a bipartisan workable policy is more urgent than ever, and that they will not give up their efforts.</p> <p>That line-up would provide pretty useful backing (and cover) for both big parties if they wanted to reach a compromise \u2013 if, of course, the impediment to that compromise was actually public opinion.</p> <p>But, as with so many policy areas flummoxing this government, the real impediment to reaching what Turnbull calls the \u201csensible centre\u201d is the rightwing of his own party.</p> <p>With so many voices telling them, Turnbull and Frydenberg obviously know that Direct Action in its current form is no longer even passable as a fig leaf. </p> <p>But on this, above all other issues, Turnbull also understands the threat from the conservative right.</p> <p>And in case the horrors of 2009 were fading in his memory, Tony Abbott <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/26/tony-abbott-urges-turnbull-to-pursue-reform-to-counter-populist-politics\">emerged last week</a> with a speech reminding Turnbull what was expected.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the government will strongly support the coal industry which will provide base load power here and abroad for decades to come \u2013 and continue to employ tens of thousands of Australians.

She has never hosted a debate.</p> <p>Moderating can be thankless work. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, criticized Candy Crowley of CNN after she spot-checked his claim on a debate stage in New York that Barack Obama had failed to refer to the 2012 Benghazi attacks as a \u201cterror\u201d attack. \u201cShe obviously thought it was her job to play a more active role in the debate than was agreed upon by the two candidates,\u201d Romney later <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2014/01/27/romney-breaks-silence-on-candy-crowleys-debate-interference/#ixzz4J6pPe2vK\">said</a>. </p> <p>More recently, Trump complained for months about Fox News host Megyn Kelly, who asked him during the first Republican primary debate last August about his views on women, quoting his own words back to him, which Trump claimed was unfair. <br></p> <h2><strong>Who are the moderators?</strong> </h2> <p>Let\u2019s not overlook the break-glass-in-case-of-emergency backup moderator for these debates, C-Span\u2019s Steve Scully.

  "<p>Youth unemployment figures published this week have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/30/youth-unemployment-highly-regionalised-report-shows\">underlined the contrasting economic fortunes</a> of two cities an hour\u2019s drive apart, with Wolverhampton having one of the highest jobless rates for 16 to 24-year-olds in the UK, and Coventry one of the lowest.</p> <p>The Guardian visited the two cities to find how their paths have diverged and why young people appear to have such comparative success in finding a job in Coventry, while the story is so different in Wolverhampton.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>Wolverhampton</h2> <p>According to a <a href=\"http://www.ey.com/UK/en/Issues/Business-environment/Financial-markets-and-economy/Youth-unemployment-in-the-UK\">study commissioned by accountants EY</a>, 27% of young people in Wolverhampton are unemployed. This is despite a number of economic successes for the West Midlands city, including a Jaguar Land Rover engine plant and the establishment of several hi-tech businesses.</p> <p>But one expert suggested that the gap between Wolverhampton and Coventry may have been exaggerated. Prof Anne Green of the Institute for Employment Research at Warwick University said figures that break down unemployment into age groups are based on small sample sizes and should be treated carefully.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-02T14:31:47/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Youth unemployment in the West Midlands\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-02T14:31:47/embed.html\">Youth unemployment in the West Midlands</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe small sample size can exaggerate the extent of the gap between one place and another,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we do know that the average skill level in the Black Country is lower than the south-east of the area around Coventry.\u201d</p> <p>Politicians in Wolverhampton are trying to distance the city from the idea of lower skills levels. From its beginnings as a market town heavily linked to the wool trade, Wolverhampton embraced the industrial revolution. For much of the past century, children followed their parents into heavy manufacturing industries and learned on the job.</p> <p>John Wood, the corporate services director of steelmaker Liberty, said companies are having to cope with an ageing workforce and a lack of skilled new entrants to replace retiring colleagues. \u201cCompanies round here are realising they\u2019ve got to deal with a ticking timebomb, which is an ageing workforce,\u201d he said, adding that the apprenticeship levy is another incentive to train people, because companies will receive a refund on it if they take on trainees. <br></p> <p>\u201cThere is the need for people with higher skills and the extra cost of the apprenticeship levy, which will cost them money unless they train people. All three have created a change in the thinking among manufacturers,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Schools in the Wolverhampton area have only recently succeeded in raising GCSE results above the national average. Wolverhampton University is credited with developing skills training alongside higher education.</p> <p>But for children from poorer backgrounds, the level of support remains ad hoc compared with Coventry. Business groups visit schools and offer mentoring, but the onus is on schools to connect with individual businesses. The Black Country chamber of commerce, which could play a major role, has been without a chief executive for six months. </p> <p>Further education colleges are the backbone of training for many 16 to 18-year-olds and have faced severe cuts in recent years.</p> <p>Adrian Wright, the president of the chamber, said FE colleges were mostly rated outstanding by Ofsted, meaning the quality of people leaving them was good, but many young people were failing to bridge the gap into employment.</p> <p>\u201cI think there is a bit of a disconnect between our manufacturers and those colleges,\u201d he said.</p> <p>About 40% of chamber members are manufacturers and most are crying out for apprentices. \u201cBut there is more investment in technology than in training,\u201d Wright said</p> <p>Throughout the New Labour era, business leaders say, the local council was a barrier to change, but it is now a key partner in bringing investment to the area.</p> <p>Cllr John Reynolds, who is responsible for skills and development at Wolverhampton council, said the authority has plans to regenerate the city centre, creating a canalside quarter with towpaths safe for cyclists next to renovated warehouses. </p> <p>Wolverhampton has spent the past 30 years being hollowed out following an exodus of shops and employers to greenfield sites outside the city. His job is to entice a new breed, starting with a Debenhams store and a multiplex cinema to provide much-needed service sector jobs.</p> <h2>Coventry</h2> <p>Coventry has fared much better after a decade of investment that made it less dependent on manufacturing. This helps balance out the employment market, because manufacturing demands higher-skilled workers, who then become fewer in number as the business grows more sophisticated and workers are replaced by machines.</p> <p>The service sector has stepped into that gap. The rise in services employment in the city comes from an increase in hotels, shops and leisure facilities. It is the key factor in a youth unemployment rate that stands at 8.2%, according to EY. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89166202faacad6d0ae81b934f395d3873311de8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89166202faacad6d0ae81b934f395d3873311de8/0_294_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People build a car\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Engineers and designers put the finishing touches to the Speedback, a luxury sports car, in Coventry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cllr Kevin Maton, the head of education and skills at Coventry city council, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve always had an underdeveloped services sector. Very few hotels, restaurants and other businesses that young people traditionally went into and gave them their first taste of work.\u201d</p> <p>The council, keen to bring young people into the city centre, has recently sold to Coventry University land next to the town hall, allowing it to develop a site next to the train station.</p> <p>This provides vital construction jobs, said Rachael Stewart, who works on skills and employment for the local enterprise partnership.</p> <p>Stewart has helped recreate the Connexions careers service <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/aug/03/connexions-cuts-advice-young-people\">scrapped by the last government</a>, creating support for schools that now advise children on their career paths. Sally Lucas, the executive director of training at the Coventry and Warwickshire chamber of commerce, works with the LEP, the council, schools and colleges to coordinate funding, and seek out grants from EU and lottery funds.<br></p> <p>It means that the level of coordination between the agencies that deal with young people surpasses Wolverhampton in breadth and depth. </p> <p>Maton said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/14/wasps-coventry-city-ricoh-arena\">arrival of Wasps in 2014</a> was another boon for the city. The rugby club had a long tradition of engagement with school children and forced Coventry City to \u201cup its game\u201d in response.</p> <p>\u201cThere are some who might criticise us as a Labour council for being too close to employers, but that is about engaging with local businesses. And we still have power in that relationship, so if we find they are using zero-hours contracts and paying less than the minimum wage, we are not standing on the sidelines, we can do something about it,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>The bishop of Grantham has become the first Church of England bishop to publicly declare that he is gay and in a relationship. In a move that will be embraced by campaigners for equality but is likely to alarm conservatives who fear the church is moving away from traditional teachings, Nicholas Chamberlain said there had been no secret about his long-term \u2013 albeit celibate \u2013 relationship with his partner.</p> <p>But a threat by a Sunday newspaper to reveal Chamberlain\u2019s sexuality had pushed him to speak publicly. He acknowledged that the revelation would cause \u201cripples\u201d within the church. \u201cIt was not my decision to make a big thing about coming out,\u201d he told the Guardian in an exclusive interview. \u201cPeople know I\u2019m gay, but it\u2019s not the first thing I\u2019d say to anyone.

During the process of being appointed as suffragan bishop of Grantham, he said, \u201cI was myself. Those making the appointment knew about my sexual identity.\u201d His appointment was made by the diocesan (senior) bishop of Lincoln, Christopher Lowson, and endorsed by Welby.</p> <p>Chamberlain said he adhered to church guidelines, under which gay clergy must be celibate and are not permitted to marry. In the appointments process, \u201cWe explored what it would mean for me as a bishop to be living within those guidelines,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>In a statement, Welby said: \u201cI am and have been fully aware of Bishop Nick\u2019s long-term, committed relationship. His appointment as bishop of Grantham was made on the basis of his skills and calling to serve the church in the diocese of Lincoln. He lives within the bishops\u2019 guidelines and his sexuality is completely irrelevant to his office.\u201d<br></p> <p>In a letter to parishes in his diocese, Lowson said: \u201cI am satisfied now, as I was at the time of his appointment, that Bishop Nicholas fully understands, and lives by, the House of Bishops\u2019 guidance on issues in human sexuality. For me, and for those who assisted in his appointment, the fact that Bishop Nicholas is gay is not, and has never been, a determining factor.\u201d<br></p> <p>The C of E has been deeply divided over issues of sexuality. For the past two years, it has been involved in a series of painful internal discussions on the church\u2019s attitudes to LGBT people and whether it can accept same-sex marriage. Its traditional belief that marriage is a union of a man and a woman has come under pressure from societal change and growing demands within the church that gay people should be accepted and allowed to marry in church.<br></p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/21/gay-anglican-clergy-to-defy-churchs-official-stance-on-same-sex-marriage\">increasing number of priests</a> have married or plan to marry same-sex partners in defiance of the ban on gay clergy marrying.</p> <p>This week, a group of C of E conservative evangelical parishes <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/28/church-of-england-parishes-consider-first-step-to-break-away-ove/\">held a meeting</a> to discuss their response to what they claimed to be the watering-down of the authority of the Bible on the issue of sexuality, in what was billed as potentially the first step towards a breakaway from the Anglican church. It followed <a href=\"http://www.christiantoday.com/article/justin.welby.i.am.constantly.consumed.with.horror.at.the.way.the.church.has.treated.gay.people/94077.htm\">Welby\u2019s recent comments</a> at a Christian festival, when he said he was \u201cconstantly consumed with horror\u201d at the church\u2019s treatment of lesbians and gay men.</p> <p>Chamberlain said he had been with his partner for many years. \u201cIt is faithful, loving, we are like-minded, we enjoy each other\u2019s company and we share each other\u2019s life,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>Stressing that he did not want to become known as \u201cthe gay bishop\u201d, he said he hoped that the impact of his openness would be \u201cthat we can say the bishop of Grantham is gay and is getting on with his life and ministry\u201d. However, as a member of the C of E\u2019s College of Bishops, which meets this month to discuss the next stage of the church\u2019s discussions about sexuality, Chamberlain may come under pressure to be a representative for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/lgbt-rights\">LGBT rights</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI will speak [at the meeting], and this part of me will be known. I hope I\u2019ll be able to be a standard-bearer for all people as a gay man. And I really hope that I\u2019ll be able to help us move on beyond matters of sexuality,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not to say this isn\u2019t an important matter \u2013 I\u2019m not brushing it aside,\u201d he added. But the church needed to focus on issues such as deprivation, inequality and refugees, he said.</p> <p>Asked whether other bishops might follow his lead in openly declaring their sexuality, he said: \u201cI really can only speak for myself. If I\u2019m an encouragement to others, that would be great.\u201d<br></p> <p>Chamberlain said the C of E was \u201cstill at the beginning of a process of learning\u201d about issues of sexuality, describing it as a struggle. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve reached a position where the church is going to be marrying same-sex couples,\u201d he said. He declined to express objections to the C of E\u2019s celibacy rule for gay clergy. \u201cMy observation of human beings over the years has shown me how much variety there is in the way people express their relationships. Physical expression is not for everyone.\u201d<br></p> <p>He hoped to be \u201cjudged by my actions as a parish priest, a bishop \u2013 and by the Lord ultimately. My sexual identity is part of who I am, but it\u2019s the ministry that matters.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement, the C of E said: \u201cThe church has said for some time that it would be unjust to exclude from consideration for the episcopate anyone seeking to live fully in conformity with the church\u2019s teaching on sexual ethics or other areas of personal life and discipline.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/16/senior-bishop-change-church-of-england-attitudes-gay-people\">Senior bishop calls for change in C of E attitudes to gay people</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rumours about gay bishops have circulated for decades, but no serving bishop has ever before gone public about their sexuality. David Hope, the former archbishop of York, said that his sexuality was a \u201cgrey area\u201d after being threatened with being \u201couted\u201d; and former archbishop of Canterbury George Carey claimed to have knowingly consecrated two celibate gay men as bishops in the 1990s.<br></p> <p>In 2003 <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article1909777.ece\">the Times reported</a> that the Right Rev Peter Wheatley, then the bishop of Edmonton, was gay and living with his partner. He said he was \u201ca celibate Christian living by Christian teachings\u201d.</p> <p>Also in 2003, Jeffrey John, now the dean of St Albans, was nominated as bishop of Reading while being in a same-sex relationship with another C of E priest. Despite publicly declaring the relationship to be celibate, John withdrew from the nomination after an outcry from conservative Anglicans.<br></p> <p>In the same year in the US, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/oct/31/gayrights.religion\">Gene Robinson</a> was elected as bishop of New Hampshire, a move that split the Episcopal church.

  "<p>For a party with one MP and poll ratings that rarely reach double figures, the Greens have exerted a disproportionate influence on national politics, while also failing to fulfil their potential.</p> <p>One explanation for this contradiction is the party\u2019s self-imposed confinement to the leftmost portion of the electoral battleground. In last May\u2019s general election, the Greens won 3.8% of the vote \u2013 a record performance but not the breakthrough that had been forecast earlier in the campaign. The greatest impact was on the Labour party.</p> <p>In the aftermath of the election, the modest Green \u201csurge\u201d was read by many on the left as a symptom of Labour having surrendered the hallowed space of principled opposition to a pluckier, more radical rival. That was a factor steering disheartened members in the direction then advocated by Jeremy Corbyn. The feeling was mutual, with some Green supporters transferring their loyalty to Mr Corbyn or dividing their allegiance between the two parties.</p> <p>This dynamic contains a challenge for Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley, named yesterday as co-leaders of Green party of England and Wales. (The unprecedented job-sharing arrangement reflects well on the party\u2019s willingness to embrace alternative ways of conducting politics \u2013 in this case playing catch-up with a tried and tested practice in many British workplaces.)</p> <p>Ms Lucas, MP for Brighton, and Mr Bartley, the party\u2019s work and pensions spokesman, take over from Natalie Bennett, whose tenure looks, with hindsight, like a period of steady growth and missed opportunity.</p> <p>Under Ms Bennett, the Greens stood on a platform of wide-ranging assault on austerity and free-market capitalism. This yielded a dividend in attracting defectors from Labour and the Liberal Democrats. It also cast the party as a vehicle for radical left protest politics \u2013 a role that Mr Corbyn has now usurped and seems unlikely to surrender.</p> <p>Ms Lucas and Mr Bartley now have to decide whether they are happy to be ideological satellites in orbit around a Corbynised Labour. If not, they must find a way to reassert a distinct Green identity. Speaking after their commanding victory \u2013 their joint ticket took 86% of first-preference votes \u2013 the new leaders gave some indication of their priorities: Ms Lucas called for a second referendum to ratify the outcome of any Brexit settlement negotiated by the government; Mr Bartley made the case for electoral reform and committed the Greens to collaboration with other parties in the formation of a \u201cprogressive alliance\u201d.</p> <p>That is a reasonable ambition given the increasingly fluid nature of political affiliation in Britain, although the concept is advocated more often than it is defined. It too often refers to a theoretical coalition united by little more than shared antipathy towards the Conservative party. It masks significant differences of policy, ideology and strategy between and within self-identifying forces of \u201cprogress\u201d \u2013 not least the question of whether private enterprise and markets are to be harnessed or dismantled in pursuit of environmental protection and social justice.</p> <p>In that context, Ms Lucas and Mr Bartley have a choice to make between the politics of generalised, green-tinged anti-capitalist agitation and a more strategically-minded deployment of arguments on energy and climate change that might resonate across the political spectrum. They could, for example, break an old taboo and acknowledge that an environmental conscience is not the exclusive property of the left.</p> <p>That does not mean the party needs to repudiate current positions, only that it acknowledge the extent to which green politics is seen by many non-aligned voters as an obsession for the radical fringe \u2013 and one that demands onerous material sacrifices from everyone else.</p> <p>If real progress is to be made, the case must more effectively be made that action to protect the environment can be taken in ways that enhance prosperity and security; indeed that inaction is the more perilous course. People who are not already wedded to green causes need reassurance that it is an agenda fit for mainstream participation.</p> <p>British voters are amply served by Labour if they want broad-brush complaint about the Tories and economic inequality. The Greens should not be jostling for position in a race to have the most radical-sounding exposition of every problem, but occupy instead the available niche for a progressive party, focused on the environment and trading in imaginative, pragmatic solutions.</p>",

It does not affect alcohol-based hand sanitizers and wipes, which the FDA is <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm509097.htm\">still investigating</a>, or certain <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm445002.htm\">healthcare products</a> meant specifically for clinical settings. The FDA has given manufacturers a year to change their products or pull them off shelves.</p> <p>The FDA first proposed a rule about the chemicals in 2013, following research that they might affect human hormones or change natural resistance to bacteria. The agency requested research from the producers to back up their health claims, but in the three years since has found that data lacking or their requests ignored.<br></p> <p>Triclosan has been proven effective at killing bacteria if used at sustained length \u2013 far longer than the few seconds most people spend washing their hands \u2013 and was once only found in healthcare settings.</p> <p>Recent studies have linked triclosan to a series of disruptions in human and animal health. A University of Chicago study released in July found that triclosan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/30/anti-bacterial-skin-care-microbiome-antimicrobial-harm\">changed the microbiome inside human guts</a>, and its researchers suggested that exposure could damage developing fetuses. A study from earlier this year found that overuse <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/mar/14/antibiotic-resistance-nhs-fda-agriculture-health-pfizer\">could also be contributing to antibiotic resistance</a>, and <a href=\"http://time.com/4035442/antibacterial-soap-ineffective/\">a 2015 study</a> found that antibacterial formulas were not more effective than soap and water.</p> <p>Triclosan can be found in 93% of liquid soaps labeled \u201cantibacterial\u201d or \u201cantimicrobial\u201d, according to the FDA, though some companies, including Proctor &amp; Gamble, have already begun phasing the chemical out of products. There are partial triclosan bans in the European Union and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/jun/19/minnesota-ban-triclosan-germ-killing-chemical\">Minnesota</a>, but the chemical remains common in toothpaste, as it is <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0061266/\">believed effective against the bacteria</a> that cause gum disease. </p> <p>People should still keep their hands clean, the FDA noted. \u201cWashing with plain soap and running water remains one of the most important steps consumers can take to avoid getting sick and to prevent spreading germs to others,\u201d the agency said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that if people need to use a hand sanitizer, it should have at least 60% alcohol.</p> <p>Professor Patrick McNamara, who has published research on antimicrobial soaps, called the ruling \u201clogical\u201d because research shows \u201cthere is no added benefit to having these antimicrobial chemicals in soaps\u201d.<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">He added that triclosan could play a part in driving antibiotic resistance, saying, \u201cafter these chemicals are used in our homes they go down the drain to wastewater treatment plants and eventually to the environment where they can select for antibiotic resistance genes\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn short, triclosan and triclocarbon present a risk towards propagation of antibiotic resistance,\u201d he said. \u201cSince they do not offer added benefits when washing hands, their use is not worth their environmental risk.</p>",

He added that in the UK, the brand would benefit from being well known to Polish emigrants.</p> <p>\u201cThe Polish now make up the largest [non-British] ethnic group in the UK. That\u2019s a good sign for Reserved. They will already have a strong foundation of expats who would recognise the brand and are perhaps interested in shopping there,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Hall agreed Reserved would be helped by being recognisable to Polish families living in and visiting the capital. However, she said that the chain\u2019s family ethos, which is less trend led than the likes of Zara or H&amp;M and priced somewhere between H&amp;M and Primark, would not necessarily take off here. \u201cThe UK is the most competitive market in the world. LPP will know this market and will have visited often but it\u2019s still challenging for retailers coming in because there is already so much choice.\u201d <br></p> <p>She said having a site in London was important for brands wanting a global presence, with LPP\u2019s move likely to be more an international marketing statement rather than the start of a significant UK presence.</p> <p>LPP confirmed it did not have plans for more UK stores but would be launching online here at the same time as it opens its Oxford Street site.</p> <p>The spokeswoman said: \u201cWe know the UK is a tough market but this flagship on Oxford Street is a marketing move. We want to show our clients we are a global brand \u2013 if they go to Berlin, the UK and the Middle East they will see the Reserved logo everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>The move into London comes at a time of rapid growth for LPP, although its main Reserved brand has experienced some difficulties after relying perhaps too heavily on one fashion trend: the retro look.</p> <p>It has now hired a new creative director to help overhaul its range and is revamping its products and logistics operation. </p> <p>Gaul said: \u201cMost of LPP\u2019s success has so far been with its Reserved brand but now it is diversifying, which is a good sign. It is getting a good mix of up and coming brands focused on different types of consumer to balance out any ups and downs. You often find in fashion that when the more luxury brands are not performing the discount brands do so \u2013 that\u2019s a natural hedge.\u201d</p> <p>In the UK, he suggested LPP will have to step up its game online, in a market where tech-loving UK shoppers expect to be able to browse via mobile phones, tablet computers or apps.</p> <p>Keeping pace with the highly competitive UK market, where online shopping continues to challenge traditional high street players, will just be part of LPP\u2019s challenge to ensure it\u2019s not just another three letter acronym footnote in history.

Classification involves medical and functional assessment of competitors. They are observed in training and at competitions during the classification process.</p> <p>Umbrella Paralympics organisations, such as the British Paralympic Association, play no hands-on role in the classification of individual athletes apart from ensuring that classification conforms to the rules and is delivered in a consistent way. UK Athletics is responsible for the classification of track and field Paralympic competitors.</p> <p>Correctly classifying an athlete can be a complex process and those who are classified incorrectly may gain an unfair advantage over other athletes.</p> <h2>What is a sport class? </h2> <p>A sport class is a category which groups athletes depending on how much their impairment impacts on performance in their sport, according to the IPC. Therefore, a sport class does not necessarily comprise one impairment type alone, but can include athletes with different impairments. A sport class is allocated through athlete evaluations by classifiers. Each international federation trains and certifies classifiers to conduct classification in its sport.</p> <h2>How does classification work in practice?</h2> <p>Some Paralympic sports only have one sport class, such as powerlifting, the IPC says. To compete in these sports, the athletes only need to meet the minimal impairment criteria.<br></p> <p>In team sports such as wheelchair rugby, the players are allocated points, which indicate their activity limitation. A lower score indicates a more severe activity limitation than a higher score. A team is not allowed to have more than a certain maximum sum of points on the field of play at the same time in order to ensure equal competition with the opposing team.<br></p>",

Medical records are part of the classification system but there\u2019s a degree of trust in what is offered to the classifiers. Should an athlete, coach, national governing body or a country choose not to present the entire data it is possible that an inaccurate classification could take place.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/02/how-does-paralympic-classification-work\">How does Paralympic classification work?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Classification is sport specific and is governed by different international sports federations under the codes of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). Competitors are observed in training and at competitions during the process. <br></p> <p>Umbrella Paralympics organisations, such as the BPA, play no hands-on role in the classification of individual athletes apart from ensuring that the process conforms to the rules.</p> <p>One of Great Britain\u2019s leading young Paralympians, who has won medals in the Games, is understood to be close to confirming that she has withdrawn from her sport because of her disquiet about what is happening in classification. Her father said: \u201cShe\u2019s categoric about leaving the sport. She feels there has been a breakdown in her trust and faith in the classification system.\u201d</p> <p>While the majority of Paralympians would appear to be correctly classified, accusations of misrepresentation have become so widespread that some of the Paralympian sports\u2019 governing bodies are now attempting to control them, with one UKA official sending an email warning athletes not to make \u201cbaseless\u201d claims or face legal action. The nature of Paralympic classification can lend itself to some disgruntled competitors and their advocates pointing the finger at their rivals, whether or not they are actually competing in the right class.<br></p> <p>Historically, there have been a few high-profile cases of cheating in Paralympic sport. At the 2000 Games, the Spanish basketball team was disqualified after winning gold. It had been discovered that most of the team members did not have learning difficulties as they had claimed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"727f6491298c87eb700d54a309db66564f5c23f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/727f6491298c87eb700d54a309db66564f5c23f9/0_47_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Spanish basketball team celebrate their victory over Russia in the final of the 2000 Paralympics in Sydney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Spanish basketball team celebrate their victory over Russia in the final of the 2000 Paralympics in Sydney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Rycroft/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even some top sports officials have been known to cast doubts. The Guardian has discovered that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/nov/21/gb-paralympic-coach-paula-dunn\">Paula Dunn</a>, UKA\u2019s Paralympics head coach, said earlier this year that she would resign after admitting she made comments suggesting one of Britain\u2019s best medal hopefuls was too able-bodied for their category. She later retracted her resignation and now insists that the athlete in question is correctly classified \u2013 a view held up by an internal UKA inquiry. </p> <p>Dunn also circulated an email to athletes and their families in December last year relating to classification, stating that the athletics governing body \u201cwill have no hesitation in taking legal action against anyone found to have made baseless allegations in the public domain\u201d.</p> <p>When asked about the email this week, Dunn told the Guardian: \u201cIt was clarified at a later date. I did put it out \u2026 I think I had just come back from a major championships and we had had a lot of people making complaints, and you get slightly frustrated that you have gone through a system and people are still questioning whether you have got it right or wrong.\u201d</p> <p>There are also concerns that flaws in the classification system may result in competitors being inadvertently placed in the wrong classes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bf71d13bf22885864a9be962f80765b180490934\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf71d13bf22885864a9be962f80765b180490934/508_388_2953_6274/471.jpg\" alt=\"Olivia Breen models the Team GB kit for Rio 2016.\" width=\"471\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olivia Breen models the Team GB kit for Rio 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adidas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Michael Breen, the father of the Paralympic runner Olivia Breen, has complained to the sport\u2019s governing body about the way athletes are classified and his views have also helped prompt the UKA to launch its planned inquiry. Breen, a solicitor, said: \u201cThe current classification system is not fit for purpose. Consequently, some athletes have been incorrectly classified.\u201d</p> <p>He said, in his opinion, UKA seemed to be primarily focused on medals. Citing the Dunn warning email, he claimed: \u201cThey blatantly threaten athletes, their parents and coaches with litigation and therefore because of this intimidation people are too frightened to speak out about erroneous classifications. This is not how Paralympic sport should be conducted.\u201d</p> <p>The claims of cheating and wrongful classification have so far failed to gain much traction with the governing bodies, however. Xavier Gonzalez, the IPC\u2019s chief executive, said last month that the committee had looked into 80 individual cases but had failed to find any proof of competitors being wrongly categorised.</p> <p>Breen questioned these findings and the level of proof required by the IPC. He said the classification system would be fairer if all athletes consented to their relevant medical records being made public, and if a clear whistleblowing policy was established.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Tim Hollingsworth, the chief executive of the BPA, said Grey-Thompson had not identified to him any specific athletes about whom she had concerns. He said: \u201cWhat she has done and said to me and others is that she\u2019s aware of some athletes within the system who would like to see classification made more robust and transparent and she is pushing hard to advocate that.\u201d</p> <p>He insisted he had no concerns about classification but conceded that it could be improved. \u201cWe will be drawing on some of these thoughts about transparency and robustness and athletes feeling that classification should be objective and transparent. We intend, post-Games, to take a more considered view about how [individual] sports and the IPC can develop practices that are more transparent.\u201d</p> <p>An IPC spokesman said: \u201cThe IPC firmly acknowledges that the classification environment requires continued attention. Over the past years dialogue with IFs [international federations] and NPC [national Paralympic committee] classification experts has intensified and more sports and IFs have recognised the urgent need for investments in research, classifier training and certification, and potentially some revisions of classification systems.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Following publication, a UKA spokesperson said: \u201cDecisions relating to the classification of international para-athletes are handled by the International Paralympic Committee. UK Athletics is not responsible for the classification of any of its athletes competing internationally. We are confident of the classification of all British athletes who took part in Rio and we always cooperate 100% with the IPC to ensure that all GB athletes are correctly classified in line with international rules. A complaint was made earlier this year by a parent of a UK athlete in connection with the classification of other athletes. This was fully investigated by UKA and the IPC who found the complaint to be without merit and we consider the matter to be at an end\u201d. <br><br></li> </ul>",

On Thursday England chased down 248 from a perilous 74 for four in the 15th over through a controlled display of batting from Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow in their 103-run stand, before Moeen Ali\u2019s unbeaten 45 from No7 negotiated a situation that, on another day, could easily have disintegrated fast.</p> <p>Certainly Morgan noted the benefit after the match, saying: \u201cI think our best is good enough to beat most sides. But when we are off, it is important other guys fall in behind and today proved that. Losing wickets early puts you back quite a bit. But guys who have not had an opportunity to contribute throughout this series stepped up.\u201d</p> <p>Stokes, for whom one-day cricket has been a slightly hit and miss affair thus far, demonstrated maturity in the run chase with his 69 from 70 balls, not least because he would have been itching to go hard after being next man in during the Trent Bridge butchery. \u201cBen is a hugely talented player but very aggressive too,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cThe more he plays the more he finds his own tempo. We encourage him to explore that because it is important he feels comfortable with the way he bats.

He will miss the derby at Old Trafford, plus the visit of Bournemouth on 17 September and the EFL Cup trip to Swansea City four days later.</p> <p>The charge relates to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/28/manchester-city-west-ham-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">City\u2019s 3-1 victory over West Ham United on Sunday</a> when Ag\u00fcero appeared to elbow Winston Reid.

Tour\u00e9\u2019s contract expires next summer.</p> <p>City may face a United defence which is below full-strength at Old Trafford because Antonio Valencia\u2019s late return from the international break could force Jos\u00e9 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/jose-mourinho\" title=\"\">Mourinho</a> into using Phil Jones, Matteo Darmian or Timothy Fosu-Mensah at right-back despite none having played this season.</p> <p>Valencia is away with Ecuador but does not return until next Friday, the day before City\u2019s visit.

If one candidate has been to Eton and the other to a comprehensive, the guy from Eton gets the job. If both candidates have been to Eton but one is wearing brown shoes, the other guy will get it. Of course it\u2019s unfair, it\u2019s bullshit. But the City will never change.\u201d</p> <p>Among some younger City workers though, there is a belief that the sartorial code is slowly becoming more relaxed. Charles Courtney, 23, a broker with currency trader Sigma Trading, is sporting a natty pair of what could be accurately described as brown hybrid slip-on tasseled brogues.</p> <p>\u201cThe City is an old established place and there are a lot of rules that go back hundreds of years,\u201d he says. \u201cIt comes with the territory. But up-and-coming firms tend to be more chilled, so it\u2019s definitely changing. Back in the 80s, if you were wearing brown shoes you\u2019d get booed off the trading floor.\u201d</p> <p>To those not steeped in the traditions of the London financial milieu, the brown shoe rule is an idiosyncratic quirk of Britishness. Frank van der Korput, 37, works for a Lloyds of London insurer and has had to get used to watching what he puts on his feet.</p> <p>\u201cIn Holland and Italy, it\u2019s fairly normal to wear brown shoes but here it\u2019s like a little bit of history.

  "<p>As an infectious disease physician, scanning breaking news headlines for stories about Zika is a work-related hobby. The latest bit of bad news to cross the wire, on Thursday, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/01/zika-virus-found-mosquitoes-miami-beach\">the confirmation</a> that mosquitoes in Miami Beach harbor the Zika virus. </p> <p>Reading this announcement, the general public might rightly be pessimistic about the medical community\u2019s ability to cope with emerging infectious diseases \u2013 Zika just seems to keep on spreading. However, despite <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/18/zika-virus-bill-funding\">the politicization of the disease</a> and the difficulties individual local health agencies may have marshaling resources, the scientific community\u2019s response so far has actually been a resounding success. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/08/zika-doctor-pregnant-women-obgyn-florida\">I\u2019m treating pregnant women with Zika and this is what it\u2019s like | Christine Curry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the span of less than a year, the scientific and medical worlds have moved at a breakneck speed, probably not seen since the dawn of the HIV pandemic, to not only unravel the mysteries of this virus but to provide a pathway to ultimately extinguish its ability to threaten our species. </p> <p>When Zika, a virus believed for decades to be almost entirely benign, appeared for the first time in the western hemisphere, it coincided with a remarkable spike in numbers of newborns with microcephaly, a devastating and extremely costly condition that leads to cognitive impairment, developmental delays and early death. This sort of brain damage was never before associated with Zika, or with any disease like it. </p> <p>A major scientific endeavor \u2013 and indeed the driving force behind the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) quick declaration of a public health emergency \u2013 was required to establish whether these two events were merely correlated, or if a causal relationship existed. In a remarkably short span of time, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) put Zika through <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsr1604338#t=article\">Shepard\u2019s criteria</a>, a rigorous series of steps used to establish causation for fetal abnormalities like microcephaly. A similar establishment of causality was made for Zika\u2019s role in the autoimmune neurologic disorder Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Concurrently, separate efforts to develop a vaccine effective against Zika flourished, leading to at least two candidate vaccines (with more to follow) <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/6/28/12047994/zika-virus-possible-vaccine-successful-mice-trials\">already moving</a> into human trials. Laboratory diagnostics for Zika, which were virtually non-existent a year ago, are now available all over the world and will probably become even more refined and accessible after the WHO took steps to internationally standardize the strain of Zika used in research and development this week. </p> <p>It is crucial to realize that these diagnostic tests have not yet been formally licensed for use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but have been made available through Emergency Use Authorizations. These emergency authorizations are the result of important legislation that emphasized the absolute need to eliminate bureaucratic hurdles in the midst of a public health emergency. </p> <p>Indeed, a whole portion of the FDA \u2013 the Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats \u2013 was created years ago for just this very reason, and this office\u2019s efforts in prior emergencies, such as the 2009 flu pandemic and the 2014 Ebola outbreak, altered the course of those outbreaks for the better.</p> <p>More basic scientific questions have also been probed by multiple research groups and have revealed the virus\u2019s proclivity for traversing the placenta to reach the fetus, and the molecular pathways the immune system uses to combat the virus\u2019s attack. This week, researchers also found that we may be able to repurpose a tapeworm medication to fight Zika, which would fast-track the process of delivering the drug to the market, because it is already approved by the FDA. </p> <p>With each outbreak, leaders in the fields of infectious disease and public health preparedness become more skilled as they integrate the lessons of the past into their knowledge base. The flourishing of the human species is directly related to our ability to minimize the impacts of these threats. </p> <p>There is a tendency with every outbreak of disease to see the litany of negative headlines and hear the hoof beats of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The burden caused by Zika, thus far, has been sizable, and for those families in which a pregnancy was affected, incalculable. </p> <p>However, the historic scientific and medical advances that have characterized the response to the Zika outbreak show the profound advancement of modern science, and ultimately how far we have come in confronting global threats of disease.</p>",
  "<p>British and US marine scientists say that the race to designate ever-bigger marine national parks in remote parts of the world could work against conservation.<br></p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X1630481X\">commentary</a> timed to coincide with President Obama\u2019s announcement of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/26/obama-to-create-worlds-largest-protected-marine-area-off-coast-of-hawaii-papahanaumokuakea\">huge extension of a marine park off Hawaii</a>, the authors argue that the creation of very large marine protection areas (Vlmpas) may give the illusion of conservation, when in fact they may be little more than \u201cpaper parks\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not enough to simply cover the remotest parts of our oceans in notional \u2018protection\u2019 \u2013 we need to focus on seas closer to shore, where most of the fishing and drilling actually happens,\u201d said Peter Jones, a marine researcher at University College London.</p> <p>Co-author Elizabeth de Santo, an assistant professor at Franklin and Marshall College in Pennsylvania, added that the push for quantity over quality threatens to undermine sustainability.</p> <p>\u201cThere are concerns that marine conservation aims could be undermined by this focus on a few big areas. The marine biodiversity target is about much more than the proportion of the seas that are covered,\u201d she said.</p> <p>In the past five years over 20 huge new marine parks have been designated by countries, including Britain, in response to calls by marine scientists to protect more of the oceans. </p> <p>The Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea park off Hawaii, which will cover 582,578 square miles and include the world\u2019s longest and most remote chain of coarl islands, is by some way the world\u2019s biggest, covering an area larger than all US country\u2019s national parks combined.</p> <p>The authors question the motives of the conservationists. \u201cEvery time there is a new \u2018leader\u2019 in the size stakes, it is feted... giving the impression of a competitive edge. This race has been enthusiastically supported by conservation campaign groups and donors, and many governments have joined in, all keen to gain the green credentials associated with remote VLMPAs,\u201d says the paper in the journal Marine Policy.<br></p> <p>But other marine scientists this week defended the size of the VLMPAs. \u201cSize is often a critical component of effectiveness. What is needed is for the conservation NGOs to wake up to the fact that size isn\u2019t everything, and to push equally hard for representative, equitable, effective, local, nearshore protected areas,\u201d said Nature Conservancy marine researcher Mark Spalding, in email correspondence.<br></p> <p>The global target, agreed in 2010 at the Convention for biological diversity meeting in Japan, is to designate 10% of the world\u2019s oceans by 2020. But what has happened, say the authors, is that countries have taken the politically easy route, creating vast parks in remote places without taking into account their conservation value or their ability or countries\u2019 willingness to police them. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/13/chile-plans-easter-island-marine-park-fishing\">Chile plans world's biggest marine park to protect Easter Island fish stocks</a> </p> </aside>  <p> There is now a great imbalance between a few giant protected areas and the many thousands very small ones which together cover only 3.27% of the global marine area, they say. \u201cWithout remote VLMPAs , the 10% target would be even further from being reached,\u201d said Jones.</p> <p>The authors emphasise that they do not discourage the designation of vast remote MPAs, but fear that by focusing on size could divert attention, political will and resources from the need for smaller MPAs in seas that are being overfished. <br></p> <p>\u201c[Their] vastness and remoteness pose major enforcement challenges. Whilst emerging satellite surveillance technology can help detect illegal fishing vessels, there are still challenges in detaining such vessels through interception by a fisheries patrol vessel, which are very expensive to operate in such vast distant areas,\u201d they say.</p> <p>Last year the UK said it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/18/pitcairn-islands-marine-reserve-budget-2015\">would create what was then the world\u2019s largest continuous marine reserve around the Pitcairn islands</a>, and another huge protected area was designated around Ascension Island in January 2016. Chile, France and New Zealand have all made similar moves turning the waters surrounding their remotest island territories into huge nature reserves.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the perspective of governments, it is clear that remote VLMPAs are win-win, in that they gain green credentials and contribute to each country\u2019s progress towards the Aichi [2010] target. </p> <p>\u201cWhy go through the politically and economically expensive process of designating relatively small MPAs around the mainland when you can designate remote Vlmpas in overseas territories with minimal costs and many gains?\u201d, the authors ask.<br></p> <p><br></p>",

Caroline Lucas and her co-leader Jonathan Bartley delivered their first leaders\u2019 speech in tandem - with one delivering one passage, before handing over to the other - and as a result it sounded a bit a school show and tell. The writing was strong, Lucas and Bartley are both confident speakers, but this format meant the speech never really built up any rhetorical momentum.</p> <p>That aside, and turning to the content, it was fine. It did not say anything particularly surprising, but Lucas and Bartley delivered a robust critique of the conduct of the EU referendum, and of inequality, and they presented a solid, progressive vision. There was relatively little environmentalism in it, but much more on the case for political reform, even if they were vague on what a progressive alliance with Labour might look like. The Greens seem quite serious about collaborating with Labour because, although Lucas and Bartley were damning about the Tories, they said virtually nothing critical of Labour, apart from Bartley\u2019s sharp opening joke - \u201cwe stand here, more united as party with two leaders than others are with one\u201d - which may well be the line from the speech most likely to be remembered.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c9823be4b0c2a396c0698c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T13:45:23.478Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Lucas is now winding up.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Conference, it\u2019s been said that \u201cWe write history with our feet and with our presence and our collective voice and vision\u201d.</p> <p>We write history by resisting the climate crisis.

Like most small parties the Greens are very strong supporters of proportional representation (for obvious reasons - it took more than 1m votes to elect just one Green MP) . But there is no prospect of PR for Westminster arriving anytime soon and so currently there is an active debate in the party about how the Greens could cooperate electorally with Labour and other parties on the left. <strong>Caroline Lucas </strong>and Jonathan Bartley have made this an issue in their leadership campaign (their slogan is \u201cthe power of working together\u201d) and Lucas is the joint editor, with the Labour MP <strong>Nisa Nandy</strong> and the Lib Dem activist <strong>Chris Bowers</strong> of a new book called <a href=\"https://www.bitebackpublishing.com/books/the-alternative\">The Alternative: Towards a New Progressive Politics</a> which features essays about how progressive politicians from different parties might work together.</p> <p>There are various ideas floating around about how Labour and the Greens could work together. Here are four options.</p> <p><strong><em>1 - A proper pact - or an alliance called Plaform</em></strong></p> <p>The new book, The Alternative, does not make any firm proposals for Labour/Green cooperation. But in their conclusion Lucas and her co-authors quote at length a proposal from the Guardian journalist <strong>Stephen Moss</strong>, who wrote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/12/could-you-build-new-part-of-the-left-labour-jeremy-corbyn\">a long feature last summer looking at the possibility of building a new party of the left. </a>He floated the idea of an alliance called Platform, featuring four partners: a socialist Labour, a social democrat Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens. He suggested they could agree a set of common values and policies, and then in any seat put up the candidate (ie, Socialist Platform) most likely to win. The others could stand aside, or just put up paper candidates.</p> <p><strong><em>2 - A progressive kitemark</em></strong></p> <p>Lucas, Nandy and Bowers also float another idea in The Alternative - a progressive kitemark. They write:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Another [idea] might be for the progressives to establish a \u2018progressive kite mark\u2019 to which candidates at the 2020 election (and even earlier elections) could sign up to demonstrate to their electorate a commitment to a core set of priorities, which would include red lines for all the parties involved. This kind of pre-election identification could also help to prepare the ground for post-election cooperation without any formal agreement needing to happen before the election.</p> </blockquote> <p>Interestingly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/19/liberals-celebrities-and-eu-supporters-set-up-progressive-movement\">Paddy Ashdown, the former Lib Dem leader, is currently promoting a similar idea. </a></p> <p><strong><em>3 - Informal \u201cnon-compete\u201d agreement</em></strong></p> <p>The most basic form of cooperation involves parties coming to an understanding, privately, they they won\u2019t try very hard in each other\u2019s target seats at an election. Labour and the Lib Dems operated on this basis in 1997.</p> <p><strong><em>4 - Formal \u201cnon-compete\u201d agreements in certain areas</em></strong></p> <p><strong>Adam Ramsay,</strong> the Open Democracy co-editor and Green activist, floated this <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/adam-ramsay/green-party-should-help-build-progressive-alliance\">in an article on the case for a progressive alliance earlier this summer.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the nature of an electoral pact, there is a spectrum of options ... My preference is something in the middle.</p> <p>Specifically, political activist and electoral statistics geek Elliot Folan <a href=\"https://opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/elliot-folan/what-would-labour-green-electoral-pact-actually-look-like\">conveniently outlined</a> what such a deal might look like a number of months ago. They highlighted a list of seats in which it might be sensible for Labour to stand down for the Greens and vice versa, without going the whole hog and withdrawing candidates en mass. How many each party stood aside in would have to be the result of a tricky negotiation between respective central and national parties, and I think Greens should be willing to ask for quite a lot: after all, it would be Labour who would get to be in government. Ultimately, for Greens, such a deal could offer a serious chance to elect two or three more MPs. Let\u2019s be honest: that\u2019s unlikely otherwise.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is, though, one rather significant problem with all these proposals, and that is that the Labour leadership has shown very little interest in any form of alliance with the Greens.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/26/caroline-lucas-labour-jeremy-corbyn-progressive-alliance-green-party\">Lucas said last month that her office had been told by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office that he had \u201cnot shut the door\u201d on the idea of talking about a cross-party electoral alliance.</a> But Corbyn himself has said during the Labour leadership contest that he does not favour a progressive alliance. At one hustings meeting he said that Labour was \u201cdifferent from any other party\u201d and growing very quickly on its own. He may like Lucas personally (many Labour MPs do) but, with Labour currently hoovering up the Greens\u2019 voters, he has little incentive to form some pact with them.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T12:23:06.260Z\">at 1.23pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c83da4e4b00c28eaea75f0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T11:02:03.424Z\">12.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There has been some controversy about Caroline Lucas\u2019s decision to stand again for the leadership. This is what <strong>Matt Townsend</strong>, a Green activist, wrote in <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/matt-townsend/green-party-leadership-election-stitch-up\">an article for Open Democracy in June.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The announcement by Caroline about returning as leader, I believe, has meant that most who were considering running campaigns now won\u2019t put their name forward. I am sure there will be some competition, but the general expectation is of a coronation rather than a real contest. Caroline is the Green Party\u2019s only national household name politician. Unless something amazing happens, there is a risk the contest has already been killed off ...</p> <p>[Bartley] is relatively unknown within the Green Party outside London. By being on a joint ticket with Caroline, he could become a co-leader of the party without any mandate of his own. He could ride in to the role on her coattails instead of earning his place through an open and fair contest which would have enabled him to become better known, test how the party feels about him and build up his profile ...</p> <p> It\u2019s easy to see how the Lucas-Bartley campaign can be justified. Two experienced media-savvy politicians, based in London and the South East, working together, for the good of the party \u2013 the end justifies the means. But does it really? Or maybe this kind of top-down decision-making by a party establishment just removes opportunities and ends fairness.</p> </blockquote> <p>In <a href=\"http://leftfootforward.org/2016/06/green-party-leadership-race-doesnt-need-to-be-a-coronation/\">a Left Foot Forward article in June </a><strong>Josiah Mortimer</strong> acknowledged that some members were unhappy about Lucas standing on a joint ticket with Bartley, but he defended their decision to put themselves forward.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Greens haven\u2019t done co-leadership since scrapping principal speakers around 2008. It\u2019s an exciting democratic model that\u2019s worth drawing the best elements from \u2013 and it\u2019s clear that the two candidates\u2019 qualities complement each other: Caroline \u2013 high profile, Jon \u2013 highly organised.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c958d1e4b00c28eaea77bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T10:48:06.340Z\">11.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is from <strong>Archie Thomas</strong>, the Green party\u2019s press manager.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Archie_Thomas/status/771635846743101440\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1,200 due to attend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GPConf?src=hash\">#GPConf</a> in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Birmingham?src=hash\">#Birmingham</a> - approx. 40% are first-timers.</p>&mdash; Archie Thomas (@Archie_Thomas) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Archie_Thomas/status/771635846743101440\">September 2, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c9572be4b09a68e9b64eaa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T10:46:46.117Z\">11.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Peter and I have arrived at the conference.

There is a full list of the party posts and candidates<a href=\"https://www.greenparty.org.uk/internal-elections/candidates.html\"> here.</a></p> <p>And here are short profiles of the leadership election candidates.</p> <h2>Jonathan Bartley and Caroline Lucas (job share)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7120ff003a060d8c0ffcd0fb37bae7927cdac3b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7120ff003a060d8c0ffcd0fb37bae7927cdac3b0/462_437_3951_2370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For many people Lucas is the Green party. A former MEP, and the only Green MP (she has represented Brighton Pavilion since 2010), she led the party from 2008 until 2012 and, even after she stepped down (she said she wanted others in the party to have a chance to raise their profile), she found it hard not to overshadow her successor, Natalie Bennett. An excellent media performer and accomplished parliamentarian, she is one of the few people in the party one could easily imagine serving in cabinet.</p> <p>Bartley, from Lambeth in south London, is the party\u2019s work and pensions spokesman. A former researcher for the Conservative party in the 1990s, he is the founder of a Christian thinktank, Ekklesia, and he has been active in the Green party for some years, standing as a candidate in London elections. He has a disabled son (and achieved prominence in the 2010 general election when he challenged David Cameron on camera over Tory policies on inclusive education) and he cites being a parent as one reason why he is applying for the leadership as a job share.</p> <p>Lucas and Bartely want to form a new \u201cprogressive alliance\u201d. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/31/caroline-lucas-stand-green-party-leadership-job-share\">Lucas told the Guardian earlier this summer: </a>\u201cI really think there is an appetite out there now for a less tribal politics ... There is a sense, which we felt very strongly with the job share idea itself, that more ideas, the more plural your politics, the more likely they will be effective, and reach more people\u201d.</p> <p>The Lucas/Bartley website is <a href=\"http://www.bartleylucas.com/\">here.</a></p> <h2>Clive Lord</h2> <p>Clive Lord is virtually a founder member of the Green party, having joined in March 1973, five months after it was set up. Aged 81 (although \u201cremarkably fit for my age\u201d, he says in his election statement), he says he is only standing because his preferred candidate, Andrew Cooper, did not put himself forward. Cooper is standing for the deputy leadership and Lord says that, if elected, he would hope Cooper could do much of the work.</p> <p>Lord wants the Green party to get back to focusing on how to save the planet. Sustainability requires \u201cde-growth\u201d, he argues. He says he once proposed \u201ca recession can be fun\u201d as a slogan, but that fortunately \u201cwiser (?) counsels prevailed\u201d.</p> <p>Here is<a href=\"https://clivelord.wordpress.com/2016/06/23/my-leadership-bid-latest/\"> Lord\u2019s website.</a></p> <h2>David Malone</h2> <p>Malone is a filmmaker who makes documentaries for the BBC and Channel 4 and who also writes about finance and economics. He published a book about the financial crash,<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Debt-Generation-David-Malone/dp/0956690203\"> The Debt Generation</a>, and his pitch for the leadership is that the party should focus more on economics. \u201cIt seems to me that one of the defining facts of our times is that around the world the established political parties have surrendered to the idea that economics and finance no longer need to be under democratic control,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is wrong and dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>Here is Malone\u2019s<a href=\"http://www.golemxiv.co.uk/\"> website.</a><br></p> <h2>Martie Warin</h2> <p>Aged 27, Warin is the youngest candidate. A musician and parish councillor from County Durham, he describes himself as an ecosocialist and says \u201csocialism is the philosophy of caring, capitalism, the philosophy of the greedy, ecosocialism is the philosophy of caring for the future\u201d. A member of the GMB, he also says that <a href=\"https://thenorwichradical.com/2016/07/30/our-greens-in-the-north/\">\u201cit is about time the Green party tried harder to forge robust alliances with trade unions,</a> as the values that we hold dear and the values of the trade unions go hand in hand.\u201d</p> <h2>Simon Cross</h2> <p>A Green party campaigner for many years, and a general election candidate in Rochford and Southend East in 2015, Cross has said that he wants the party to \u201crehabilitate progressive taxation\u201d and that this requires two things: \u201craising taxes fairly and explaining them honestly\u201d.</p> <h2><br></h2> <h2>David Williams</h2> <p>Williams spent 20 years as a Labour councillor and stood for parliament for the party three times. But he left the party in 2003, \u201cnot simply because they had launched the Iraq war but because they had adopted the philosophy and policies of Thatcherism\u201d. Since then he has been leader of the Green group on Oxford city council and he is currently leader of the Green group on Oxfordshire county council.</p> <p>He says that he is a great supporter of Lucas, but that he is standing because he does not want to see the party have a \u201ccoronation\u201d. He says the Greens are \u201ca political party not an environmental pressure group\u201d and that, if elected leader, he would tour the country building up the party.</p> <p>Here is William\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.david-williams-greenleader.co.uk/why-i-m-standing-.html\">website.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c837f5e4b09a68e9b64cbb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T08:43:31.949Z\">9.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One of the defining stories in British politics since 2010 has been the rise of insurgency parties. Ukip went from a party attracting under 1m votes (3.1%) in the general election six years ago to one getting 3.9m votes (12.6%) in 2015. The SNP transformed itself from a party that was seen as lucky to form a minority administration in Edinburgh to one that is now the unchallenged party of government in Scotland, with almost all the countries\u2019 MPs. And, in a less dramatic way, the same trended boosted the Greens. In 2010 they got just 286,000 votes (1%). Last year they were up to 1.2m (3.8%.) and their leader, Natalie Bennett, achieved prominence because she was included in the TV debates.</p> <p>But since then the Green party has collided with an obstacle - called Jeremy Corbyn. Corbyn\u2019s purist, anti-capitalist, green-tinged radicalism overlaps to a considerable degree with the Green party\u2019s policy platform. It is not just that Corbyn has an allotment; at the general election <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jan/18/green-party-citizens-income-natalie-bennett-benefit\">the Greens\u2019 flagship policy proposal was for a citizen\u2019s income </a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/05/john-mcdonnell-labour-universal-basic-income-welfare-benefits-compass-report\">Corbyn and his team are now actively considering whether Labour should adopt the idea. </a>As a result the Greens start their autumn conference today in Birmingham facing the challenge of how to compete or coexist with a Corbynite Labour party that seems to be stealing their USP.</p> <p>They also have to choose a new leader, although in truth they have already done so because the voting is over. The result will be announced at 2pm. Caroline Lucas, the former leader and only Green MP, is standing along with Jonathan Bartley as a job share and, although there are five other candidates, Lucas and Bartley are the overwhelming favourites to be elected. Almost 15,000 members votes in the contest (a turnout of 34%) but it is hard to avoid the suspicion that this is only the second most important leadership election for Green party voters this summer. After last year\u2019s Labour leadership election <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/09/15/anatomy-corbyns-victory/\">a YouGov analysis concluded that 40,000 of those voting in the contest were people who had voted Green in 2015. </a>Overwhelmingly they were voting for Corbyn. It is likely that this year there are more Green voters from 2015 taking party in Labour\u2019s leadership contest than in the Greens\u2019.</p> <p>I\u2019m on a Virgin train to Birmingham at the moment (with a seat) and I will be covering the opening of the conference, as well as any other Green-related developments. After the results of the leadership election are announced, the new leaders, or leaders, will address the conference. There will also be a debate about the universal basic income proposal.</p> <p>If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow.</a></p> <p>I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all.

  "<p>It is said to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/06/mediterranean-diet-statins-heart-attack-cardiovascular\">better at lowering cholesterol than statins</a>, and able to prevent dementia and heart disease, and will not make you fat. Anything that good for you might be expected to smell foul and come in a medicine bottle, but the Mediterranean diet is generally considered to be delicious, except by those who hate olive oil. </p> <p>It is a potential answer to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/09/obesitys-global-spread-un-goals-diet-related-diseases-fail\">obesity crisis crippling healthcare systems</a>, but few understand exactly what the diet is and most of us do not follow it, including increasing numbers of people who live in the Mediterranean. The scientist Ancel Keys and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/dec/08/elizabeth-david-first-lady-of-food\">cookery writer Elizabeth David</a>, two of the pioneers who helped open the eyes of northern Europeans to the wonders of the Mediterranean diet, must be turning in their graves.</p> <p>We are constantly presented with paeans to the Mediterranean way of life and were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/29/mediterranean-diet-better-than-statins-for-tackling-heart-disease-study\">faced with yet another</a> this week, when a study presented at a heart disease conference in Rome claimed that those who ate a diet rich in vegetables, nuts, fish and oils were 37% less likely to die early than those who ate red meat and butter.</p> <p>But ask anybody what the Mediterranean diet actually is and few will give you the same answer. It is not a weight-loss regime such as the Atkins or Dukan diets. It is actually not a prescriptive diet at all, rather a pattern of eating. In spite of the name, it has less and less in common with the way that many people in southern Europe live and eat today.</p> <p>In the Greek tavernas, thronged with British holidaymakers in the summer months, the Mediterranean diet so highly regarded by health experts can turn into a lamb kebab with rice and chips, washed down with lager. Pasta, which has historically been a smaller <em>primi</em> (first) dish, overflows the enormous bowls in which it is served in many Italian restaurants. The French have finally lost the battle against the Big Mac.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5ca44b85213cc1257688a7e216402666b12d1e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5ca44b85213cc1257688a7e216402666b12d1e9/0_827_4957_2560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A plate of grilled octopus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"516\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seafood, including octopus, is a component of the traditional Mediterranean diet, but consumption varied according to location.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Mediterranean diet is based on a rural life where people ate what they grew, which is fast disappearing. The UN has recognised the diet as an endangered species. In 2013, Unesco <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/mediterranean-diet-00884\">listed the Mediterranean diet</a> as part of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity in Cyprus, Croatia, Spain, Greece, Italy, Morocco and Portugal.</p> <p>Even health experts and nutritionists differ on the detail of the Mediterranean diet, but the principles are fairly clear. It is about an eating style based on large amounts of fruit and vegetables, legumes such as beans, lentils, peas and peanuts, whole grains and especially olive oil. </p> <p>Fish and seafood are part of it, but their consumption varied in the past according to how close people lived to the sea. Chicken, eggs and small amounts of dairy, such as cheese and yoghurt, are there in moderation, but red meat and sweets would rarely be consumed. The diet includes a small amount of wine with meals. Pasta, bread and potatoes are variables from one region to another. It is quite a high-carbohydrate diet, which was fine when people were physically active on farms or fishing boats.</p> <p>Notably, none of this comes in a box. The supermarket spaghetti bolognese does not count. The Mediterranean diet has no preservatives. It is freshly picked, plucked and cooked. </p> <p>The use of olive oil is interesting, according to Tom Sanders, an emeritus professor of nutrition and dietetics at King\u2019s College London, who has carried out studies involving Mediterranean diets. \u201cIf you are trying to get people to eat a lot of vegetables and salad, it\u2019s quite difficult to do without oil,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if you are putting oil on top of salad, it also has a bit of a satiating effect. Aubergines or tomatoes in oil \u2013 you can have enough of that quite quickly. Whereas something that you\u2019ve got saturated fat in, such as cake or biscuits, it\u2019s easy to knock them back and you don\u2019t realise how much is going in.\u201d</p> <p>But there is more to the Mediterranean diet than the food on the plate. Unesco waxes wistfully lyrical on a whole idealised lifestyle that may appear to have little to do with the modern Mediterranean as we know it. \u201cThe Mediterranean diet involves a set of skills, knowledge, rituals, symbols and traditions concerning crops, harvesting, fishing, animal husbandry, conservation, processing, cooking and particularly the sharing and consumption of food. </p> <p>\u201cEating together is the foundation of the cultural identity and continuity of communities throughout the Mediterranean basin. It is a moment of social exchange and communication, an affirmation and renewal of family, group or community identity,\u201d the citation says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"454c83f32c356fedf58337d178b99ec4a36e282b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/454c83f32c356fedf58337d178b99ec4a36e282b/0_183_5504_3302/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fresh produce at a street market stall in Naples, Italy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fresh produce at a street market stall in Naples, Italy. The key element of the diet is eating a large amount of vegetables.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe Mediterranean diet emphasises values of hospitality, neighbourliness, intercultural dialogue and creativity, and a way of life guided by respect for diversity.\u201d</p> <p>Shared family meals, it is now widely understood, help people eat well and avoid excess, while the TV dinner habit is linked to obesity.</p> <p>Keys, a Minnesota academic, started to investigate the health benefits of Mediterranean eating in the 1950s, after a visit to Naples. He was concerned about the large numbers of men dying from heart attacks in the US. An Italian colleague had told him that the heart attack rate among labourers in the Neapolitan area was low. It led to <a href=\"http://www.sevencountriesstudy.com/home/\">the Seven Countries Study</a>, an enormous project that continues today. The first pilot studies were set up in Nicotera, a village in Calabria, southern Italy, and in six villages on Crete.</p> <p>The study compared middle-aged men with different lifestyles and diet: on the US railroads, in the villages of North Karelia, Finland, where many men died as a result of heart disease, in the Netherlands, in Italian villages, but also workers on the railroads in Rome, in Crete and Corfu, in villages in Croatia, and in farming and fishing communities in Japan. </p> <p>It uncovered a link between eating high levels of saturated fat, found in red meat and dairy products, and cholesterol in the blood, and heart disease. The scientists could not prove that saturated fats were the cause, but the finger of suspicion was firmly pointed, leading to changed dietary guidelines in the US and the eventual craze for low-fat everything, with the resulting rise and rise of sugar to make processed food and drinks taste better. Keys has more recently been heavily criticised for opposing John Yudkin, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/07/the-sugar-conspiracy-robert-lustig-john-yudkin\">argued in the 1970s</a> that sugar, not fat, was the problem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e58de0610f1556e4740d4908e9cd2e236eff8e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e58de0610f1556e4740d4908e9cd2e236eff8e9/0_215_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mediterranean food is served\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nowadays, Mediterranean food is often served with chips, while in Italy, pasta has gone from being a small first course to a larger main course.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What did not happen as a result of the study was the wholescale adoption of the Mediterranean diet, although Keys, who died aged 100 in 2004, promoted it in popular books and practised what he preached. </p> <p>David, a debutante, adventurer and lover of the Mediterranean sunshine, had an influence with her articles and books, describing dishes with aubergines, courgettes and other exotica that were all but unavailable in northern Europe in the 1950s and 60s. But the era of convenience food and the sheer quantity that became available, whether in supermarkets or from takeaways, had a greater impact on working populations.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Sanders says northern Europe is generally healthier than the Mediterranean regions. Things have changed.</p> <p>\u201cThat sort of diet was accompanied by quite a lot of physical activity. There were moderate intakes of wine, but it wasn\u2019t huge: it was about 300ml or 400ml at most a day. And these guys, particularly in Crete, which was looked at, were pretty active and were quite thin. </p> <p>\u201cIf you look at a follow-up of their kids, the second generation in the Seven Countries Study, they tend to be overweight and eating something quite different \u2013 a lot more deep fried food. The equivalent of Colonel Sanders really. And what you are seeing in southern Europe, Greece, is one of the highest increases in rates of cardiovascular disease, so there\u2019s been a switchover.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc757b241706f90381fca5e0627239fd522a4eb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc757b241706f90381fca5e0627239fd522a4eb1/303_0_4432_2659/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Obesity in on the rise in Greece.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Obesity is increasing in Greece, which topped the OECD childhood obesity league in 2014, ahead of the US, Italy and Mexico.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf we look at life expectancy, I think it\u2019s longest in Iceland.

Both countries had higher rates than the US and Mexico.</p> <p>Studies continue to show the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet. In June, the <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(16)30085-7/abstract\">respected Predimed study</a> in Spain found that overweight and obese people, with heart disease and diabetes, who ate a Mediterranean-style diet high in vegetable fat, because of additional olive oil or nuts, did not gain weight, compared with people on a low-fat diet.</p> <p>There is no doubt that the Mediterranean diet is good for you. But shifting the habits of nations to adopt, cook and eat it regularly in societies dominated by packaged food manufacturers is quite a task.</p>",
  "<p>Many a political movement has started with students. Meeting a new, large and diverse pool of people at university opens up many students\u2019 eyes to the inequalities of society and the possibility of remedying them.</p> <p> Some students, such as Grace Casanova, a soon-to-be third year at Kingston University, decide to campaign for a better world in between lectures. </p> <p>As well as being president of Kingston\u2019s branch of Student Hubs, an organisation focused on social change, Casanova has held a number of campaigning roles at the university, including presidency of Unicef on campus. Through these she has led a number of drives to raise awareness of and funding for the effects of war, hunger, disease and violence on children worldwide. <br> </p> <p>\u201cDuring my time, I have organised five outreach campaigns where we exposed the student community to the situation of children in Yemen, South Sudan, Ecuador, Syria and the Philippines,\u201d she says. The Peruvian, who has done much through her university to contribute towards political change in her home country, has also benefitted personally from her campaigning. \u201cDuring my time as the president of the Latin American Society at Kingston, the campaigns I organised were related to environmental issues deriving from extractive activities and indigenous rights in Latin America,\u201d says Casanova. \u201cAs a result, I\u2019ve been awarded a scholarship for an indigenous rights and peace summer school in Japan this August.\u201d<br> </p> <p>Some students look close to home when trying to effect change. Over the past couple of decades, campaigns for universities to buy more Fairtrade items and to stop selling Nestl\u00e9 products, for example, have seen students encourage their universities to be more socially conscious. </p> <p>Since 2013, Miriam Chapman, who is about to graduate from the University of Oxford, has been one of six core students involved in the Fossil Free campaign to get her university to clean up its investments.<br> </p> <p>There has been some success. \u201cLast year, the university made a statement announcing that it would not invest directly in coal and tar sands, alongside reporting on its current investments,\u201d she says. \u201cWhile this is a step in the right direction, we continue to campaign for full divestment.\u201d She first got involved through the students\u2019 union\u2019s environment and ethics group. \u201cI went along to the first meeting because I was keen to get involved in environmental campaigning and then just got swept along with it all. If I wasn\u2019t leaving uni now, I would get behind the Divest-Invest campaign, which is really exciting and has a lot of potential to help divestment campaigns move forward.\u201d </p> <p>There are also opportunities to join grassroots student activists who are aligned with the likes of Occupy. One which has sprung up recently is the Merit Student Activist group, which has a core of 10 university students from around the UK, and about 500 Facebook followers. The group writes about equality and social change. </p> <p>\u201cWe are a political movement that is invested in trying to redistribute power within the UK,\u201d a spokesperson for the group says. \u201cSo far we have taken part in many self-planned charity events such as OpSafeWinter, which helps the homeless through the winter months by giving them food, clothes and someone to talk to. Also, we work with other groups, such as Love Activists and Occupy.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The resettlement of Syrian refugees has been a political flashpoint of the US presidential election. This week, Donald Trump used a speech outlining <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/donald-trump-vows-to-deport-millions-during-first-hour-in-office-in-hardline-speech\">his hardline views on immigration and national security</a> to once again raise the specter that terrorists could infiltrate the Syrian resettlement program in the US. </p> <p>As a safeguard, the Republican nominee announced that his administration would suspend immigration from Syria and Libya. Those seeking to enter the US would be subject to an \u201cextreme vetting\u201d process that Trump emphasized would be \u201cso tough\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/in-arizona-we-saw-the-real-donald-trump-the-one-we-already-knew\">In Arizona we saw the real Donald Trump: the one we already knew</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before being accepted, applicants would submit to an \u201cideological certification\u201d that would ensure that those who are admitted \u201cshare our values and love our people\u201d. Trump said immigrants would face questions about honor killings, their view on \u201cwomen and gays and minorities\u201d as well as their attitudes on \u201cradical Islam\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe have no idea who these people are, where they come from,\u201d Trump said of Syrian refugees during his speech in Phoenix on Wednesday. \u201cI always say, Trojan horse. Watch what\u2019s going to happen, folks. It\u2019s not going to be pretty.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond the hot rhetoric and controversial proposals, Trump is tapping into serious anxieties about national security and the threat of terrorism. Here we <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/19/syrian-refugees-in-america-fact-from-fiction-congress\">revisit the topic of Syrian resettlement </a>in the US in an effort to try to separate fact from fiction.</p> <h2>We actually do know who these people are</h2> <p>Despite Donald Trump\u2019s repeated claim that the US doesn\u2019t know who it lets into the country, the US\u2019s refugee vetting process is among the most rigorous in the western world. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/11/249613.htm\">The state department</a> has said that Syrians flown to the US are among the most heavily vetted group of people currently allowed into the country.</p> <p>In total, the screening process takes an average of 18 months to two years and involves multiple federal intelligence and security agencies who carry out a series of security screenings and checks. </p> <p>The process begins with an initial vetting by the United Nations\u2019 refugee agency. Prospective candidates are then referred to the US, where officials from the state department, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the defense department conduct further vetting. </p> <p>The homeland security secretary, Jeh Johnson, said recently that the department had \u201cadded security checks to the process\u201d specifically for Syrian refugees as well as designated more resources to help make the process more efficient. As an added check, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services are instructed to review the social media accounts of Syrian refugee applicants who are referred for more enhanced vetting. </p> <p>Immigration officials have a very good idea of who they are accepting from Syria even before their plane touches down on American soil. </p> <h2>How many Syrian refugees has the US accepted?</h2> <p>The answer is significantly more than<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/19/syrian-refugees-in-america-fact-from-fiction-congress\"> the last time we posed that question</a>. </p> <p>After a painstakingly slow start, the White House announced this week that it had achieved its goal of resettling 10,000 refugees by the end of this fiscal year. </p> <p>Barack Obama made the commitment last year under pressure from Europe and the United Nations for the US to play a bigger role in confronting the global refugee crisis. The majority of the refugees were accepted in the last three months. Before that, the US had admitted just a quarter of the 10,000 displaced Syrians it pledged to resettle. In total, the US has resettled roughly 12,000 Syrian refugees since the war began five years ago.</p> <p>To help ease the integration process, the refugees are resettled in areas where they have family ties. For those who have none, the resettlement groups try to place them in cities with an established community of Syrian immigrants or where they will have the best chance of finding jobs.<br></p> <p>These groups \u2013 a coalition of humanitarian and religious nonprofits \u2013 help adults find work, enroll their children in school and learn English. During this process, they receive housing and financial assistance. One year after being admitted, refugees can apply for a green card at which point they must submit to another screening.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-u-s-should-take-65000-syrian-refugees/\"> has called </a>for the US to resettle an additional 55,000 refugees from Syria in addition to the 10,000 pledged by Obama. And even if the US were to accept 65,000 Syrian refugees, it will still be just a fraction of the more than 4.8 million Syrians who have fled mostly to neighboring countries who are bearing the biggest burden of the world\u2019s largest refugee crisis. </p> <h2><strong>Are Syrian refugees likely to be Isis sympathizers?</strong></h2> <p>The Syrian refugees who are coming to the US are among the most vulnerable in the Syrian conflict: many are women and their children, religious minorities and victims of violence or torture. Many have fled to escape the brutality of both the Islamic State, or Isis, and the Assad government and are doing so at their own peril. </p> <p>The worsening Syrian refugee crisis has undermined Isis\u2019s claim that its caliphate is a safe haven for Muslims. In choosing to risk their lives on the dangerous journey to Europe and beyond rather than join Isis\u2019s caliphate is a sharp rejection of the group and its ideology. On <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/09/22/442520787/the-flood-of-syrian-refugees-puts-isis-on-the-defensive\">several occasions the Islamic state</a> has condemned refugees who flee its strongholds.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/01/us-military-iraq-syria-sean-macfarland-republican-carpet-bomb-isis\">US military commander in Iraq and Syria rejects GOP pledges to 'carpet-bomb' Isis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In effect, some experts argue that by rejecting Syrian refugees, American politicians are in fact helping Isis. When the US shuts the door on Syrian Muslims, it reinforces Isis\u2019s argument that the west does not want to assist them and that their only salvation lies in Isis.</p> <h2><strong>Could dangerous refugees come to the US?</strong></h2> <p>The refugees admitted to the US are much different than those arriving at Europe\u2019s borders. </p> <p>Unlike in Europe, where immigrants can cross through Turkey and then enter Greece, the immigrants who arrive will have cleared a lengthy screening process. Because of Europe\u2019s Schengen system, refugees could conceivably pass between EU countries without having to show a passport or submit to a background check. </p> <p>Public anxiety over the arrival of refugees has a historical precedent. The controversy over Syrian immigrants has <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/11/19/9760060/refugees-history-holocaust\">recalled</a> Americans\u2019 reluctance to accept Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany in the years just before the second world war. </p> <p>And yet an <a href=\"http://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/us-record-shows-refugees-are-not-threat\">October 2015 analysis by the Migration Policy Institute</a> is a reminder of why many of these fears are misplaced. Of the 784,000 refugees resettled in the United States since 11 September 2001, just three have been arrested for planning terrorist activities, the report found. It adds for context that of those three cases \u201ctwo were not planning an attack in the United States and the plans of the third were barely credible\u201d. </p> <p>Finally, denying Syrian refugees entry to the United States would break a decades-long American tradition. After the second world war, the US created its first formal resettlement programs and began to position itself as a safe haven for the persecuted. In the 1970s, the US accepted <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/09/syria-refugees-europe-vietnam\">hundreds of thousands</a> of Vietnamese refugees. In 1980, the US accepted as many as 125,000 Cubans during the Mariel boatlift crisis. The 1990s saw an influx of refugees fleeing the wars in Bosnia, Somalia and Rwanda. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/11/syrian_refugees_per_pop/giv-32650YJN6SYy5Ympe/\" data-alt=\"Refugees and population\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/11/syrian_refugees_per_pop/giv-32650YJN6SYy5Ympe/\">Refugees and population</a> </figure>",

Walking the streets of Somers Town, one of the most deprived wards in the UK, it\u2019s hard to miss the 1,000,000 sq ft pile, signalled from all directions by the great aluminium slug that slithers across its rooftop and the orange tiled walls that loom above the streets.</p> <p>Almost 10 years in the making, the Crick is an ocean-liner of medical research that will soon hold 1,500 scientists tackling the roots of everything from cancer and HIV to tuberculosis and neurodegenerative diseases. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4168ae70314f368b9577030c6c4b7652e3d40c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4168ae70314f368b9577030c6c4b7652e3d40c1/0_412_4928_2773/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Better from the sky?

Clad in terracotta tiles, it echoes the warm orange hues of its neighbours, while the curving aluminium roof is a nod to the station\u2019s barrel-vaulted Victorian train shed. Yet it misses the mark on both counts, lacking either the confidence or elegance of its forebears.</p> <p>In an attempt to break up the building\u2019s bulk, the architects have employed a multitude of different claddings, using fins and grids and faceted walls of glazing, but the pick\u2019n\u2019mix collage only calls attention to the building\u2019s heft. The roof \u2013 designed to hide the three-storey technical plant needed to keep the labs chugging along \u2013 looks like the swooping canopy of an airport terminal, cut and pasted on to a cluster of generic office blocks.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8546371a9a45e2987f07672ec91a8d2624167393\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8546371a9a45e2987f07672ec91a8d2624167393/0_62_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The new building was nominated for this year\u2019s Carbuncle Cup.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Crick was nominated for this year\u2019s Carbuncle Cup award for Britain\u2019s worst building.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The resulting dog\u2019s dinner was perhaps inevitable, given the project\u2019s convoluted gestation.

Their proposals were met with fierce opposition from Camden\u2019s planners, who had earmarked the site for affordable housing (a plan that was overturned by central government pressure).

  "<p><br> Islam Karimov, the only ruler Uzbekistan has known since independence in 1991, leaves a toxic legacy of egregious human rights abuses, dictatorial governance and endemic corruption. The question now is whether the US, Britain and the EU will continue to ignore this once his successor takes charge, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/uzbekistan-uncertainty-death-dictator-islam-karimov\">assuming a handover of power can be accomplished peacefully</a>.</p> <p>Western priorities in Uzbekistan since the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse have focused on two main concerns: security and trade, particularly in gas, cotton and gold. Democracy comes a distant third. This approach, sensibly pragmatic or hypocritically cynical, depending on your point of view, also applies to the other autocratic central Asian states: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. </p> <p>But Karimov\u2019s heedless brutality upset the strategic applecart in May 2005 when hundreds of anti-regime protesters were shot down by Uzbek army troops in the town of Andijan. The wider context was agitation against repressive governments across the region, notably in Kyrgyzstan\u2019s thwarted \u201ctulip revolution\u201d in March that year. George W Bush\u2019s administration and European leaders were forced to condemn the Andijan killings. In response, the ostensibly pro-American Karimov ordered the US military to leave the Karshi-Khanabad airbase that it had been using since 2001 to resupply Afghanistan. </p> <p>Cementing his change of sides, Karimov signed a mutual defence treaty with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. Karimov\u2019s refusal to allow independent investigation of the Andijan massacre \u2013 its victims remain unavenged to this day \u2013 and his pointed shift towards closer ties with China through the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, a Beijing front, marked a turning point in relations with the west. </p> <p>Yet there was no real penalty to pay. Karimov got away with it and with the ensuing intensification of abuses, including torture, arbitrary detention, rigged elections, religious persecution, media crackdowns and forced labour. That Craig Murray, Britain\u2019s ambassador who <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/nov/24/comment.tisdallbriefing\">resigned in an unusual, personal protest</a> over burgeoning abuses in 2004, was vindicated appeared to make no difference.  </p> <p>Fast forward a decade and John Kerry, sticking to the same old discredited script, had no problem <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/01/john-kerry-uzbekistan-islam-karimov-central-asia-human-rights\">cosying up to Karimov last November in Samarkand</a>. The US secretary of state stressed Washington\u2019s support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Uzbekistan, effectively lending legitimacy to Karimov\u2019s dictatorship after another presidential election swindle. </p> <p>Kerry claimed to have raised in private the matter of human rights. But it was clear other issues dominated the meeting, not least US eagerness to halt the spread of Isis-style Islamist ideology and jihadism in Muslim central Asia \u2013 a spectre regularly invoked by Karimov to justify his actions. Kerry was also keen to enlist Uzbek support in curbing Russia\u2019s post-Ukraine expansionist tendencies, which at that point were taking flight in Syria.  </p> <p>Putting hardware where its conscience should be, the US had already resumed military cooperation, providing Uzbekistan in 2015 with 300 armoured utility vehicles and 20 armoured recovery vehicles \u2013 reportedly the largest single arms transfer by the US to any central Asian nation. </p> <p>Part of the backdrop to the Samarkand meeting was Kerry\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/oct/21/uzbekistan-forced-labour-cotton-harvest-violent-crackdown-activists]\">State Department global report on human rights</a>, citing torture, forced labour in the Uzbek cotton fields and endemic corruption. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2016/country-chapters/uzbekistan\">Human Rights Watch world report for 2015</a> was even blunter. Uzbekistan\u2019s human rights record was appalling, it said, with thousands imprisoned and torture endemic. </p> <p>Whether Karimov\u2019s successor will prove more amenable to democratic governance is doubtful. What happens next may in any case be largely hidden from view. In 2014, the US-based thinktank Freedom House said: \u201cThe Karimov regime has all but eradicated free media in Uzbekistan. The few independent journalists who remain are subjected to harassment and detention.\u201d After last year\u2019s elections, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe said meaningful \u201cpolitical debate and genuine competition\u201d were wholly absent. Without serious western pressure, this seems unlikely to change.</p>",
  "<p>Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley have been voted in as joint leaders of the Green party, and pledged to take the party\u2019s message into Labour\u2019s former industrial heartlands.</p> <p>Lucas, the party\u2019s sole MP, and Bartley, its spokesman on work and pensions, won 86% of first-preference votes in the six-candidate race, and become the first leaders of a Westminster party to undertake the role as a job share.</p> <p>Addressing 1,200 party members gathered in Birmingham on Friday for the start of the Greens\u2019 annual conference, where the result was announced, Lucas promised the pair would fill the void left by Labour over challenging the effects of Brexit, for example over workers\u2019 rights and the status of EU nationals in the UK.</p> <p>Standing at an adjoining lectern, Bartley declared \u201cthe era of two-party politics is over\u201d, and said the big parties could no longer take their voters for granted.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian after the joint speech, they said policies such as a green technology-based industrial strategy and a commitment to tackling inequality and challenging the effects of globalisation could lead them to win more support in traditionally Labour areas, constituencies already being actively pursued by Ukip.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a risk that Ukip will move into this space,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important parties like the Greens are out there with a really practical set of measures that can speak to people\u2019s incredible insecurity that was manifest partly in that Brexit result.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s often some of the poorest, most excluded people who have the most to gain from Green policies.

  "<p>Half a million people are expected to attend the canonisation of Mother Teresa at the Vatican on Sunday, in a ceremony transmitted live to her adopted home of Kolkata and Catholic audiences worldwide.</p> <p>The two-hour mass in St Peter\u2019s Square, led by Pope Francis almost 19 years after she died, will transform the diminutive nun who became a global icon for her work with the poor into Saint Teresa of Kolkata. But it will also reignite deep criticism of the order she founded, the Missionaries of Charity, which according to detractors focused on the elevation, rather than the relief, of suffering.</p> <p>Pilgrims will venerate her relics and have the opportunity to buy 1.5m commemorative 95c postage stamps, released on Friday, that celebrate her \u201cgreat strength, simplicity and extraordinary humility \u2026 [and] tireless dedication\u201d, according to an accompanying brochure.</p> <p>In the lead-up to Sunday\u2019s mass, images of Mother Teresa have been publicly displayed in and around the Vatican.

  "<p>On Friday 2 September it will be exactly 350 years since <a href=\"http://collections.museumoflondon.org.uk/online/object/102171.html\">The Great Fire of London</a> swept through the capital. While the Museum of London has an exhibition marking the anniversary, we\u2019d like to invite readers to share their artwork on London in general. The great Rhinebeck Panorama of London depicts the capital at the peak of its naval power and position as a global city in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/31/artists-flames-mark-350th-anniversary-of-great-fire-of-london\">Artists\u2019 flames mark 350th anniversary of Great Fire of London</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://collections.museumoflondon.org.uk/online/object/431604.html\">The Rhinebeck Panorama</a> gives us a stunning birds eye view of London around 1806. It is a watercolour painted on four sheets of paper, almost nine feet wide, and gets its name from Rhinebeck, in the USA, where it was found in 1940.</p> <p>We are high above the River Thames, looking west from roughly where Tower Bridge now stands. Below, daily life in the city is laid out before us: a man flies a kite, a building is on fire, soldiers are on parade, a funeral takes place, elegant ladies stroll arm-in- arm, carriages cross London Bridge, and shipping jostles for space in the Pool of London.</p> <p>The streets of Southwark and Lambeth spread out to the left, the City to the right. In the middle-distance lies Westminster. Beyond are the suburbs of Battersea and Chelsea, and the villages of Fulham, Hammersmith and Kew. Farther off, the panorama embraces the surrounding countryside. On the horizon, Windsor Castle can be seen, a subtle reminder that London is part of the wider national landscape.</p> <p>The teeming cargo vessels are evidence of London\u2019s mercantile significance and economic power. Yet, despite the sense of peace and prosperity the panorama gives, Britain was then embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars. In fact, the Battle of Trafalgar took place only about a year before this picture was made. And amongst the colliers, lighters, barques and barges, is a receiving ship for men press-ganged into the Royal Navy.</p> <p>Although the overall impression is convincing, the scene is not quite accurate. There are some discrepancies in scale, for instance. Still, this is about as close to an overall view of pre-Victorian London as we\u2019re likely to get. But accuracy wasn\u2019t the main point of an image like this: the main point was to amaze. Panoramas were extremely popular in the late-18th and early-19th centuries. Probably this is a study for a much larger painting, which would have been displayed on a curved wall, giving the illusion that the viewer really was hovering over the city. Today, we get a similar view from the Shard. <br></p> <p>Share your images and depictions of London and what the capital means to you. </p> <h2><strong><strong>How to share your artwork</strong></strong></h2> <p>Share an image of your artwork via<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CC0QFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwitness.guardian.co.uk%2F&amp;ei=aCD6Ub-BOYTY0QXfo4CYCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNExLL0b8-w97kDOG255cFwccvrrJQ&amp;sig2=cqgHLUCzLdan0HyToN2Ggw&amp;bvm=bv.50165853,d.d2k\">GuardianWitness</a>, by clicking the blue \u201ccontribute\u201d button on this page, or via the <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/apps\">Android or iPhone app</a>.

Time to despair? If you\u2019re an Asiatic cheetah \u2013 or any number of other endangered species \u2013 it doesn\u2019t look good.

Will we eat new foods, plant new crops, raise new animals? Will we make space for wildlife in this human world?\u201d<br></p> <p>Journalism might merely be the first draft of history, but since the Anthropocene is only estimated by the IGC to have begun in 1950 and is likely to go on for many thousands of years, that first draft is badly needed. Vince set out to supply it, leaving her job as news editor of Nature magazine to trudge around many of the world\u2019s most embattled environments \u2013 from mountains to oceans, forests to deserts \u2013 finding out how people are surviving in them.</p> <p>In Peru, she discovers two friends who are painting a mountain white in an attempt to bring back the glacier that made their valley habitable.

The beauty of this idea made my eyes water. The Anthropocene\u2019s usual encounters with previous geological eras involve drilling, quarrying and fracking, but these villagers have effectively put a pair of spark-plugs between them, creating a model for a future sustainably powered by the interaction of past and present, constancy and change, flood and drought.</p> <p>I love this book for what it says about the resourcefulness of humanity, the capacity of ordinary people to make a difference, and for those small differences to add up to something that might even turn the planet away from its apparently unstoppable hurtle towards environmental destruction. </p> <p>Vince doesn\u2019t shirk the hard stuff \u2013 the whats, whys and whethers of conservation. She acknowledges that extinction is not unique to the Anthropocene, and she is clear that many of the schemes she witnesses will fail. But where they do, others will spring up. I keep returning to her book, because there is hope between these pages of colourful reportage: from the former fashion executive who is breeding Chinese tigers in South Africa to the Caribbean fisherman who has built a fruit garden on an island made of garbage. With such will and ingenuity, there may yet even be hope for the Asiatic cheetah.</p>",
  "<p>I came across <a href=\"http://www.frogandscot.co.uk\">Frog And Scot</a> on TripAdvisor, while researching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jul/08/trouble-with-tripadvisor-summer-food-drink-marina-oloughlin\">a piece about how much I hate TripAdvisor</a>. The irony is not lost on me. As part of the article, I wanted to examine how restaurant owners, particularly the more splenetic ones, responded to anonymous critics. Sadly, that bit didn\u2019t make the final cut, but I was hugely impressed by the grace with which this new place\u2019s owner, Benoit Dezecot, dealt with complainers, even those who deserved the lacerating edge of any tongue \u2013 those, say, who insisted their bavette was so tough they took it home and fed it to their pet crocodile, \u201cwho spat it out\u201d. Deal in Kent is clearly home to the more discerning carnivorous reptile.</p> <p>So off to this bijou, pastel-painted town, with its maritime history and crocodile-owning natives. My favourite Deal ex-native is Carry On star <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Hawtrey_(actor_born_1914)\">Charlie Hawtrey</a>, frequently in trouble for his habit of hoisting seamen and rent boys into his 18th-century smuggler\u2019s cottage. (It\u2019s fair to say he\u2019s not Deal\u2019s favourite: he referred to the locals as \u201cpeasants\u201d.) Here, Dezecot and his partner Sarah Ross \u2013 the eponymous Frog and Scot \u2013 have taken over a former florist\u2019s and caff, and turned it into the platonic ideal of neighbourhood bistro.</p> <p>Here\u2019s where to come to practise shrugging expressively and rolling your Rs. For French onion soup and snails, of course; rillettes and moules; a rough-textured terrine of chicken livers bellowing with booziness and spiked with green peppercorns. Sunday brunches of croques and truffle omelettes. For Whitstable oysters with shallot-vinegar mignonette and homemade bread. Or confit duck leg, served with its pink breast and the roasting juices stirred and scraped with spices. Crabmeat, the white meat piled on to toast lubricated with its punchy, resonant brown meat, and lightly acidulated fennel adding a scintilla of crisp liquorice. Or lobster mayonnaise with chips \u2013 what could be lovelier moments from the sea?</p> <p>But the kitchen can handle more elaborate stuff, too: fish aren\u2019t just water-bathed or slapped on the grill, but a bit of both. So, brill is beautifully moist-crisp, with a sauce stained an alluring grey by avruga caviar (just what I\u2019m after for my kitchen cabinets). Lamb chops have a depth of flavour you\u2019d associate with hogget, but the tenderness of babies; with them, a croquette stuffed with the confit neck fillet is sultry with melted lamb fat.</p> <p>You can tell a lot about a place by the quality of the basics: anywhere that rejects the easy option of catering-pack chips deserves all the brownie points, and Frog And Scot\u2019s, served with a fine sirloin steak over which a pat of reeking garlic butter slowly creeps, are belters, double-cooked until almost nutty, all crisp and fluffy and lustworthy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/19/rick-stein-sandbanks-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin\">Rick Stein, Sandbanks: \u2018I\u2019m not buying it\u2019 \u2013 restaurant review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s an appreciation of ingredients: seasonal vegetables, green and perky in a light dressing of French butter. And a love of saucing based on homemade stocks: truffle creams, celeriac purees, bisques. And a total lack of crooked pinkie pretension that, round these parts, is as bracing as a dive into the British briny. They bake their own bread, churn their own ice-cream and plunge local soft fruits into the sweet, enveloping embrace of frangipane for their tarts. Sure, there are a few rough edges: menus \u2013 changing by the hour as dishes sell out and are replaced \u2013 are scrawled on blackboards; furniture is currently long, beer hall-style benches. But, as Dezecot patiently explains to the whingers, they are being gradually replaced for something more accommodating to the less tolerant arse.</p> <p>The pair also own <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/le_pinardier\">Le Pinardier</a>, a little wine shop and bar up the road, where you drink at barrels, and I\u2019m guessing that both have been kitted out on a shoestring and are developing organically, like the wines on a list featuring much that is biodynamic and natural.

  "<p>The prospect of an interest rate rise in the US has receded after news that the world\u2019s largest economy suffered a lull in job creation last month.</p> <p>There were 151,000 jobs<strong> </strong>added to the US economy in August, below economists\u2019 forecasts for 180,000 and a marked slowdown after two bumper months of growth. <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm\">Figures from the Department of Labor</a> also showed wage growth slowed and the unemployment rate remained steady at 4.9%, defying expectations for it to edge down in August.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/26/janet-yellen-speech-jackson-hole-federal-reserve-interest-rate\">Janet Yellen: the case for an interest rate hike in 2016 has 'strengthened'</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/26/janet-yellen-speech-jackson-hole-federal-reserve-interest-rate\">The US Federal Reserve has hinted at a rate rise before the end of this year</a>, with some economists saying ahead of the latest job figures that a move could come at central bank\u2019s meeting later this month. But the Fed chair, Janet Yellen, has also said she and fellow policymakers would watch the economic data closely. As a result, analysts said the weaker jobs number would probably keep interest rates on hold for now.</p> <p>\u201cThe data-dependent Fed will most likely see the payroll numbers as taking pressure off any immediate need to hike interest rates, significantly reducing the scope for further policy action in September,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at IHS Markit.</p> <p>Investor expectations that the Fed will now hold off raising rates in September buoyed stock markets in the US and Europe. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose sharply after the jobs news but ended the day up 72 points (0.39%). The FTSE 100 of big UK-listed stocks ended the day up 2.2% at 6894.60, lifted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2016/sep/02/ftse-climbs-on-uk-construction-news-ahead-of-us-jobs-but-bt-drops\">brighter news on Britain\u2019s economy this week</a>.</p> <p>The August slowdown in US jobs creation follows stronger performances in June and July when a combined 546,000 jobs were added. That apparent strength had fanned market expectations of another move from the Fed to get interest rates back to more normal levels after the financial crisis ushered in years of record low borrowing costs. </p> <p>The Fed last raised borrowing costs in December 2015, the first such move in almost a decade, bringing the interest rate range to 0.25%-0.5%. Since then it has held off any further moves amid low inflation and mixed news on the US economy. Policymakers have also highlighted worries about the global outlook and the possible repercussions of the UK vote to leave the EU. </p> <p>A report this week suggesting US manufacturing shrank in August added to the mood of caution around the economic outlook but many economists still see a rate rise in December as likely.</p> <p>The US central bank is also closely watching wage growth, which slowed in August, according to the latest figures. Average hourly earnings were up 0.1% in August after a 0.3% rise in July.</p> <p>Economists at Fathom Consulting said the \u201clukewarm\u201d payrolls report left rate-setters at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) with a dilemma.</p> <p>\u201cIn order to be \u2018reasonably confident\u2019 that inflation will return to target, average hourly earnings will need to rise by more than 0.1% each month, as they did between July and August,\u201d they wrote in a research note.<br></p> <p>At the same time, the slowdown in jobs creation at this point in the recovery was widely expected and the Fed will not be overly concerned about the August figure, economists said.</p> <p>The Fathom note continued: \u201cAlthough just 151,000 net payrolls were added in August, less than expected, the underlying rate of job creation is still well above the level required for the labour market to tighten. We stick to our view that the FOMC will increase rates once this year \u2013 though December now looks most likely \u2013 and at least twice in 2017.\u201d</p> <p>The detail of the jobs report showed food services was the biggest growth area, adding 34,000 new jobs.</p> <p>The report once again highlighted the racial disparity in the jobs market. Unemployment for African Americans stood at 8.1%, with white people at 4.4%.</p> <p>The US labor force participation rate, the percentage of the US population in the workforce or actively seeking a job, remained unchanged at 62.8%.</p> <p>Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, said the latest payrolls report meant the Fed should hold fire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/interest-rates/\" data-alt=\"US interest rates\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/interest-rates/\">US interest rates</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cAugust\u2019s payroll number is weak tea \u2013 we need to have stronger job growth for a more sustained period before we can say we\u2019re at full employment,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the last jobs report before the Federal Reserve meets and potentially raises rates. They should hold steady, and let the economy to steep a little longer, so the recovery can reach the most distressed communities.\u201d</p> <p>The FOMC will next meet on 20 and 21 September. However, not everyone believes it should wait to raise rates.</p> <p>\u201cI think they should hike in September,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/31/why-the-federal-reserve-probably-will-not-like-the-nonfarm-payrolls-jobs-report-friday.html\">said Mark Zandi</a>, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.

Adding to the massive global e-waste problem with an electronic device that has such limited functionality is certainly not innovative. </p> <p>Cook says technology like the Dash buttons could be part of a closed-loop system that helps get the container back to the manufacturer \u2013 for example, milk bottle back to dairy, ink cartridge back to HP \u2013 and help us to reuse and reduce waste. \u201cThis button would seem to be taking us in the opposite direction\u201d, he says.</p> <p>The buttons launched in the US last year priced at $4.99, and Amazon has said sales trebled in the last two months with more than 150 product types now on offer.</p> <p>Raz Godelnik, assistant professor at Parsons School of Design in New York, who is researching the impact of the sharing economy on traditional business and cities, is critical of the impact of the buttons on our consumption.</p> <p>\u201cI think that IoT could be a force for good but [will] also increase unsustainable consumption,\u201d he says. \u201cUsing smart buttons will make it easier to maintain the status quo and not change consumption habits, whether it\u2019s about moving to a different brand or finding other ways to meet our needs, and since the status quo is mainly unsustainable, they\u2019re probably not going to help us make the changes we need to make. Efficiency could be beneficial, but it all depends on the context and, in this one, I doubt if this is the case.\u201d</p> <p>The UK government\u2019s waste reduction advisory body, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wrap</a> \u2013 which raises awareness about the 15m tonnes of annual food waste, among other things \u2013 declined to comment on Amazon\u2019s Dash, or similar products that are likely to be released in the future by manufacturers keen to tie us into their brands.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Amazon defends the environmental credentials of its Dash buttons. Tarek El-Hawary, a senior spokesman, explained: \u201cAmazon Dash buttons are fully recyclable and Amazon will cover the cost of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200197550\" rel=\"nofollow\">recycling</a>. Orders placed via Dash buttons are grouped together where possible, as with any order we fulfil ... Prime customers can also continue to order via the website or Amazon app if they wish.\u201d</p> <p>Given the limited range of 40 products currently linked to this Wi-Fi-connected device, however, you\u2019ll still have to do your weekly shop. And if your city (like mine) does not welcome hundreds of thousands of cardboard boxes in the rubbish collection, and you don\u2019t much enjoy stripping off endless bits of tape and wrestling with the blasted things to fold them up for recycling, Amazon Dash might not shake up your world just yet.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",
  "<p>Online fashion retailer Asos has been forced to pay out more than \u00a320m to two European retailers due to an alleged infringement of the trademarks on their names.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/asos\">Asos</a> has reached a global settlement with Assos of Switzerland, which makes clothing for cyclists, and Anson\u2019s Herrenhaus, a German menswear retailer. The UK retailer will pay a total of \u00a320.2m in cash to the two companies.</p> <p>The deal will allow Asos to start selling athletic leisurewear, a growing segment of the youth fashion market. However, Asos will be restricted from selling cyclewear and opening shops in Germany.</p> <p>Assos and Anson\u2019s were already both in operation when Asos <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/01/asos-founder-nick-robertson-chief-executive-steps-down\">changed its name from As Seen on Screen in 2002. </a>Anson\u2019s launched its legal case in 2010 and Assos launched its in 2011 as Asos began to expand rapidly outside the UK. Assos will open it first flagship store outside Switzerland in London\u2019s West End later this year.</p> <p>Asos had successfully defended its case in the UK right up to the supreme court. However, there are outstanding cases in the US, France and Germany.</p> <p>Despite the payment, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/12/asos-sales-brexit-benefits-pound-eu-referendum\">equal to almost six months profit for Asos</a>, shares in the company rose 132p, or 3%, to \u00a346.94.</p> <p>Nick Beighton, chief executive of Asos, said: \u201cWe are pleased to have put this litigation behind us. Entering into this settlement at this juncture is the right commercial decision for our business.\u201d</p> <p>Asos has been involved in disputes with rival retailers before over trademark infringements, but they have tended to involve accusations that the online retailer stole the design of an individual piece of clothing. The company said there were no other intellectual property cases that could have a material impact on its finances.</p> <p>Analysts at Berenberg said: \u201cIntellectual property law is very complex and varies significantly by country. Asos couldn\u2019t therefore guarantee that it would win all cases in all markets and as such decided to settle the disputes.\u201d</p> <p>The City welcomed the settlement because of the potential disruption the legal cases could have caused and the new opportunities that could open up for Asos.</p> <p>Simon Bowler, analyst at Exane, added: \u201cWhilst Asos has successfully defended itself until now, there was no certainty they would be successful in these markets. Losing a case in either of these markets would force Asos to rebrand, which was a significant risk that Asos has eliminated.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhilst the \u00a320.2m cash payment is optically large, this looks to be the right commercial decision for the business in the long term. The settlement brings certainty over the end of the dispute and eliminates any further litigation risk in Asos\u2019s biggest markets. The settlement also opens up the opportunity of moving the Asos own-brand into the attractive \u2018athleisure\u2019 market.\u201d</p> <p>Analysts at RBC Capital Markets said: \u201cIn addition to removing a potentially large distraction, Asos will now be permitted to start selling sportswear on a global basis which they were previously unable to whilst the litigation was under way.</p> <p>\u201cSportswear, particularly yoga wear, gym wear, golf wear, could present a sizeable market share opportunity for Asos given its younger customer demographic and the growth we have been seeing in the premium sportswear market.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>In the Pentagon\u2019s fight against Islamic State, the Kurds had always been a good fit. In northern Iraq they were both trusted ally and known quantity. On the battlefields of Syria they were seen as better trained, more able and more motivated than any other group, including the Arab militias that the US had supported elsewhere in the war.</p> <p>There remained one big problem, though: Turkey.

The bottom line is that a solution to the increasingly opaque and endlessly destructive conflict seems further away than ever.<br></p> <p>Turkey\u2019s entry into the war has exposed a rapidly shifting series of alliances that would not have been predictable at the start of the year, making surefooted partnerships now seem hesitant. Back then, the losses of the Syrian regime were being steadily turned around through a robust Russian intervention, which had battered opposition groups in the north of the country and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/15/kurds-carve-out-new-reality-in-northern-syria\">sent the Syrian Kurds into areas they had never before controlled</a>. </p> <p>The Kurds\u2019 manoeuvres had two effects: to close supply lines to the border used by Turkish-backed anti-Assad groups and \u2013 far more importantly \u2013 to needle Ankara where it would hurt most, by helping move Kurds into a 90-mile zone between a Kurdish enclave in north-west Syria and another in the north-east, therefore unifying the two areas.</p> <p>It was precisely the nightmare scenario that Ankara had warned Washington about throughout its use of Kurdish groups as a proxy to fight Isis. The closing of the gap would change the demographic of the entire 500-mile border and, in doing so, create strategic depth for the PKK in south-east Turkey, which is firmly aligned to the Syrian Kurds.</p> <p>Turkey\u2019s worst fears were confirmed late in August when Kurdish forces who had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/06/us-backed-syrian-fighters-take-town-of-manbij-from-isis\">ousted Isis from the town of Manbij</a> turned their attention towards Jarabulus, which Isis had occupied for the past two years. Jarabulus lies west of the Euphrates river, which Ankara had long insisted was a demarcation line between the US-backed adventures to the east and its own core interests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"774903186d9d76e99e975da518c6084adcfa331b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/774903186d9d76e99e975da518c6084adcfa331b/0_162_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Recep Tayyip Erdog\u011fan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Recep Tayyip Erdog\u011fan has suddenly emerged as a decisive player.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Depo Photos/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As it steadily picked off Isis-held towns near the Iraqi border, Washington had supported the Turkish stance and claimed it could control its proxies. The pivot towards Jarabulus blindsided the US and has derailed, for the time being, further plans to march towards Isis-held Arab towns. Instead, remnants of the Free Syrian Army, backed by Turkey, are now in the ascendancy. The Arabs rode across the border on Turkish tanks and now have their sights set on the town of al-Bab, the most western area held by Isis.

Neither man sees a breakdown of the Syrian border as advancing their goals. Moscow has not objected to Turkey\u2019s advances and has even turned its guns away from the Ankara-backed rebels.<br></p> <p>The Kurds, meanwhile, claim they have been abandoned by the US, which continues to see the war as a tailored fight to contain a cornerstone of a global jihad. For all the other stakeholders, a new phase of an interminable struggle for ethnic, sectarian and national identity is being played out.<br></p> <p>It is for now impossible to reconcile competing visions for what will emerge from Syria. And it is just as difficult to see how any of the major players\u2019 key goals can be met. Turkey\u2019s detente with Russia has put both sides ahead in the lineup. On the other hand, a US-Turkish joint push into Syria appears to have been derailed by mutual distrust.</p> <p>There is little from which to take comfort for those who still live in the wastelands of Syria.

As part of a widespread attempt to rein in the worst of the compensation practices that contributed to the crisis, Congress imposed a <a href=\"http://www.willkie.com/~/media/Files/Publications/2009/02/Compensation%20Restrictions%20Under%20The%20Latest%20Stimu__/Files/CompensationRestrictionsUndertheLatestStimulusPl__/FileAttachment/Compensation_Restrictions_Under_the_Latest_Stimu__.pdf\">raft of new restrictions and rules governing pay at the banks</a> as long as they still owed money borrowed under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (Tarp). </p> <p> Once those Tarp funds were repaid, the banks were free to dole out performance-based bonuses once more \u2013 and they rushed to do so. The study notes that the share of vested stock paid out as bonuses to the top five bank employees at the banks it studied rose from about 5% (when they were still under Tarp oversight) to 50% today.</p> <p> The Institute for Policy Studies uses the banks as a case study in arguing for the demolition of the executive pay bonus loophole. Their broad argument couldn\u2019t be more accurate or more timely. We need to revive the debate about all the wrongs committed in the name of delivering value to shareholders, and performance-based compensation is the tip of that particular iceberg. </p> <p> The pursuit of shareholder value has become a cult devoted to delivering maximum profits to shareholders, at all costs. Just look at how Mylan Pharmaceuticals has responded to the virtual evaporation of competitors to its lifesaving EpiPens by raising the price it charges for the auto-injector pens (which treat deadly allergic reactions to bee stings and food allergies) from $50 apiece to $600 for a two-pack over the course of eight years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/27/mylan-ceo-sold-stock-epipen-price-hike-heather-bresch\">Mylan CEO sold $5m worth of stock while EpiPen price drew scrutiny</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Just why on earth did Mylan do this?</p> <p>Well, it could. It has a virtual monopoly on a critical product \u2013 one that millions of people with an allergy rely on. There\u2019s a bonus: the active ingredient, epinephrine, degrades rapidly, so they need to buy new EpiPens every year. </p> <p>Mylan blames the insurance industry \u2013 a convenient scapegoat. Consumers were never supposed to pick up the full price tag: if insurers aren\u2019t paying, that\u2019s because the Affordable Care Act has left the health insurance system in a mess, distorting drug pricing.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth noting, however, that EpiPen price increases began before the Obama administration\u2019s healthcare law was put in place, and that in Canada\u2019s single-payer insurance market, people suffering from allergies <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.montrealgazette.com/health/canadians+with+allergies+subject+same+epipen+price+hike+consumers/12159857/story.html\">can pick up an EpiPen two-pack for less than $100</a>. Of course, in Canada, it\u2019s not Mylan that sets the price, but Pfizer, which has licensed the injectable medication from Mylan.</p> <p>Let\u2019s circle back to the pesky question of what it is that motivates CEOs like Bresch, why they make decisions like this and what they conceive their responsibilities to be.</p> <p>Since the summer of 2007, the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has climbed 47%, while Mylan\u2019s shares have outperformed dramatically, soaring 178%. And yes, you-betcha, Bresch has benefited from some of that same performance-linked compensation. Not only has it deprived the taxpayer of potential income, but it has rewarded Bresch for doing something that is just as clearly against the public interest just as leveraging the banking system to the hilt was in the run-up to the financial crisis in 2005, 2006 and 2007. </p> <p>Bresch clearly should have been rewarded for savvy marketing that made EpiPen a <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-mylan-epipen-monopoly-20160825-story.html\">\u201cmust have\u201d item in schools, airplanes and theme parks</a>. But should Bresch have been rewarded so lavishly simply for being able to hike those prices and profit from the fact that Mylan had no viable rivals? It wasn\u2019t as if the company was being rewarded for years of costly research and development. On the contrary; about half of its revenue was pure profit. And a lot of that went to pay Bresch\u2019s increasingly lavish compensation package, which rose at an even faster clip than did EpiPen\u2019s price. In 2007, Bresch pocketed $2.45m; in 2015, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/mylan-execs-gave-themselves-raises-they-hiked-epipen-prices-n636591\">her compensation totaled nearly $19m</a>. </p> <p>In whose interests are companies like Mylan and the Wall Street banks being run? </p> <p>The basic argument \u2013 based on law that dates to the early 20th century, when Henry Ford\u2019s shareholders sued him for trying to make cars more affordable to customers \u2013 is that a company has a fiduciary duty to maximize profits for its investors. It has been seized on, amplified and raised to the status of holy writ by short-term thinkers among those on Wall Street.</p> <p>The result? Publicly traded businesses, fearful of being pummeled by hedge fund investors, end up increasingly detached from the realities of the real world. They reward CEOs lavishly for delivering outsize profits and big stock price gains, even if that is done by keeping wages and salaries for employees at rock bottom levels. That\u2019s how we end up with firms like Walmart and McDonald\u2019s ostensibly employing people full time, who still rely on various forms of government assistance to keep them above the poverty line.</p> <p> </p> <p>Doing away with tax deductibility for performance-based compensation, as the Institute for Policy Studies suggests, would be a great start. At a stroke, there would be one less incentive for companies to give outsize rewards that are geared exclusively to a measure of performance that may not be in everyone\u2019s interest. As the financial crisis should have taught us, a boom in a company\u2019s profits and a run-up in the company\u2019s stock price as a result, isn\u2019t always an unquestioned good thing. Making performance-based pay more costly to a company might force the board\u2019s compensation committee to think more critically about the criteria that they\u2019re using. </p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>The real value of the IPS report isn\u2019t in the fine details like how many dollars might have flowed into the US Treasury (much less how many teachers\u2019 jobs might have been funded as a result \u2013 as if government budgets worked that smoothly \u2026). Rather, it has drawn attention to the crucial issue of performance-based compensation and the pesky questions that underpin it. If, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/04/16/what-are-corporations-obligations-to-shareholders/corporations-dont-have-to-maximize-profits\">as some legal scholars suggest</a>, it\u2019s possible for companies to go beyond the narrow, toxic pursuit of maximizing profits and think about what is good for their employees, consider their customers, take the environment into consideration and pursue innovation, then the debate about how we get from here to there has to start somewhere. Performance-based compensation is a logical point.</p>",

I could generally drive there in 40-50 mins and had free parking.  The public transport option involved getting to the tram station (either a 25 minute walk or a bus ride,) a good hour on the trams and a 10 minute walk at the end.  The trams are reliable but crowded, and I have to stand until I change trams in the City Centre.  For several weeks I also had to add on a 20 minute walk across the City because the trams weren\u2019t running through services.</p> <p>Despite the fact we have a so-called integrated public transport system in Greater Manchester, you can\u2019t buy a combined tram and bus ticket until after 9.30 a.m. and you can only buy them on the bus with certain companies \u2013 and not mine, so you have to get to the tram stop anyway.  Buying tram and bus tickets costs \u00a310.40 for 2 x 90+ minute journeys (there might be slightly cheaper options but the TfGM website is impenetrable when it comes to combined fares) compared with about \u00a34.80 in petrol for 2 x 45 minutes.  The tram stop does have park and ride, but unless you get there before 8.00 a.m. it\u2019s full because of people who park there to work in the town centre, as it is not effectively monitored.</p> <p>Add to that the facts that I was an essential car user because of travel required in the job itself and I also do shopping, go out after work (e.g. choir) or visit family, then driving - in warmth and comfort, listening to my own music and admiring the buzzards, kestrels and herons you often see on an M60 commute -  becomes a no-brainer.  My brother lives in South Manchester and works in Rochdale.  His public transport journey involves trains and trams and is just as unfathomable as mine.</p> </div>   </div> <footer class=\"element-witness--footer\"> <p class=\"element-witness--source\">Sent via <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/\" class=\"element-witness--brand\" itemprop=\"provider\">GuardianWitness</a></p> <div class=\"element-witness--metadata\"> <p class=\"element-witness--author\" itemprop=\"author\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">  By  <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/KarenED\" class=\"element-witness--author-name\" itemprop=\"name\">KarenED</a> </p> <p class=\"element-witness--date\"> <time itemprop=\"dateCreated\" datetime=\"2016-09-02T11:14:58+01:00\">2 September 2016, 11:14</time> </p> </div> </footer>  </figure>  <p>And finally ... one more about Southern rail ...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-witness element-witness-text\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/WebPageElement\" data-canonical-url=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57c81764e4b09a68e9b64c4d/5002308\"> <div class=\"element-witness--main\">    <h3 class=\"element-witness--title\" itemprop=\"name\"><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57c81764e4b09a68e9b64c4d/5002308\" itemprop=\"url\">Southern, you&#39;ve finally broken me!</a></h3>  <div itemprop=\"text\"> <p>The last 5 months of Southern Rail chaos has coincided with the 20 weeks of my first pregnancy.

He claims Southern is trying to blame its own failings on the unions and calls for the government to seize back the franchise from Govia.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Over the past year Southern has established itself as the standard bearer for dysfunctional privatised rail services. Passengers are enduring the worst delays in the country, fares are up 25%, and public investment to improve Southern services seems a long way off.</p> <p>The primary cause of train cancellations and delays on GTR services are poor planning and management by GTR and the DFT. Southern was already the least reliable service in the country before industrial action began in the spring and GTR\u2019s management revealed their failure to prepare and plan for necessary driver numbers at a select committee session in July. Trying to pin the blame on rail unions is a politically contrived attempt to deflect criticism from the failures of management and the DFT.</p> <p>GTR\u2019s management contract or \u2018concession\u2019 with the government sees the DfT taking all the revenue risk whilst GTR is paid an annual management fee, totalling \u00a38.9bn over the life of the seven-year contract to 2021. Not only does this place all the risk on the taxpayer and the passenger, GTR is not incentivised to improve performance for passengers. But the company is incentivised to cut costs at the expense of staff and to poison industrial relations. </p> <p>Go-Ahead CEO, David Brown, let the cat out of the bag this morning when he said: \u2018A large part of the role of the GTR franchise is to introduce three new train fleets and modernise working practices.\u2019 If revenue risks were with GTR, they would never have allowed services to get to this point and if the DfT had not insisted on \u2018modernising working practices\u2019 which really means attacking trade unions in order to force through an extension of cheaper and controversial driver only operations, then the current dispute would have been settled by now and the company and the rail unions could set about restoring good industrial relations.</p> <p>Instead, GTR have been fined just \u00a32m, a pittance of the company\u2019s annual turnover of \u00a31.9bn and easily covered by the \u00a315m (36%) increase in operating profit from the rail sector announced this morning by Go-Ahead. Passengers seeking recompense for serial delays, service cancellations and failures must enter the \u2018delay-repay\u2019 lottery which is heavily loaded against them.</p> <p>Yesterday, it was announced that another \u00a320m of taxpayers\u2019 money would be spent to try to save the failing franchise. Today, the Go-Ahead group, a co-owner of the Southern franchise, announced a 27% rise in profits on last year.</p> <p>The Government should strip Southern of the franchise, end the Tory sponsored rip-off of the public and run services in the public sector. The last Labour government took this approach when franchises failed on both South Eastern and twice on the East Coast, where Directly Operated Railways went on to deliver record punctuality and passenger satisfaction scores. Passengers, not ideology or political pride, must now be the priority.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c9446fe4b09a68e9b64e5e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/martin-belam\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T09:23:24.520Z\">10.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There\u2019s been a few comments on this story over on our Facebook page. This one stood out, from Jan Foster. I think it echoes the sentiment of a lot of people below the line on this live blog, and also a couple of the people I met on my journeys this morning, who really were indignant at the timing of the profit announcement coming just a day after taxpayers\u2019 cash was pledged to sort out the problems. Jan says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The sum of \u00a320m was mentioned on various news programmes yesterday as being the amount given to Southern rail to assist them in some way. I\u2019m very confused by this. I never voted Tory and don\u2019t live in the Southern rail region, but voters were always led to believe that privatisation was the best thing ever, with more choice and competition, etc. Odd, then, that those wonderful private companies, including many banks, financial institutions and now this particular railway provider, make such a total and utter mess of running them. </p> <p>Those at the very top, however, seem to thrive on this series of cock-ups, being awarded ever-expanding salaries and bonuses and then, when they fail, they are often given hand-outs to make our benefits system weep. Yet this government support this, tacitly, by chucking more and more money in the direction of many corporate companies who are poor at best and out and out crooked at worst. </p> <p>To add insult to injury, the same government holds public servants (except for themselves and their public servant cronies, of course) in extremely low regard, denying that there are available monies to support the NHS, ambulance, police, councils and fire services while handing out \u00a320m to a failing, rubbish rail company without a qualm. </p> <p>Indeed, some government bloke appeared on the BBC news yesterday, and had the bare-faced cheek to tell viewers that \u00a320m was \u201ca drop in the ocean\u201d. Really? If it truly is a \u2018drop in the ocean\u2019 I am sure there are many more \u2018drops\u2019 it could find to fund public services which would benefit everyone and not just bail out CEOs who can\u2019t do their job.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T09:34:00.506Z\">at 10.34am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c94359e4b06b4ac1748b2f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T09:21:14.860Z\">10.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>One contributor, who wishes to remain anonymous, travels on East Midlands trains from Nottingham to Leicester.

These shorter journeys could link smaller towns and services and make more parts of the countryside attractive for people who work. <br></p> <p>For instance, a Leominster to Hereford train cost \u00a37.50 for an open return, a journey of 13 miles and about 18 minutes on the train.</p> <p>A cost of \u00a315.00 for me and my wife to pop into Hereford for a bit of shopping doesn\u2019t make sense when we can drive it in about 20 minutes, even when you take into account the parking and traffic.</p> <p>I can see such train lines becoming like the bus routes in rural areas.

Yesterday my train home from London Bridge was cancelled, no explanation, while the day before my train home was delayed by about 40 minutes due to another train having brake problems. Next week\u2019s two strikes mean I\u2019ll either have to cycle more than 100 miles in a day to get to work, or work from home.</p> <p>When Southern works - which was most of spring and last winter (December excepted) - it\u2019s absolutely fine. But the last four months have been Fawlty Towers on Rails. Multiple cancelled trains in the morning and evening have been the norm, leaving me phoning family to pick up the children, or penning and editing articles on the train. Filling in the delay relay form for compensation (a pitiful \u00a34 or so per delay for me) is slow and tedious.</p> <p>For some, the stress and inconvenience is more serious. An actor I spoke to recently was furious at having been left stuck in London several times by last-minute cancellations, unable to get home to Sussex and forced to beg a sofa from friends in the capital. \u201cI despise them: Southern rail, Thameslink Govia, it\u2019s a nightmare, they\u2019re useless,\u201d he said.</p> <p>One friend, David Wicksteed, who commutes from Banstead in Surrey to a school in south London, now has to include over 10km of running into his daily journeys, because Southern\u2019s emergency timetable cut off his line entirely. </p> <p>Some long-suffering passengers I spoke to earlier this summer had a very British, resigned approach to the ongoing problems. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any choice. What can I do?

It is what it is. What can you do? They\u2019ve got you over a barrel, you\u2019ve got to get to work,\u201d said Martin Smith, an IT contractor who commutes from Crawley to London Bridge.</p> <p>James Emanuel, a software developer who travels up to London from Newhaven, said he was regularly delayed and had taken to getting earlier trains, but echoed the sentiment. \u201cI\u2019m resigned. I can\u2019t see that getting angry is going to help my situation, it would make things more stressful.

Also the service finishes at about 8pm and there are no Sunday trains.</p> </blockquote> <p>One reader, who wishes to remain anonymous, commutes five days a week on the West Coastway line between Brighton and Southampton. It\u2019s run by Southern rail. He describes a typical day\u2019s commute: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The day begins with checking the Network Rail app as soon as I wake up so that I can see whether any trains have been delayed or cancelled. If everything seems fine I get a bit worried that the app isn\u2019t working properly. I\u2019ll step out to the station and will usually notice that the train I\u2019m aiming for is a few minutes late. This is one thing to point out, they\u2019re never on time. Ever. </p> <p>I usually have the option of a seat at my station, but the train is still crowded most of the time. A few stations along and it\u2019s standing room only. </p> <p>Coming back from work, those of us who travel by train discuss which services we can aim for and we religiously check the Network Rail website again to see if they\u2019re cancelled or delayed. On the way home, if you\u2019re not at the train when the doors open, you\u2019re not going to get a seat. </p> <p>Along the line, if London trains have been delayed or cancelled you will get two or three train loads of people trying to cram themselves on at particular stations. If you\u2019re in a wheelchair or you have a pram, you can forget it. If I\u2019m lucky, the train will be within 10 minutes of its scheduled arrival time. This is my commuting life, every single day of the working week.</p> </blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not all bad news out there though. Isabel Divanna travels on Great Northern between Cambridge and London. She says she\u2019s quite satisfied by the service:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is a good line and the early train I catch in, and the mid-afternoon one I catch back, always have seats. The mid-afternoon train is often a little late, but not more than 10 minutes. My main dissatisfaction is the price - I wish it was a bit cheaper.

What can a driver do in that kind of situation if the trains aren\u2019t fully staffed?</p> <p>He says he remembers back when they took staff off the ticket barriers in Paddington a couple of decades ago. Within a few years they had to bring them back because they were losing so much revenue. \u201cAnd that\u2019s public money.\u201d</p> <p>I asked him about the personal cost of the strike - with the two days next week he will have a lost a week\u2019s wages through industrial action. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of money to lose\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ceba65d5bcb9d4c1c980ef88e8a30a30e1da17d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ceba65d5bcb9d4c1c980ef88e8a30a30e1da17d/0_225_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"RMT strike notice\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">RMT strike notice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Belam/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T06:33:58.762Z\">at 7.33am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c8a88ce4b00c28eaea76bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/martin-belam\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-02T06:24:43.970Z\">7.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s the view from someone who wanted to remain anonymous, but had plenty to say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dissatisfied doesn\u2019t really begin to describe it.

Industrial disputes have made it harder to find drivers and guards willing to do overtime.<br></p> <p><strong>New trains: </strong>New rolling stock has been ordered but drivers have to be retrained to operate them. That means taking them off the usual schedule, adding to staff shortages. <br></p> <p><strong>Industrial action: </strong>Some new trains have been designed to run without a guard, which unions oppose. This has fuelled strike action that only exacerbates existing problems.<br></p> <p><strong>Growth in rail usage:</strong> Passenger numbers have reached record levels and the south-east is where three-quarters of UK journeys take place. This has strained busy commuter routes to bursting point.<br></p> <p><strong>Cost cuts:</strong> The government has sought to transfer the cost of rail travel from taxpayers to passengers but fares are already so high that raising them is difficult.

  "<p>I don\u2019t remember a time we didn\u2019t have video games in the house. </p> <p>I grew up in Gregory, Michigan, a small town in the middle of nowhere; a town that literally borders Hell. That\u2019s Hell, Michigan. I wish I was kidding. My dad was a second shift supervisor at a General Motors plant in Detroit. He always wanted to have the latest expensive things; we owned an early home PC and he\u2019d bring home these floppy discs filled with games \u2013 they would trade them around at his office. My mom worked as a secretary and later a substitute teacher and a city postal carrier \u2013 she learned how to program at college. She made sure we all had access to the computer, even though my sister and I were super little and there were six of us fighting to use it.</p> <p>We owned an Atari when I was a toddler and a Nintendo Entertainment System by the time I was six. I had four older brothers \u2013 the eldest a decade older than me \u2013 so I didn\u2019t get to touch the consoles much. But that all changed when we got a Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/07/prototype-nintendo-playstation-obscure-games-consoles-snes-cd\">After the prototype PlayStation: six more obscure games consoles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We were given it for Christmas right before my 11th birthday. By that time, my two oldest brothers had moved out and then the third brother got a summer job. This left me in the position of second player to my youngest brother. The Snes was purchased for him (of all the girls I was friends with in late elementary and early middle school, none of them had a console in the house unless they also had a brother) but this time, by default, it was for me too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59823ccb12aff64919b2395ea0c7cd62850bfbff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59823ccb12aff64919b2395ea0c7cd62850bfbff/0_122_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A child playing Donkey Kong Country on the American version of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A child playing Donkey Kong Country on the American version of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was at the right age for it. Born in 1981, I fell through the cracks of the big generational distinctions. I am not Gen X, I am not a millennial. I am the Goonies and Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club and The Gremlins and Back to the Future. I grew up with a rotary phone, a VCR, the very first CD player, the first DVD player. My introduction to the internet was in a physical science class in 1994, trying to send an email to a university about some chemistry term. This was the era of Telnet and dial-up. It was the tipping point into the digital age.</p> <p>The Snes sat right in that weird middle ground between the past and the future. It couldn\u2019t easily handle 3D graphics like later consoles, but the pixel art worlds envisaged at the time contained the same sprawling stories and immersive experiences that modern games are built around.</p> <p>We\u2019d never before had so much control over a story as we did in on that console with its grand role-playing adventures. We\u2019d played simple arcade games on the Atari, but they were generally too hard for younger kids; the games on the Nes were nearly impossible for us too. But by the time the Snes came along, we were old enough and confident enough to go all in \u2013 and we could experience them with our friends. The games finally had proper save functions too, allowing us to store progress without having to write down a special code, which was how it worked with the Nes (and it wasn\u2019t easy for a kid who could barely write).</p> <p>So in the summer of 1993, my brother, sister and I saved up every cent of our raspberry-picking money to buy Secret of Mana, the new role-playing game from Squaresoft, creator of the legendary Final Fantasy series. It was, like, $60, which was a fortune for a bunch of kids at the time. I remember opening the package after setting up the Snes on the \u201cbig TV\u201d in the family room, which was usually forbidden by my parents. We studied the game manual together and then we started our epic journey. My brother played as the Mana Sword hero and I played as Purim, a young girl determined to rescue her boyfriend Dyluck from a witch, and Gnome, a powerful earth spirit. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79f844c016549293d1dc119f802fdd81df5ce922\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79f844c016549293d1dc119f802fdd81df5ce922/71_48_664_398/500.jpg\" alt=\"Secret of Mana was one of the great Snes role-playing adventures\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Secret of Mana was one of the great Snes role-playing adventures. It was ported to smartphones in 2014</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We spent every second we could playing that game. We played it until we beat it, and then we started again. It was the first time we had ever been sucked into a world that took us far away from our own. If we\u2019d had access to the early online fan fiction community (where people wrote and shared their own stories based around games, movies and TV shows) or if there had been something like Pottermore for Secret of Mana \u2013 we would have spent the rest of our waking hours interacting there. We had never seen anything like this game; we cared about the characters, they were real people to us, and we needed to bring stability and peace to their sad world.</p> <p>It feels weird to describe this simple, pixelated landscape in the same way someone would describe a hyper realistic endlessly exploratory game environment from today. But in 1993, this place, where I fought monsters in real time with my brother, where we got to save a world while flying on a dragon \u2013 it was like I was really there and my actions mattered. When Dyluck was taken by the witch, when the town of Pandora was struck mute, even when I had to save Santa \u2013 which is REALLY a thing in the game \u2013 everything mattered.</p> <p>What was going on culturally and historically in the years before this? The Berlin wall came down. The first Gulf War had just ended. I grew up with nuclear bomb drills, the red scare, the end of the cold war. My parents lived through the recession in the 1980s \u2026 and then here was the VERY FIRST real digital escapism for children where they were in control of a world that needed saving. Secret of Mana and the games like it were products of the culture we lived in. They were a mirror to the joy and terror we experienced as we grew older. There are parallels to the types of media kids are gravitating toward today \u2013 video games fill a need for us all. </p> <p>With their elaborate stories, multi-gendered characters, astonishing musical scores, and countless hours of gameplay, the Super Nintendo role-playing games certainly reflected a need in me. I was a 12-year-old girl from the Midwest, feeling, but not understanding, the effects of the auto industry collapsing in Detroit, the economic uncertainty of my parents and friends\u2019 parents, the shrinking of the world through satellite TV and globalisation. Yet with Secret of Mana, I had this one place where I was in control.</p> <p>Even now, many years later, I feel all of these things when I turn on that game. I am transported back to the summer of 1993, when I got to know my brother and sister so well. The world feels just as real, even though I am looking at it through adult eyes \u2013 eyes that have witnessed the first school shootings, the homegrown terrorist attacks in Oklahoma City, the bombings and destruction of the World Trade Center, the wars that claimed the lives of kids I grew up with, the illness and death of friends and family.</p> <p>My brother, sister and I still play Secret of Mana together when we are all in one place. It is much harder now that we are parents ourselves, living at opposite ends of the country. Our current playthrough has taken years instead of a few hours \u2013 10 years to be exact. But we will complete it. </p> <p>And that story \u2013 about a child who must save the world with nothing but his sword and his friends \u2013 still speaks to the kid inside of me.</p> <p><em>Rebekah Saltsman is cofounder of indie studio Finji.

  "<p>I spent Saturday morning at the public library with my 2.5-year-old daughter. She sat in the centre of a multi-racial, multi-lingual group of toddlers, spread her arms out as wide as they would go, and screamed: \u201cHe turned into a beautiful butterfly!\u201d at the end of the consummate classic, The Very Hungry Caterpillar. The parents and grandparents giggled at the collective exuberance of little ones. The kids\u2019 insanely spongy brains soaked up the sea of words surrounding them.</p> <p>This may sound like a mundane scene, but it\u2019s a surprising triumph for philanthropic equity \u2013 one of the few that exists at a meaningful, functional scale in our increasingly unequal country. At a time when early childhood has exploded as a lucrative market opportunity, no money is exchanged at the nation\u2019s public libraries.</p> <p>Why? Because in the 1850s, a wealthy guy invited a poor, 13-year-old immigrant boy to spend Saturday afternoons at his private library in Pittsburgh.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The only philanthropy worth engaging in is the kind that honours the wisdom of relationships and the power of money</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That boy grew up to be steel magnate Andrew Carnegie. <a href=\"https://dp.la/exhibitions/exhibits/show/history-us-public-libraries/carnegie-libraries\">Carnegie remembered</a> that, as a child, \u201cI resolved, if wealth ever came to me, that it should be used to establish free libraries.\u201d True to his word, Carnegie\u2019s funding built about half of the 3,500 public libraries that existed by 1920.</p> <p>Philanthropy has come a long way since the \u201cPatron Saint of Libraries\u201d took a childhood experience and turned it into a national legacy. Too often, it feels like we\u2019ve lost our core wisdom about how change actually happens.</p> <p>As they say, money can\u2019t buy love. It can\u2019t, ultimately, buy equity either. Both start with the seed of relationship.</p> <p>There would be no three-year-old black kid in Oakland screaming hungry caterpillar exuberance without Andrew Carnegie. And there would no Andrew Carnegie without that Pittsburgh bibliophile.</p> <p>So what does this mean for philanthropy? It means that the only philanthropy worth engaging in \u2013 both ethically and strategically speaking \u2013 is the kind that honours the wisdom of relationships <em>and</em> the power of money.</p> <p>In what organiser and human rights activist<strong> </strong>Ella Baker deemed the \u201cfoundation complex\u201d in 1963, those with money usually call the shots. Typically, a foundation positions itself as the expert and judges the merits of a nonprofit to solve a particular problem, whether it\u2019s childhood hunger, or deforestation, or homelessness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"069d2a4b34de366b3995c5a4f6fe4076e32be3d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/069d2a4b34de366b3995c5a4f6fe4076e32be3d3/0_3_4287_2572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A girl stamping her own book at the old Aberystwyth Carnegie funded public lending library, Wales.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A girl stamping her own book at the old Aberystwyth Carnegie-funded public library, Wales.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keith Morris/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve been on the phone myself, scrambling to feel worthy of a foundation officer\u2019s attention and money; nothing has inflicted me with a more toxic form of impostor syndrome. The questions foundation representatives ask, like those little bubbles on a standardised test, seem to pop up one after the other. With each one, I feel my breath get shallow. I\u2019m feverishly tap-dancing when what I want to be doing is have good faith, meaningful conversation.</p> <p>With individual donors, the hierarchy is often softened with social graces \u2013 a cup of coffee, a chat about shared passions, the scent of camaraderie \u2013 but ultimately the power dynamic is no different. One of us has the means and therefore is in the position of judging the other\u2019s \u201cgood works\u201d. In some ways, these interactions can be even more demoralising because they are deeply confusing; sometimes it can feel like you are performing friendship.</p> <p>In the midst of particularly demoralising experiences with wealthy philanthropists, I have often reminded myself of my own privilege \u2013 a white woman from an upper-middle-class background with an Ivy League degree. If these interactions make me feel this way, imagine how confusing and alienating they likely are for people even further afield of the social class of most philanthropists.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/12/philanthropy-global-poverty-development-finance-sdgs\">Philanthropists can\u2019t eradicate global poverty, but we can make a start</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A note about philanthropists\u2019 demographics: three-fourths of foundations\u2019 full-time staff are white and nearly 90% are over 30. Women flourish at smaller foundations \u2013 about three of four fundraisers are female \u2013 but at those with assets of more than $750m, <a href=\"https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2012/03/22/foundation-portrait-demographics-and-compensation/\">women comprise only 28.9% of CEOs and CGOs </a>(chief growth officers).</p> <p>Board leadership is even more demographically starved. \u201cFully 85% of foundation board members are white, while just 7% are African American and only 4% are Hispanic,\u201d <a href=\"http://democracyjournal.org/magazine/34/democracy-and-the-donor-class/\">said Gara LaMarche, president of the Democracy Alliance</a>. \u201cNearly three-quarters of foundations have no written policy on board diversity, and fewer than 10% of board members are under 40.\u201d</p> <p>This means a lot of people who are not white, male and older are hustling their asses off to understand the sensibility of those who are. They are spending energy being tactical about how they talk about their work and build relationships, however transactional or tokenising. I admire their commitment and acuity, but even if some get good at translating and tap-dancing for dollars, that should not comfort the philanthropic world about its own inclusivity or transparency.</p> <p>It only means that some people are willing to put in the work to get good at the game, not that the game isn\u2019t profoundly rigged or that it doesn\u2019t distract from getting real work done.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How do we create paradigm-shifting programmes together, not just send LinkedIn requests and push money and paper around?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And the truth is, I imagine it\u2019s a disconcerting experience for most philanthropists, too. On some level, they must know that they\u2019re not the wisest authorities on the issues they\u2019re seeking to effect. Money doesn\u2019t make you an expert on poverty alleviation; in fact, it can make you dumber with distance. And yet, traditional philanthropy is set up to put you \u2013 the one with financial wealth \u2013 in the position of playing god with something you deeply care about. Even if it strokes your ego to be the decider, it\u2019s got to erode your sense of integrity.</p> <p>How can we reinvent philanthropy with an eye toward true equity? How can we create new cultures and structures that allow resources \u2013 financial, experiential, energetic \u2013 to flow in ways that feel dignifying? How do we create paradigm-shifting shit together, not just send LinkedIn requests and push money and paper around?</p> <p>One obvious thing we can do is work to change the demographics of those giving away money and sitting on boards. But even that isn\u2019t a fix; it\u2019s a good bet to slowly shift culture, but not a promise of radical restructuring. There has been a slight uptick in black executives at foundations, for example, but as soon as they arrive, many are looking for an out, <a href=\"https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2014/06/09/study-why-has-the-number-of-black-professionals-in-philanthropy-decreased/\">according to the Association of Black Foundation Executives</a>. They overwhelmingly cite as their reason for fleeing that they want to be \u201cmore directly engaged in creating community change.\u201d Duh.</p> <p>If we really want to reinvent philanthropy then we are going to have to look at the underlying historic and structural causes of poverty and work to dismantle them and put new systems in their place. It\u2019s also about culture \u2013 intentionally creating boundary-bashing friendships, learning to ask better, more generous questions, taking up less space.</p> <p>It\u2019s about what we are willing to acknowledge about the origins of our own wealth and privilege. It\u2019s about reclaiming values that privilege often robs us of: first and foremost, humility. But also trust in the ingenuity and goodness of other people, particularly those without financial wealth. And a more accurate sense of proportion \u2013 where and how are philanthropists really most crucial in the fight for a more just society?</p> <p>Several groups are working to show us what this kind of giving might look like. An example: a group of trust fund kids, calling themselves the <a href=\"http://resourcegeneration.org/gilmoregulfsouthalliedfunders/\">Gulf South Allied Funders</a>, took their own inheritances, raised even more money from their own networks and then donated the sum to the Twenty-First Century Foundation, which has a long-standing presence in New Orleans. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, they acknowledged their unfamiliarity with the community, and decided to funnel their resources to someone who could make a bigger difference.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cb9ea380c5a4df610354d2c1c9d880fc9d18e838\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb9ea380c5a4df610354d2c1c9d880fc9d18e838/0_11_3224_1934/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emergency Response Team volunteers clean up debris from a home destroyed by Hurricane Katrina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emergency response team volunteers clean up debris from a home destroyed by Hurricane Katrina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Humphrey/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another: poor families in Boston and Detroit and Fresno track data about their own strengths and goals and then come together on a regular basis to talk about what they\u2019re learning and the kinds of support they need.

They walk their talk \u2013 moving beyond radical theory to radical practice.</p> <p>To their credit, many of<strong> </strong>the world\u2019s most powerful donors have begun to question the ethical underpinnings and best practicesof status quo philanthropy. In 2013, <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/3cab31066f79\">Peter Buffett</a>, chairman of the NoVo Foundation, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/27/opinion/the-charitable-industrial-complex.html?_r=0\">wrote a manifesto</a> that, at its essence, was a call for more structural consciousness and less cognitive dissonance among wealthy altruists: \u201cBecause of who my father is, I\u2019ve been able to occupy some seats I never expected to sit in. Inside any important philanthropy meeting, you witness heads of state meeting with investment managers and corporate leaders. All are searching for answers with their right hand to problems that others in the room have created with their left.\u201d</p> <p>More recently, <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/f7208b89e16c\">Darren Walker</a>, the President of the Ford Foundation, has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/opinion/why-giving-back-isnt-enough.html\">called for</a> a \u201cnew \u2018gospel of wealth\u2019 for the 21st century\u201d \u2013 one that addresses \u201cthe underlying causes that perpetuate human suffering. In other words, philanthropy can no longer grapple simply with what is happening in the world, but also with <em>how</em> and <em>why</em>.\u201d</p> <p>The shift in zeitgeist is promising. A critical mass of people working within philanthropy is hungry to do work with more ethical rigor; more systemic, cultural, and emotional intelligence; less bureaucracy and hubris. There is a growing conversation about these shifts. On paper, the will is there.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/30/cincinnati-experiment-peoples-liberty-citizen-philanthropy-improve-city\">The Cincinnati experiment: can 'citizen philanthropy' improve a city?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But philanthropists need more than \u201cbig ideas\u201d about how their profession could and should change.

And they\u2019re not as generous as those with less income: \u201cThe wealthiest Americans \u2013 those who earned $200,000 or more \u2013 reduced the share of income they gave to charity by 4.6% from 2006 to 2012.

  "<p>When Tori Fahey packed in her job and embarked on a journey across Africa on her bike, what started as a hiatus from real life became the catalyst for an entirely new beginning.</p> <p> On the surface, her story is almost a clich\u00e9. Having worked for more than a decade in finance (in the oil and gas industry in Canada), Fahey found herself wanting more from life. But it wasn\u2019t through desperation that her circumstances changed: \u201cI didn\u2019t get fed up and storm off, nothing like that; it was curiosity about other interests and wanting to experience something new.\u201d</p> <p> Stage one was a return to education; Fahey left her job and completed an MBA before setting up a move to New York to begin a degree. However, the opportunity of an open year between the MBA and the degree came up, and as a keen touring cyclist, Fahey realised that a much dreamed-about adventure was now becoming a possibility: \u201cThe ride in Africa had been on my fantasy list. It was a moment when I realised that I could do anything, so I should. Things were happening in my personal life, and suddenly the life I might go back to in Canada wasn\u2019t there anymore. Suddenly everything was possible.\u201d</p> <p>Fahey not only rode across Africa, a 12,000-km (7,500-mile) trip that took four months and traversed Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Botswana, Namibia and South Africa, but she also raced solo and unsupported the 4,200km from Banff in Alberta to Antelope Wells in New Mexico on two wheels, taking everything she needed for the trip with her.</p> <p> The whole experience had a life-changing impact. Fahey is the first to admit she needed a shove in the right direction, but what is also clear is she is very much the architect: \u201cIt was a very liberating experience because there are so many things that you can\u2019t prepare for that you have to figure out on the fly, and when you start to deal with the problems that come up it\u2019s really, really rewarding to realise you can do anything.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fe476eba2984b4270f33df43a88946eff5b2633\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fe476eba2984b4270f33df43a88946eff5b2633/0_86_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Not a fan of pannier and rack systems ...\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not a fan of pannier and rack systems ...</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tori Fahey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBefore the trip, I considered myself quite independent, but I realised how much I valued interacting and enjoying experiences with people. The Canada-to-Mexico trip was very much a solo trip. You would spend a whole day not talking to anyone \u2013 and I realised from a biking perspective that tours I did in the future would be with people. It was an important part of the experience.\u201d<br></p> <p>Fahey also realised that, while people were important, material things were not. \u201cI realised how little I needed and how to let go of material things. I had a real tendency to cling to things, various types of safety blankets, but I realised very quickly what I did and didn\u2019t need. It was a very liberating experience, you have to figure things out on the fly and when you start to deal with the problems that come up, it\u2019s really, really rewarding to realise you can do anything.\u201d</p> <p>Post-degree, Fahey worked on projects with the UNDP (United Nations Development Project) in Montenegro, the National Innovation Fund of Kazakhstan and the Caisse des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts et des Consignations de Tunisie; all with the aim of bringing venture capital and investment to rural or marginalised communities</p> <p>It was while working on these projects that the seeds were sown for the next new venture. \u201cIt was through my trip from Canada to Mexico that I discovered pannier and rack systems and my revelation from the trip was that I was never going to use them again.\u201d</p> <p>So, in 2013, <a href=\"https://www.apidura.com/\">Apidura</a> was born, producing storage solutions for people looking to travel the world by bike, race across continents and carry all they need to do so. It\u2019s now a successful global brand, but Fahey remains reflective about what the company does. \u201cIt\u2019s very different from my past life; the nice thing about the cycling industry is that you\u2019re generally dealing with people who do what they love. So it can get hectic but you\u2019re dealing with happy, honest, good people and that\u2019s a really nice perk!</p> <p>\u201cBicycles provide a literal freedom, but the emotional feelings are also so important; the types of feeling you really get when you push yourself on a bike ... You don\u2019t allow yourself to feel like that in everyday life because there are so many distractions, so when you feel happy or sad, you\u2019re distracted by something, but when you\u2019re out on the bike and there\u2019s nothing else, you\u2019re really free to experience what life is.\u201d</p>",

Theresa May and Amber Rudd should go to the global summit on refugees led by President Barack Obama later this month to try to reach new commitments on aid and resettlement, as well as resolving conflicts that are forcing people from their homes. Britain must be part of new international partnerships and action, rather than using the Brexit vote as an excuse to turn inwards. We should continue our leading role on aid, not cut back under the new international development secretary Priti Patel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2afb2a434cc472f4a63944251ed61eff56fd78c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2afb2a434cc472f4a63944251ed61eff56fd78c7/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"More than 600 unaccompanied children are at daily risk in the makeshift Calais refugee camp known as the Jungle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">More than 600 unaccompanied children are at daily risk in the makeshift Calais refugee camp known as the Jungle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In our remaining time in the EU we should push for Europe-wide action on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/01/abandon-refugee-children-politicians-calais-camp\">child safeguarding</a>, and the restoration of border checks within the Schengen zone to stop child trafficking and increase security.

  "<p> </p> <p>If <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pokemon-go\">Pok\u00e9mon Go</a> has taught us anything, it\u2019s that apps and gamification have the potential to change the way we interact with our cities; and as cities become smarter, citizens are increasingly having a greater influence on their development.</p> <p>A new Oslo-based app has taken that idea further and is giving power directly to the people who, when it comes to urban planning, are too-often left out of the conversation: children.</p> <p>Two years ago, Vibeke R\u00f8rholt, who has worked in traffic safety in Norway for more than15 years, began compiling a report that looked into road safety for children in Oslo. Commissioned to work for Norway\u2019s Agency of the Urban Environment, R\u00f8rholt had to come up with a way to encourage the capital\u2019s 44,000 children to walk or cycle to school. What better way to find out how they feel about their own security than by asking them directly?</p> <h2>A drive for sustainability</h2> <p>The Traffic Agent app was created to understand children\u2019s concerns about their own safety in the city and is part of Oslo\u2019s move towards greater sustainability and away from cars. The new leftwing city government announced last year it planned to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/19/oslo-moves-to-ban-cars-from-city-centre-within-four-years\">ban private cars from the centre by 2019</a> as part of its initiative to halve greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cThe government said that all increase in traffic in Norway should now be done by cycling, walking or public transport,\u201d explains R\u00f8rholt. Indeed, the country is on a sustainable push: there have been reports that the sale of fossil fuel-based cars will be <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/norway-to-ban-the-sale-of-all-fossil-fuel-based-cars-by-2025-and-replace-with-electric-vehicles-a7065616.html\">banned in the hope of all cars running on green energy by 2025.</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/jan/25/floods-jakarta-indonesia-twitter-petajakarta-org\">How tweeting about floods became a civic duty in Jakarta</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Increasingly, cities across Europe are investing in different ways to become greener and more liveable. Peter Staelens, project coordinator at Eurocities, says the nature of the investment has changed. \u201cOriginally there was a lot of investment in roads and infrastructure for cars. I think that changed because practically all major cities have recognised that we need a modal shift away from the car so that more investment is needed for sustainable alternatives.\u201d These alternatives include investments in public transport, electric mobility, cycle- and pedestrian-friendly areas. \u201cIt\u2019s about making better use of existing infrastructure, improving the capacity and flow of the network,\u201d adds Staelens. </p> <h2>Secret agents</h2> <p>With \u20ac347,000 (\u00a3290,000) in funding from the city, the Research Council of Norway and consultancy Capgemini, R\u00f8rholt needed to find ways to create an environment where parents would feel that it was safe enough for children to walk to school. \u201cI was supposed to make a traffic report on all roads in Oslo. That\u2019s a big job,\u201d she comments. \u201cSo I thought, why don\u2019t we ask the children how they feel on the street?\u201d The best way to do that, she says, was to turn to gamification. Using a smartphone app, with the idea of users being \u201csecret agents\u201d for the city, children can send immediate reports on their route to school when they come across, for example, a difficult crossing on the street or an area of heavy traffic. Their location is tracked using GPS, so researchers can pinpoint exactly where these hazards are.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/aug/25/pokemon-go-libraries-technology-innovation\">Pok\u00e9mon: gotta catch them all, even in the library</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The idea of crowdsourcing information to understand what needs to be improved in cities is nothing new. In Jakarta, Indonesia, the city started exploring how citizens could help address major issues including flooding and congestion. The Emergency Management Agency set up a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/jan/25/floods-jakarta-indonesia-twitter-petajakarta-org\">project called PetaJakarta</a> to create a real-time, crowdsourced map of flooding in the city. In San Jose, California, city authorities have set up what they describe as a \u201creal-time civic engagement tool\u201d whereby residents download a <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/san-jose-mobile-city-hall/id338029133\">free app</a>, and can send, for example, a photograph of litter connected to GPS that goes directly to city hall.<br></p> <h2>The positive impact on children</h2> <p>Asking children for feedback has never been done before in Norway, R\u00f8rholt says. She believes this is having a positive impact on children, and could be rolled out to other cities. \u201cI received a telephone call from the mother of a little boy who had reported some bushes that meant he couldn\u2019t see when he was crossing the street. And two days later the bushes were cut. She phoned in saying he\u2019s so happy that he could make this happen.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa174a3145ad62e5dfcaec9a90bbbd0a38f9dede\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa174a3145ad62e5dfcaec9a90bbbd0a38f9dede/0_17_1305_783/1000.png\" alt=\"xxx\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The app crowdsources data to identify problems.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mister Trafikkagenten</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>R\u00f8rholt says that using information provided by children through the app, authorities have rebuilt several big crossings and made more pavements to make it safer for pedestrians in the past year. For example, several students reported that they liked to walk through privately-owned land on part of their journey to school as it felt safer, so Oslo municipality agreed with the owner of the property that if the government created a crossing, path and handrail, he would maintain it. </p> <p>Data protection is an issue that might deter parents and teachers from encouraging children to use this app, but from the beginning the Traffic Agent has anonymised data. The app is integrated with Norway\u2019s school software platform which generates a code for each child to use as a login. This data is visible only to the school and project team. R\u00f8rholt also maintains that when the children start using the app from home, they don\u2019t get a report until they move at least 200 metres away. To keep some privacy for the children, not all the information is shared with parents and teachers. </p> <p>Although the app is in use only in the capital, R\u00f8rholt says the director of the Oslo municipality wants to see it shared across Norway, so other communities can use it at a low cost. It is a slow process: so far only 35 out of 135 schools have taken part. \u201cI still don\u2019t think we have changed the number of children walking,\u201d says R\u00f8rholt, \u201cand I hope that we will. I hope that when we can show the results \u2013 which we try to do <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/trafikkagenten/\">on Facebook</a>, as that\u2019s where the parents are \u2013 we can get more schools to cooperate with us.\u201d</p> <p>Cities like Oslo are having to strike a balance between becoming both accessible and liveable, and it seems that crowdsourcing information from residents is the most logical way forward. Traffic Agent shows that children can even have a hand in how cities are planned \u2013 like where the safest place to build a school is \u2013 at just the click of a button.<br><strong><br>Talk to us on Twitter via </strong><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianpublic\">@Guardianpublic</a> and </strong><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/public-leaders/\">sign up</a></strong><strong> for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.</strong><br></p>",

When Hungary shut its border on 15 September, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/17/croatia-overwhelmed-by-volume-of-refugees-crossing-from-serbia\">Croatia and Slovenia simply picked up the slack</a>, allowing hundreds of thousands of migrants to cross their territory instead. That month, Donald Tusk, the European council president, stood next to Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the Hungarian prime minister, and said that he fundamentally <a href=\"http://budapestbeacon.com/politics/tusk-gives-orban-lesson-on-christianity/26746\">disagreed with Orb\u00e1n\u2019s vision of Christianity</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e3cf4ec1c71410d2c9245e63c033b826400d8b1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3cf4ec1c71410d2c9245e63c033b826400d8b1f/0_0_3419_2929/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The front pages of six British national newspapers featuring the picture of Alan Kurdi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"857\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The front pages of six British national newspapers featuring the picture of Alan Kurdi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA Wire/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But on the anniversary of Alan\u2019s death, Hungary believes it has all but won the argument on European migration policy. \u201cMost of the countries have come to the same conclusions that we came to last year,\u201d says Zoltan Kovacs, the Hungarian government spokesman. \u201cThey didn\u2019t see it as we saw it last year, and there are still people in Brussels who don\u2019t. But common sense has prevailed.\u201d</p> <p>With rightwing populists on the rise across the continent, and a perceived connection between migration and terrorism, Europe has gradually abandoned the humanitarian approach of last winter. Austria, which was once a key German ally on migration policy, <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/austrian-minister-wants-to-replicate-australian-model-for-migrants/\">now wants an Australian-style approach</a> that could see Greece formally used as a giant holding bay for asylum seekers, just as Canberra controversially uses the island state of Nauru to detain people trying to reach Australia.

A briefing stressed that curbing migration is a red line, and that Britain is not interested in an off-the-shelf deal with Europe but a bespoke one. Nevertheless it is still far from clear, perhaps even to May herself, what will emerge once she has finished with her hammer and chisel.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/restricting-immigration-will-be-at-heart-of-brexit-deal-theresa-may-says\">Restricting immigration will be at heart of Brexit deal, Theresa May says</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/30/theresa-may-launches-conservative-leadership-bid-brexit-means-brexit-video\" title=\"\">May\u2019s well-tried line about Brexit meaning Brexit </a>has been a useful summer defence against attempts to bounce her into committing herself before she was ready. It allowed her to scotch suspicions that a predominantly pro-remain government would attempt to renege on the people\u2019s verdict. It also bought her time to clarify what, in her view, Brexit really adds up to. But its shelf-life is over now and decision time is getting close.</p> <p>Wednesday\u2019s cabinet meeting showed that what Brexit really means is still a work in progress. To extend the sculpture analogy, it showed that May has begun to shape and narrow the block of marble without starting to cut irrevocably into it. The precise outlines of the figure to be carved remain hidden. But some things are now not in&#xa0;doubt.</p> <p>It was always clear, for instance, that meaningful migration controls would be at the heart of any Brexit package that May will accept. Border controls are crucial to the social reform Toryism she stands for. That was explicitly confirmed this week. Free movement as we know it will end. The rules governing movement to and from the 27 remaining European Union member states will change. Downing Street claims to have a pretty clear idea of what it wants to achieve.</p> <p>Likewise, it has always been obvious that May will look to maintain existing EU single market trading links as much as possible. As an aim it\u2019s a no-brainer. But the reality is something else. You can\u2019t be in the single market without free movement, so if the UK forsakes free movement, in what sense can it still access the single market? Deciding how far to push that is not a dilemma for London, but one for the whole EU.</p> <p>True, it is a mistake to think that no compromises whatever are possible. The single market is not just one undifferentiated system. Services, digital issues, energy and transport are all not fully unified. Even rights to free movement can be differentiated \u2013 like existing length of stay, the position of dependents, students and, in particular, those in and with offers of employment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc3d9a0c406d088d70706b8c983b64de292119b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc3d9a0c406d088d70706b8c983b64de292119b1/0_183_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May at Chequers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May at Chequers: \u2018Wednesday\u2019s cabinet meeting showed that what Brexit really means is still a work in progress.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nevertheless, it is naive to imagine May either wants to or could deliver continued freedom of movement in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. The Brexit vote was many things, but at its heart it was a revolt against migration, both real and imagined. Others may be in denial about this, but the prime minister certainly is not.</p> <p>It therefore follows that Britain has not got a hope in hell of negotiating a deal that keeps the country in the single market after Brexit. Freedom of movement is not a detail, to be casually set aside. And if the UK is determined to end freedom of movement, it also follows that UK access to the single market will be very limited.</p> <p>Not enough people have grasped this yet. Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform thinktank says \u201cthe British people are living in cloud cuckoo land\u201d about the economic impact. Most prophets of post-Brexit economic doom are lying low at the moment \u2013 August\u2019s rebound in manufacturing being the latest reason for them to do so. But it is hard to imagine how a Britain outside the single market will not struggle.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All the choices that follow from Brexit are difficult \u2013 and many of them are very bad ones indeed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s why the real political tension in the May cabinet is actually not between the remainers and the leavers, as many have too easily assumed. People who were at the meeting claim there is reasonable agreement among ministers about the shape of the strategy so far. The bigger faultline is the one between the Treasury, which wants the single market to be the priority, and No&#xa0;10, which puts migration control first.</p> <p>Since No&#xa0;10 will ultimately win that battle, the question is how the Treasury will react. In its determination to maintain the City of London\u2019s global position outside the single market, the Treasury will find itself inexorably drawn down the road towards remaking the UK as an offshore, low-tax financial haven. Just at the very moment when the EU locks horns with Apple over sweetheart tax deals, so Britain may roll out the welcome mat to international corporations such as Apple, offering Britain as the new Ireland, or as a European Singapore.</p> <p>There was a sign of that changing mood this week when Carolyn Fairbairn, the new head of the CBI, urged the government <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/248396/let-banks-off-naughty-step-fight-london-post-brexit-says\" title=\"\">to allow the banks to come \u201coff the naughty step</a>\u201d, said City regulators should prioritise competitiveness and proposed scrapping the current 8% surcharge on bank profits. George Osborne\u2019s brief post-referendum flirtation with a low corporation tax regime was ended by his sacking in July. But the pressure on Philip Hammond to follow that path seems likely to grow as the shape of the Brexit stance gradually becomes clearer this autumn.</p> <p>This will present May with a huge dilemma. If she sanctions a drive towards lower tax, lighter-touch financial regulation, she will delight the Thatcherite Brexiteers such as the international trade secretary, Liam Fox. He told Wednesday\u2019s meeting that Britain had to rediscover a Victorian buccaneering spirit \u2013 language that may not travel as well as Fox imagines. May herself talked this week about forging a unique new role for the UK in the world, so some of that may have rubbed off on her.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/31/theresa-may-brexiteers-conservative-right-prime-minister\">Has Theresa May really thrown in her lot with the Brexiteers? | Jackie Ashley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But a re-embrace of City bankers and an even more sumptuous welcome mat to global corporations would be disastrous for the Tories. A decent opposition would make hay with it. It would make a mockery of the claim that Britain should be \u201ca country that works for everyone\u201d. This claim has been central to May\u2019s political positioning ever since the referendum (and indeed long before that). And it is now to be the theme of the post-referendum Tory party conference in Birmingham next month.</p> <p>May and her ministers aren\u2019t stupid people. They know they are advancing into an autumn in which all the big political and economic calls are connected and all have big consequences. They mostly understand the problems they face. What they lack at this stage are the answers. But the inescapable truth is that all the choices that follow from Brexit are difficult \u2013 and many of them are very bad ones indeed.</p> <p>Some may see an angel in the block of marble.

There is widespread bafflement at why students are engaging in this bizarre form of protest, but theories abound.</p> <p>The new education minister, Fred Matiangi, <a href=\"http://www.nation.co.ke/news/It-s-exam-cheats-burning-dorms--says-Matiang-i/1056-3317442-d6ux0n/index.html\">a combative figure</a> who has already introduced many reforms, has accused cartels unhappy at efforts to thwart systematic exam cheating, which has blighted past national examinations, of inciting students.</p> <p>Commentators have suggested everything from political sabotage and copycat action by students to boredom, protest at authoritarian school leadership, and the bad example set by politicians in one of Africa\u2019s more raucous democracies.</p> <p>Johnston Kavuludi, a former provincial director of education who is now chairman of the national police service commission, believes the crisis has complex roots that require an equally sophisticated policy response.</p> <p>\u201cSociety has changed,\u201d says Kavuludi. \u201cThis is a very different generation from those we had in the past. The ICT revolution means that these are children, who have access to a broad array of information and social media, feel much more empowered than in the past. But the school system has not changed and remains very much a place where there is a top-down approach to management.\u201d</p> <p>Kavuludi says Kenya needs to engage in root and branch reform of the education system to make it more democratic, and to open more avenues for engagement with students. He says Kenya\u2019s evolution into a more open society should be reflected in the school system, and has called for teachers to be trained in psychology to help them engage more robustly with students, instilling in them a sense of ownership of their schools.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf5671f835b46b7f8c8b8e0f7762ee4c802e02c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf5671f835b46b7f8c8b8e0f7762ee4c802e02c1/0_326_4896_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Double Olympic 800m champion David Rudisha leads a training session at St Patrick\u2019s high school in Iten, Kenya, in February 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Double Olympic 800m champion David Rudisha leads a training session at St Patrick\u2019s Iten high school.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The author and journalist Charles Onyango-Obbo, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nation.co.ke/oped/Opinion/Try-letting-students-sleep-to-stop-arson-in-schools/440808-3329224-mbey5t/index.html\">writing in </a>Kenya\u2019s biggest newspaper, the Daily Nation, suggested that the fact students were only burning dormitories could be a sign of their frustration with an incredibly structured and regimented system that affords them too little autonomy. \u201cStudents get up too early when they still want to sleep, and are kept away studying late or doing other things when they would want to go in and sleep,\u201d wrote Onyango-Obbo. </p> <p>Kavuludi takes that analysis further, arguing that while living conditions in most Kenyan homes have improved over time, those in schools \u2013 which have experienced record rates of enrolment since the introduction of free primary education and partially free high school education in 2003 \u2013 have arguably got worse. He says crowded dormitories are evidence that schools need to be made more accommodating spaces for students.</p> <p>The Guardian was barred from visiting a number of schools in Nairobi where dormitories have been torched. However, students who <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nation.co.ke/news/Why-we-are-setting-our-schools-on-fire--Students-speak-out/1056-3308118-4i0om0z/index.html\">spoke to the Sunday Nation</a> on condition of anonymity cited a laundry list of complaints as the source of their frustrations. Most blamed high-handed administrators, while some pointed to poor conditions in their schools including inadequate food rations.</p> <p>\u201cHow can a big school like Njonjo girls high school give one loaf of bread to six girls to share for breakfast, while in most other schools the minimum quantity of bread is a quarter loaf per student?\u201d asked one pupil from a school in the central Kenya highlands.</p> <p>It is hard to emphasise how seriously parents take education in Kenya. In a country with few mineral resources, education is widely seen as the main passport to a better life. Parents sell cows and take loans \u2013 using title deeds on their land as security \u2013 to get their children into the best schools. They are conscious that good grades lead to coveted degree courses that can win jobs in Kenya\u2019s service-driven economy.</p> <p>In the 2016-17 budget, the education ministry again drew the biggest allocation, taking 399bn Kenyan shillings (\u00a33.02bn), about 18% of government spending.

I wouldn\u2019t even bear to visit a school where dormitories have been gutted by fire. Why would anyone then imagine teachers can be involved in this?\u201d</p> <p>Sossion says the school system must be reformed to minimise conflict between school administrations and the student body. He also wants the education ministry to take a more consultative approach, saying that students may be reacting to \u201cabrupt changes in the school calendar\u201d, such as the recent decision to shorten the August school holiday. </p> <p>\u201cWe need to create schools that are fit for the 21st century. In Kenya, the [2010] constitution has granted people a lot of rights. The school environment should be no different. We need to rethink everything.

  "<p>The rains are not what they once were in Kitui County. As climate change bites, the wet season is more erratic and drought has become an all-too-common phenomenon in this rural corner of eastern Kenya.</p> <p>This year, the community\u2019s produce of peas, sorghum and other staples failed to reach maturity because the rains arrived one month late, says Onesmus Mwangangi, an agricultural expert at the charity <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.farmafrica.org/\">Farm Africa</a>. \u201cFarmers in this region have lost more than 80% of their crops due to lack of rain,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>They are not alone. Much of southern Africa is currently suffering consecutive seasons of drought, prompting the <a href=\"http://www.sadc.int/\">Southern African Development Community</a> to declare a regional disaster and to request $2.7bn in aid. If donors were to follow the recent <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.fao.org/emergencies/resources/documents/resources-detail/en/c/426926/\">advice of the UN</a>, a proportion of that funding should be spent on so-called drought-resistant seeds.</p> <p>Seeds have been conventionally bred to be more tolerant to low water levels for decades. Plants are either conventionally crossed and then screened to identify those with optimum gene patterns or, more recently, they have been genetically modified (GM) to include the desired DNA traits. </p> <p>Among the early pioneers of conventional cross-breeding for drought resistance are organisations such as the non-profit <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cimmyt.org/\">International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://archive.agra.org/\">AGRA</a> (supported by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation). In Kitui County, Farm Africa is already encouraging farmers to adopt drought-tolerant hybrids of traditional crops, with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12571-013-0256-x\">evidence suggesting</a> these seeds use water more efficiently and, in many cases, mature over shorter periods.</p> <p>The big guns of the biotech world are also moving in, with seed giants such as <a href=\"http://www.monsanto.com/products/pages/droughtgard-hybrids.aspx\">Monsanto</a>, <a href=\"http://www.syngenta-us.com/corn/agrisure/agrisure-artesian\">Syngenta</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www2.dupont.com/Renewably_Sourced_Materials/en_US/seeds.html\">DuPont</a> investing heavily in GM strains of drought-resistant crops for the US, but not yet Africa.</p> <h2>Do drought-resistant seeds work?</h2> <p>The evidence in favour of drought-resistant seeds is strong, says Kate Fehlenberg, from the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cimmyt.org/project-profile/drought-tolerant-maize-for-africa-dtma/\">Drought Tolerant Maize for Africa Seed Scaling project</a> (DTMASS), funded by USAID. Over a five-year period, a total of 2.9 million farmers in 13 African countries covered by an earlier version of the DTMASS project saw their yields increase by 20% to 30% after sowing a variety of drought-tolerant hybrids. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/sep/17/food-security-gm\">Africa shouldn't take GM crops lightly, but neither can it ignore their potential</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fehlenberg says that the hurdle has less to do with science and more to do with distribution. \u201cThe challenge is to get [the seed] out to the farmers \u2026 You can have the best corn in the world but it\u2019s no good if it\u2019s sitting in the freezer.\u201d</p> <p>Some inroads are being made. The <a href=\"http://wema.aatf-africa.org/\">Water Efficient Maize for Africa programme</a>, involving Monsanto, for example, saw sales of its drought-tolerant hybrid non-GM seed variety increase by more than <a href=\"http://www.aatf-africa.org/files/files/publications/AATF-ar-2015.pdf\">300% last year</a> [pdf], with around 200,000 farmers having used its seeds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf12dc373c5100fb97e4ebde655220ced6e00b1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf12dc373c5100fb97e4ebde655220ced6e00b1d/0_174_5216_3129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Farmer in Africa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trials of drought-resistant seeds, funded by the Gates Foundation, have shown yield increases.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Farm Africa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such successes remain relatively isolated, however. In reality, most smallholder farmers in Africa have yet to hear about drought-resistant seed technology. And those that have are still to be convinced. According to an as yet unpublished survey of more than 4,000 farmers by DTMASS, common concerns include the cost, reliability and productivity of these novel seed varieties. </p> <p>The seed market also needs better regulation, says Fehlenberg. In countries such as Kenya and Tanzania, for example, the sale of fake and falsely labelled seeds is widespread.</p> <p>DTMASS recently set up a seed scaling programme to increase awareness and demand for drought-tolerant varieties among small farmers in Africa. Part of its strategy will be to look beyond formal market channels such as seed companies\u2019 local salespeople and try to access informal farmer networks.</p> <h2>Seeds not the only solution</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/18/africa-drought-untapped-groundwater-aquifers-water-stress-ngo-partnership-ethiopia\">Africa droughts prompt calls to start pumping untapped groundwater</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are, however, reservations. Seed sovereignty in particular has become a red-flag issue for many farmer groups in Africa. The drought-tolerant seeds have to be purchased anew every year, unlike traditional seeds, which can be regularly recycled. If seed companies like Monsanto end up controlling the sale of drought-tolerant seeds in Africa in the future, many farmers fear becoming locked into cycles of financial obligation as well as losing control over local systems of food production.</p> <p>The solution, says Clare Oxborrow, senior <a href=\"https://www.foe.co.uk/page/sustainable-farming\">food and farming</a> campaigner at Friends of the Earth UK, is an approach to seed development, including drought-tolerant seeds, that prioritises local-led breeding and local knowledge. </p> <p> Seeds are also only one piece of the puzzle, says Fehlenberg. Other important steps to increase resilience to drought include good farm management, effective irrigation, suitable crop insurance, and the use of crops suited to the local climate and soil.</p> <p>With this advice in mind, Farm Africa currently trains farmer groups in agricultural best practices such as manure-based fertility management, water conservation and proper tillage. The charity is also working to provide improved early warning of potentially extreme weather conditions so farmers can better prepare for drought conditions.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 September 2016.

  "<p>The bankruptcy of the Hanjin shipping line has thrown ports and retailers around the world into confusion, with giant container ships marooned and merchants worrying whether hundreds of tonnes of goods being carried by the South Korean company will reach shelves.</p> <p>The company filed for bankruptcy protection on Wednesday and stopped accepting new cargo. With its assets frozen, ships were refused permission to offload or take aboard containers because there were no guarantees that tugboat pilots or stevedores would be paid.</p> <p>Hanjin is the world\u2019s seventh-largest container shipper and the news left cargo headed to and from Asia in limbo. There were reports that some Hanjin ships had been seized in China on behalf of creditors.</p> <p>Seeking to contain the fallout, a South Korean court said it would begin proceedings to rehabilitate the carrier \u2013 which would allow Hanjin to take legal action in other countries to keep its ships and other assets from being seized. <br></p> <p>But the court action was seen as mainly procedural and an eventual liquidation of assets was likely, analysts and industry officials said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/16/shipping-emissions-low-carbon-wind-power-climate-change\">Why aren't ships using wind-power to cut their climate footprint?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cUnlike dry cargo, liner shipping is all about marketing and service reliability \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen any large carriers come back from collapse,\u201d said Rahul Kapoor, a director at maritime consultancy Drewry Financial Research Services.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a loss of faith among customers. It\u2019s very unlikely Hanjin can come back from the ashes.\u201d </p> <p>Hanjin\u2019s banks decided to end financial support for the shipper this week and many of its vessels were denied entry to ports or left unable to dock as container lashing providers worried they would not be paid. This included the port of Busan, South Korea\u2019s largest.</p> <p>The Korea International Trade Association said on Thursday that about 10 Hanjin vessels in China have been either seized or were expected to seized by charterers, port authorities or other parties. That adds to one other ship seized in Singapore by a creditor earlier in the week.</p> <p>The collapse comes at a time of high seasonal demand for the shipping industry ahead of the year-end holidays. <br></p> <p>In the US, at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the nation\u2019s busiest port complex, three Hanjin container ships, ranging from about 700 feet to 1,100 feet long, were either sitting offshore or anchored away from terminals on Thursday. A fourth vessel that was supposed to leave Long Beach on Thursday morning remained anchored inside the breakwater.</p> <p>The National Retail Federation, the world\u2019s largest retail trade association, wrote to the US secretary of commerce, Penny Pritzker, and the Federal Maritime Commission chairman, Mario Cordero, on Thursday, urging them to work with the South Korean government, ports and others to prevent disruption.<br></p> <p>Hanjin represents nearly 8% of the trans-Pacific trade volume for the US market and the bankruptcy was having \u201ca ripple effect throughout the global supply chain\u201d that could cause significant harm to both consumers and the US economy, the association wrote.</p> <p>\u201cRetailers\u2019 main concern is that there [are] millions of dollars\u2019 worth of merchandise that needs to be on store shelves that could be impacted by this,\u201d said Jonathan Gold, the group\u2019s vice president for supply chain and customs policy. \u201cSome of it is sitting in Asia waiting to be loaded on ships, some is already aboard ships out on the ocean and some is sitting on US docks waiting to be picked up. It is understandable that port terminal operators, railroads, trucking companies and others don\u2019t want to do work for Hanjin if they are concerned they won\u2019t get paid.\u201d</p> <p>Hanjin has been losing money for years and filed for bankruptcy protection a day after its creditors, led by a state-run bank, refused to prop it up.</p> <p>Other shipping lines were moving to take over some of the Hanjin traffic but at a price, with vessels already are operating at high capacity because of the season. The price of shipping a 40ft container from China to the US jumped by up to 50% in a single day, said Nerijus Poskus, director of pricing and procurement for Flexport, a licensed freight forwarder and customs broker based in San Francisco, who predicted the higher prices would last a month or two.</p> <p>The price from China to west coast ports rose from $1,100 per container to as much as $1,700 on Thursday, while the cost from China to the East Coast jumped from $1,700 to $2,400, he said.</p> <p>Hanjin\u2019s bankruptcy was a major factor, he said, although prices also were affected by an upcoming Chinese national holiday, Golden Week, that would close factories, and by shipping lines sidelining vessels to reduce overcapacity.</p> <p>A weakened economy since the 2008 recession hurt global demand and trade at the same time that steamship lines continued to build more and larger vessels \u2014 immense ships that were conceived as cost-effective when freight costs were higher several years ago.</p> <p>The weaker trade and overcapacity has sent ocean shipping rates plunging in recent years.</p> <p><em>With Reuters and the Associated Press</em></p>",
