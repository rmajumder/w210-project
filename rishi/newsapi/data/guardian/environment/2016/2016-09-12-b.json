  "<p>The future of the programme to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees in Britain could be put at risk by a lack of 10,600 school places and nearly 5,000 suitable homes by 2020, Whitehall\u2019s spending watchdog has warned.</p> <p>The National Audit Office said that the Home Office has enough indicative pledges from 118 local authorities to meet the 20,000 target but that it was essential the pledges materialise into firm offers of support.</p> <p>The NAO said the programme was successfully expanded at speed to reach its initial target of resettling 1,000 Syrian refugees by last Christmas and is underpinned by strong working relationships between central and local government.</p> <p>But an investigation into the resettlement programme by the watchdog found no official figures existed for its total projected costs, and estimated they could reach \u00a31.1bn by March 2020 and up to \u00a31.7bn over its lifetime.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/07/uk-will-accept-up-to-20000-syrian-refugees-david-cameron-confirms\">David Cameron made the commitment</a> last September to resettle 20,000 vulnerable Syrian refugees by 2020. The programme is only open to registered refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Eqypt and Turkey and has been an alternative to participating in the European Union\u2019s emergency relocation scheme for refugees who have reached Europe. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/03/uk-unlikely-to-reach-target-of-resettling-20000-syrian-refugees-by-2020\">UK unlikely to reach target of resettling 20,000 Syrian refugees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By June 2016, 2,659 refugees had arrived in Britain under the scheme \u2013 13% of the overall target. By comparison Germany had resettled more than 19,000 people by May 2016 under its humanitarian assistance programme. In Canada more than 26,000 Syrian refugees were resettled between November 2015 and March 2016, exceeding its 25,000 target.</p> <p>Refugees who have come to Britain on the resettlement programme told the NAO that their experience had been largely positive and they had been warmly welcomed by local communities but uncertainty about their status had caused them some anxiety.</p> <p>Meg Hillier, the chair of the Commons public accounts committee, said that local authorities in the UK should be applauded for stepping up to help Syrian refugees in desperate need.</p> <p> \u201cBut already under-pressure local authorities will have to find over 10,600 childcare and school places and nearly 5,000 homes over the course of the programme as well as social and community support services. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-12T17:02:10/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Syrian refugees in neighbouring countries and in Europe\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-12T17:02:10/embed.html\">Syrian refugees in neighbouring countries and in Europe</a> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe need to be convinced that the government is committed to supporting local authorities in their efforts and is clear about its expectations and funding beyond the first year of a refugee\u2019s stay in the UK,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>The NAO report confirms that most of the costs of each refugee\u2019s first year in Britain is paid for out of the overseas aid budget. A total of \u00a320,530 for each refugee over their five years on the programme is being made available to local authorities.</p> <p>Local authorities told the NAO that the main reason they may not be able to take part in the programme in the future was a possible lack of suitable flats and houses or childcare and school places. An estimated 4,930 extra homes and 10,664 school places for refugees are needed on the programme. The Whitehall spending watchdog said tthat remains a risk to meeting the target.</p> <p>David Simmonds, the chairman of the Local Government Association\u2019s asylum, refugee and migration task group, said: \u201cThe focus must now be on ensuring families are well supported. Councils are and will be helping some of the most vulnerable families fleeing Syria who will need access to ongoing support from local services to cope with injuries, disabilities and to recover from the severe trauma they have experienced.\u201d</p> <p>A government spokesperson said work would continue to turn the pledges of 20,000 places into resettled people: \u201cThis is a humanitarian programme and the level of funding enables local authorities to provide vulnerable refugees with a safe environment and the chance to rebuild their lives. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe ask local authorities to consider carefully whether they have the necessary infrastructure and support networks before a resettlement occurs and we will only resettle individuals to a particular area once we\u2019ve ensured these arrangements, including school places and housing are in place,\u201d they added.</p>",
  "<p>Britain\u2019s employers have refused to panic following the referendum vote, but new jobs are likely to become increasingly scarce as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/12/brexit-talks-may-be-most-complicated-negotiation-ever-says-minister\">concerns over Brexit talks</a> undermine business confidence.</p> <p>Recruitment agency Manpower said that, on the surface, the EU referendum had done little to dampen firms\u2019 immediate recruitment plans. Official figures show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/uk-unemployment-claimant-count-falls-after-brexit\">employment is steady and the number of people claiming jobseeker\u2019s allowance is falling</a>.</p> <p>However, Manpower said the UK jobs market was \u201cskating on thin ice\u201d, with cracks starting to appear in many areas of the economy. </p> <p>A survey of more than 2,100 employers showed that companies in business and financial services, construction and utilities were less optimistic than before the referendum, while prospects also fell in manufacturing. </p> <p>Employers in several sectors said they were concerned that key staff would be affected by a block on EU workers staying in the UK.</p> <p>The survey chimes with a raft of similar reports showing that employers are nervous about Brexit negotiations that could see the UK leave the single market and impose strict limits on EU workers coming to Britain.</p> <p>The ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s said signs of a post-referendum recovery should be treated with caution because a <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/sep/01/uk-factories-bounce-back-brexit-shock-eu-referendum-manufacturing-sector\">rebound in August</a> only made up for <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2016/jul/22/britains-economy-shrinking-at-fastest-rate-since-2009-says-survey\">ground lost in July</a>.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhile the news is encouraging, we believe it has no bearing on the cloudy longer-term outlook for the UK economy,\u201d said Sophie Tahiri, an economist at S&amp;P Global Ratings.<br></p> <p>An expansion over the next few months could be viewed as the economy returning to \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, but this may prove to be premature or even a mirage, she said.</p> <p>\u201cThe uncertainty surrounding the UK\u2019s future outside of the EU \u2013 and the associated economic risks, which we think are pronounced and predominantly skewed to the downside \u2013 will gradually take its toll, particularly on investment, as businesses start dealing with the new Brexit reality,\u201d Tahiri said.</p> <p>Manpower said the government\u2019s austerity cuts were also taking their toll, cutting the number of jobs in the public sector, especially in local government.</p> <p>\u201cConducted in the weeks following the referendum, the survey shows that while UK job prospects have held firm, cracks in the ice are appearing, with six out of nine sectors surveyed reporting a fall in jobs optimism,\u201d the report said. </p> <p>Mark Cahill, Manpower\u2019s UK managing director, said: \u201cAfter the initial shock of Brexit, we\u2019re entering a new phase of prolonged economic uncertainty. The future of freedom of movement across the EU is of particular concern.\u201d</p> <p>Cahill said employers were reliant on European talent to help fill skills shortages, especially in IT and the City. </p> <p>Manpower said financial centres in the EU were circling financial institutions in the City to steal work and skilled staff. It said there had been an 800% increase in applications for finance positions in Dublin since the EU referendum. </p> <p>Many employers in the health service and care sector also rely on foreign workers from the EU and were concerned about filling skills gaps. </p> <p>The study found that job prospects in the public sector had fallen to the weakest level in four years, dragged down by forecasts of further rounds of redundancies in local government.</p>",
  "<p>Global public health experts have called for \u201cfundamental and extensive reform\u201d of the World Health Organisation (WHO) including major outsourcing of key activities, warning that the organisation is already at risk of repeating the mistakes it made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/07/world-health-organisation-lacks-capacity-culture-react-crises-ebola-report\">in handling the Ebola crisis</a>.</p> <p>Writing in <a href=\"http://gh.bmj.com/content/1/2/e000047\">the British Medical Journal (BMJ)</a>, Professor Joel Negin of the University of Sydney and Dr Ranu Dhillon of Harvard Medical School say that only radical reform of the organisation will ensure it can get sufficient funding in the coming years and tackle public health crises.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2016/sep/12/yellow-fever-democratic-republic-congo-msf-vaccinates-710000-people-10-days-kinshasa-in-pictures\">Yellow fever in Congo: MSF vaccinates 710,000 people in 10 days \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Negin describes the current WHO response to an outbreak of drug-resistant tuberculosis in Papua New Guinea as having a \u201csimilar pattern\u201d to the Ebola catastrophe.<br></p> <p>\u201cThey are being slow in their response, not taking it as seriously as some others suggest they should. Some on the ground are saying this is like Ebola with wings, and we have a potentially cavalier attitude from the WHO,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The WHO faced severe public <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/22/experts-criticise-world-health-organisation-who-delay-ebola-outbreak\">criticism for its handling of the Ebola crisis in West Africa</a> in particular over the failure to declare a public health emergency quickly enough. About 11,000 people died in the outbreak, which started in 2013. Dhillon and Negin say that there have been similar failings in public health responses in Sri Lanka in 2009, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/series/rebuilding-haiti\">Haiti in 2010</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/23/south-sudan-state-that-fell-apart-in-a-week\">South Sudan in 2013</a>.</p> <p>At the heart of the vision for reform outlined in the article is a radical change to the way the WHO operates, with vital activities outsourced to other key players in the global health field, such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Global Fund for Aids, TB and Malaria, and frontline humanitarian response groups including M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF).</p> <p>The report says: \u201cWHO should aim to outsource a number of its functions to other global agencies that are already leading the way. This would allow the WHO to focus on a small number of core activities where it has comparative advantage and to coordinate or orchestrate the broader array of global health actors to take on other activities.\u201d<br></p> <p>Negin points to recent calls, following the Ebola epidemic, for the WHO to establish a humanitarian rapid response team. \u201cWhy does this role fall to WHO when organisations such as MSF and the International Rescue Committee already have committed experts willing to travel to crisis zones and systems in place to quickly mobilise a response? These organisations have the credibility, track record and networks to fulfil this role and could further be reinforced instead of trying to create parallel mechanisms within WHO.\u201d<br></p> <p>Responding to the BMJ article, a spokesman for the WHO said that the organisation is already undergoing two waves of reform following public discussion on its functions.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe first [of these] was triggered by the financial situation after the global financial crisis. On top of this, the Ebola outbreak has shown that WHO needed to reform its work on emergency response to become, in addition to its normative and technical mandates, much more operational in the field. </p> <p>\u201cWHO is the world\u2019s best-placed convenor and has been mandated by its 194 member states to build an effective emergencies response and management function. This is currently under way.\u201d<br></p> <p>Much of the WHO\u2019s work in the humanitarian sector is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/ebola-who-government-cuts-delays-in-dealing-with-outbreak\">severely underfunded</a> but Negin believes that without substantial reform and a willingness to use the expertise already existing across the sector, funders will not be prepared to give the large sums that the WHO needs, putting its operations at risk.<br></p> <p>\u201cA lot of donors are more impressed by the actions of other global health actors so they cut their funding for the WHO \u2026 I just want [the organisation] to be more focused on a few things it does well, [such as] orchestrating the global health community expertise. WHO is being bypassed and only with reform can it play the role it should play.\u201d </p>",

He was not at all happy with the sloppy, snoozeful first half, but pretty chuffed at the end:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Only the second half. I was really disappointed about our first 45 minutes. From the start it was not the Everton I like to see. We lost a lot of easy balls. Too many players not on the level in our ball possession. We had difficulties. The second half, that was what I like to see. Good football, good pressing, and we had opportunities to score more goals.</p> <p>I told the players I was really angry about our team. I think we had good defending, that was not the problem. The problem is when we had ball possession in midfield, in front, we lost the ball too many times. You need a good reaction and that reaction came in the second half. I know the players, I know the level they can achieve, and that is the level we saw in the second half, not the first half.</p> <p>I did not have doubts about Lukaku. I think the two goals Romelu scored with Belgium gave him a real boost, and it\u2019s unbelievable how good he can be. I told him the best answer is always on the pitch, and he showed the goals tonight. A great performance.</p> <p>[On Gueye\u2019s performance] Fantastic. Maybe he was the key tonight. He\u2019s that player with a lot of energy, and on the ball he\u2019s quiet and he takes good possession. He\u2019s a key player that you need in midfield and I think it\u2019s a great signing for us.</p> <p>I think we will be one of the teams who fight for European football.

My fitness levels weren\u2019t as good as I wanted them to be. I could have had five tonight. I have to be more of a serial killer if I want to help the team achieve its objective. We have to keep going as a team.</p> </blockquote> <p>And then, Leighton Baines:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m delighted for Rom and for us. We know he\u2019s got goals in him, his goalscoring record is phenomenal. We all know the goals are going to come. He\u2019s shown tonight what he\u2019s all about. I think we started from scratch.

  "<p>Nestled between Chattanooga and Knoxville, Tennessee, the Watts Bar 2 nuclear power plant sits on 1,700 acres in an area friendly to nuclear power. It\u2019s near Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which might be best remembered for its work on <a href=\"http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace-and-war/the-manhattan-project/\">the Manhattan Project</a>. The 1,150-megawatt plant is undergoing testing to go fully online this month, and will join the existing 1,100-megawatt Watts Bar plant, which already provides 650,000 area homes with electricity that emits zero carbon emissions.</p> <p>When Watts Bar 2 is fully operational, it will be the 100th operating nuclear power plant in the US, the country with the <a href=\"http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/usa-nuclear-power.aspx\">most nuclear power stations </a>in the world.</p> <p>Watts Bar 2 is making history for being the first nuclear power plant to be built in the US in two decades. Its existence also happens at a time when the role of nuclear power in the country\u2019s energy future is uncertain. While states such as<a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-diablo-canyon-nuclear-20160621-snap-story.html\"> California are shutting down nuclear power plants</a> over safety concerns, other states see nuclear power playing an important role in their march to replace fossil fuels with energy sources that emit little or no emissions. Georgia and South Carolina, for example, are currently building plants.</p> <p>The number of states that support nuclear is by no means high. Although 29 states have renewable energy goals, until recently, only Indiana and Ohio expressly included nuclear energy in those strategies. But other states are starting to craft plans to subsidize nuclear power generation, which accounts for<a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=427&amp;amp;t=3\"> 20% of the nation\u2019s total electricity</a> production. </p> <p>Unlike coal and natural gas plants that emit carbon emissions while producing electricity, nuclear generates none and accounts for <a href=\"http://www.nei.org/Master-Document-Folder/Backgrounders/Fact-Sheets/Nuclear-Energy-America-s-Low-Carbon-Electricity-Le\">63% of the country\u2019s zero-emission electricity</a>, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), a nuclear power advocacy group. </p> <p>New York recently joined the two other states by including nuclear as part of its clean energy plan, which calls for 50% of its electricity to come from renewable sources by 2030. The move illustrates the difficulties of reaching the goal with renewables such as solar and wind alone. </p> <p>\u201cIf you think of the time it will take to make those renewable additions, we are digging the hole too deep on carbon emissions and losing time. New York did the right thing,\u201d said Paul Meier, an environmental engineer at Blumont Engineering Solutions, specializing in modeling energy and emissions scenarios. </p> <p>The new plan also includes an unusual subsidy program to pay struggling nuclear plant owners more for the power. The subsidy program reflects a major shift in energy planning in an era of historically low natural gas prices, increased availability of renewable energy and new technology development to generate and deliver electricity more efficiently.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc8e206158ae7e17e0c178fe8a54cd2afe986df8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc8e206158ae7e17e0c178fe8a54cd2afe986df8/0_0_2848_2109/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US nuclear reactors.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"741\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US nuclear reactors.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: US Nuclear Regulatory Commission</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>New York experiment</h2> <p>What makes New York\u2019s subsidy program unique is it\u2019s the first time that nuclear power will receive the same environmental and social benefits ascribed to wind and solar, said Gene Grecheck, former president of the American Nuclear Society, a professional organization of engineers and scientists and a current co-chair of a committee at the society that advises state policy makers. </p> <p>Unlike wind and solar energy which receive hefty federal and state subsidies, nuclear providers have not seen the same support despite providing a consistent, large scale and reliable carbon-free energy. The enormous cost of developing a nuclear power plant and safety concerns that grew out of the<a href=\"http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/fukushima-accident.aspx\"> three melting Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactors</a> in Japan in 2011 have made nuclear seem a risky option for addressing climate change. </p> <p>Each nuclear power plant could take around $10bn and 10 years to develop and build, said Matt Crozat, NEI\u2019s senior director of business policy. Justifying that cost is tough at a time when natural gas doesn\u2019t have the same risk profile, and its price is low.</p> <p>The US Energy Information Administration estimates the cost for producing electricity averages $56.40 per megawatt hour at new, basic natural gas plants and $99.70 per megawatt hour at nuclear plants. The production costs, which take into account tax credits, average $50.90 per megawatt hour for wind power and $58.2 per megawatt hour for energy from solar panels. </p> <p>As a result, nuclear is a particularly expensive energy in states that <a href=\"http://www.quantumgas.com/list_of_energy_deregulated_states_in_united_states.html\">allow multiple electricity retailers</a> to do business in the same region. A utility that buys nuclear power will likely have to raise the price it charges and become a less desirable option. In states that allow utilities monopolies, such as California, the utilities need to justify the higher rates when they seek state approval to charge customers more, but they don\u2019t have to worry about competition. </p> <p>Since 2013, about 13 nuclear plants around the country have been or are slated for shutdown, largely because of low natural gas prices and the rise of renewable energy, NEI said. California plans to close its last nuclear power plant in about nine years. Illinois has not come up a plan to avoid early retirement for two plants. Nebraska\u2019s nuclear plant will close, said Edward Kee, chief executive officer of the Nuclear Economics Consulting Group. Ohio is trying to come up with a plan to keep its Davis-Besse nuclear plant going.<br></p> <p>Under the new program, New York is requiring its energy suppliers to start, in April 2017, to pay to <a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-establishment-clean-energy-standard-mandates-50-percent-renewables\">pay a premium for nuclear energy</a> because of its environmental benefit.</p> <p>The higher revenues will make two of New York\u2019s plants profitable and help the third at least break even, said Lela Jgerenaia, US power market analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. In 2015, the average wholesale electricity prices for the two plants ranged from $22.49 per megawatt hour to $39.36 per megawatt hour. The average cost of running nuclear power plants nationwide is about $35 per megawatt hour to run, Kee said. </p> <p>If the three struggling plants in New York closed today, the state\u2019s carbon emissions would increase by more than 31m metric tons during the next two years, resulting in<a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-establishment-clean-energy-standard-mandates-50-percent-renewables\"> public health and other societal costs</a> of at least $1.4bn, the governor\u2019s office said.

Looking out on the cold fresh waters of Encounter Bay, the seaside community of Victor Harbor is located around an hour\u2019s drive south of Adelaide. The town\u2019s way of life and economy revolve around the ocean.</p> <p>In the course of an afternoon, I get some sense of just how wonderful Victor Harbor can be. South Australian <a href=\"http://www.sustainableseafood.org.au/fish.php/1/51/king-george-whiting\">King George whiting </a>and chips for lunch at a pub is followed by a short drive up the coast where, at Bashem Beach, we happen to see a couple of <a href=\"http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/wildlife/animals/whales/southern-right-whale\">southern right whales</a> gambolling on the surface.</p> <p>At one of the lookouts a middle-aged woman tells me with a broad grin that she lives in Adelaide but \u201ckeeps coming back to Victor\u201d because it is the best place in the world.

In his official submission to the Australian Senate, City of Victor Harbor CEO Graeme Maxwell <a href=\"file:///Users/dritter/Downloads/Oil%20or%20Gas%20Production%20-%20sub12.pdf\">warned</a> that BP\u2019s drilling plans represented a high risk to both the values and economy of the coastal community.</p> <p>BP are keeping their own modelling secret, but analysis of oil spill trajectories in the Great Australian Bight commissioned by the Wilderness Society <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/17/bp-application-drill-oil-in-great-australian-bight-rejected-for-second-time\">shows</a> the impact not only extending across South Australia but to Victoria and Tasmania.</p> <p>BP\u2019s recklessness was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/04/bp-reckless-conduct-oil-spill-judge-rules\">major cause</a> of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. In April 2014, Louisiana District Judge Carl Barbier found that their negligence was the single greatest reason for the disaster, showing \u201can extreme deviation from the standard of care and a conscious disregard of known risks\u201d. According to Barbier, BP made \u201cprofit-driven decisions\u201d during the drilling of the well that led to the deadly blowout.</p> <p>Even if there is no catastrophic oil spill, South Australia and the world can\u2019t afford the opening of new fossil fuel extraction if we are to have a chance of keeping global warming to the international target of no more than 1.5 degrees.</p> <p>Climate change means BP\u2019s Bight oil scheme is a threat to all of South Australia. For example the Climate Council has <a href=\"https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/hard-to-swallow-how-climate-change-is-affecting-australian-food\">warned</a> that the iconic Barossa Valley would be at risk from higher temperatures and lower rainfall caused by global warming.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/28/assessment-of-bps-bight-oil-drill-plan-secretive-and-weak-senate-told\">Assessment of BP\u2019s Bight oil drill plan secretive and weak, Senate told</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Adding fiscal insult to environmental injury, it has been <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/mining-energy/bp-could-claim-150pc-deepwater-drilling-cost-in-bight/news-story/2ff3f6446ec35d67966c21ff33923314\">reported</a> that BP may be able to deduct 150% of its planned $1bn Great Australian Bight deep-water drilling program from tax and royalty payments.

We\u2019ve got so many accounts of fans trading blows, people having to dive on their kids to protect them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/11/west-ham-london-stadium-upton-park\">West Ham feeling far from home after London Stadium teething problems | Paul MacInnes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe two big problems are probably that the migration from Upton Park was not handled as well as it could have been and the second is that there is no family enclosure.\u201d</p> <p>A West Ham spokesman said the London Stadium did have a family section, with two blocks reserved in the Bobby Moore stand, and thus complied with Premier League guidelines. \u201cThe club is doing everything possible within its jurisdiction to help provide a safe and enjoyable environment for all supporters,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.whufc.com/News/Articles/2016/September/12-September/Club-Statement\">the club said</a>. \u201cThe club is working hard to move like-minded supporters into areas to enhance their match-day experience.\u201d</p> <p>By offering cheap ticket deals for minors and allowing existing season ticket holders to purchase two extra seats at the new ground, West Ham have 25,000 family ticket holders in the stadium that has a capacity of 57,000. Cheap season ticket deals and the allure of the new stadium have also tempted new fans to buy season tickets. Much of the tension has been sparked because fans who were used to standing for much of the match at Upton Park have been told to sit at the London Stadium.</p> <p>West Ham are believed to be concerned that the standard of stewarding has not been up to scratch and will be seeking answers from LS185, the company used by the stadium operators, Vinci, to handle the task.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the two different factions being separated by a handful of stewards,\u201d said Howlett. \u201cThe majority of the stewards are not trained or not able to act. It\u2019s ludicrous. There are no police inside the stadium. On Saturday it took 15 minutes for a response team to come in.</p> <p>\u201cI have plenty of sympathy with those who want to be allowed to stand. We\u2019ve got this ridiculous issue where the home fans are told to sit, yet the away fans are allowed to stand.\u201d</p> <p>The LLDC is expected to argue privately that Vinci, which also operates the Stade de France, has longstanding experience of overseeing sporting events and that hundreds of thousands of fans have attended other events at the stadium with no problem.</p> <p>West Ham will seek to start relocating fans so they can sit with more like-minded supporters but the process will be far from straightforward. It is unclear what went wrong during the consultation process that was supposed to ensure that fans sat in a part of the stadium with a similar atmosphere to that they were leaving behind at Upton Park.</p> <p>Brady is also expected to push LS185 \u2013 which must pay for all stewarding and security within the stadium under the terms of the controversial tenancy deal signed with West Ham \u2013 to improve stewarding and segregation.</p> <p>The KUMB site has collated anonymous submissions from former Upton Park stewards who claim their expertise and experience was ignored by the new stadium operators. Among their complaints is that stewards are allocated randomly to different parts of the ground and thus unable to build up a rapport over successive matches.</p> <p>Fans have complained that many of the 700-strong army of stewards have little experience of managing football crowds, having been trained to look after other events, and of inadequate security measures.</p> <p>West Ham and LS185 have been asked to draw up a report for Newham Council\u2019s Safety Advisory Group, while the Football Association has also confirmed that it is investigating scenes that saw 10 fans ejected on Saturday and three handed to the police.</p> <p>Ten other West Ham fans had already been banned for life following incidents at earlier games in the Europa League and the Premier League opener against Bournemouth.</p> <p>Both LS185 and West Ham are combing through CCTV footage and clips posted on social media to identify perpetrators.</p> <p>\u201cAs part of our review process, we will be taking steps to strengthen the segregation measures between home and away supporters,\u201d said an LS185 spokesman.</p> <p>\u201cIn-fighting amongst home supporters has also given us cause for concern and we will continue to work closely with West Ham United to identify and take action against the small number of supporters found to be responsible for these incidents.</p> <p>\u201cWe remain determined to ensure that all supporters can enjoy the best possible matchday experience in a safe and secure environment and fully support West Ham\u2019s efforts to migrate supporters attending in family groups to dedicated sections.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The launch of the world\u2019s first large-scale <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wave-tidal-hydropower\">tidal energy</a> farm in Scotland has been hailed as a significant moment for the renewable energy sector.</p> <p>A turbine for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/16/tidal-energy-scheme-northern-scotland\">MeyGen tidal stream project</a> in the Pentland Firth was unveiled outside Inverness in the Scottish Highlands. </p> <p>After the ceremony, attended by Nicola Sturgeon, the turbine, measuring about 15 metres tall (49ft), with blades 16 metres in diameter, and weighing in at almost 200 tonnes, will begin its journey to the project\u2019s site in the waters off the north coast of Scotland between Caithness and Orkney.</p> <p>The turbine will be the first of four to be installed underwater, each with a capacity of 1.5 megawatts (MW), in the initial phase of the project. </p> <p>But the Edinburgh-based developer Atlantis Resources hopes the project which has received \u00a323m in Scottish government funding will eventually have 269 turbines, bringing its capacity to 398MW, which is enough electricity to power 175,000 homes. </p> <p>Maf Smith, the deputy chief executive of the lobby group RenewableUK, said: \u201cNew technology like this will be powering our nation for decades to come.\u201d</p> <p>The first minister called on the UK government to end the uncertainty around subsidies for similar schemes, warning that a failure to do so risks causing irreparable damage to the marine power industry. </p> <p>Sturgeon said: \u201cI am incredibly proud of Scotland\u2019s role in leading the way in tackling climate change and investment in marine renewables is a hugely important part of this. </p> <p>\u201cMeyGen is set to invigorate the marine renewables industry in Scotland and provide vital jobs for a skilled workforce, retaining valuable offshore expertise here in Scotland that would otherwise be lost overseas.\u201d</p> <p>Tim Cornelius, the chief executive of Atlantis Resources, said: \u201cToday marks a historic milestone not just for Atlantis and our project partners, but for the entire global tidal power industry. </p> <p>\u201cIt gives me enormous pride to have reached this juncture after 10 years of tireless work, preparation and planning by everyone associated with this project. This is the day the tidal power industry announced itself as the most exciting new asset class of renewable, sustainable generation in the UK\u2019s future energy mix. </p> <p>\u201cThis is an industry that is creating jobs and Scotland is the undisputed world leader of this high growth sector.\u201d </p> <p>Smith said the MeyGen project is a \u201cmajor step forward in terms of scale\u201d and provides \u201ca great boost in maintaining Britain\u2019s pole position\u201d in the renewables sector. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/29/world-first-for-shetlands-in-tidal-power-breakthrough\">World first for Shetlands in tidal power breakthrough</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe fact that the first turbine was assembled at what was an oil and gas fabrication yard illustrates the opportunities offered by renewables,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cThe official launch of the largest tidal stream energy project in the world marks a significant moment in the commercial development of marine power.\u201d</p> <p>Jenny Hogan, the policy director for the trade body Scottish Renewables, also highlighted the \u201cpotential of tidal generation to make a significant contribution to the UK\u2019s growing need for clean electricity, and to deliver further investment and jobs to the UK\u201d. </p> <p>She added: \u201cHowever, this is still an incredibly young technology, and future development is absolutely dependent on continued support from Holyrood, Westminster and Brussels, who have all played a vitally important part in the growth of the sector to date.\u201d </p> <p>Meanwhile Fabrice Leveque, the climate and energy policy officer at the environmental body WWF Scotland, said: \u201cIt\u2019s great that Scotland is now home to the world\u2019s first large-scale tidal stream farm. It comes hot on the heels of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/29/world-first-for-shetlands-in-tidal-power-breakthrough\">Shetland tidal devices</a> exporting power to the National Grid for the first time and the testing of the world\u2019s most powerful tidal turbine off Orkney. </p> <p>\u201cThis underlines what we already know, that Scotland has 25% of the EU\u2019s offshore wind and tidal power potential.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>\u201cI\u2019m only 49,\u201d David Cameron said as he announced he would be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/12/david-cameron-to-stand-down-as-mp-for-witney\">leaving parliament with immediate effect</a> to \u201cstart to build a life outside Westminster\u201d.<br></p> <p>He spoke about his hope that he would \u201cstill contribute in terms of public service and to the country\u201d, while allies were quoted suggesting Cameron would seek to stay involved in a series of issues close to his heart including anti-corruption efforts, dementia<strong>, </strong>schooling and life chances.</p> <p>There will, however, be more lucrative options available if, at some point in the future, he decides he wants to take them. Free from the restrictions of political life, opportunities to make millions of pounds from directorships, book deals and speechmaking will open up in front of him.</p> <p>Tony Blair\u2019s high-profile, lucrative and controversial post-Downing Street career as a Middle East peace envoy and international business broker \u2013 including a reported \u00a32m a year role for JP Morgan \u2013 looms large over any speculation about what Cameron might do next.</p> <p>Taking corporate money after leaving office has become a well-trodden path. John Major, the prime minister until 1997, was chairman of the European private equity funds of the Carlyle Group until 2004. Gordon Brown\u2019s first role in the private sector was on a global advisory board at the international investment firm Pimco; he gave his fees to charity. </p> <p>The former chancellor Alistair Darling has joined the board of the US bank Morgan Stanley, a more formal role than being an advisor. Cameron could expect to earn as much as \u00a380,000 a year for a non-executive role in a large company. He has some connections in the City, not least with the stockbroker Panmure Gordon, where his late father, Ian, was a director.<br></p> <p>\u201cI think most likely he will be sucked into the corporate world and he will become the non-executive director of three or four companies and perhaps the chairman of one,\u201d said Tim Bell, chair of the public relations firm Bell Pottinger and a former communications adviser to Margaret Thatcher. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll go into banking because I don\u2019t think he likes that world and it is so predictable. It\u2019s what George [Osborne] would do.\u201d</p> <p>Lord Bell also predicted Cameron could be attracted by international roles, including at the United Nations or even the European Union, which would perhaps be the ultimate irony.</p> <p>\u201cHe needs money but not that much,\u201d said Bell. \u201cHis financial needs are not as great as Blair\u2019s were. His wife is rich and the Astor family [Samantha Cameron\u2019s stepfather is Viscount Astor] have plenty of money. I think he is now obsessed with what he thinks about as public service. He talks about it all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Like Blair, who quit parliament as soon as he resigned in 2007, Cameron has wasted little time in moving on. By contrast, Gordon Brown spent five years on the backbenches after he was ousted in 2010 before throwing himself into a new life of book writing and work as a United Nations education envoy. </p> <p>Cameron has decided not to continue his constituency work in Witney, Oxfordshire, and is said not to feel burdened by his role presiding over the historic Brexit vote that ended his premiership. </p> <p>Lord Chadlington, a PR adviser and friend and neighbour of Cameron in Oxfordshire, told the Guardian: \u201cI don\u2019t want to speak pejoratively of Mr Blair, but I think Mr Cameron will think more of what he can do in the charitable field and will think more about other ways in which he could serve. He is still a very young man. He is 49 he could be working for another 20 or 25 years. I think he will take his time over what he does, but it is more likely to be in the charitable area than in other areas [like trade and business].\u201d</p> <p>A series of more obvious opportunities also present themselves, including public speaking, from which Blair has reportedly made as much as \u00a3330,000 a time. Cameron will hope to be able to charge more than his former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who has been seeking up to \u00a332,000 per speech through one agency.</p> <p>It was reported in July that Cameron was planning to \u201cgo dark\u201d, stepping back from public life to write his memoir. The advance for Blair\u2019s autobiography, A Journey, was reported to be \u00a34.6m. </p>",
  "<p>I\u2019m struck by how much of the current debate about grammar schools and their part in promoting social mobility relies on ideas about the past (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-to-end-ban-on-new-grammar-schools\">May opens floodgates on grammars</a>, 9 September). There is a vital role here for historians of education, who are well placed to expose some of the myths of the experience and consequences of the tripartite system as well as account for how those same myths continue to shape popular notions of what an excellent education looks like. The modern state grammar school of the popular imagination, and the secondary modern which was a necessary condition for it, existed over a relatively short period after 1944 and the system was soon (by the late 50s) generally regarded as a mistake. The key thing that promoted social mobility, to my mind, was not the grammar school but the huge expansion of higher education with full financial support by the state. In 1964 Harold Wilson\u2019s Labour government made sure this would happen, and that, in turn, relied upon a national commitment to comprehensive schooling. At that time, only about 4% went to university, only a quarter of whom were female; such numbers could not sustain the expansion of the sector. The evidence is clear: higher expectation of entry to university, financial support and comprehensive education equal social mobility. If we were serious about increasing social mobility (whatever that means today) we would scrap university fees and invest in education from the cradle to the grave. <br><strong>Dr Catherine Burke</strong><br><em>Reader in history of education and childhood, University of Cambridge</em></p> <p>\u2022 The Conservatives\u2019 grammar school spasm is primarily about neither nostalgia nor social mobility. It\u2019s simply about cutting the cost of entrenching educational privilege: tutoring, or even prep school, is cheaper than moving house. Much more interesting is the concept of \u201csocial mobility\u201d itself. This cannot mean what it meant in the halcyon postwar days when a huge expansion in professional and white-collar jobs meant that grammars and an expanding university sector could support a mass journey up the ladder without many of the privileged having to move down. The labour market is very different now \u2013 and an upcoming explosion in automation is set to destroy many of those professional jobs. It\u2019s not clear whether grammar school supporters haven\u2019t thought this through or (more likely, in my view) they have indeed thought it through , and intend the new policy as a way of ratcheting up competition in order to put the children of \u201ctheir\u201d people in the best position to survive the coming employment storm. For the rest of us, the pressing need is to think hard about a better way of organising the social relations of work in the future dispensation. I suggest that \u201cequality\u201d would be a better starting point than \u201cmobility\u201d.<br><strong>Richard Middleton</strong><br><em>Crossmichael, Dumfries and Galloway</em></p> <p>\u2022 Having spent 40 years in secondary education, of which 34 were in mixed non-selective schools (20 years as a head), I soon learned that investment in the first five years of a child\u2019s life is what enables social mobility. The child who starts primary school with a vocabulary of fewer than 100 words and whose family members have had no support from their local Sure Start centre is permanently disadvantaged. If only Theresa May would see the beneficial wisdom of replenishing local authorities\u2019 funding for Sure Start and public health, she would then be investing in the nation\u2019s future in a manner that the reintroduction of selection for 11-year-olds could never achieve. However intrinsically intellectually able they may be, the 15-year-olds whose only learned means of communication is via the three Fs \u2013 feet, fists and four letter words \u2013 have long been condemned to remain on the bottom rung of the social ladder.<br><strong>Anita Higham</strong><br><em>Adderbury, Oxfordshire</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/16/build-on-sure-start-for-families-future\">Build on Sure Start for families\u2019 future | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u2022 Melissa Benn\u2019s article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/06/grammar-schools-social-mobility-theresa-may-early-years\">Grammar schools don\u2019t help social mobility \u2013 we need to start earlier</a>, 6 September) shows that by reopening the debate on grammars, the government is falling at the first hurdle in its stated commitment to equalise life chances. Frank Field\u2019s report presented to the prime minister in 2010, \u201c<a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110120090128/http://povertyreview.independent.gov.uk/media/20254/poverty-report.pdf\">The Foundation Years: Preventing poor children becoming poor adults</a>\u201d, highlighted that there are interventions that can equalise the life chances of poor children before they reach school and are more powerful than the impact of income and class: the mental health of the mother, the bond between mother and child, and the home learning environment.</p> <p>If we are to radically address Britain\u2019s stagnant social mobility, greater resources in the early years need to target not only quality, as Melissa Benn rightly identifies, but the key role of parents in ensuring these first years are the basis for success in adulthood. The Foundation Years Trust was established here in Birkenhead to identify viable approaches to improving the life chances of children before they enter reception class, by engaging the poorest families as leaders in the drive to break the intergenerational cycle of poverty. An effective approach links schools, families and communities, and must be supported and promoted by a government with a genuine commitment to life chances.<br><strong>Anna-Louise van der Merwe</strong><br><em>Trust director, The Foundation Years Trust</em></p> <p>\u2022 It\u2019s refreshing to have Tory policy set out so clearly.

  "<p>Once we had forests and children, like my dad, John, roamed them freely. One day in the 1950s, he encountered a forester (now an extinct species, like the free-roaming child) in a nearby wood.

There were still woods but many became industrial plantations of Sitka spruce \u2013 inhospitable to both children and other species.</p> <p>Coincidentally, my three-year-old, Ted, this week brought home a lump of wood from his <a href=\"http://www.dandelionsnorfolk.com/\" title=\"\">new forest school nursery</a>. He had drilled holes and banged nails into this lump without any maiming because he was under close supervision, as I saw from photos \u2013 which hard-pressed nursery teachers now spend their weekends sending to parents.</p> <p>A free-roaming childhood is gone forever, more because of the volume of traffic than the loss of open woodland, but this need not be a source of despair.</p> <p>Forest schools represent the best of the present and are a sign that we are belatedly recognising woodland as a supreme setting for the learning that comes from free play outdoors.

Helena Smith reports from Athens:</p> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s September. The summer is over and the auditors are back. There is, and has always been, a cyclical quality to Greece\u2019s long-running debt crisis but six years on it is a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu that comes against a background of poverty and immiseration made worse by the passage of time. Talks resumed today with inspectors focusing on accelerating the government\u2019s long-delayed privatisation program and rooting out corruption \u2013 endemic and, as such, a major curse for the economy. </p> <p>Once again Athens has been told in no uncertain terms that the heat is on: failure to implement 15 major prior actions, or reforms, will result in non-disbursement of the next tranche of aid, at \u20ac2.8bn vital for the debt-stricken economy. Publicly, the leftist-led government is keen to complete what will amount to a second review of the economy in the 13 months since it signed up to a third, \u20ac86bn bailout as soon as possible. Finance ministry sources speak of September 29, when the next Euro working group is held, as a deadline.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7d7bb839be19359b56966624f131465e79a0312\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7d7bb839be19359b56966624f131465e79a0312/0_117_2554_1533/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexis Tsipras.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexis Tsipras.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexandros Avramidis/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Creditors have also made clear that debt relief negotiations \u2013 central for real economic recovery to even begin \u2013 can only be countenanced once further austerity is enforced. Such policies would include abolishment of protection laws against mass lay-offs \u2013 a huge red line for the ruling Syriza party.</p> <p>And prime minister Alexis Tsipras, once the pin-up for anti-austerians Europe-wide, is feeling the heat. Latest polls have repeatedly shown the leftists to be trailing the main opposition centre right New Democracy party with approval ratings for Tsipras himself plummeting. One recent survey showed only 19% of Greeks viewed the leader favorably with a massive 85% dissatisfied with a government they had initially voted in to dismantle policies blamed for run-away unemployment and soaring impoverishment. The leftists\u2019 penchant for replacing cuts with taxes has exacerbated the disgruntlement. All of which is why few believe this latest chapter will end anytime soon - with ever growing numbers believing that Greece will only regain competitiveness when it eventually leaves the eurozone. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d6cf10e4b013613fffc863\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T16:01:43.283Z\">5.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished down 76.05 points or 1.12% at 6700.90, its lowest level since the start of August</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax was down 1.34% at 10,431.77</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed 1.15% lower at 4439.80</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.84% to 16,840.28</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.76% lower at 8866.6</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.68% to 557.25</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 63 points or 0.36%.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T16:02:01.448Z\">at 5.02pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d6cb33e4b013613fffc852\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T15:40:11.973Z\">4.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Markets recover from post-Brexit lows</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After early plunges this morning, European markets have recovered from their worst levels.</p> <p>For much of the day the FTSE 100 was suffering its worst day since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote in June, with a similar story on the Dax.</p> <p>Much of the falls came after Friday\u2019s comments from Federal Reserve members suggesting a US rate rise was possible next week, with the news of Hillary Clinton\u2019s illness adding to the uncertainty.</p> <p>But Wall Street regained its poise and in turn gave a lift to European markets.

This afternoon\u2019s speech from Fed\u2019s Brainard represents the final appearance before the pre-meeting blackout period.

  "<p>On Sunday afternoon, Hillary Clinton\u2019s doctor revealed that she had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-leaves-911-ceremony-after-feeling-overheated\">diagnosed with pneumonia</a> two days earlier. The admission came after she was filmed stumbling into her van after leaving a 9/11 memorial ceremony early. Pneumonia is a serious illness, but it can be treated with antibiotics.</p> <p>The incident divided opinion along familiar lines: for the Trumpian right it was confirmation that Hillary is sickly, perhaps far more than she lets on. Some Clinton supporters railed against the press\u2019s obsession with her health, arguing that it feeds conspiracy theories \u2013 and why on earth should it matter?</p> <p>Of course a presidential candidate\u2019s health matters. Both Trump and Clinton can rightly expect scrutiny of their records and fitness for office. But the press also has a duty to place medical problems in perspective.</p> <p>The effects of the illness may last a few more days, or a month. And the coming hours will be utterly dominated by coverage of it. But the next president is going to be elected for at least four years. Hillary Clinton is sick right now, but her opponent has flaws that won\u2019t disappear with a course of pills. Here\u2019s a reminder of some of the factors that should weigh heavier than a bout of pneumonia. </p> <h2>Donald Trump\u2019s attitude to climate change</h2> <p>The Republican candidate has said he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/26/donald-trump-environmental-policy-climate-change-keystone-xl\">withdraw</a> from the Paris deal on cutting emissions, and in 2014 referred to the scientific consensus on global warming as \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/418542137899491328?lang=en\">bullshit</a>\u201d, stating that \u201cour planet is freezing\u201d. The <a href=\"http://www.climatecentral.org/gallery/graphics/the-10-hottest-years-on-record\">10 hottest years on record</a> have all occured since 1998. </p> <h2>Donald Trump\u2019s religious test for migrants</h2> <p>In December 2015, Trump called for \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d. Since then his position has shifted somewhat; in June he <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-06-25/trump-says-immigration-plan-wouldn-t-feature-mass-deportations\">said</a> \u201cI want people that have bad thoughts out\u201d and his finance chairman <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/24/politics/donald-trump-muslim-ban-election-2016/\">explained</a>: \u201cIt is about Muslims from countries that support terrorism.\u201d The RNC chairman, Reince Priebus, has denied that this would amount to a religious test. </p> <h2>Donald Trump\u2019s support of torture</h2> <p>In February, Trump <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2016/07/trump-torture/\">said</a> \u201cTorture works. OK, folks?\u201d and has endorsed waterboarding, which was banned by George W Bush in 2006, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/28/donald-trump-ohio-rally-isis-torture-tpp-rape\">saying</a>: \u201cI like it a lot. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s tough enough.\u201d</p> <h2>Donald Trump\u2019s attitude towards freedom of the press</h2> <p>He argued that libel laws should be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/26/trump-pledges-curb-press-freedom-libel-laws-first-amendment\">expanded</a>, so that \u201cwhen the New York Times or the Washington Post writes a hit piece, we can sue them\u201d.</p> <h2>Donald Trump\u2019s attitude towards women</h2> <p>Trump has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/08/05/donald-trump-on-women-sex-marriage-and-feminism/?utm_term=.6feaf23fe1e0\">written</a> that \u201cWomen have one of the great acts of all time. The smart ones act very feminine and needy, but inside they are real killers.\u201d He has criticized female public figures for their appearance and retweeted the question: \u201cIf Hillary Clinton can\u2019t satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy America?\u201d before deleting it. He also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQfJpTUYr2Q\">stated</a> that \u201cthere has to be some form of punishment\u201d for women who have abortions (he subsequently <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-03-30/trump-says-abortion-ban-should-carry-punishment-for-women\">released a statement</a> that, where abortion was illegal, doctors, not women, should bear criminal responsibility). </p> <h2>The prospect of Donald Trump as commander in chief</h2> <p>Retired General John Allen has <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/john-allen-donald-trump-226479\">warned of</a> a \u201ccivil military crisis where the military could be ordered to conduct illegal activities\u201d if Trump is elected. Former CIA director, Michael Hayden, has expressed concern about how \u201cerratic\u201d Trump is, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/michael-hayden-trump-military-226606\">saying</a>: \u201cHe\u2019s inconsistent. And when you\u2019re the head of a global superpower, inconsistency, unpredictability, those are dangerous things. They frighten your friends and they tempt your enemies. And so I would be very, very concerned.\u201d The Trump campaign <a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/290227-trump-camp-denies-questioning-of-us-nuclear-policy\">denies reports</a> that, referring to nuclear weapons, he asked a foreign policy expert, \u201cIf we have them, why can\u2019t we use them?\u201d three times during a briefing. </p> <h2>Donald Trump\u2019s donations to public officials<br></h2> <p>Trump told the Wall Street Journal in 2015: \u201cAs a businessman and a very substantial donor to very important people, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.\u201d Trump donated $25,000 to Florida\u2019s attorney general, Pam Bondi, a few days after her office said it would review allegations made against Trump University in 2013. The review was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/10/politics/pam-bondi-donald-trump-donation/\">ended</a> without any action being taken. Bondi denies any impropriety. </p> <h2>Mike Pence\u2019s beliefs</h2> <p>The man who will be a heartbeat away from the presidency also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/07/14/watch-mike-pence-trumps-likely-vp-pick-question-global-warming-and-demur-on-evolution/?utm_term=.f3b8fe5e6687\">questions</a> the expert consensus on global warming, saying the \u201cscience is very mixed\u201d. He has refused to say he\u2019s convinced by the theory of <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2016/jul/29/jerry-brown/jerry-brown-makes-true-claim-mike-pence-denies-evo/\">evolution</a>. He voted against measures designed to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation and opposed equal marriage. </p>",

Loyalty, to the party and its leader, counts a great deal for him, more perhaps than it does for some of his predecessors. (Sir John Major has been broadly loyal to his successors, but Major\u2019s two Tory PM predecessors, Margaret Thatcher and Edward Heath, were notorious for their unwelcome backseat driving.) And today Cameron has been quite explicit about why he is leaving the Commons; while stressing that he generally supported Theresa May, he also said that he had his \u201cown views about different issues\u201d and that he did not want to be a \u201cdistraction\u201d.</p> <p>By distraction he meant \u201crebel\u201d. He is not going to be able to honestly support May on everything, and so he would rather leave the Commons than stay on and turn into Ted Heath. (As a former prime minister it will still be interesting to know what he thinks about government policy, but his views will be less relevant if he is no longer an MP and, crucially, he will not be expected to vote for measures he does not back.)</p> <p>Cameron insisted that this was not just about grammar schools and that his decision had nothing to do with \u201cany one individual issue\u201d. (See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/12/tuc-leader-says-labour-must-start-focusing-on-what-voters-want-politics-live?page=with:block-57d6c532e4b08465d44ffe08#block-57d6c532e4b08465d44ffe08\"> 4.25pm.) </a>This is almost certainly true. Here are five issues that probably helped Cameron come to the view that he was best off no longer serving as an MP with May as prime minister.<br></p> <p><strong>1 - Grammar schools.</strong> Cameron says there are \u201cvery many good things\u201d in May\u2019s grammar school policy, but his comments (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/12/tuc-leader-says-labour-must-start-focusing-on-what-voters-want-politics-live?page=with:block-57d6c532e4b08465d44ffe08#block-57d6c532e4b08465d44ffe08\">4.25pm)</a> also make it clear that he has strong reservations too. That\u2019s not surprising. \u201cIn 18 years of Conservative government, we didn\u2019t create a whole big number of grammar schools because parents fundamentally don\u2019t want their children divided into sheep and goats at the age of 11,\u201d <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6658613.stm\">he said in 2007.</a> There is nothing to suggest he has changed his mind.</p> <p><strong>2 - Faith school expansion.</strong> The grammar school aspect of May\u2019s policy is the one that has received the most attention, but the faith school proposals are very contentious too. Today\u2019s Times carries an article by Clare Foges, a former Cameron speechwriter, saying that allowing faith schools to expand without having to mix their intake would produce \u201cmore mono-cultural, mono-faith, mono-racial schools. More bubbles. More parallel lives\u201d. (See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/12/tuc-leader-says-labour-must-start-focusing-on-what-voters-want-politics-live?page=with:block-57d67696e4b07ac3d446b52c#block-57d67696e4b07ac3d446b52c\"> 10.39am.)</a> Foges was publishing her own views, not Cameron\u2019s, but he resisted the proposal that May is adopting when he was prime minister and so he may well agree with his former aide.</p> <p><strong>3 - Europe. </strong>After Britain voted for Brexit Cameron told MPs that it would be up to his successor to decide what relationship the UK formed with the EU but that he thought \u201cit is in all our interests, whatever the eventual decision, to make sure we are as close as possible economically to our friends and partners in the European Union\u201d. <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2016-06-27/debates/1606275000001/OutcomeOfTheEUReferendum#contribution-16062713000091\">Put more bluntly, \u201cthe closer, the better\u201d, he said. </a>With David Davis, the Brexit minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57cda570e4b0c2a396c06e89#block-57cda570e4b0c2a396c06e89\">virtually saying the UK will have to leave the single market</a>, and Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/11/boris-johnson-backs-brexit-pressure-campaign-change-britain\">backing what is seen as a \u201chard\u201d Brexit campaign</a>, Cameron may have already concluded his advice will be ignored.</p> <p><strong>4 - China. </strong>Cameron\u2019s government made forging a strong partnership with China a key priority. May\u2019s decision to postpone the decision to give the new Hinkley Point power station project the go-ahead shows she takes a very different view.</p> <p><strong>5 - Reshuffle. </strong>May was always going to appoint her own cabinet and ministerial team, but the extent to which she was willing to purge the Notting Hill Cameroons took many MPs by surprise. It would be surprising if Cameron was not at least a little disappointed about the way figures like George Osborne and Oliver Letwin were treated.</p> <p>One other point: not for the first time, Cameron is living up to his \u201cheir to Blair\u201d reputation. Former prime ministers always used to stay on in the Commons at least until the subsequent election because triggering a byelection just to avoid the fate of having to be a backbencher seemed indulgent. But Tony Blair set a new trend when he decided to resign from the Commons on the day he left Downing Street.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T16:18:42.499Z\">at 5.18pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d6c532e4b08465d44ffe08\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T15:25:21.350Z\">4.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Cameron hints he does not fully support May's plans for new grammar schools</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is a lightly edited account of the rest of Chris Ship\u2019s interview with <strong>David Cameron. </strong>I posted a transcript of the first half of it a<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/12/tuc-leader-says-labour-must-start-focusing-on-what-voters-want-politics-live?page=with:block-57d6be05e4b013613fffc7f9#block-57d6be05e4b013613fffc7f9\">t 3.50pm.</a></p> <p>(I have paraphrased some of the questions, but not the answers, obviously.)</p> <p><em>Q: You were opposed to a return to grammar schools.

I wish her well, I wish the government well.</p> <p>In a way there\u2019s a link to the decision to resign as prime minister. The country made a decision, a decision I advised against but nonetheless the decision has been made. I want the government to successfully pursue that decision and to get it right. And as a result I think not being a backbencher but leaving parliament is the right thing to do.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Q: Do you or do you not support the expansion of grammar schools?</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>DC:</strong> There\u2019s very many good things in the policy. We actually when I was prime minister agreed to the expansion of grammar schools in areas where they already where. We set up sixth forms that were selective in our big cities as free schools, so lots of merit in the policy. But frankly I don\u2019t want to get into the whys and wherefores of this individual policy ...</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Q: This suggests you simply do not support the expansion of grammar schools. </em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>DC:</strong> I think there\u2019s some merit in the policy that is being put forward. My announcement today is not about grammar schools. There\u2019s no connection with grammar schools, it\u2019s purely one of timing. My view is, as I\u2019ve said, I don\u2019t want to be the distraction and diversion that the former prime minister inevitably is on the backbenches.</p> <p>So it\u2019s with a heavy heart because I love this part of the world, I\u2019ve loved being an MP, I\u2019m going to go on living here. Being a constituency MP is a great and fulfilling job but I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the best thing is to stand down.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Cameron hints he does not fully support Theresa May\u2019s plans to open new grammar schools.</strong></li> </ul> <p><em><strong>Q</strong>: You will be remembered mostly for taking this country out of the EU, won\u2019t you?</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>DC</strong>: I\u2019m sure I will be remembered for keeping that pledge to hold areferendum when many people thought that promise would never be kept but I hope that people will look back at the 11 years I was leader of the Conservative party and six years as prime minister of our country as a time when we did create a stronger economy \u2013 1,000 people found work for every day I was prime minister \u2013 and we did make some important social reforms ... and the Conservative party went from being in the doldrums and getting beaten to being a modernising winning force in British politics. But the historians will have to work all that out. I obviously now am going to be looking at a new life, but I\u2019m only 49 \u2013 I hope I can still contribute in terms of public service and contribute to our country.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Q: What will your new life outside the Commons involve? </em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>DC</strong>: I haven\u2019t made firm decisions, I need to look at all of that. The only firm decision I\u2019ve made is to leave the House of Commons and stop being an MP \u2013 as I say, with a heavy heart because I\u2019ve loved the jobs but I don\u2019t think it works for a former prime minister who resigned in my circumstances and with all the new government needs to do.</p> <p>Issues for the future. I\u2019ll decide them in the future and, hopefully, as I say, continue to make some service and some public service contribution to this country. I want to continue campaigning on the local, national and indeed international issues that were part of my prime ministership where I think we made some good progress. There\u2019s still a lot more to be done.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T15:41:03.440Z\">at 4.41pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d6c470e4b08465d44ffe04\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T15:07:54.463Z\">4.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The BBC is now broadcasting further extracts from the David Cameron interview with ITV\u2019s Chris Ship.</p> <p>Cameron claims that his resignation announcement has not been prompted by opposition to the government\u2019s grammar school plans, but he falls short of endorsing them in full.</p> <p>I will post the quotes shortly.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d6c303e4b08465d44ffdfc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T15:00:52.045Z\">4.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague <strong>Rowena Mason</strong> has posted this from Twitter following the Number 10 lobby briefing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rowenamason/status/775348174533734400\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Theresa May says she was proud to serve under Cameron, thanks for work on economy, social reform.

Here are the main points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Downing Street disowned <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/10/business-leaders-politicians-attack-fox-over-lazy-accusations\">Liam Fox\u2019s claim about British business being \u201ctoo lazy and too fat\u201d to succeed at exporting.</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/10/business-leaders-politicians-attack-fox-over-lazy-accusations\"> </a> Asked if Theresa May agreed with Fox, the prime minister\u2019s spokeswoman said her view was that the government needed to make sure \u201cthat British businesses are seizing the opportunities available\u201d.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The spokeswoman suggested that the creation of a new cross-party, pro-Brexit pressure group, Change Britain, was unnecessary.</strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/11/boris-johnson-backs-brexit-pressure-campaign-change-britain\"> Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, is backing the group</a>, which is seen as campaigning for a \u201chard\u201d Brexit and against any backsliding by the government. Asked if May welcomed this, the spokeswoman said: </li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government is absolutely committed to delivering on the decision of the British people to leave the EU ... The government and the cabinet are already getting on with it.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Number 10 brushed aside the TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady\u2019s claim that not guaranteeing EU citizens resident in the UK the right to stay after Brexit was \u201cimmoral\u201d</strong>. Asked about this, the spokeswoman said that May hoped to be in a position to let them stay and that the only circumstances in which they would not be allowed to stay would be \u201cif European countries were not able to make commitments with regard to the position of British nationals\u201d.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The spokeswoman claimed the government was \u201cmaking progress\u201d in terms of its commitment to take in Syrian refugees, including vulnerable children.</strong> More than 120 unaccompanied child refugees have come to the UK since the start of the year, she said, and more than 30 children have been admitted since the Immigration Act became law in May under the provisions of that legislation. The UK had already committed to resettle 20,000 vulnerable refugees from camps near to Syria over a five-year period and to take 3,000 children and their families from the region under the Children at Risk scheme. The Immigration Act set out measures to take in unaccompanied refugee children who were already in Europe before March 20 this year, \u201cwhere it is in their best interests\u201d, but set no figure on the numbers who might be allowed into the UK. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Downing Street said the Ministry of Justice was now investigating <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3784457/Huge-rise-debt-judgements-against-families.html\">today\u2019s Daily Mail allegations about thousands of country court judgments being issued against people without their knowledge and without full court hearings.</a> </strong>\u201cWe have a strong legal system in this country and it\u2019s important that it cannot be abused,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cThe Ministry of Justice is now taking forward work looking into this specific issue.\u201d</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Aung San Suu Kyi, the Myanmar leader, is in London for talks and is meeting Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, this afternoon.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Philip Hammond, the chancellor, is meeting British exporters this afternoon as part of a series of meetings he is holding ahead of the autumn statement.</strong></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"407681f80a1bae10bf6169f8a4e0275981435300\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/407681f80a1bae10bf6169f8a4e0275981435300/0_146_2556_1532/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Number 10.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Number 10.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Back / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T11:23:01.475Z\">at 12.23pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d67bbde4b08465d44ffc5d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T09:57:50.196Z\">10.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/about-tuc/congress/congress-2016/tuc-general-secretary-frances-o%E2%80%99grady%E2%80%99s-address-congress-2016\">the full text of Frances O\u2019Grady\u2019s speech to the TUC conference. </a>I will post a summary in due course, but first I\u2019m off to the Number 10 lobby briefing.

Previously, over-subscribed new schools could only select 50 per cent of pupils on the basis of religion. Now it is to be 100 per cent. More mono-cultural, mono-faith, mono-racial schools. More bubbles. More parallel lives.</p> <p>It would seem the government has been backed into a corner on this. The Conservative manifesto promise is to create 500 new free schools. The hope was that a significant chunk would come from Catholic schools, but the church resisted. It takes issue with the 50 per cent cap on religious selection. Apparently, it is against canon law \u201cfor a Catholic bishop not to prioritise the admission of Catholic pupils\u201d. The chief rabbi also resisted the 50 per cent cap.</p> <p>I find secularist harrumphing about the pernicious influence of religion pretty ridiculous on the whole, but isn\u2019t there something rather ugly about this demand that \u201cwe take care of our own\u201d to the exclusion of others? Doesn\u2019t it stick in the craw that the state will pay for this discrimination? Government guidance says it is unacceptable for schools to \u201cpromote discrimination against people or groups on the basis of their belief\u201d. So, not OK to promote it, OK to practise it.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2016/09/tim-farron-a-plea-to-conservative-mps-its-neither-in-britains-interest-nor-yours-to-back-mays-grammar-school-plan.html\">Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, uses an article for ConservativeHome to urge Tory MPs to block the proposals.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Here is the killer stat: the Sutton Trust found that less than three per cent of grammar kids were on free lunches, compared with 20 per cent across the country.</p> <p>Theresa May addresses this by talking of \u201cinclusive grammar schools\u201d. But this is a contradiction: grammars exclude. Some complicated two-tier entry taking into account socio-economic background will have MPs post-bags brimming with constituents complaining that their child was denied a place despite gaining a higher mark than another child.</p> <p>And however \u201cfairly\u201d you try to select, you won\u2019t escape the fundamental unfairness of deciding ability at the age of 11. Streaming within schools works because it allows flexibility as children flourish at different stages and in different subjects. Grammars stream people for entire school careers, and beyond.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d66fd2e4b07ac3d446b50a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T09:06:10.631Z\">10.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Frances O\u2019Grady,</strong> the TUC general secretary, is addressing the TUC conference now.</p> <p>You can watch a live feed <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/about-tuc/congress/congress-2016/congress-2016-watch-live\">here.</a></p> <p>I will post a summary of the speech when I\u2019ve seen the text.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d66d28e4b07ac3d446b501\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T09:02:01.779Z\">10.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It is one year to the day since Jeremy Corbyn was elected Labour leader.</p> <p>Obviously the fact that 75% of Labour MPs backed a motion expressing no confidence in him suggests that Corbyn\u2019s first year as leader has not been an unalloyed triumph.

  "<p>Enoch Powell\u2019s famous remark that all political careers end in failure was never so apposite as in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/12/david-cameron-to-stand-down-as-mp-for-witney\" title=\"\">the case of David Cameron</a>. Three months ago Cameron commanded British politics. He was expecting to be prime minister until 2019. It\u2019s still a mere two months <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/12/david-cameron-chairs-final-cabinet-before-theresa-may-enters-no-10\" title=\"\">since he left No 10</a> after six years in the job.</p> <p>Now he is heading for the exit from Westminster altogether, quitting as a backbench MP after initially promising to stay on until the next election. The air has gone out of his career with astonishing speed. And he\u2019s not yet 50.</p> <p>Ostensibly Cameron is quitting the Commons because he says it is hard for a former prime minister to be an effective MP for his Witney constituents. There is some truth in that. The constituency demands on MPs are far greater than they once were. It\u2019s not so long ago that some Tory MPs only visited the constituency once every four or five years at election time. Nowadays an MP is a 365-days a year citizen\u2019s advice worker, mediator and activist on behalf of tens of thousands of people who have instant access to his or her email address.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/12/david-cameron-to-stand-down-as-mp-for-witney\">David Cameron to resign as MP for Witney with immediate effect</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet as he prepares to write his memoirs for what is doubtless an extremely tidy sum, it\u2019s unlikely that Cameron warms to the task of sorting out constituents\u2019 complaints about welfare payments, the need for a Chipping Norton bypass, A&amp;E closures and the rest. And as a new inductee into the rootless and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2009/apr/10/tony-blair-speaking-fees\" title=\"\">roaming global elite</a> of former political leaders, Cameron will already know that he has a choice between making a black-tie speech in Chicago for a six-figure sum and giving out the prizes at the annual Burford Conservative harvest festival.</p> <p>The bigger truth is that Cameron is going because he gambled his career and reputation on winning the European referendum \u2013 and lost. He lost because he has always been a short-termist and a tactical leader. He thought he could win the referendum on the back of his own communication skills and without building up the pro-European case in his party and in the country in his decade as leader of a largely anti-European party. The UK voted for Brexit because two out of three Tory voters voted to leave. Cameron was not strong enough to stop that from happening.</p> <p>Just after the referendum, I had a brief private exchange with Cameron. He said it was very disappointing not to get the remain case over the line, as he put it. It was better to quit as prime minister, he added, because politics shouldn\u2019t be about how long you stay out in the middle. Later I wondered whether Tony Blair, Gordon Brown or Margaret Thatcher would have used a self-deprecating cricket metaphor the way Cameron did. Almost certainly not. They would have talked about destiny, their cause and history. But that isn\u2019t the&#xa0;Cameron way.</p> <p>The prospect of sitting on the backbenches as Theresa May trashes much of his record probably holds very limited appeal for him, too. Although his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/10/david-cameron-intends-stand-re-election-mp-in-2020\" title=\"\">initial commitment to stay on</a> as an MP until 2020 raised the prospect of the former prime minister playing a significant role from the backbenches in the unfolding politics of Britain\u2019s slide towards Brexit, it is hardly surprising that his heart is not now in it. May has already begun to redefine Cameron\u2019s Toryism in dramatically new ways. Like Wotan in Wagner\u2019s Ring, Cameron clearly judges that, once the spear that symbolises his power has been broken, it is time to slip away quickly and without fuss.</p> <p>It\u2019s a loss to public life \u2013 politics needs veterans, whether they are wise or silly. But it is hardly unexpected. Modern party leaders, whether prime ministers or opposition leaders, tend to leave the stage once the spell of their own power is broken. Perhaps to an extent they are the victims of their own hubris. But probably they are just plain knackered too. The disciplines of life in No 10 are ferocious as well as exciting, and once the rhythm is broken, the pace slackens,&#xa0;and audiences no longer hang on your every word, it is only human to want to make a clean break. It\u2019s what most prime ministers of the modern age have done.</p> <p>It all stands in striking contrast to an earlier time. William Gladstone was prime minister at 84. Churchill at 80. Among more recent premiers Jim Callaghan and Margaret Thatcher were well into their 60s by the time they lost power and left the Commons. Modern British politics still hasn\u2019t found a useful place for the current crop of younger retired leaders, some of whom, like Blair and Cameron, leave Downing Street with at least 20 years of the average working life ahead of them. Perhaps Cameron will cope with retirement better than the ever restless Blair. It\u2019s a fairly safe bet that he will.</p>",
  "<p>Britain\u2019s post-referendum recovery may prove to be a \u201cmirage\u201d, a leading credit rating agency has warned, as uncertainty about the country\u2019s relationship with the European Union persuades companies to delay staff hiring and investment. </p> <p>Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s said signs of recovery should be treated with caution because a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/uk-factories-bounce-back-brexit-shock-eu-referendum-manufacturing-sector\">rebound in August</a> only made up for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/22/britains-economy-shrinking-at-fastest-rate-since-2009-says-survey\">ground lost in July</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the news is encouraging, we believe it has no bearing on the cloudy longer-term outlook for the UK economy,\u201d said Sophie Tahiri, an economist at S&amp;P Global Ratings.<br></p> <p>Tahiri said the economy recovered in August after the Bank of England cutinterests rate to 0.25% and deployed a range of other measures to stimulate an economy that appeared to be heading for recession.</p> <p>\u201cA barrage of new data for August suggests that the economic hit may have been a temporary reaction.

  "<p>Tesco faces being fined after admitting responsibility for a fuel leak at one of its petrol stations that polluted a 10-mile stretch of river.</p> <p>Thousands of litres of diesel leaked underground for up to two days from a pump at one of the supermarket\u2019s petrol stations, seeping into a tributary that feeds into the river Irwell in east Lancashire, in an area popular with anglers. </p> <p>By the time engineers at the firm\u2019s Haslingden branch managed to shut off the leak, the spilled fuel is thought to have contaminated a stretch of the river as far as the town of Radcliffe near Manchester.

Their ability to enhance their families\u2019 and their own welfare by spacing and limiting the number of their children is often thwarted by opposition to birth control on the part of organised religious bodies such as the Catholic church.</p> <p>Advocating family planning is not \u201celiminating the poor\u201d. It is simply a matter of enabling poor people in developing countries to exercise the choices available to rich people everywhere, including Catholics. Had this problem been addressed decades ago, a great deal of suffering could have been averted. Moreover, the human population and concomitant environmental crisis would not have reached anything like current levels.<br><strong>Jeanne Openshaw</strong><br><em>Brighton</em></p> <p>\u2022 Of course the developed countries consume too much, but that does not negate the fact that there are too many people to survive even at a lowered consumption level. We are using up the world\u2019s resources at an astounding rate. Even if everyone in the world limited their fish consumption to once a week (I don\u2019t eat other kinds of meat), the oceans would still be hovering on depletion. To say that population is not a problem on a finite planet is ridiculous.<br><strong>Katherine DelaNoy</strong><br><em>Eagle, Colorado, USA</em></p> <p>\u2022 The pope\u2019s new views on the environment are indeed welcome. Any debate on the environment that focuses solely on overconsumption by rich countries is still missing out the role played by rapid population growth in creating inequality and environmental degradation. Very poor countries such as Niger could develop faster if population growth were halted. Gains are transitory when any improvement they win, such as more children in school, is followed by a rapid rise in the number of children needing schooling. Similarly, when better farming practices bring more food, they still do not bring more land for everyone to live on.

Whether they like it or not, the unspoken message is heard loud and clear: \u201cWe\u2019re carrying on flying.\u201d</p> <p>We need trend-setters, not jet-setters. Leaders who refuse to fly, saying why. The elephant in the room is flying. Please, \u201cleaders\u201d, no more acting dumbo about that gas-guzzling jumbo. <br><strong>Dave Hampton</strong><br><em>Marlow, Buckinghamshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Candidates for O-level maths exams in the 1950s were advised to show their working in order to maximise their marks.

  "<p>Earlier this summer, I found myself in the middle of a lively debate because of my work on climate change and the ethics of having children.</p> <p>NPR correspondent Jennifer Ludden profiled some of my work in procreative ethics with an article entitled, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/08/18/479349760/should-we-be-having-kids-in-the-age-of-climate-change\">Should we be having kids in the age of climate change?</a>,\u201d which summarized my published views that we ought to consider adopting a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319338699\">small family ethic</a>\u201d and even pursuing <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/19933914/Population_Engineering_and_the_Fight_against_Climate_Change\">fertility reduction efforts</a> in response to the threat from climate change. Although environmentalists for decades have worried about overpopulation for many good reasons, I suggest the fast-upcoming thresholds in climate change provide uniquely powerful reasons to consider taking real action to slow population growth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/02/does-climate-change-make-it-immoral-to-have-kids\">Does climate change make it immoral to have kids? | Dave Bry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clearly, this idea struck a nerve: I was overwhelmed by the response in my personal email inbox as well as op-eds in other media outlets and over 70,000 shares on Facebook. I am gratified that so many people took the time to read and reflect on the piece.</p> <p>Having read and digested that discussion, I want to continue it by responding to some of the most vocal criticisms of my own work, which includes research on \u201c<a href=\"http://philpapers.org/rec/HICPEA\">population engineering</a>\u201d \u2013 the intentional manipulation of human population size and structure \u2013 I\u2019ve done with my colleagues, Jake Earl and Colin Hickey.</p> <p>In short, the varied arguments against my views \u2013 that I\u2019m overreacting, that the economy will tank and others \u2013 haven\u2019t changed my conviction that we need to discuss the ethics of having children in this era of climate change.</p> <p>Some comments \u2013 those claiming climate change is a hoax, devised by those who wish to control the world\u2019s resources \u2013 are not worth responding to. Since <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/consensus-confirmed-over-90-of-climate-scientists-believe-were-causing-global-warming-57654\">97% of all relevant experts</a> cannot convince climate change skeptics of the basic scientific facts, then nothing I say will change their minds.</p> <p>Other concerns, however, do require a response. Many people reacted to my work on procreation ethics by saying climate change will not be so bad, and so curbing individual desires, such as having children, in its name is unnecessary fear-mongering.</p> <p>In my work, I suggest that 1.5-2 degrees Celsius warming over preindustrial levels will be \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cvery bad\u201d, while 4 degrees C will be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d and will leave large segments of the Earth \u201clargely uninhabitable by humans\u201d. Here is a very brief survey of the evidence for those claims based on what I consider reputable sources.</p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/climatechange/publication/turn-down-the-heat\">1.5-2 degrees C</a>, a World Bank report predicts an increase in extreme weather events, deadly heat waves and severe water stress. Food production will decrease, and changing disease vectors will create unpredictable infectious disease outbreaks. Sea levels will rise, combining with increased storm severity to place coastal cities at risk. The World Health Organization (WHO) <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs266/en/\">estimates</a> that from the years 2030-2050 \u2013 as we reach this level of warming \u2013 at least 250,000 people will die every year from just some of the climate-related harms.</p> <p>Perhaps many of us in rich countries (the \u201cus\u201d who might be reading this) will be largely protected from these early harms; but that doesn\u2019t make them less real to the vulnerable citizens of, say, <a href=\"https://maplecroft.com/portfolio/new-analysis/2013/10/30/31-global-economic-output-forecast-face-high-or-extreme-climate-change-risks-2025-maplecroft-risk-atlas/\">Bangladesh</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg2/index.php?idp=671\">Kiribati or the Maldives</a>. In fact, it <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-ethics-of-climate-change-what-we-owe-people-and-the-rest-of-the-planet-51785\">escalates the injustice</a>, as the global wealthy have benefited from and contributed to climate change the most, while the global poor will be hurt first and worst.</p> <p>At <a href=\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/865571468149107611/pdf/NonAsciiFileName0.pdf\">4 degrees C warming</a>, the World Bank predicts that every summer month will be hotter than any current record heat wave, making the Middle East, North Africa and the Mediterranean deadly during the summer months. Many coastal cities will be completely under water, and all low-lying island nations will likely have to be abandoned. Hundreds of millions, if not billions of people could become <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-should-we-compensate-poor-countries-for-loss-and-damage-from-climate-change-55612\">climate refugees</a>, as their homelands become uninhabitable.</p> <p>Based on these descriptions, I stand by my predictions.</p> <p>Other critics have argued that advocating for a lower birth rate equals <a href=\"http://thefederalist.com/2016/08/24/baby-haters-use-global-warming-to-justify-their-selfishness/\">hating babies</a> or being \u201c<a href=\"http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2016/08/horwitz-make-babies-and-dont-let-the-greens-guilt-trip-you-about-it.html\">anti-life</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Obviously I don\u2019t hate babies! I\u2019m pretty wild about my own kid, and small humans in general.</p> <p>This anti-life charge is more interesting, but equally wrong. The premise seems to be that those who wish to lower fertility rates must be misanthropic, or fail to see the value of humans. But that gets things exactly backward: a radical concern for climate change is precisely motivated by a concern for human life \u2013 in particular, the human lives that will be affected by climate disruptions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/07/oceans-heating-big-problem-blue-planet-iucn-report\">The oceans are heating up. That's a big problem on a blue planet | Bill McKibben</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A valuable philosophical contribution here is <a href=\"https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/13064981/Frick_gsas.harvard.inactive_0084L_11842.pdf?sequence=1\">the distinction between \u201cmaking people happy\u201d and \u201cmaking happy people\u201d</a>. When I feed a hungry person, or prevent a harm from befalling someone, I improve a person\u2019s well-being. But when I create a person whom I will then feed and prevent from harm, I make a person who will predictably be well off. In the first case, I added happiness to the world by helping an existing person; whereas in the second case, I added happiness by creating a person who will be happy. See the difference?</p> <p>I, like many philosophers, believe that it\u2019s morally better to make people happy than to make happy people. Those who exist already have needs and wants, and protecting and providing for them is motivated by respect for human life. It is not a harm to someone not to be created.</p> <p>In fact, I would argue that it is more \u201canti-life\u201d to prioritize creating new life over caring for, or even not harming, those who already exist.</p> <p>Another opposing argument: people are not only consumers \u2013 they are also <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2016/08/23/rising-population-makes-world-better-not-worse/d7TvIfu8L9F1LTv2yxYhfI/story.html\">producers</a>, and so will make the world better.</p> <p>Yes, humans are producers, and many wonderful things have come from human genius. But each person, whatever else they are (genius or dunce, producer or drag on the economy) is also a consumer. And this is the only claim needed in order to be worried about climate change.</p> <p>The problem here is that we have a finite resource \u2013 the ability of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere to absorb greenhouse gases without violently disrupting the climate \u2013 and each additional person contributes to the total amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. So although humans will hopefully save us (we do, in fact, desperately need brilliant people to develop scaleable technology to remove carbon from the air, for instance), the solution to this cannot be to have as many babies as possible, with the hope that this raises our probability of solving the problem. Because each baby is also an emitter, whether a genius or not.</p> <p>Lastly, there\u2019s the view that lowering fertility rates <a href=\"http://thefederalist.com/2016/08/23/have-lots-of-children-its-good-for-the-planet/\">will kill the economy</a>.</p> <p>Several commenters point to low-fertility countries such as Japan, Italy and Germany, and argue that problems experienced by such countries are proof that the \u201creal\u201d population crisis is our dropping fertility rate. We need more babies to grow into healthy young producers to keep our economic engine humming.</p> <p>The truth in this objection is the following: an economy that requires infinite growth to be healthy will be harmed in a world of finite resources. But if it\u2019s true that our economies can\u2019t survive slowing or even reversing population growth, then we\u2019re in some trouble no matter what.</p> <p>Why? It\u2019s simple logic that we cannot grow our population forever. We can either reflect now on how to protect our economy while working toward a sustainable population, or we can ignore the problem until nature forces it on us, perhaps violently and unexpectedly.</p> <p>I\u2019ll conclude with one, final thought: I don\u2019t enjoy arguing for a small family ethic, or a population engineering scheme. Despite snide accusations to the contrary, I get no research funds or any other incentive for making this case. I\u2019m arguing these points because I\u2019m genuinely worried about the future of our planet, and the people who will inherit it, and I believe difficult yet civil discussion is the crucial first step to making that future one we won\u2019t be condemned for creating.</p> <p><em>This piece was originally published in The Conversation.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"img tag\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/65014/count.gif&quot; alt=&quot;The Conversation&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",
  "<p>When food prices spiked in 2008, the international price of basic items peaked at unprecedented levels, bringing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/apr/06/food.foodanddrink\">a wave of food riots in low-income countries</a>.</p> <p>Subsequent price volatility and peaks put huge pressure on millions of people, many of whom already spent half or more of their incomes and labour effort on getting enough rice, maize or bread.

Their time and energy are being squeezed as never before.</p> <p>The second is less obvious: people eat more convenient or processed foods, so long as they are cheap, cheerful and available. People described the shift from <em>teff </em>and <em>enjera</em>, the customary fermented bread of Ethiopia, to wheat flour and bread in these terms.</p> <p>As people worked harder and longer, and migrated to towns, other regions or countries to find work, more turned to heavily-marketed convenience fast food, particularly unhealthy processed items with high fat/sugar/salt content \u2013 a more \u201cwesternised\u201d diet.</p> <h2>Promoting the right to good food</h2> <p>What we have learned about life as it is lived since the end of the cheap food era is that <a href=\"http://www.ids.ac.uk/socialprotectionthatnourishes\">public policy needs to focus on more than basic incomes</a>.

  "<p>Trees have friends, feel loneliness, scream with pain and communicate underground via the \u201cwoodwide web\u201d. Some act as parents and good neighbours. Others do more than just throw shade \u2013 they\u2019re brutal bullies to rival species. The young ones take risks with their drinking and leaf-dropping then remember the hard lessons from their mistakes. It\u2019s a hard-knock life.</p> <p>A book called The Hidden Life of Trees is not an obvious bestseller but it\u2019s easy to see the popular appeal of German forester Peter Wohlleben\u2019s claims \u2013 they are so anthropomorphic. Certainly, a walk in the park feels different when you imagine the network of roots crackling with sappy chat beneath your feet. We don\u2019t know the half of what\u2019s going on underground and beneath the bark, he says: \u201cWe have been looking at nature for the last 100 years like [it is] a machine.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a touchy-feely warmth to the book \u2013 an \u201couch!\u201d when he describes trees having branches hacked, roots cut or being gnawed by insects \u2013 and he talks about \u201cbrainlike things\u201d going on in trees that enable them to learn over their long lifetimes. He points to scientific research \u2013 by <a href=\"http://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~a/root/?lidx=1\">Aachen University</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.forestry.ubc.ca/2011/05/prof-suzanne-simard-talks-about-mother-trees/\">University of British Columbia</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.mpg.de/en\">Max Planck Society</a> \u2013 that he claims underpins all his vivid descriptions, but he writes as a conservationist and admits that much is still unknown. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to find out what trees are communicating when they feel well,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Wohlleben \u2013 it translates as \u201cLivewell\u201d \u2013 has developed his thinking over the past decade while watching the powerful but self-interested survival system of the ancient beech forest he manages in the Eifel mountains of western Germany. \u201cThe thing that surprised me most is how social trees are. I stumbled over an old stump one day and saw that it was still living although it was 400 or 500 years old, without any green leaf. Every living being needs nutrition. The only explanation was that it was supported by the neighbour trees via the roots with a sugar solution. As a forester, I learned that trees are competitors that struggle against each other, for light, for space, and there I saw that it\u2019s just vice versa. Trees are very interested in keeping every member of this community alive.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/08/humans-have-destroyed-a-tenth-of-earths-wilderness-in-25-years-study\">Humans have destroyed a tenth of Earth's wilderness in 25 years \u2013 study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The key to it, he says, is the so-called woodwide web \u2013 trees message their distress in electrical signals via their roots and across fungi networks (\u201clike our nerve system\u201d) to others nearby when they are under attack. By the same means, they feed stricken trees, nurture some saplings (their \u201cmost beloved child\u201d) and restrict others to keep the community strong.</p> <p>\u201cTrees may recognise with their roots who are their friends, who are their families, where their kids are. Then they may also recognise trees that are not so welcome. There are some stumps in these old beech reservations that are alive, and there are some that are rotten, which obviously have had no contact with the roots of supporting neighbours. So perhaps they are like hermits.\u201d It sounds like living in a small village \u2013 as he does, in H\u00fcmmel, near the Belgian border.</p> <p>He writes about the unforgiving woodland etiquette \u2013 no one likes a showoff who crowds everyone out and hogs the resources. When trees break the rules, you end up with a \u201cdrunken forest\u201d. He describes \u201cupright members of ancient forests \u2026 This is what a mature, well-behaved deciduous tree looks like. It has a ramrod-straight trunk with a regular, orderly arrangement of wood fibres.\u201d</p> <p>In Wohlleben\u2019s analysis, it\u2019s almost as if trees have feelings and character. \u201cWe think about plants being robotic, following a genetic code. Plants and trees always have a choice about what to do. Trees are able to decide, have memories and even different characters. There are perhaps nicer guys and bad guys.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/24/plagues-and-pests-beset-our-trees\">Plagues and pests beset our trees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So which are good, bad and sad? Beeches and oaks form forests that last for thousands of years because they act like families, he says. Trees are tribal (\u201cThey are genetically as far away from each other as you and a goldfish\u201d) and ruthlessly protect their own kind: \u201cBeeches harass new species such as oak to such an extent that they weaken.\u201d Douglas fir and spruce also bond within their species.</p> <p>Willows are loners. \u201cThe seeds fly far away from other trees, many kilometres. The trees grow fast and don\u2019t live very long. They are like Usain Bolt \u2013 always the first, then they can\u2019t breathe any more after 100 years and then they are gone.\u201d Poplars aren\u2019t social either and \u201ca birch will wipe other trees away so it has more space for its crown. That doesn\u2019t sound very nice but I think birch has no other choice because that\u2019s what it\u2019s grown like because of its genes.\u201d City trees are like street kids \u2013 isolated and struggling against the odds without strong roots.</p> <p>Wohlleben, 52, used to work as a state forester, viewing trees as lumber, then began running survival training courses and log-cabin tours.

  "<p>Tata Steel slumped to another loss in the three months to the end of June as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/20/how-the-uk-steel-crisis-unfolded\">crisis that has engulfed its UK operations</a> weighed on the company\u2019s global results.</p> <p>The Indian steel firm\u2019s European division, which includes Port Talbot steelworks in Wales and several other plants in the UK, enjoyed an operating profit of \u00a390m during the quarter.</p> <p>The company put the improved performance down to cost cuts in the UK and a boost in exports thanks to the weakness of sterling after the EU referendum.</p> <p>But Tata Steel fell \u00a3360m into the red on a group-wide basis after tax, when including a \u00a3370m loss on the sale of its UK long products business.</p> <p>Tata sold the division to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/01/tata-steel-sale-to-greybull-saving-jobs-and-bringing-back-british-steel\">investment group Greybull Capital</a> for a nominal sum earlier this year in a deal that saw it crystallise a loss on the asset.</p> <p>Executive director Koushik Chatterjee said that, despite the impact of the UK on Tata\u2019s balance sheet, its British operation enjoyed a \u201csignificant benefit\u201d during the quarter from the weakness of the pound.</p> <p>But he did not offer any update on discussions with German rival ThyssenKrupp about setting up a pan-European joint venture.</p> <p>Tata suspended the sale of Port Talbot in July to give it time to explore a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/08/tata-stops-port-talbot-plant-sale-as-talks-begin-with-german-steel-group\">larger tie-up with ThyssenKrupp</a> that the firms believe could help address overcapacity in the European steel industry.</p> <p>One stumbling block is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/13/fears-british-steel-pension-scheme-folded-pension-protection-fund-tata\">British Steel pension scheme</a>, which has 130,000 members and a \u00a3700m funding deficit.</p> <p>Chatterjee said: \u201cWe need more time \u2013 there is the complication of pensions. All bidders come with a univocal approach \u2013 that pensions have to be separated from the business.\u201d</p> <p>He warned observers not to read too much into the \u00a390m quarterly operating profit within Tata Steel Europe, given that this was due largely to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/23/british-pound-given-boost-by-projected-remain-win-in-eu-referendum\">weakness of the pound</a>.</p> <p>\u201cCurrency is always short term,\u201d he said. \u201cToday we see a more depreciated pound, which is where exporting competitiveness has improved. That provides a lever [for the UK business] to sustain itself ... but that\u2019s very fickle.\u201d</p> <p>The company added that the currency effect will not be beneficial only to UK exporters.</p> <p>\u201cThe weaker pound is expected to improve [the] UK\u2019s short-term competitive position on exports. However, it will add cost pressure due to higher cost of raw materials purchased in US dollars.\u201d</p> <p>It also warned that the UK\u2019s growth \u201cmay slow down following the referendum result\u201d.</p> <p>However, Chatterjee was more circumspect about the likely long-term effect of Brexit.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know how trade agreements will pan out between UK and the rest of EU and rest of world. We\u2019ve got to watch and wait and see,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Nonetheless, he was optimistic about the government\u2019s commitment to supporting key industries.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a clear signal to look at industrial strategy in a more focused manner.

  "<p>My colleague and friend Kay Everett, who has died of cancer aged 43, was a gifted lawyer whose campaigning work in immigration and human rights issues made her a powerful voice for the voiceless. She was also instrumental in establishing the public law department at our firm, <a href=\"http://www.wilsonllp.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Wilson Solicitors</a>, where she was made a partner in 2012.</p> <p>Born in Swindon, daughter of Rosemary (nee Stevens), a medical secretary, and Brian Everett, who worked for Burmah Castrol (now BP), Kay went to Cirencester Deer Park school. Brian\u2019s work meant the family lived abroad for periods, and Kay took an international baccalaureate at the United World College of South East Asia in Singapore before reading law and Chinese at the University of Leeds.</p> <p>Following graduation in 1995, Kay trained at the City firm Lovells, where she met her partner, Anand Doobay, then joined the magic circle firm <a href=\"http://www.freshfields.com/en/global/\" title=\"\">Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer</a>, working in project finance, in 2000.</p> <p>It was at a meeting at the Ministry of Defence that Kay realised the City was not for her. This was in 2003, just before the invasion of Iraq, and there was an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/15/iraq-war-mass-protest\" title=\"\">anti-war demonstration </a>outside. Kay turned to her colleague and whispered: \u201cI think I\u2019m the only one around this table who would rather be outside with the protesters.\u201d</p> <p>In 2004 Kay followed her conscience and enrolled for a master\u2019s in human rights law at the School of Oriental and African Studies. Thereafter she volunteered at <a href=\"http://www.hclc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Hackney Law Centre</a> and became active in supporting destitute asylum seekers and migrants, reshaping her career as an immigration and legal aid specialist.</p> <p>Kay joined Wilson Solicitors in 2008, where I first worked with her. She had a wonderful sense of humour and her optimistic catchphrase \u201cwhat can possibly go wrong?\u201d punctuated the most tense legal dramas involving emergency removals and complex detention cases. She was a passionate fighter for the most vulnerable of clients, winning their trust, and giving them a place of safety.</p> <p>She helped to establish the public law department at Wilsons, and we were proud to appoint her a partner. Her kindness and intellectual rigour underpinned outstanding legal work. Kay was a wise mentor, helping numerous trainee solicitors with their careers.</p> <p>Over the years Kay campaigned on immigration and human rights issues. She gave moving evidence about the inordinate immigration detention in the UK to the <a href=\"http://www.appgmigration.org.uk/\" title=\"\">all-party parliamentary group on migration</a>. Kay was co-convenor of the <a href=\"http://www.ilpa.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Immigration Law Practitioners\u2019 Association\u2019s </a>detention committee and a member of the Law Society\u2019s human rights committee.

  "<p>Asthma and allergies in children could be prevented by altering the type of microbes inside their gut as babies, researchers have suggested.</p> <p>The team found that a particular pattern of gut microbes in babies just a month old was linked to an increased risk of them developing asthma and allergic reactions as they grew up.</p> <p>\u201cEarly-life intervention may be a strategy by which we can offset allergic asthma in perhaps a portion of the population,\u201d said Susan Lynch, co-author of the research from the University of California, San Francisco, adding that such interventions could include supplementing young babies with a cocktail of bacteria and other microbes lacking in their gut.</p> <p>According to Asthma UK, the UK has one of the highest rates of asthma symptoms in children in the world, with one in 11 currently receiving treatment for the condition. While the disease can be managed, there is currently no cure.</p> <p>Writing in the journal <a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nm.4176\">Nature Medicine</a>, Lynch and colleagues describe how they analysed the gut microbes of 130 babies aged around one month old by examining their stool samples. They then followed up on the health of the children at two and four years of age.</p> <p>Microbes such as bacteria and fungi are passed from mothers to babies during birth, while breastfeeding, the surrounding environment and the use of antibiotics are also thought to influence the mix.</p> <p>The researchers found that the babies fell broadly into one of three groups, based on the mix of microbes living in their gut. </p> <p>One of the groups, composed of 11 babies, were three times more likely to have allergic reactions at two years and asthma at four years old compared to the other groups.</p> <p>The stools of these babies, Lynch added, had low levels of bacteria including <em>Faecalibacterium</em> and <em>Bifidobacterium</em> and high levels of fungi such as <em>Candida </em>and <em>Rhodotorula</em>. That raises the possibility of manipulating the mix of gut microbes early in development to reduce the risk.</p> <p>To unpick how the microbes could affect the likelihood of developing allergies and asthma, Lynch and colleagues exposed immune cells from healthy adults to sterilised stool samples from the lowest and highest-risk babies. The upshot was that samples from the high-risk babies triggered an immune response and suppressed cells involved in keeping allergic responses in check.</p> <p>That, says Lynch, \u201c[suggests] that the microbes in the gut and their products in these highest-risk children drives an allergic response from very early infancy\u201d.</p> <p>The researchers also delved into possible explanations for why some babies had the problematic set of gut microbes, finding that those children were more likely to be boys and to grow up in a household without a dog.</p> <p>Benjamin Marsland, an expert on the impact of microbes on the immune system from the University hospital of Lausanne in Switzerland, described the new research as \u201cimportant\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThere is a growing awareness that events very early in life can shape how our immune system matures, and as a consequence, our susceptibility to, or protection against, allergies,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The new research, he adds, is a stepping stone towards new ways of tackling asthma and allergies. \u201cIf we can ensure that a baby is exposed to the right microbes early in life, we might be able to reduce the global burden of allergic diseases, such as asthma,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But William Cookson, professor of genomic medicine at Imperial College London, urged caution, noting the small number of children considered to have asthma or allergy in the study and that an increase in allergic reactions at two years of age was not found using conventional definitions.</p> <p>\u201cAsthma is a disease of the airways, it is not a disease of the bowel, and the airways have their own microbiota \u2013 fungi and bacteria \u2013 which are very, very plainly abnormal in asthmatics,\u201d he added. \u201cSo the more logical thing to do, to me, is to look at the lungs, rather than to look at the bowels.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Erika Kennington, head of research at Asthma UK, said: \u201cWe know that gut bacteria can influence our health in many different ways, including determining our risk of developing asthma, but we don\u2019t yet know exactly how this process works.</p> <p>\u201cThis new research helps us better understand the link between gut bacteria and asthma in young children and, in the future, could potentially help us to identify youngsters at higher risk of developing asthma and develop treatments to help them manage it.\u201d</p> <p>Lynch adds that early life gut bacteria are not likely to be the whole story. \u201cMy personal view is that there are many ways to develop the disease,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<p>The world\u2019s biggest corporations have increased their wealth compared with nation states in the last year, illustrating the growing power of multinational businesses.</p> <p>A study by the anti-poverty charity <a href=\"http://www.globaljustice.org.uk/\">Global Justice Now</a> found that the number of businesses in the top 100 economic entities jumped to 69 in 2015 from 63 in the previous year.</p> <p>While many emerging market economies have struggled to grow in the last couple of years, mainly as a result of China\u2019s slowdown, many of the world\u2019s largest corporations have increased in size.</p> <p>The London-based campaign group said the 10 biggest corporations \u2013 including Walmart, Apple and Shell \u2013 make more money than most countries in the world combined. </p> <p>The charity blamed governments for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/03/observer-view-on-corporate-tax-global-reform\">bowing to pressure from multinational firms to promote business-friendly tax regimes</a> above the needs of their citizens. <br></p> <p>An assessment of the top 200 entities found that many smaller countries were squeezed out, leaving 153 corporations above many nations from Africa, Asia and South America.</p> <p>The US, China, Germany, Japan, France and the UK make up the top six economic entities followed by Italy, Brazil and Canada.</p> <p>Walmart ranks as the 10th largest, followed by China\u2019s electricity monopoly State Grid at number 14, China National Petroleum at 15 and Chinese oil firm Sinopec Group at 16.

These figures show the problem is getting worse.\u201d<br></p> <p>Global Justice Now said it released the figures to increase pressure on the British government ahead of a UN working group, led by Ecuador, that aims to draw up a binding treaty \u201cto ensure transnational corporations abide by the full range of human rights responsibilities\u201d.</p> <p>Campaigners said they are calling for the treaty to be legally enforceable at a national and global level. The charity has criticised Britain for refusing to support the process. </p> <p>Dearden said: \u201cThe UK government has facilitated this rise in corporate power through tax structures, trade deals and even aid programmes that help big business.</p> <p>\u201cTheir wholehearted support for the US-EU trade deal TTIP, is just the latest example of government help to big business. Disgracefully, it also routinely opposes the call of developing countries to hold corporations to account for their human rights impacts at the UN.\u201d</p>",

Bainbridge always falls off the bottom of my list and I don\u2019t know why.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>I\u2019ll be delighted to hear it if anyone has ideas about why this wonderful writer might continue to be overlooked - and why she so often lost at out at the Booker Prize too (the wonderful Master Georgie lost out to Ian McEwan\u2019s Amsterdam. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/06/booker-club-amsterdam-ian-mcewan\">Amsterdam</a>!) Also, if anyone thinks we should cover a Beryl Bainbridge book on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/reading-group\">Reading Group</a>, please let me know. I\u2019ll be very pleased to move her to the top of the list. Seems only fair...</p> <p>Also on the theme of unfairly neglected authors, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2439109\">LeoToadstool </a> has written a fascinating review of the Chantic Bird by David Ireland:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Halfway through The Chantic Bird by David Ireland, republished last year in Text Publishing\u2019s Classics range. A first-person narrative of a sociopathic teenager and the trail of havoc he wreaks around Sydney\u2019s outer suburbs. The introduction to the Text Classics edition subtitles it \u201cAustralian Psycho,\u201d and there is something of Patrick Bateman in the nameless narrator, though his pursuits are rendered sightly less graphically (but graphic enough for the book\u2019s original late-60s readers, I\u2019m sure), in a tough Aussie working class vernacular, tempered with some surprisingly lyrical passages</em></p> <p><em>I first heard of Ireland in late 2011 when Text Publishing announced its plan to unearth forgotten gems of Australian literature under a new imprint. Intrigued by the description of David Ireland and his novel The Glass Canoe, I bought it on a whim and was stunned. How this book - a winner of the Miles Franklin Award (basically the Aussie Booker, for those not in the know), and as brutal, tender and stylish a work of late-20th century literature you might hope to read - could have ever have been allowed to fall out of print was criminal. </em></p> </blockquote> <p>Still continuing on overlooked talent, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14992181\">interwar </a>has been reading Palladian by Elizabeth Taylor - but is perhaps ambivalent about its qualities:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Rather a strange work. The first sentence informs the reader that the heroine of sorts, Cassandra, has done a lot of \u201cnovel-reading\u201d and therefore \u201ccould be sure of experiencing the proper emotions\u201d. So when she takes up a position as governess in a Palladian mansion (the owner\u2019s name is Marion Vanbrugh - her surname is Dashwood) she believes she will inevitably fall novelistically in love with Marion - and so she does. </em></p> <p><em>There are echoes of the gothic here: the Palladian facade hides medieval rooms and priest-holes, just as the members of the Vanbrugh family have been raised to hide their emotions. The house is also haunted by the spirit of the beautiful Violet, who could read Homer in Greek at the age of eight, who married Marion, was loved by his cousin Tom (a drunkard who keeps a skeleton in his room), and died giving birth to her daughter Sophy...</em></p> <p></p> </blockquote> <p>More certain was <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/11774763\">laidbackviews</a> in this review of Sooyong Park\u2019s The Great Soul Of Siberia:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>An eagle perched on top of a tree. The feathers on its back fluttered in the wind. In the fall, the fish swim against the current, but the birds turn their back to the wind. A badger crossed a log bridge over the brook to dig through the leaves for food, and an Asian black bear climbed nut pines to gather pine nuts.\u201d</em></p> <p><em>All this, and so much more in The Great Soul of Siberia. Sooyong Park takes us to the two metre earthen bunkers where he spends six winter months in isolation watching everything around him. The Amur Tiger is his speciality, and he introduces us to three generations of the family, from hot breath to heartache. It\u2019s a beautiful gently-paced read.</em></p> <p></p> </blockquote> <p>Another glowing recommendation came from <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13121203\">paulburns</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Just finished Kei Miller\u2019s Augustown. a breathtakingly beautiful 240 page novel of love, class, horror, brutality, Rastafarianism, violence and magic realism of a present and remembered Jamaica. Its not the poetically restful read it promises to be in its opening pages - there\u2019s too much horror and cruelty for that, but it is an absolutely wonderful work.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/11420064\">Kemster</a> provides a nice endorsement of the benefits of Tips, Links and Suggestions itself - and of the fun of following good recommendations:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Someone here recommended The Book of Illusions by Paul Auster a while back.

  "<p>Dance like nobody is watching, sing like nobody is listening and email like it will be read out in court. Or so Nadine Moawad of the Association for Progressive Communications (APC) joked. Feminist activists from around the world were in a conference room in Brazil, discussing what a feminist internet might look like. How did we get here?</p> <p>The number of prosecutions for violence against women and girls in England and Wales is at record levels.

Activists are taking action against online abuse and working towards a feminist internet. When discussing women and the internet, we need to also talk about how feminists are working to reclaim the space.</p> <p>Last week, I attended the 13th international forum organised by the Association for Women\u2019s Rights in Development in Bahia. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=AWIDforum&amp;src=typd\" title=\"\">AWIDForum</a> brought together feminist activists from across the world to imagine feminist futures. We spent an entire day working to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImagineaFeministInternet?src=hash\" title=\"\">#ImagineAFeministInternet</a> \u2013 and preventing and responding to violence against women and girls was just one part of what this looks like.</p> <p>Sessions were led by the APC. In 2014, the APC brought together activists to develop the <a href=\"http://feministinternet.net/sites/default/files/FeministPrinciplesoftheInternetv2.0_0.pdf\" title=\"\">feminist principles of the internet</a>. They were revised and published in August this year and cover themes of access, movements and public participation, economy, expression and agency. They state that a feminist internet is one where women and LGBT people have affordable and equal access and are able to create, design and use technologies to challenge sexism and discrimination. It is one where feminists\u2019 use of the internet is linked to resistance in other spaces and where the internet allows us to connect and demand accountability.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A feminist internet is one where online violence against women is taken seriously and addressed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In this future, there are more feminists and LGBT people in internet governance, making decisions and creating technologies, in contrast to the current male domination of this space. According to Facebook\u2019s <a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/06/driving-diversity-at-facebook/\" title=\"\">own figures released in 2015</a>, men made up 68% of all employees, 77% of those in senior leadership and 85% of those working in technology. Twitter\u2019s <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/2015/we-re-committing-to-a-more-diverse-twitter\" title=\"\">2015 figures</a> reveal that men make up 66% of the company, 87% of those in tech jobs and 78% of those in leadership. <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com.br/2016/06/focusing-on-diversity30.html\" title=\"\">Google is no better</a> \u2013 men make up 69% of all employees, 76% of those in leadership and 81% of those in technical jobs.</p> <p>These three companies are indicative of the sector as a whole. There is a problem with ethnicity as well as gender, particularly when it comes to who runs companies. At Google for example, even though white people make up 57% of those in tech positions and 59% of the company overall, they hold 70% of leadership positions. This is despite women spending more time on social media than men globally \u2013 5.88 hours compared to 4.75 hours \u2013 and the history of women in computing and technology. It was women like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ada-lovelace\" title=\"\">Ada Loveleace</a> after all who were the pioneers of computer programming and women made up over two-thirds of those working at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/29/the-bletchley-girls-tessa-dunlop-the-debs-of-bletchley-park-michael-smith-review\" title=\"\">Bletchley Park</a> during the second world war.</p> <p>A feminist internet also enables us to challenge the ways capitalism plays out in technological spaces and underlies the drive towards profit, privatisation and control. What does it mean when the primary spaces for so many public and private interactions, including activism, are owned by corporations from one part of the world, run by mainly white men? We need to create alternative forms of economic power around technologies. Using and sharing information about free and open-source software, tools and platforms is key to this.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/26/women-misogynist-trolls-feminist-internet\">When women can be misogynist trolls, we need a feminist internet | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A feminist internet also allows us to harness the power of the internet to convey the realities of women\u2019s lives to the world and to ensure freedom of sexual and gender expression. It takes agency and consent seriously, designing them into thinking, planning and technology. Women need to be able to make informed decisions of what information about themselves will and will not be online, to realise their rights to privacy, digital security and full control over their data. The Snowden revelations about the extent of surveillance are a feminist issue. Surveillance has been used to police black communities for centuries and to restrict women and their movement, speech and activism. It is a real threat to women who defend human rights. This needs to change</p> <p>And yes, a feminist internet is one where online violence against women is taken seriously and addressed. This year marks 10 years of the groundbreaking <a href=\"https://www.takebackthetech.net/\" title=\"\">Take Back the Tech campaign</a>, during which thousands of activists have come together in creative ways, online and offline, to prevent violence against women and girls. Examples include the Women of Uganda Network\u2019s SMS campaign mobilising individuals to speak out and stand against violence against women and girls, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/myfirstharassment\" title=\"\">#MyFirstHarassment</a>, which spurred thousands of women in Brazil, Mexico and other countries to talk about sexual harassment and abuse online and with families and friends after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/nov/11/brazil-explicit-tweets-junior-masterchef-star-online-campaign-against-abuse-sexual-harassment\" title=\"\">sexual comments were made about a 12-year-old girl</a> on the Brazilian version of Junior MasterChef.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.genderit.org/feminist-talk/feminist-tech-tools\" title=\"\">Zara Rahman writes</a>, there are a number of tools today that support feminist ideas, from <a href=\"http://arementalkingtoomuch.com/\" title=\"\">Are Men Talking Too Much</a>, a handy way to check who\u2019s dominating the conversation, to <a href=\"http://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/\" title=\"\">Gender Decoder</a> or <a href=\"https://textio.com/\" title=\"\">Textio</a>, which checks bias in job adverts and reveals the language that encourages different people to apply.</p> <p>So the next time there is a discussion of women in tech, online bullying or misogynistic trolls, look at Take Back the Tech and <a href=\"http://genderit.org/\" title=\"\">GenderIT.org</a> for ideas and inspiration, re-read the feminist principles of the internet \u2013 and join the many activists working to make a feminist internet possible.</p>",

Anything new that goes into the dictionary is drafted and researched by us. It\u2019s all down to evidence.\u201d</p> <p>The 15-strong new words team \u2013 out of a staff of 70 at the OED \u2013 work year round tracking words in corpuses \u2013 electronic text collections containing billions of words \u2013 and analysing online databases, as well as material submitted by the public through reading programmes. \u201cWe are always tracking new words that arrive in the language and start to be picked up widely,\u201d Dent tells me. \u201cOED traditionally waits for 10 years of evidence before we add a word but there are exceptions such as livermorium, a chemical element, in this update, which has only been around since 2012. At the same time the wider project of revising the whole text of the dictionary continues.\u201d</p> <p>The updates are achieved through a fine balance of human endeavour and technology, a system introduced in 2000 when the OED went online. But in 1884, when the very first edition started publication it was a different story. \u201cIt took around 50 years for them to finish the first run,\u201d Dent explains. \u201cThat was mainly done through the public reading books and submitting quotations on paper. As soon as it was finished in 1928 they had a whole extra volume\u2019s worth of new words.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1eb3106b8f903575513a7f03548fd91bc55bb798\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1eb3106b8f903575513a7f03548fd91bc55bb798/0_37_2512_1507/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roald Dahl\u2019s perma-tanned Oompa Loompas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roald Dahl\u2019s perma-tanned Oompa Loompas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the latest list, Dent has observed \u201cnotable word clusters\u201d around shopping and slacktivism (people supporting political or social causes online but actually taking no further action).

  "<p>A pioneer monument and a lot of state troopers with batons and riot helmets stood between the mostly young native activists and the North Dakota state capitol on Friday afternoon. Many of the activists arriving at the capitol\u2019s vast green lawn hadn\u2019t heard that the Washington DC judge had decided against the Standing Rock reservation Sioux lawsuit. That was the lawsuit asserting that the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) had gone forward without adequate tribal consultation. There was a sign of anguish when the news was delivered by megaphone, and then, a few minutes later, shouts of joy as a young woman with a long black braid standing in the pouring rain announced the victory chasing the heels of that defeat. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/18/north-dakota-pipeline-activists-bakken-oil-fields\">'We are protectors, not protesters': why I'm fighting the North Dakota pipeline</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a joint statement on Friday by the US army, the Department of Justice, and the Department of the Interior (which oversees Native American affairs), two major decisions were announced. One was a decision by the US army corps of engineers, the permitting body for the pipeline, to hold off on issuing permits to dig on federal land near or under the Missouri river above the Standing Rock reservation. The other was a landmark announcement that this fall, the government would discuss with tribes how \u201cto better ensure meaningful tribal input into infrastructure-related reviews and decisions and the protection of tribal lands, resources, and treaty rights\u201d and whether new legislation should be put in place to pursue those goals. It\u2019s at least an implicit and maybe an explicit acknowledgment that the permitting process for the DAPL fell short of meeting the Standing Rock Sioux\u2019s rights. It may become a landmark decision for all native rights in the United States, and it appears to be the result of tremendous international public pressure that probably changed the outcome of what could have been another quiet defeat. </p> <p>What\u2019s happening at Standing Rock is extraordinary and possibly transformative for native rights, Sioux history, and the intersection of the climate movement with indigenous communities. I spent two days in the Red Warrior camp, the big camp with dozens of teepees, hundreds of tents, and at least 1,000 people. It\u2019s across the small Cannonball river from the Sacred Stone camp founded this spring to catalyze resistance against the DAPL intended to bring dirty crude from the Bakken oil shale in the northwest of North Dakota to Illinois, then down to refineries in the Gulf of Mexico for export. Resistance has been catalyzed, and the world electrified by the gathering of participants from tribes across North America and non-native supporters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2791475badbb9e79ce6b4a0b27a8f617eabc91c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2791475badbb9e79ce6b4a0b27a8f617eabc91c5/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dakota protesters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, on Friday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Cullen/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Friday morning in the camp, I asked Dallas Goldtooth of the Indigenous Environmental Network what were the precedents for this. Sitting in the back of his minivan, as his small children milled about and the boy across the road came to shake his hand, he told me: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing, honestly. There\u2019s nothing that can compare. One-hundred and eighty different tribal nations have sent letters of solidarity.\u201d Goldtooth, who is Dakota and Dene, went on to describe the unprecedented support of tribes from all over the United States and Canada for this resistance, along with climate and environmental groups \u2013 a coalition with tremendous possibility for the future of both indigenous rights and the climate movement. </p> <p>The joy is widespread. The first person I met was a young Hoopa/Yurok woman from far-northern California, who told me this is the most amazing thing she\u2019s ever been part of. The next morning, a small man came up and greeted me, introduced himself as Frank, \u201cfrom right here\u201d, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux. Somewhere in the conversation he said : \u201cI wake up happy every day about this.\u201d I asked him how this changed the past, thinking of the losses the Lakota/Sioux faced over the past 150 years, but he heard the question differently. He mentioned that their old enemies the Crow and the Cheyenne came to stand with them, and that the old divisions are over. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2016/aug/25/north-dakota-pipeline-protest-pictures\">Faces of the North Dakota pipeline protest: 'Sacred land is who we are'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When I asked that question, I was thinking about what I heard from climate activist and environmental lawyer Carolyn Raffensperger, who had spent time at the camp earlier and has a long history in the area. \u201cThere are moments in history that can heal the past and the future,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a healing moment. It\u2019s extraordinary. I\u2019m hoping that it heals the river, which has suffered assaults that are unspeakable.\u201d Though climate activists oppose the pipeline, because it\u2019s part of the machinery to keep fossil fuel flowing and temperatures rising, the Standing Rock oppose it because it would tunnel underneath the Missouri river and threaten their water supply if it ever ruptures.</p> <p>The river is their only source of water. And as Raffensberger mentioned, it has been violated in many ways, including by the Oahe Dam in South Dakota, which turned a free-flowing river into a long unnatural lake. The Cannonball river used to meet the Missouri in such a way that their their turbulent waters turned out big round stones \u2013 which white people saw as cannonballs, thus the name \u2013 but now the smaller river sinks quietly into the lake, and the stones are gone and so are the forces that made them. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are moments in history that can heal the past and the future</p> <footer> <cite>Carolyn Raffensperger</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As Standing Rock tribal chairman David Archambault said in an editorial last month: \u201cWhen the Army Corps of Engineers dammed the Missouri River in 1958, it took our riverfront forests, fruit orchards and most fertile farmland to create Lake Oahe. Now the Corps is taking our clean water and sacred places by approving this river crossing. Whether it\u2019s gold from the Black Hills or hydropower from the Missouri or oil pipelines that threaten our ancestral inheritance, the tribes have always paid the price for America\u2019s prosperity.\u201d It will again, if the corporations and banks behind the DAPL have their way, but this may be a turning point in history; they could lose. </p> <p>That\u2019s what members of Native American nations from the California Yurok to the Michigan Chippewa and the other activists and supporters are hoping, and it\u2019s a tremendous hope against the odds or at least against the record of the past. Victors like to forget how they got their spoils, but the despoiled have long memories. In the central circle of the camp, some words and ideas recurred: that peace and prayer were the means here, that being humble mattered, that ancestors mattered, that this was nonviolent. </p> <p>I met an older woman from the Pine Ridge reservation, one of the poorest places in the United States and the site of some of the fiercest Native American resistance in the 1970s. She told me she had come when the camp was just beginning, when she saw seven teepees there. The next morning there were hundreds of people, and the occupation had stepped up a level. It kept growing, and there are plans to continue, though a Dakota winter may winnow out all but the toughest. When I arrived, the camp spread in all directions from the main entrance on the road. A long avenue of flagpoles lined the main road down what had been grasslands before, with nearly 200 flags from native nations around the country. Near the entrance was a sprawling camp kitchen, with mountains of supplies, indoor and outdoor facilities and open fires on which some of the cooking was done, and all of the gigantic vats of coffee seemed to be boiled. The grass was flattened and dried in some places, worn through in others, and after Wednesday\u2019s rain some of the bare places became mud wallows. People made camp on both sides, some in tall white or painted teepees, most in tents, a few in recreational vehicles.<br></p> <p>Horses were staked in the grass or kept in small corrals. People flew flags, covered their car in graffiti \u2013 \u201cWater is life\u201d or its equivalent in Lakota, \u201cMni wiconi\u201d, and \u201cNo DAPL\u201d were the most common slogans. There was a remarkable absence of brochures, leaflets and petitions, along with meetings and perceptible organizational structure. There was a classroom, a table where volunteers lawyers were available (they were also there to witness and represent anyone who might be arrested), sweatlodges. It was a village, though one without commerce of any kind or alcohol, drugs, or weapons. People chopped wood, fed horses, made coffee, visited with their neighbors, told their stories, came to ceremonies and talks, and waited to see how they could make history. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5942af12749a4a43b6b484e1b392d2c3c8542a14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5942af12749a4a43b6b484e1b392d2c3c8542a14/0_27_3351_2011/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pipeline protest encampment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protest encampment near Cannon Ball, where members of some 200 Native American tribes from across the US and Canada have gathered to lend their support to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe\u2019s opposition to the pipeline.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Which left time on some days for cultural celebration by a thousand people from dozens of cultures. Thursday, the people of the Pacific north-west paddled down the Missouri river in magnificent boats they had brought with them. They were scheduled to come up the Cannonball about 3pm, and people were beginning to line the shore when runners came to call people to the central circle where ceremonies were held and information distributed. There, Archambault spoke about the governor\u2019s calling out the national guard, seeking to calm fears by saying they would be used for traffic management and would never be allowed to come to the camp.</p> <p>In fact, men in uniform from the sheriff\u2019s department and state troopers were already being used to turn people back on Highway 1806, which goes south from the Bismarck area to the reservation. I ran into them Wednesday afternoon, looking like they were combat-ready for Afghanistan, and they appeared to be turning all cars back not far down the highway from Bismarck. I took a huge detour through the rolling green countryside and got back without a mishap, but the goal seemed to be discouragement. On Friday, I saw more uniformed men turning people back about a dozen miles above the camp and then, again, further north, another blockade sending people back. There seems to be a concerted effort to prevent people from reaching the camp or to at least inconvenience them. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Archambault spoke, and then everyone wandered back to shore where the huge Tlingit boat and other crafts were arriving. Goldtooth had noted that the river tribes had who responded most strongly, groups who had fought or were fighting their own battles over water. The ceremonies were unhurried, with the boats passing by and then pointing their prows to shore and asking, with speeches of gratitude, songs in native languages, and jokes, permission to land.</p> <p>The fight is about water and rights. The Missouri is the longest river in the United States, joining the Mississippi at St Louis; any pollution caused by a spill from the DAPL on its current route would impact the reservation first but would continue downstream all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. It would impact a huge swathe of the agriculture and residents at the center of the continent. You could also note that the Missouri and Mississippi meet close to where a police officer killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, the event that prompted the formation of Black Lives Matter (members of which were also at the camp showing solidarity). The river goes onward to flow past New Orleans, where the natural disaster of Hurricane Katrina turned into the unnatural disaster of a city blockaded and its citizens shot down and stranded by the authorities. Histories flow together. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"346955435e382557b2489e05f1308feb23441c20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/346955435e382557b2489e05f1308feb23441c20/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Native American protesters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women and girls from the Colorado River Indian tribes dance after arriving at a protest encampment near Cannon Ball, North Dakota.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s happening at Standing Rock feels like a new civil rights movement that takes place at the confluence of environmental and human rights and grows from the last 60 years of lived experience in popular power and changing the world. This is already a movement with national solidarity \u2013 there were support demonstrations in San Francisco and Tulsa, Oklahoma, among other places \u2013 and a national day of action is scheduled for Tuesday. </p> <p>Many involved in the climate movement see it as a human rights movement or a movement inseparable from human rights. Indigenous people have played a huge role, as the people in many of the places where extracting and transporting fossil fuel take place, as protectors of particular places and ecosystems from rivers to forests, from the Amazon to the Arctic, as people with a strong sense of the past and the future, of the deep time in which short-term profit turns into longterm damage, and of the rights of the collective over individual profit. All these forces are antithetical to capitalism, and it to them. </p> <p>There is nothing guaranteed about the outcome for the DAPL, the larger movement that the uprising at Standing Rock has begun, and the connections it strengthens. It\u2019s only a beginning but it\u2019s a spectacular beginning and a reminder that sometimes the future is made by dreamers and warriors who come together unexpectedly. </p>",

  "<p>The last time I returned to Washington DC, I arrived as I usually do, by train into Union Station. It was the end of March, the day before Easter Sunday, and the platforms teemed with travellers coming into town to see the city\u2019s cherry blossoms, gifted to the city more than a hundred years ago by the mayor of Tokyo.</p> <p>The colonnade of delicately blossomed trees along the Tidal Basin walkway to the Jefferson Memorial is a historical and aesthetic delight for visitors; but for me, as a child, they were a harbinger of Washington\u2019s aggressive hay fever season. When I was in high school, I would do my best to run speed workouts on the track while inhaling my own snot and wheezing through pollen-aggravated wind pipes. As an adult, I discovered Claritin and my whole world changed.</p> <p>When I return by train, weather permitting, I often walk the mile-and-a-half from Union Station to the White House along Constitution Avenue before catching an Uber home, just to reacquaint myself with some of the structures and institutions that make my city so unique.</p> <p>Here are the Smithsonian Museum buildings, many of which I entered as a child on school field trips. This is the majestic, David Adjaye-designed African American History Museum, so long overdue. There is the Washington monument in marble of two shades because the civil war disrupted its construction. Here is the White House, where the most powerful man in the world resides \u2013 for a few months longer, a black man like me. This is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve\">Federal Reserve</a>, which for conspiracy theorists is the ultimate arbiter of all our fates. And here are the paths one million people marched along to hear Dr Martin Luther King preach for an end to America\u2019s love affair with structured hate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d251da667fadf3bc24c88ad6018321d8150dd16e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d251da667fadf3bc24c88ad6018321d8150dd16e/0_171_2525_1515/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cherry blossom in front of Jefferson Memorial, Washington DC, March 2011\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cherry blossom in front of the Jefferson Memorial \u2013 \u2018a harbinger of Washington\u2019s aggressive hay fever season.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beau Finley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Washington DC is not a subtle city.

Unlike these interlopers, I was born on this soil, within the 70 sq miles divided into four large quadrants that constitute our nation\u2019s capital. I consider this city and these public spaces my own, yet I am cowed by the vastness of its outsized influence.</p> <p>I rep Washington DC \u2013 hard \u2013 despite not having really lived here since I graduated from high school, and despite spending the past few years working in Lagos. DC is in my blood, my diction, my sensibility and style. I am, though, in love with a city that cannot fully love me back.</p> <p> **** </p> <p>My DC starts in 1982 at the Washington Hospital Center. I was born in a city that was nearly 70% black. They called it \u201cChocolate City\u201d: birthplace of Duke Ellington and Marvin Gaye, home of Chuck Brown and the city\u2019s idiosyncratic Go-Go music.</p> <p>Ronald Reagan was not quite two years into his presidency, and Marion Barry was still a mayor celebrated for having made the jump from civil rights activist to consummate city politician. Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House was still an active thoroughfare, not yet closed to traffic for fear of assassination attempts or terrorist attacks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3b2c951deaed2f9a38d2c61074cb053fec2e119e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b2c951deaed2f9a38d2c61074cb053fec2e119e/0_410_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Uzodinma and his father.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uzodinma with his father at his high school graduation</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uzodinma Iweala</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was also trouble. Drug usage and crime rates had steadily escalated through the 1970s, creating a vicious cycle of white flight and depressed municipal revenue, which in turn led to decreased services, increased poverty, worsening crime and further white flight to the Maryland and Virginia suburbs.</p> <p>The DC I entered was a divided city, populated by a minority white elite in the upper north-west section of the city that buzzed around the corridors of power; and a majority mixture of black wealthy, middle and working class \u2013 with the poorest residents confined to pockets of debilitating poverty, and largely ignored in the city\u2019s outward projection of itself.</p> <p>Yet this great divide did not manifest in the way you might have noticed in other cities.<br></p> <p> For as long as I can remember, the majority of Washington DC\u2019s police force has been black. For that reason, perhaps, the city has been spared some of the worst excesses of police brutality, exacerbated by racial misunderstanding. But young as we were, my siblings and I still felt the racial tensions in assumptions our friends and their parents made about where we should live (read: not in the affluent suburb of Potomac); in the joking remarks white classmates made about majority black sections of the city (automatically the ghetto) to which they had most likely never been; in the skin colour of the people riding the metro buses compared to those on the subway or driving their cars; and in white people\u2019s presumption of incompetence on the part of the mostly black city officials.</p> <p> Even more troubling to me was the fact that growing up white in Northwest DC or the surrounding suburbs meant one could get away with not noticing these complex racial dynamics. I\u2019m pretty certain that for many of my classmates at the elite private school I attended, my black classmates and I formed the majority of their substantive interactions with people of colour. </p> <p>But Washington DC has always been a divided city, most obviously between the officialdom of the United States federal government headquartered here, and the informal lives of the people who inhabit the city and its surrounding suburbs. It is a city fractured by its infatuation with official remembrance (as seen in its monuments and museums), and its seeming indifference to the personal memories of the permanent residents whose lives have truly shaped it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"21fe071b5dfe90a8352222b035fc957b9d597f6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21fe071b5dfe90a8352222b035fc957b9d597f6e/0_76_2820_1692/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The National Mall in Washington DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The National Mall in Washington DC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beau Finley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>***</p> <p>People often speak of DC as if it has always existed in its pure state; as if brought to us by virgin birth. In fact, its territory was carved from two slave-holding states. Within its original borders were two slave trading ports: the first in what is now the trendy north-west neighbourhood of Georgetown, and the second in the modern city of Alexandria, Virginia.<br></p> <p>Upon its founding, nearly a quarter of DC\u2019s population was black, and just under 10% of that population was free. The city\u2019s grand avenues and whitewashed structures were built by black slaves and freemen for the powerful white men who met inside to pass laws and uphold social norms that severely compromised the fundamental rights of black Americans.<br></p> <p>Slavery is the reason DC looks like a half-eaten sandwich on a map. Slave holders in Virginia feared a growing abolitionist block in the United States congress might eventually push to outlaw slavery in the federal capital, so they petitioned to have the portion of the capital donated by Virginia returned to the state in 1846.<br></p> <p>Four years later, congress outlawed the slave trade in the nation\u2019s capital. Soon after, during the nation\u2019s catastrophic civil war, the 13th amendment abolished slavery in all states, triggering an influx of ex-slaves from the south who sought safety and opportunity in this relatively progressive enclave.<br></p> <p>DC has since seen the rise of a flourishing black community that, despite both legalised and de facto segregation, managed to found the nation\u2019s most prominent historically black university (shout out to Howard \u2013 I see you), produce a strong class of black professionals and artists, and amass black wealth in a way few other black communities have done in the United States. This was in part due to the benefits of proximity to an ever-expanding federal government \u2013 which was generally more progressive than the southern state governments that did everything in their power to limit the freedoms and economic progress of black citizens. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4de77062aad270cb181f01a93424061df9194d3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4de77062aad270cb181f01a93424061df9194d3a/0_278_4463_2678/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Buskers in DC\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Washington DC has seen the rise of a flourishing black community despite its history of segregation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beau Finley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>***</p> <p>When my mother came to Washington DC in the early 1980s, she had three things on her mind: her new job at the World Bank, the one-year-old baby girl she gave birth to just before earning her PhD, and me \u2013 as yet unborn but already demanding a larger living space than she and my father had originally intended for their \u201ctemporary\u201d sojourn in America.</p> <p>My mother found a three-bedroom apartment at 4600 Connecticut Avenue just a few blocks from the Van Ness metro station, and half a mile from the Wesley United Methodist Church where I was baptised, attended pre-school, and where we still attend Christmas Eve service when assembled as a family during the holidays.</p> <p>For my mother, the decision to live in Northwest DC was practical. She didn\u2019t have a car and needed to be close to her demanding job; and she needed something affordable (which much of the city was at that time). When she interned at the World Bank as a young graduate student, her African and black colleagues advised her to avoid Virginia because, despite cheaper accommodation, its political and cultural history made it more hostile to minorities.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eb1ddcfc56adda83b6ab75a0875f586af6038096\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb1ddcfc56adda83b6ab75a0875f586af6038096/0_376_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Uzodinma Iweala family photo, Washington DC\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Iweala family at Uzodinma\u2019s high school graduation</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uzodinma Iweala</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI almost took a place in Adams Morgan, but the apartment was too dark,\u201d my mother told me the last time I was home, as she drove me to Union Station to catch my train back to New York. Adams Morgan is now an overly trendy area to the north-east of Dupont Circle, but 30 years ago, it was more immigrant, more black and Hispanic: the kind of place your mother dragged you after church on Sunday so she could buy oxtail, crayfish and dried cod from the Latin American and African grocers selling the ingredients of the Nigerian food we regularly ate.</p> <p>Later, after adding two more children, my family moved to Potomac, Maryland in large part because my father, a man who values his quiet and privacy, wanted enough space that he didn\u2019t have to see his neighbours unless absolutely necessary.</p> <p>My mother built her career in downtown Washington DC at the World Bank headquarters, close to the White House. She worked with the international and domestic policy makers and practitioners who often move to Washington in waves as presidential administrations, congressional terms and ambassadorial appointments turn over. <br></p> <p>Most of the kids I went to school with were white. They lived in neighbourhoods of white people, shopped in grocery stores with other white people, attended church or synagogue with other white people. For them, and in large part for me and my siblings, DC was wealthy and white \u2013 even if this wealthy whiteness was hardly representative of the city. Perhaps I\u2019m unkind, but I\u2019d wager that many of my classmates were unaware, except for the odd cross-cultural or cross-class interaction, that the city they lived in actually looked more like me than them.<br></p> <p>I knew this because my father worked in a Washington DC just a few miles from my mother\u2019s office, but worlds away culturally, economically and psychologically.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019d wager that many of my classmates were unaware that the city they lived in actually looked more like me than them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If my mother worked in official DC, then my father, when he finally moved over from the United Kingdom and began work at Providence Hospital in Northeast DC, built his career in unofficial Washington. Located on Varnum Street Northeast, Providence sat in a working-class black neighbourhood not far from the Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.</p> <p>On the drive there, I would notice how the houses shrank in size and grew closer together. Some had fake green turf lining their front steps. There were fewer trees and the grass in the beds separating the curb and street was patchy and brown. The streets also had more cracks and potholes than in other areas of the city. Though it was perfectly safe and pleasant, it was evident, even to a child\u2019s eye, that this place received less attention than parts of Northwest DC.<br></p> <p>When my father first started at Providence in 1993, his patients worked unglamorous jobs as teachers and support staff for government offices, as bus drivers, police officers and firemen. They carried with them stories of a vibrant and diverse majority subculture that, largely unbeknown to greater America and the world, built and shaped DC.</p> <p>I remember working in Providence\u2019s stuffy medical library, which occasionally would fill with black doctors and nurses taking a quick break away from the hectic wards. I also remember walking around and hearing an entirely different kind of English spoken: a slow, almost southern drawl that was instantly inviting and comforting. Washington DC\u2019s indigenous (for want of a better term) black folk were kind and open. They asked strangers, \u201cHow is your day?\u201d and smiled, because that was good manners.<br></p> <p>\u201cI liked it,\u201d my father told me when I asked what it was like to move from Manchester, England and Edinburgh, Scotland to black America. \u201cI was finally able to practise; to use my skills to take care of people and make money to support my family; and to work in a community that appreciates your work even more because you look like them.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"91c4e81904091b867b0d133336e858d2e6244684\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91c4e81904091b867b0d133336e858d2e6244684/0_123_5322_3193/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben\u2019s Chili Bowl, U Street, Washington DC, December 2015\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two decades ago U Street was a predominately black neighbourhood, but has since been gentrified.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beau Finley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>***</p> <p>All that changed with the city\u2019s budget crisis of the mid-1990s. These were the nascent years of the extreme partisanship and Republican intransigence during the (hopefully) first Clinton presidency, that managed to shut down the federal government \u2013 twice \u2013 including right after the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2016/01/06/remembering-the-blizzard-of-1996-that-paralyzed-washington-d-c/\">blizzard of 96</a> (which meant DC schools were closed for almost two weeks).<br></p> <p>As usually happens during spats between the branches of the federal government, DC got tossed around in the middle, and ended up being stripped of its little sovereignty when President Clinton and the Republicans agreed to appoint a \u201ccontrol board\u201d to oversee city finances.</p> <p>As with many American urban centres that have seen financial hardship, this meant corporate executives making hardnosed decisions to cut services and save money. One of the casualties was DC General, the city\u2019s public hospital, which served lower-income communities across the district. After DC General\u2019s closure, hospitals such as Providence saw an increase in patients from some of the city\u2019s more neglected areas, and it wasn\u2019t pretty. \u201cWe saw a lot more gunshot wounds. We saw much more in terms of drug addiction and alcoholism,\u201d my father told me.<br></p> <p>The worst was that hospitals in Northwest such as George Washington University Hospital \u2013 where President Reagan was treated after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/john-hinckley-jr-release-ronald-reagan-assassination-attempt\">John Hinckley\u2019s attempt to assassinate him</a>, and where my youngest brother now works as a resident orthopaedic surgeon \u2013 would illegally turn these patients away by telling them they could not treat their problems. \u201cHow can you do that? It\u2019s not right! It\u2019s reprehensible,\u201d my father told me, his voice still brimming with anger many years later.<br></p> <p>They could do it because of a dissonance at the core of Washington DC\u2019s existence. The people turned away didn\u2019t fit the whitewashed image of the marketable city, even though they were the majority of the population. It was the same reason my siblings and I were able to attend posh schools that could \u201cachieve\u201d a black student enrolment of 10% in a city more than 60% African American, and find those figures cause for celebration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2484fc912aecd96e05524b286ca53ca528ec3b60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2484fc912aecd96e05524b286ca53ca528ec3b60/0_284_4830_2898/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The NY Avenue area was burnt during 1968 riots in DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The NY Avenue area was burnt during 1968 riots in DC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beau Finley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two of my closest friends in school, Aaron and Ismael, were black (we comprised 33% of the black population of our high school class) and lived in what were then majority black areas. They were always aware of, but hardly surprised by, how different the city looked after a journey of a few miles.</p> <p>\u201cI have to remind myself that it\u2019s not required that your parents give you a car when you turn 16,\u201d Ismael said once, as we sat in the large, blue Volvo station wagon that my parents had bequeathed to my sister when she started driving, and that I inherited when I turned 16. I took comfort in the fact that, compared to some classmates who drove Audis, BMWs and Range Rovers, my Volvo was \u201cslumming it\u201d. <br></p> <p>Ismael lived in the U street area of Northwest on Riggs Street, between 13th and 14th streets. Today the area is full of chic restaurants, multimillion-dollar row houses and condos and white yuppies (and their strollers). Twenty years ago, it was a predominantly black neighbourhood with more liquor stores than trendy restaurants, and more African immigrants from countries like Ethiopia than American immigrants from Idaho and Montana.</p> <p> This is the neighbourhood where my father asked me to drop the car off with a Ghanaian man who owned a vacant lot full of problematic Mercedes Benzes and Volvos that he fixed for much less than the dealership a few miles away on Wisconsin Avenue. Young black children played in the streets because backyards were small. The pavements cracked over prying tree roots and there were some businesses with boarded windows; a testament to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonian.com/2008/04/01/people-were-out-of-control-remembering-the-1968-riots/\">1968 riots that decimated a neighbourhood</a> which had been an incubator for the black artistic renaissance of the early 20th century.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>More and more sections of DC are beginning to look the way city has always thought it looked</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the time, property values were much lower. Ismael\u2019s parents bought their row house in the 1980s for less than $100,000 (\u00a375,000). His mother was recently offered over a million in cash for that same property.</p> <p>What\u2019s changed? Quite simply, more and more sections of DC are beginning to look the way city has always <em>thought</em> it looked. I remember one visit to Ismael\u2019s neighbourhood where he pointed to a house at the end of the block with a rainbow flag flying from its porch. \u201cThere are some gay guys living there now,\u201d he said.</p> <p> This was the mid-1990s so being gay was still a big deal. It was also a harbinger of change; an almost textbook sign that gentrification was on its way. First wealthy but socially unacceptable white people who nobody wants to live next to find acceptance among black people who nobody has ever wanted to live next to. Then, years later, I\u2019m more likely to run into a white college classmate on the way back from grocery shopping \u2013 tote bag slung over her shoulder, kale leaves peaking over the edge \u2013 than I am to see one of Ismael\u2019s old neighbours who can speak to the rise and fall and rise of a community that has always been integral to the city\u2019s life.</p> <p>As Ismael put it one afternoon a couple of years ago when he, Aaron and I sat at Hooters in Chinatown salivating over the chicken wings: \u201cWhen we were in high school, our white classmates used to come here with fake IDs to buy alcohol for their parties, and I didn\u2019t like that. Now they live here and they don\u2019t like that my mum does too.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1cacc2b782cc1d9fdf4d2071a98e3a3f2fa22802\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cacc2b782cc1d9fdf4d2071a98e3a3f2fa22802/577_0_3288_1973/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Metro station, Washington DC, May 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Has gentrification really benefited Washingtonians?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beau Finley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gentrification is a tough topic to consider, especially given that my education, income and love for kale means I am demographically a gentrifier myself. For the gentrifiers and those in neighbourhoods being gentrified, there are contradictory emotions caused by the interplay of race, class and ambition in the winner-takes-all pursuit of constant growth that we have termed urban renewal.<br></p> <p> Like many major cities built around a humming economic engine (LA has entertainment, New York has finance, my city has the ever-growing, ever-giving federal government), DC is an epicentre for urban renewal \u2013 and thus a locus of intense debate and discomfort around how this change impacts the \u201csoul\u201d of the city.</p> <p>DC\u2019s economic transformation began when Anthony Williams, the control board-backed chief financial officer of the city was elected mayor in 1999.

Coupled with an expanding federal government during the presidencies of George W Bush and Barack Obama, this led to an unprecedented increase in population, increased pressure on existing housing stock, and a demographic transformation that has seen Washington\u2019s African American population decrease by <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HolwxdMeTwYC&amp;pg=PA1887&amp;dq=Washington%E2%80%99s+African+American+population+decreased+by+7.3%25&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjoub7EyP_OAhXFCsAKHaZLAr0Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Washington%E2%80%99s%20African%20American%20population%20decreased%20by%207.3%25&amp;f=false\">7.3% while the white population has increased by 17.8%</a> over the last 15 years.<br></p> <p> Washington\u2019s new younger, often whiter money meets its older darker residents in a process that has accelerated under two subsequent mayors, and resulted in the conundrums facing places like the H Street Northeast corridor, where my friend and original New Yorker Mary lived during her time at Georgetown Law School \u2013 and where an influx of students, hipsters and Hill staffers has brought new economic life, but also the possibility of cultural erasure, to another historically black subsection of the city.</p> <p>***</p> <p>One morning in late 2015 when visiting Mary to attend her law school graduation ceremony, plagued by jet lag, I slipped out of her house early to take a walk around her neighbourhood. As the sun rose, I steered clear of the new hipster pubs and draft beer houses on H Street, and instead followed side streets where aged row houses stooped towards the sidewalk.</p> <p>I nodded to a dreadlocked man waxing a large SUV. I felt myself being watched, followed. From across the road, a man and a woman cat-called me. I pretended not to hear and continued my stroll, but they crossed the street to stand on the sidewalk in front of me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c2adee4681255a54c3158c9d1e71c0e387b47205\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2adee4681255a54c3158c9d1e71c0e387b47205/0_330_4944_2966/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fire station in upper Northwest at night, Washington DC, February 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The fire station in upper Northwest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beau Finley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The man was rail thin, and wore cut-off jean shorts with frayed hems and a blue form-fitting tank top that exposed his sinewy arms. He waved his skeletal fingers at me. His companion, a shorter, rounder woman with close-cropped platinum hair and a pot belly, stepped forward.<br></p> <p> \u201cYou new to the neighbourhood?\u201d the man asked.</p> <p> \u201cJust visiting,\u201d I said.</p> <p> \u201cWhere from?\u201d the woman asked, stepping closer. I stood my ground. \u201cYou thinking of coming here and buying one of our houses, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked.</p> <p> \u201cNo, no,\u201d I said with a nervous laugh, \u201cI\u2019m from Nigeria\u201d \u2013 thinking that distance would ease the tension.</p> <p> \u201cBut you want one of our houses,\u201d she insisted. \u201cPeople keep coming up in here buying our houses and shit, changing the neighbourhood and shit. Must be because we got that good stuff.\u201d </p> <p>Then she reached forward and grabbed my crotch. \u201cYou want that good stuff?\u201d Her companion squealed with delight as she cackled: \u201cYou come with us. We can show you that good stuff.\u201d</p> <p> \u201cUm. No, thank you,\u201d I said, and quickly stepped on to the grassy patch next to the sidewalk and hurried off. As I quickened my pace, I could hear them cackling to each other. The man in the tank top finger-waved good bye.</p> <p> I was shocked, mostly by the unwanted sexual contact, but also by the realness of demographic and community change across the city. According to the architecture critic Robert Bevan: \u201cIn part, we recognise our place in the world by an interaction with the built environment and remembering these experiences, and by being informed of the experiences of others: the creation of a social identity located in time and place.\u201d</p> <p>So what happens when the built environment changes directly beneath your feet; when new money brings new structures, or the reconfiguration of old structures, that define a physical-mental-emotional space?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fcc4d109a44926db260255d216cc24e8de49781\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fcc4d109a44926db260255d216cc24e8de49781/0_27_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iweala as a child.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iweala as a child.

Suddenly, the face of a neighbourhood in real-estate brochures and tourism posters becomes an appropriately bearded 30-something white man or his smiling, blue-eyed girlfriend, their ethnically ambiguous interracial couple friends, and occasionally someone who looks like me. Meanwhile, the original resident is left wondering whether each potential new face represents the increased possibility that they will be excluded from their own story.</p> <p>My friend Aaron who grew up in Northeast Washington DC with his mother and grandmother (and now lives in New York) told me: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I could really go back and live there. DC for me was close-knit, working-class residential communities. It\u2019s like the city wants something different for itself now. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d fit in.\u201d<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I just wonder why it's only when white people move to a place that people suddenly pay attention</p> <footer> <cite>Uzodinma's father</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> A lot of original Washingtonians I know (rich and poor) share this sentiment, even as there is a recognition that many of the changes have improved the overall perception and standard of living in the city. But there is also recognition that these changes have hardly been beneficial for everybody.</p> <p>\u201cBefore I retired, the people who lived around the hospital were all black.

I just wonder why it\u2019s only when white people move to a place that people suddenly pay attention.\u201d<br></p> <p>As the city\u2019s demographic shift results in better services for once-black areas that now have increased white populations; as newcomers without concern for the city\u2019s rich history and implicit biases become more populous, and unconsciously use the city\u2019s security apparatus to neutralise difference that makes them uncomfortable; and as the city\u2019s police department itself becomes less black, less integrated with the communities it serves, and more aggressive, people lose faith that the city they once knew still wants to know them.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Like all things, cities must change \u2013 even a city as enamoured of the past and memory as DC.

  "<p>We like to think that a modern society is open and mobile \u2013 and our failure on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/socialmobility\">social mobility</a> really matters to Theresa May. It is one of the reasons for successive waves of education reform, the latest of which is being debated in parliament today, sparking a fiery debate about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-to-end-ban-on-new-grammar-schools\">grammar schools</a> not seen for decades. What has gone wrong with social mobility and why?</p> <p>Despite what\u2019s often said, there has never been a golden age of high social mobility. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/12/uk-education-reforms-not-helped-social-mobility\">John Goldthorpe at Nuffield</a> argues that our record has never been much good once we allow for changes in the employment market. The shift from the blue-collar jobs of the older generation to the white-collar jobs of their children did make it look as if we had cracked the problem in the 1950s and 1960s. But when these trends slowed down the underlying problem was revealed more starkly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/20/value-for-money-not-only-measure-of-university\">\u2018Value for money\u2019 can\u2019t be the only measure of university | Julian Coman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Education is often thought of as the facilitator of social mobility. But the uncomfortable truth is that despite education being so obviously a good thing, its interaction with changes in the jobs market has not been good for social mobility. The decline of steady jobs in industry for school leavers and the expansion of higher education as the pre-eminent route to well-paid jobs has meant that the academic performance of secondary schools matters more than ever. The shocking gap in school standards may not have widened but it certainly makes more of a difference to your life chances once your school\u2019s role becomes to provide a route to university. It is the urgent need to get their children into the schools that get them into the prestigious universities that has led to the parental arms race that eventually feeds through into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/27/house-prices-state-schools-higher\">higher house prices around the primary schools</a> that feed the secondary schools that feed the universities.</p> <p>The expansion of universities also initially benefited the middle class \u2013 notably daughters whose educational opportunities had lagged behind their brothers\u2019. This expansion of their life chances is one of the great triumphs of the 20th century. But when you add in the phenomenon of assortative mating \u2013 affluent, well-educated women marrying similarly educated men \u2013 then you get wider gaps between the earnings of different households and wider gaps in the levels of investment in children.</p> <p>Then add to this mix the single most unusual feature of the English and Welsh schools system \u2013 that we expect 16-year-olds to take decisions about which subjects to specialise in. Again, this mattered less when most young people went off to work at 16, but now it matters much more. Take what that means for engineering, for example, which in many countries is a popular university subject. Only 7% of young people in England and Wales take the A-levels that make them eligible for most university engineering courses. Very few other countries have designed an education system that narrows down young people\u2019s options so that by the age of 16, 93% could not become an engineer without a dramatic change of tack. You might think that, given this educational approach, at least we would make exceptional efforts to provide careers advice and guidance, but actually this is one of our worst policy failures. A serious effort there would pay dividends for social mobility.</p> <p>It is not all about A-levels, however \u2013 what about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2011/may/24/vocation-qualifications-graduate-unemployment-university\">vocational qualifications</a>? German apprenticeships are widely admired, but in more than 300 areas they lead to a licence to practise, which means an apprentice is on a route to a guaranteed job. The British labour market has fewer such guarantees. We can enhance apprenticeships \u2013 but it becomes harder for colleges and employers to provide them. And of course you do need a job first. So apprenticeships of higher quality are hard to expand, at the same time as A-levels are becoming tougher and more academic. That leaves a real need for vocational qualifications that are rigorous and trusted by employers, as proposed in an important report by <a href=\"https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/sainsbury-review-triggers-biggest-change-post-16-education-70\">David Sainsbury in July</a>. Successive governments have fiddled around with these to little effect. And spending on education for 16- to 18-year-olds has been squeezed the most \u2013 caught between a school spending pledge that stops at age 16, and university fees and loans that bring extra resources into higher education.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are always going to be people who fall through the cracks first time round and need a second chance as adults</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are always going to be people who fall through the cracks first time around and need a second chance as adults. This is another area where we are not doing enough. In fact, a <a href=\"http://university.which.co.uk/advice/gcse-choices-university/gcse-shake-up-what-the-changes-mean-for-you\">tightening of the rules</a> on the environment for sitting GCSEs and A-levels next year means there will be even higher practical barriers for adult learners who want to take the exams. This is exactly the kind of area where Theresa May\u2019s government could make a difference.</p> <p>We need a social mobility strategy that includes all the stages of education, throughout our lives. It has to include competitive pressures on schools to improve their performance \u2013 and not simply by selecting the kids who are going to do best. It means serious information, advice and guidance. It also means vocational qualifications for 18-year-old school leavers that do not depend on employment first.</p> <p>There are bright spots on the educational map \u2013 the most conspicuous being in London. This has been achieved by putting schools under relentless pressure and not just allowing some to appear to do better by academic or social selection. Universities are reaching out too \u2013 places such as King\u2019s College London, where I am a visiting professor, realise that prior attainment is not the sole predictor of educational achievement. The good news is that university is the only stage of education where poor kids outperform their wealthier peers \u2013 if they can get in.</p> <p>With the disappearance of big local manufacturing firms; no school-leaving exam at 18; no stable, reliable set of vocational qualifications outside apprenticeships; and poor-quality careers advice, it is easy to see why working-class teenagers are having a tough time. It is unfair on them to say they lack aspiration \u2013 the evidence is that they have conventional aspirations for decent jobs, but the unusual English and Welsh education system has been tilted against them.</p>",

Among Gallup respondents surveyed in 46 countries in 2011, an average of 28% of women spent 3-5 hours a day on household work compared with just 6% of men.</p> <p>These unpaid activities are critical to human wellbeing and maintaining the labour force, as well as in supporting the future workforce through childrearing. So although not directly remunerated, they have huge economic value.</p> <p>However, recognising women\u2019s unpaid care work is not enough to achieve women\u2019s economic empowerment. Investment in care infrastructure is also needed to free women\u2019s time to earn an income when they want to.</p> <p>And where women\u2019s care burden is alleviated by paid services, the priority is to improve the frequently low status, pay and working conditions of carers who are \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 overwhelmingly women and girls.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a9ea2dc13760be674324799805e6802083bf839d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9ea2dc13760be674324799805e6802083bf839d/0_0_2500_1250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Infographic from ODI\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Across the developing world, one in five men and one in 10 women owns a business.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ODI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Myth 2: women\u2019s economic participation is the same as women\u2019s economic empowerment</strong></h2> <p>Getting women into the workforce is an important step. But empowerment is limited when women enter the labour market on unfavourable terms. This includes women\u2019s engagement in exploitative, dangerous or stigmatised work as well as low pay and job insecurity.</p> <p>Our analysis shows that having a good-quality job is \u201cessential\u201d or \u201cvery important\u201d to men and women alike \u2013 on average, over 90% across 17 African and Middle Eastern countries surveyed in 2009 agreed. But in those countries, an average of only 14% of women that same year were engaged in full-time formal employment \u2013 a typical marker of a \u201cgood\u201d job.</p> <p>Tailored interventions can support women\u2019s entry into better, more profitable and empowering work, such as investing in education and training, and removing legal restrictions to women\u2019s employment and ability to set up businesses.</p> <p>Better working conditions are also essential. For this, improving infrastructure and safety \u2013 both at the workplace and on the journey there \u2013 is critical, including for informal workers.</p> <h2><strong>Myth 3: there is an automatic win-win between gender equality and wider development outcomes</strong></h2> <p>There is overwhelming evidence that gender equality will help reach SDG targets on economic growth, family poverty reduction and human development. But it doesn\u2019t always work the other way. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Focused effort is needed to ensure economic empowerment delivers for women as well as families, societies and economies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a recent <a href=\"http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E/CN.6/2015/3\">UN secretary general report</a> confirms, many governments assume that faster growth will support gender equality, despite clear <a href=\"http://www.ids.ac.uk/files/dmfile/Wp417.pdf\">evidence</a> to the contrary.</p> <p>Therefore, focused effort is needed to ensure that economic empowerment delivers for women as well as families, societies and economies. Making a positive difference in the lives of half of the world\u2019s population is a worthy objective in itself.</p> <p>This means making gender equality an explicit concern across development policy, including labour and macroeconomic policy. And <a href=\"http://www.gsdrc.org/professional-dev/gender-responsive-budgeting/\">gender-responsive budgeting</a> is a good way to assess the impacts of economic policy on equality and empowerment \u2013 positive examples of this include <a href=\"http://gender-financing.unwomen.org/en/highlights/gender-responsive-budgets-case-of-morocco\">Morocco</a> and <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-24496-9_9\">Nepal</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Myth 4: what works for one group of women will work for another</strong></h2> <p>Many of the barriers to women\u2019s economic empowerment \u2013 such lack of access to property, assets and financial services, insufficient social protection and women\u2019s unpaid care burdens \u2013 exist across countries. But women\u2019s experiences of them differ vastly, depending on their particular demographic, economic or cultural context. Women shouldn\u2019t be treated as a uniform group.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.odi.org/publications/8275-review-evaluation-approaches-methods-used-by-interventions-women-girls-economic-empowerment\">Evidence reviews</a> confirm that while lessons should be learned from successful initiatives, direct replication is seldom entirely effective.

For example, our research shows that across 67 developing countries that Gallup surveyed in 2009, on average one in five men disagreed that women can hold any job that they are qualified for outside the home.</p> <p>These kind of discriminatory attitudes limit women\u2019s engagement in jobs they want \u2013 even when they are qualified for them. So in short, progress cannot be made without changing the wider cultural, economic and political factors that limit women\u2019s economic empowerment.</p> <p><em>This post was <a href=\"https://www.odi.org/comment/10421-five-myths-about-womens-economic-empowerment\">originally published by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI)</a>. </em></p> <p><em>Abigail Hunt is a research officer within ODI\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.odi.org/programmes/development-progress\">Development Progress</a> project. </em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

  "<h2>What is the aim of the deal?</h2> <p>To bring a sustainable peace to war that has raged insatiably for five years and shows little sign of slowing. Syria\u2019s war has become especially complex and destructive and could stay that way for many years yet. The effect outside Syria\u2019s borders, of refugees and the creep of global terror, continues to raise the stakes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/12/life-saving-un-aid-regularly-fails-reach-besieged-syrians\">Lifesaving UN aid regularly fails to reach besieged Syrians</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One concern for everyone involved has been the gradual blending of extremist groups among the mainstream anti-Assad rebels. The deal aims to disentangle this, isolating the extremists and providing aid to other groups. Russia and the US say this will ensure the mainstream groups are not bombed. For the first 48 hours, fighting was meant to stop in areas held by non-extremists and aid was supposed to be delivered to cities under siege.</p> <h2>Has the ceasefire worked so far?</h2> <p>Violence has dropped markedly across the country. Air strikes in particular have stopped, and the streets of Idlib, Damascus and Aleppo are now busier than for many months. However, aid deliveries, which were a key component of the plan, have not been allowed into opposition-held east Aleppo. Syrian troops have blocked UN trucks from entering the only access road. Syrian officials say all aid runs should be co-ordinated through Damascus. This is in contravention to the Russian/US deal. By Friday, Russia said that Syrian troops had moved back from the only access route, the Castello Road. The US said it could not confirm this. A continued hold-up in aid will put serious stress on the deal.</p> <h2>Why did it take so long to broker?</h2> <p>Trust has been impossible to build. Every previous multilateral attempt at a ceasefire has failed. Neither side has been willing to share power. The Syrian regime has preferred starvation sieges and widespread bombing of civilian areas to negotiations. The opposition has been unable to put forward a credible political alternative to rule Syria and failed to press home its early battlefield gains. Meanwhile, the goals of the foreign stakeholders in the conflict \u2013 Turkey, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the US \u2013 are mostly in competition with each other.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/syria-zip/giv-22601SFKP0dIYo8d3/\" data-alt=\"Syria control\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/syria-zip/giv-22601SFKP0dIYo8d3/\">Syria control</a> </figure>  <h2>Has it proven difficult to implement?</h2> <p>Russia and the US have had next to no common ground since Vladimir Putin sent his air force to prop up Assad in September 2015. The year since has seen Russia largely aim its firepower at opposition units, including US-vetted groups. It has at times also attacked Jabhat al-Nusra (which renamed itself Jabhat Fatah al-Sham after it announced a split from al-Qaida) and Isis.</p> <p>Russia\u2019s aim has been to ensure that Assad cannot lose and to give the Syrian leader an advantage in subsequent negotiations. The US, meanwhile, has eschewed a lead role in the war, confining its involvement to defeating Isis in north-eastern Syria, using Kurdish forces as a proxy infantry supported by its air force.</p> <p>Opposition groups are deeply sceptical of the deal. They say that neither superpower has acted in good faith. And they believe it favours Assad. Ousting the jihadis among them means giving up a layer of security that they don\u2019t believe will be filled by either side.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/11/syrian-people-of-aleppo-prepare-for-eid-under-siege\">People of Aleppo prepare for Eid festival under siege</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>What does each side want?</h2> <p>The US has been pushing for far greater humanitarian aid into areas besieged by the Syrian regime, as well as a stop to the bombing. Aleppo and parts of Damascus are central to this. Russia says it is willing to spare non-extremist opposition groups, but wants to know where they are. A joint US/Russian operation is central to determining future targets and Russia has said it will rein in the Syrian air force. If calm persists, Moscow says moves could be made to a political transition, the form of which is not yet clear.</p> <p>The opposition insists that civilian areas, which have been systematically targeted across much of the country, be spared, and that sieges of up to 18 rebel areas be lifted.</p> <h2>Is the ceasefire a path to a viable solution?</h2> <p>No political path is yet apparent, and this is another criticism of the deal. However, the ceasefire is being pitched as a trust-building measure, a necessary step before ways to put an end to the crisis can be meaningfully discussed. Previous summits in Geneva, where the Kerry/Lavrov pact was announced, have ended in spectacular failure. If the protagonists start to believe that outright victory is impossible, then there may be breathing space for negotiations. If the ceasefire holds, it could force that realisation. Therein lies its purpose.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

But they have suffered from the axing of key tax relief, increasingly complex regulations and the slashing of the feed-in tariffs meant to support the growth of solar panels.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/09/uk-will-miss-its-2020-renewable-energy-targets-warn-mps\">MPs told ministers on Friday</a> that key targets for renewable energy by 2020 were unlikely to be met<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/09/uk-will-miss-its-2020-renewable-energy-targets-warn-mps\">.</a></p> <p>The revelations come even as polls continue to show strong support for community renewable energy generation, with two-thirds of people surveyed by Co-operative Energy saying they would support community-owned renewable projects such as wind turbines and solar farms, and only 8% objecting.</p> <p>Nearly six in 10 people thought the government should U-turn on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/05/treasury-tax-plans-will-decimate-community-energy-projects\">the axing of tax relief on investments in community renewable energy</a>, which has been one of the key factors in discouraging new projects.</p> <p>Just over half of people would support a wind turbine within two miles of their home, and 61% would support a solar farm.</p> <p>Co-operative Energy and the Energy Saving Trust calculate that a 25p annual surcharge on consumer energy bills would pay for community renewable schemes to increase from only 200MW of generation capacity today to more than 3GW.</p> <p>Ramsay Dunning, managing director at Co-operative Energy, said: \u201cThis poll data shows that the government\u2019s recent hostility to further growth in onshore wind turbines and solar farms is out of kilter with the vast majority of the UK public, including Conservative party supporters. People want to see growth in local community owned projects.\u201d</p> <p>Ed Mayo, secretary-general of Co-operatives UK, the trade body which has 120 community organisations as members, said the government\u2019s changes meant people were being discouraged from schemes that provided a wide range of benefits and enjoy strong local support.</p> <p>\u201cLocal communities have put in extraordinary efforts to encourage clean renewable energy in the face of extraordinary barriers put in their way by national politicians,\u201d he said. \u201cThis hopeful and grassroots movement [has been] dealt a hammer blow, causing confusion and bringing growth to a virtual standstill.\u201d</p> <p>One example is Chester Community Energy, which aims to put 50kw of solar panels on a council-owned leisure centre. Fortunately for the organisers, they were in time to secure the old higher feed-in tariff rates before they were reduced. Without this boost, the scheme would not have gone ahead. Francesca Moore, a founding director, said: \u201cWe would not have done it. We would not have been able to give a return to investors. We might have been able to squeeze one percent but that\u2019s not enough for people and we wouldn\u2019t have been able to generate a community energy fund.\u201d</p> <p>Other proposed projects, including those by established community groups, are also facing financial troubles. Will Cottrell, chairman of Brighton Energy Co-operative which has raised more than \u00a31m, said new projects were not feasible. \u201cJanuary\u2019s feed-in tariff cuts mean that new projects are not financially viable. What\u2019s the point in starting a community energy scheme when you can\u2019t offer members interest [payments on their investment] or community funds?\u201d</p>",

That\u2019s the whole point of having this \u2013 that people can go to their faucets and drink treated, safe water.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018A failed organization\u2019</h2> <p>In the last five years, the Pittsburgh water and sewer authority has been a source of mounting discontent. <br></p> <p>One local politician called the authority a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2011/09/12/Major-inadequacies-reported-at-PWSA/stories/201109120175\">failed organization</a>\u201d, after an <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3104667-JG-2009-PWSA-RDM-Report.html\">auditor\u2019s report</a> found PWSA failed to plan, respond to service calls or retain senior executives. In 20 years, the organization lost 13 executive directors, three financial officers, and five engineering directors, according to a copy of the report obtained by the Guardian.</p> <p>In 2008, PWSA borrowed more than $400m in variable rate bonds just as the market collapsed. This year, debt payments alone accounted for 44% of the authority\u2019s operating budget.</p> <p>By 2010, the water agency was struggling with what seemed like an invasion of cancer-causing chemicals called trihalomethanes, formed when salty fracking wastewater came into contact with treated drinking water.</p> <p>In an effort to reduce brominated trihalomethanes, the PWSA dropped chlorine levels, one of several factors Stanley States, the director of water quality at PWSA until 2014, believes led to increased lead levels.</p> <p>In 2012, the struggling agency brought in <a href=\"http://www.post-gazette.com/business/businessnews/2013/07/05/Veolia-produces-savings-cultural-shift-at-Pittsburgh-water-authority/stories/201307050130\">Veolia North America</a>, a French corporation, to manage the city\u2019s water supply. The same company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/22/michigan-flint-water-crisis-lockwood-andrews-newnam-veolia\">is being sued in Michigan</a> for allegedly failing to warn officials about lead risks to <a href=\"http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3100434-JG-Veolia-Flint-Bid-2015.html\">Flint\u2019s water</a>.</p> <p>After <a href=\"http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3100433-JG-Veolia-Bid-PWSA-July-2012.html\">Veolia took over</a> management of the city\u2019s water, the chemical used to control corrosion of metals, such as lead, was changed. Typically, it takes months for a water department to change corrosion control methods, because <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3100425-JG-PWSA-Emails-John-Quigly.html\">changes can cause lead spikes</a>. Feasibility studies must be conducted, rounds of testing completed, state agencies notified and their approval sought.</p> <p>Instead, PWSA changed the corrosion control to save money in <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3100421-JG-Notice-of-Violation-PWSA.html\">violation of state law</a>, <a href=\"http://files.dep.state.pa.us/PublicParticipation/Public%20Participation%20Center/PubPartCenterPortalFiles/DEPWebinars/Water/DEP%20Webinar%20on%20Pittsburgh%20Water-20160425%201800-1.mp4\">state authorities said</a> (pdf).

Veolia denies responsibility.</p> <p>\u201cVeolia did not and would not prioritize cost savings ahead of effective corrosion control methods,\u201d said Karole Colangelo, a spokeswoman for the company. Veolia had left Pittsburgh by April 2016.</p> <p>At the same time, rates for water in the city rose precipitously. In 2013, the board approved a 20% hike <a href=\"http://www.pgh2o.com/rates\">over four years</a>, putting the <a href=\"http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2013/10/12/Pittsburgh-water-authority-sets-4-year-rate-hikes/stories/201310120025\">average residential water bill of 4,000 gallons at $50.32 a month</a> by 2017, according to the Post-Gazette. That would make Pittsburgh\u2019s water more than triple the average midwest cost, based on figures from 2015 provided by the American Water Works Association.</p> <p>By 2015, much of Veolia\u2019s tenure in the city had been marred by persistent billing issues related to new water meters. Up to <a href=\"http://triblive.com/news/allegheny/10142854-74/pwsa-billing-donahoe\">50,000 erroneous bills</a> were issued as a result of Veolia\u2019s attempted updates to 77,000 water meters.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3100427-JG-PWSA-Lawsuit-Complaint.html\">class action lawsuit</a> cited a <a href=\"http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2015/05/26/Millvale-resident-files-suit-against-Pittsburgh-Water-and-Sewer-Authority-over-meter-problems/stories/201505260132\">$2,300 bill for a vacant property</a> which already had water off, while University of Pittsburgh Medical Center allegedly <a href=\"http://www.wtae.com/investigations/big-water-customers-owe-millions-in-delinquent-bills/36282202\">owed more than $436,000</a>.

In fact, my own household, we haven\u2019t received a bill in months.\u201d</p> <p>And under Veolia\u2019s management, PWSA\u2019s new executive director, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jameslgood\">James Good</a>, a longtime Veolia employee and former private water lobbyist, became the <a href=\"http://triblive.com/news/adminpage/8376153-74/annual-board-director\">second-highest paid public employee</a> in the region. He earned <a href=\"http://https//www.documentcloud.org/documents/3100418-JG-James-Good-Employment-Agreement-PWSA.html\">$240,000 a year</a> with generous benefits.</p> <p>The announcement about the corrosion control change apparently caught even Good by surprise, who said in a public meeting that \u201cI guess we were further along than I thought,\u201d according to the <a href=\"http://triblive.com/news/allegheny/9844246-74/lead-pwsa-soda\">Tribune-Review</a>.</p> <h2>Legal violations emerge</h2> <p>Unlike in Flint, Michigan, where sudden changes in water chemistry caused a spike, lead levels in Pittsburgh\u2019s tap water rose steadily for 12 years, alongside cancer-causing chemicals from fracking waste. </p> <p>By 2013, 14.8 parts per billion of lead were found in tap water, teetering on the edge of the federal limit of 15 parts per billion.That level is meant to warn water authorities that methods to control pipe corrosion are not working. Pittsburgh blew past 15 parts per billion in its most recent tests. </p> <p>There is no safe level of lead. In childhood, exposure diminishes IQ and can lead to behavioral and developmental problems. Federal limits for lead in drinking water are based only on water chemistry. </p> <p>In fact, some of the most pioneering lead research in the country was conducted in Pittsburgh, where Dr Herbert Needleman x-rayed the bones of 212 boys, and found that those with higher lead measurements, \u201cexhibited more delinquent, aggressive, internalizing, and externalizing behavior than otherwise similar boys\u201d, according to a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=7&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4yYL4-v3OAhXFkx4KHXgIDVoQFghSMAY&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.harvard.edu%2Ffiles%2Fjfeigenbaum%2Ffiles%2Ffeigenbaum_muller_lead_crime.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNHDBHU55GvWK_WxUF3JldxQsj7lsA&amp;sig2=ykrXZ8uuGzX1eBzG3K04dA&amp;bvm=bv.131783435,d.dmo\">recent paper by Harvard economist James Feigenbaum</a> (pdf).</p> <p>Allegheny County, of which Pittsburgh is the seat, still has some of the highest reported rates of elevated lead levels in Pennsylvania.

Failure to implement corrosion control is believed to be the reason for lead contamination in Flint, Michigan. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>But when PWSA<strong> </strong>tested city homes this summer<strong>,</strong> <a href=\"http://www.pgh2o.com/release?id=6278\">17 of 100</a> Pittsburgh homes had lead levels above the 15 parts per billion limit, some by a factor of five.</p> <p>Remarkably, lead levels crept upward despite that PWSA\u2019s failure to test homes with the highest risk of lead contamination. </p> <p>Though Pittsburgh was supposed to test 50 homes at high risk for lead contamination every three years, it tested only <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3104668-JG-Copy-of-2004-LCR-Submission.html\">22 in 2004</a>, and <a href=\"http://https//www.documentcloud.org/documents/3100415-JG-2010-LCR-Testing.html\">24 in 2010</a>. The remainder were lower-risk homes. In 2012, local news station <a href=\"http://www.wtae.com/investigations/Is-your-water-being-properly-tested-for-lead/12543822\">WTAE</a> found that 40 out of 50 test sites belonged to water department employees, and were concentrated in two neighborhoods. </p> <p>States, the former water quality director at PWSA, said despite lackluster testing in Pittsburgh, his department was not trying to flout regulations.</p> <p>\u201cI would have liked 30 years ago to take all the lead service lines out,\u201d said States, adding that he believed water departments should stop \u201cMickey mousing around\u201d with trying to control lead with chemicals. </p> <p>But under his leadership, Pittsburgh also failed to test the required number of high-risk homes for lead, and said he felt \u201cI\u2019d have been fired\u201d if Pittsburgh exceeded federal limits for lead. </p> <p>Now that lead levels exceeded federal limits in Pittsburgh, the PWSA is required to <a href=\"http://publicsource.org/investigations/pittsburgh-has-replace-some-lead-water-lines-authorities-have-find-them-first#.V8neAJMYii4\">replace lead service lines</a>.</p> <p>Problematically, the piecemeal approach undertaken by the water department can cause lead spikes too. The city began replacing parts of lead service lines, known as a partial replacement. Some experts believe the practice should be banned, and similar line replacements are now the subject of class action lawsuits in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/03/water-lead-testing-cheats-philadelphia-flint-crisis\">Chicago and Philadelphia</a>. Pittsburgh has already performed 99 such replacements.</p> <p>\u201cThey are over the lead action level now, even after re-implementing corrosion control \u2013 and it is anyone\u2019s guess how bad lead levels were before switching back,\u201d said Virginia Tech professor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/27/michigan-employees-manipulate-water-samples-lead-testing\">Marc Edwards, who helped uncover the lead crisis in Flint</a>. </p> <p>\u201cOver the last year, the Pennsylvania DEP has repeatedly understated lead-in-water risks, and they have also defended test methods throughout the state that can hide high lead in water levels,\u201d he said, referring to how the state allowed use of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/03/water-lead-testing-cheats-philadelphia-flint-crisis\">discredited testing methods</a>. \u201cIt appears Pennsylvania residents will have to look elsewhere for honest answers \u2013 just like residents in Flint last year.\u201d</p> <p>State regulators told the Guardian: \u201cDEP continues to work with PWSA to determine the effects of the switch to pipeline infrastructure.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cResidents, especially those in older homes, are strongly encouraged to take simple steps to reduce possible lead in their drinking water: run the tap and use cold water for cooking/baby formula prep,\u201d regulators said. </p> <h2>Brown water persists</h2> <p>For some residents, warnings of elevated lead levels came alongside a new phenomenon: brown water. </p> <p>\u201cEverything we do filtered, even brushing my teeth I do with bottled water,\u201d said a resident who did not want to be named, because she works in public service. \u201cI\u2019m using bottled water to brush my teeth.\u201d She has lived in the neighborhood 26 years.

  "<p>For years, the BBC has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/feb/27/bbc-false-balance-fox-news-global-warming\">criticised</a> for the false balance of its climate change coverage. And for years, the BBC has apparently been doing \u201c<a href=\"http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/our_work/science_impartiality/trust_conclusions.pdf#page=3\">ongoing work</a>\u201d to fix it. So far, however, this \u2018reform\u2019 has been more like a triumph of the middling. Yes, the BBC may broadcast less outright misinformation, but as a scientist and a citizen, I still feel let down by its continually careless handling of climate denial - most recently two weeks ago. This nod to mediocrity is a disservice to science, to public trust, and to the biggest news story in the world. And it is a huge, missed opportunity.</p> <p>As a young PhD graduate working on climate change solutions, I am confronted daily by a world where the warnings of science are undercut by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/aug/17/fox-news-inner-struggle-with-climate-misinformation\">Fox \u2018News\u2019</a> and its <a href=\"http://www.ecowatch.com/wall-street-journal-willing-to-print-truth-about-climate-change-if-you-1891174269.html\">ilk</a>. It is a very different world to the trustworthy BBC broadcasts of David Attenborough and the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures that I grew up with, which helped inspire me to become a scientist. But as a recent BBC News segment by Science Editor David Shukman sadly reminded me, those worlds can too easily collide.</p> <p>Shukman\u2019s broadcast was an interesting one. An important perspective on the \u201cpolitical battle over the future of fuel\u201d in the swing state of Ohio, and its implications for U.S. energy policy. I transcribed it <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nnTclsQtlshkrj7Xz1XU0GoyFD_yVUlGpoI-9Nktf_M/edit\">here</a>. It was all pretty benign until, halfway through, something in Shukman\u2019s narration caught my ear (emphasis mine): </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>The problem with coal comes when you burn it. It releases carbon dioxide, which is <strong>blamed </strong>for global warming. <strong>Donald Trump says</strong> that isn\u2019t a problem. But <strong>Hillary Clinton says</strong> it is, and she\u2019s offering a greener future instead ... </em></p> <p><em><strong>While the debate rages over whether climate change is a threat or not</strong> \u2026</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Shukman\u2019s accompanying BBC <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37034052\">blog post</a> beats the same drum, outlining the candidates\u2019 \u201cstarkly different visions of global warming\u201d: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>The Democratic Party contender says she believes in the science of climate change. By contrast, the Republican candidate talks down the threat of rising temperatures.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>As harmless as they sound, words like \u201cblamed\u201d, \u201cdebate\u201d, and \u201cbelieve\u201d - without careful context - are the <a href=\"https://www.climatecommunication.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Somerville-Hassol-Physics-Today-2011.pdf#page=4\">currency of public confusion</a>. \u201cWho, exactly, blames carbon dioxide for global warming?\u201d we are forced to wonder. Clinton? Liberals? Scientists? And who disagrees? Trump? Other politicians? Some scientists too? Most importantly, who\u2019s right in this blame game? </p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeoffreySupran/status/769574268933922816\">For the record</a>, carbon dioxide is not \u201cblamed\u201d for global warming - it \u201ccauses\u201d it. That is the unequivocal scientific <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002\">consensus</a> the world over.</p> <p>Confusion, in turn, <a href=\"http://eiui.ca/current-literature-the-conflict-between-journalistic-balance-and-scientific-credibility-in-science-reporting/\">fosters</a> doubt. And in the <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v465/n7299/full/465686a.html\">strategic</a> words of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/27/what-happened-to-lobbyists-who-tried-reshape-us-view-climate-change\">Big Oil</a> and Big Tobacco, \u201cDoubt is our product.\u201d Doubt <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/science/about/publications/climate-change.aspx\">promotes</a> apathy. It demotes the importance of climate change to the electorate. It means we demand less of our leaders, and less of ourselves. And it is all that those who <a href=\"http://www.merchantsofdoubt.org/\">oppose</a> action on climate change need to win. </p> <p>The psychology of climate communication is of course <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/behavioural-insights/climate-change-consensus-who-cares\">not</a> black-and-white, but as one <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v1/n9/full/nclimate1295.html\">peer-reviewed study</a> summarised:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>In short, people who believe that scientists disagree on global warming tend to feel less certain that global warming is occurring, and show less support for climate policy. </em></p> </blockquote> <p>The BBC should know better, because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/jul/20/bbc-climate-change-science-coverage\">over</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/02/mps-criticise-bbc-false-balance-climate-change-coverage\">over</a>, it has been indicted for mistakes like this. In fact, Shukman\u2019s position of Science Editor was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/16/bbc-david-shukman-science-editor\">created</a> to address mistakes like this. </p> <p>As a cross-party Science and Technology Committee investigation in 2014 <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmsctech/254/25406.htm\">put it</a>,</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>This lack of distinction within BBC News between proven scientific facts and opinions or beliefs is problematic.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>It was d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu of what the BBC\u2019s own governing body had <a href=\"http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/our_work/science_impartiality/science_impartiality.pdf#page=3\">concluded</a> three years earlier, and came just months before yet another critical BBC Trust review in 2014: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>The BBC has a duty to reflect the weight of scientific agreement but it should also reflect the existence of critical views appropriately.

My point is that these subtleties of reporting matter too. They help make the difference between fair balance and false balance - a difference the BBC has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/feb/27/bbc-false-balance-fox-news-global-warming\">struggled</a> to respect. Repeated day after day, their additive creep must be guarded against to avoid the innocuous becoming the insidious. </p> <p>The public absolutely deserve to hear the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/sep/06/conservative-media-bias-is-inflating-american-climate-denial-and-polarization\">debate</a>. But they also deserve to know that the debate is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/oct/04/global-warming-debate-not-about-science\">political, not scientific</a>. They deserve to know that science-wise, one side is right and the other is wrong. They deserve to know that scientists <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002\">unanimously agree</a> that humans are causing climate change. And they deserve to know that President Trump <a href=\"http://content.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2016/07/report-trump-would-be-only-world-leader-deny-climate-science\">would be</a> the only leader in the world to oppose that consensus. </p> <p>Pat Moynihan once said, \u201cEveryone is entitled to their own opinions, but not their own facts.\u201d So how can the BBC avoid its damaging lapses, where the two get blurred? </p> <p>Extrapolating from the \u201cdisappoint[ment]\u201d of the Parliamentary committee chair, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/02/mps-criticise-bbc-false-balance-climate-change-coverage\">Andrew Miller</a>, \u201cthat the BBC does not ensure all of its [programs] and presenters reflect the actual state of climate science in its output\u201d, here\u2019s one idea: The BBC could adopt a new reporting protocol, whereby whenever individuals express opinions on climate change of any kind, or perhaps whenever the subject arises at all, reporters must include a one-sentence summary of the <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002\">scientific consensus</a> in their story. </p> <p>This (partial) solution would give journalists an uncontroversial way to apply the recommendation of Miller\u2019s committee \u201cto challenge statements that stray too far from science.\u201d And <a href=\"http://eiui.ca/current-literature-the-conflict-between-journalistic-balance-and-scientific-credibility-in-science-reporting/\">empirical studies</a> suggest that while this approach would not be enough to fully offset the <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v1/n9/full/nclimate1295.html?wt.ec_id=nclimate-201112\">crippling confusion</a> caused by \u201c<a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mediapolicyproject/2014/04/02/false-balance-in-climate-reporting-reveals-bbcs-sensitivity-to-political-pressure/\">falsely balanced</a>\u201d reporting, it <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013EF000226/full\">would help</a>.

  "<p>Brainstorming is a waste of time and nearly always fails to result in good ideas. It is also outdated and ineffective.</p> <p>The term was introduced more than 50 years ago in <a href=\"http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/history-advertising-no-145-alex-osborns-brainstormers/1362408\" rel=\"nofollow\">Applied Imagination</a>, a book by Alex Osborn (an advertising executive), which was published in 1953. It was a cutting-edge idea at the time. It thrived in offices where to-do lists were chalked on the blackboard in the director\u2019s office.<br></p> <p>The world of work has changed, and the office chalkboard is long gone \u2013 but, staggeringly, we\u2019re still stuck with brainstorming as the go-to process to help us identify new ideas for our business.<br></p> <p>Just five years after the process was developed, investigations proved the ineffectiveness of brainstorming. In 1958 Yale University ran a study to test brainstorming. Male undergraduates were divided into groups and given a number of creative puzzles. They were told that to solve the problems they must follow Osborn\u2019s guidelines for brainstorming.<br></p> <p>To provide a control group, the same number of male students were given the same puzzles and told to work alone. The students working on their own came up with around twice the number of ideas and their ideas were found to be more \u201cfeasible\u201d and \u201ceffective\u201d by the judges.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Fewer ideas of better quality will always be of more value than a lot of useless ideas</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 2012, <a href=\"http://soe.unc.edu/fac_research/faculty/sawyer.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">Keith Sawyer</a>, a psychologist from Washington University, summarised the findings on brainstorming: \u201cDecades of research have consistently shown that brainstorming groups think of far fewer ideas than the same number of people who work alone and later pool their ideas.\u201d<br></p> <p>Let\u2019s take a look at some of the brainstorming rules that have developed over time:<br></p> <h2>There are no dumb ideas, so encourage wild and exaggerated thinking</h2> <p>There are plenty of dumb ideas. When you encourage this type of thinking you end up with outcomes that are impractical and irrelevant.</p> <h2>Quantity counts at this stage, not quality</h2> <p>No it doesn\u2019t. Quality is always important. Fewer ideas of better quality will always be of more value than a lot of useless ideas.</p> <h2>Build on other people\u2019s ideas</h2> <p>Sometimes useful, but often it can lead you to bulk up a bad idea instead of coming up with something better.</p> <h2>Every person and every idea has equal worth</h2> <p>No, everyone has an equal opportunity to contribute something useful, and should be given the same amount of time to do so. But not all ideas will be of the same quality.</p> <h2>Only one person talking at a time</h2> <p>When you\u2019re trying to come up with ideas yourself, do you find it useful to be listening to someone else\u2019s at the same time? Brainstorming rules stipulate that there should only be one person talking at a time, but also that there\u2019s always someone talking. Your best ideas frequently come when you have moments of silence. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/aug/01/how-to-handle-critics-negative-feedback-entrepreneur\">How to handle your critics: 'It felt like a slap in the face'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you leave these rules behind, here\u2019s an alternative approach:<br></p> <h2>First, work out the question you\u2019re trying to answer</h2> <p>It should be one that when answered well could deliver significant benefit, and a clear plan, for your business. The scope of the question should be at a realistic level for the size of your business. Initially, don\u2019t try to think how it can be answered \u2013 just if it can be practically answered.<br></p> <h2>Be proactive</h2> <p>Don\u2019t gaze into space hoping for a serendipitous thought to pop into your head \u2013 it rarely happens. There are many <a href=\"http://creatingminds.org/tools/tools_all.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">creative thinking tools</a> online, so try several and find the ones that work best for you. Some people find that jotting down ideas on pen and paper is the easiest and most effective route for creative thinking. </p> <h2>Give yourself thinking time</h2> <p>You know when you come up with the best ideas; when you feel most energised and creative \u2013 so create a ritual around this. A local coffee shop is a good place to allocate blocks of 20-30 minutes for quality thinking. During these times, focus solely on the question and push all the other issues to one side.<br></p> <h2>Keep revisiting your question</h2> <p>Ever had an idea pop into your head from nowhere? That was because you had the question percolating in your mind and your subconscious was working on it in the background. A great killer question places an issue deep within your mind, and because you repeatedly return to it over several days or weeks this keeps your subconscious mind active on the subject.<br></p> <p>Brainstorming assumes thinking is a team sport, but it isn\u2019t. Because teams don\u2019t think \u2013 individuals do. Dedicate time for solo thinking in an environment, and at a time, that\u2019s most effective for you \u2013 and encourage your team to do the same.<br></p> <p><em>Chris Thomason is managing director of Sprint for Growth.

  "<p>A year ago today, I remember being very nervous indeed.

In the past year, the Tories been forced into retreat after retreat. On personal independence payments, tax credits, police cuts and Saudi prison contracts, a sharp, oppositional stance has produced results.</p> <p>As a member of the most diverse shadow cabinet in history, I witness every day the change that is happening at the heart of British politics. As we hold the government to account over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\" title=\"\">Panama Papers</a> and tax avoidance by Google and other multinationals, and put forward a genuine economic alternative, we are winning the argument that austerity is a political choice, not an economic necessity.

There will have to be debates about how far that agenda of investment goes, and debates too on issues where there is genuine disagreement, but as a movement we are perfectly capable of resolving our differences democratically.</p> <p>After the leadership election, we must turn this unity in policy into unity of action.

  "<p>Today is the last day of the annual <a href=\"http://www.aec.at/festival/en/\">Ars Electronica festival</a>, held in Linz Austria. Over the past 37 years it has aimed to provide an environment of \u201cexperimentation, evaluation and reinvention\u201d in the area broadly defined as art, technology and society. <a href=\"http://www.aec.at/prix/en/\">Its top award, the Golden Nica</a>, honours forward-thinking work with broad cultural impact, in an effort to \u201cspotlight the ideas of tomorrow.\u201d However, the prize, hailed by many in the field as the top honour for artists working with science and technology, has a gender problem.</p> <p>This was uncovered by artist <a href=\"http://deweyhagborg.com/bio\">Heather Dewey-Hagborg</a> after she received an honourable mention in the Hybrid Arts Category last year. The prize\u2019s <a href=\"http://archive.aec.at/prix/\">online archive</a> showed that throughout its 29-year history, 9 out of 10 Golden Nica have been awarded to men.</p> <p>It was only weeks before the festival and her work was already shipped. Unable to withdraw, Heather began discussing the problem with other artists to develop a plan. A painstaking review of the statistics confirmed that more than 90% of winners self-identified as male. Although fewer women had applied, there was no shortage of great female artists among the applicants: the archive included internationally recognized women such as Rebecca Gomperts, Lillian Schwartz, Mariam Ghani, Pinar Yoldas, Daisy Ginsberg, Holly Herndon, Kaho Abe, and Ai Hasegawa. In response, Heather and the other artists developed a social media campaign: #<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/KissMyArs?src=hash\">KissMyArs</a>.</p> <p>The campaign spread quickly, generating a host of strong responses. While many were supportive, some voiced disagreement, including 2013 Golden Nica winner Memo Atken. He <a href=\"https://medium.com/@memoakten/kissmyars-866cc1e12f5f#.41wutltvh\">commented on</a> what he viewed as the campaigners\u2019 misrepresentation of statistics, focusing only on the winners rather than diversity of submissions. After being confronted with a significant backlash to these comments on social media, pointing out among other things that the prize was not a lottery and there was no shortage of impressive female applicants, Atken apologised.</p> <p>On the flip side artists <a href=\"https://twitter.com/golan/status/640208490271797248\">Golan Levin</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mushon/status/639904718739869696\">Mushon Zer-Aviv</a> critiqued the campaign as not being radical enough for their liking and calling for a \u201cfeminist revolution across media arts.\u201d</p> <h2>Women\u2019s experiences in art and technology</h2> <p>In an insular field like art and technology, making a statement means that you risk your career. Heather Dewey-Hagborg writes, \u201cMy participation in this campaign stemmed from a frustration that this highly esteemed prize was one designed for men, and others need not apply. As women in art and tech we are consistently under-recognised, under-funded, and written out of history. We are made to feel that our work must simply not be as good as that of our male peers, and if only we made <em>better work</em> we would attain the same accolades and accomplishments as they did. Last year I finally realised that this was bullshit.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.placesiveneverbeen.com/about/\">Addie Wagenknecht</a>, a collaborator on the campaign, became aware of issues of gender bias in the tech industry when she joined a game development company out of college. Constantly surrounded by \u201ca few thousand men\u201d at game conferences started to feel suffocating, although a decade later she felt a shift in attitudes, not only toward women but also people of colour and from LGBTQ communities.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Addie sees Ars Electronica\u2019s top prize, as \u201cthe perfect metaphor of how women are represented\u201d. It is a golden sculpture of an idealised female form, with her head cut off: \u201cI find the irony in the \u2018award\u2019 being of a headless woman, to speak volumes towards how we commodify women within the communities in which we claim to be honouring.\u201d She sees the male-bias of the prize as connected to a larger systemic problem which excludes women from exhibitions, under-cuts and discounts women\u2019s work in galleries, and ultimately cuts women out of the larger canon of contemporary art. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bb8dd0dd2c3c82ac59e611e872b9cf0b75cdf6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bb8dd0dd2c3c82ac59e611e872b9cf0b75cdf6f/0_38_1200_1500/800.jpg\" alt=\"Golden Nica Award to Creative Commons (Prix Ars Electronica Net Vision 2004)\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Golden Nica Award to Creative Commons (Prix Ars Electronica Net Vision 2004)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mikegr at the English language Wikipedia/Wikmedia Commons</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Heather echoes Addie\u2019s experiences. She remembers \u201cwith horrific clarity when I became aware of myself as a \u2018woman in tech.\u2019\u201d Her college experience had been mostly female, and she was surprised by the change in tone in her first male-dominated work environment when she took a job as a software developer. At an after-work drinks event she casually found out that she was making substantially less money than her male colleagues, most of whom had less experience: \u201cAll at once in a single moment I became conscious of myself ... as a woman whose skills and experience and creativity were devalued. As a woman out of place.\u201d</p> <h2>Suggestions for positive change</h2> <p>Change is possible. At <a href=\"https://eyebeam.org/\">Eyebeam</a>, a prestigious art and technology centre in New York, the application process was recently revised to make it more accessible to underrepresented groups. This resulted in what they termed \u201c<a href=\"http://archive.eyebeam.org/projects/the-very-first-year\">the very first year</a>\u201d, the first time the number of women awarded residencies and fellowships outnumbered men. Eyebeam director Roddy Schrock explained that \u201cwe\u2019ve institutionally raised the flag\u201d on the issue of diversity.</p> <p>Realizing that women often devalue their own expertise and qualifications, that they tend to demure their skills in applications, and to have less visibility than male peers, Eyebeam developed a list of strategies for becoming more inclusive:</p> <ul> <li>Reach out to women with personal invitations to encourage applications.<br></li> <li>Change the application language to focus on process rather than product.<br></li> <li>Place more emphasis on the interview than the written application.<br></li> <li>Do independent research about the applicants.<br></li> <li>Once women are accepted, make a point to highlight their work to the media.<br></li> </ul> <p>These are tactics that could be deployed at almost any institution in any field. But since we know that both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2014/feb/14/women-academic-science-mps-commons-committee-report\">STEM careers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thewhitereview.org/art/redressing-the-balance-women-in-the-art-world/\">elite arts</a> can be inhospitable to women it is imperative that action is taken within art and technology. Yet to date Ars Electronica has not commented publicly on matters of inclusivity, nor have they taken strong measures to improve on their track record.</p> <p>Institutions like Ars Electronica have a tremendous opportunityto set a global example by highlighting diverse voices which run counter to the mainstream, and to open public dialogue around the problems, benefits, and tradeoffs new technology is bringing. If there is an \u201cask\u201d associated with the #KissMyArs campaign it is for marginalised artists to be given a seat at the table; to have a voice in helping reshape this competition into one that is at once more inclusive and more relevant.</p> <p><em>Heather Dewey-Hagbor</em><em>g, artist and bio-hacker</em></p> <p><em>Addie Wagenknecht, artist and founder of <a href=\"http://www.deeplab.net/#home\">Deep Lab</a></em></p> <p><em>Camilla M\u00f8rk R\u00f8stvik, art and science historian and postdoctoral researcher</em></p> <p><em>Kathy High, artist, curator and scholar</em></p> <p><em><br></em></p> <p><em>Update [21.09.16]: Eyebeam have asked us to clarify that, since the discussions<br> reflected in the comments above, their review policy has evolved<br> further.

But today their subject is Brit and Mobo award-winning rapper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tinie-tempah\">Tinie Tempah</a>, a musician who\u2019s more used to scanning lyric sheets than having his brain scanned in a university lab.</p> <p>For the experiment, they get subjects like Tinie to listen to music under laboratory conditions: hooked up to an EEG while having their brains scanned from the inside of an fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) machine \u2013 which bears some resemblance to a giant sci-fi donut.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"91d376146770fc416127c41fbc15a436761855be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91d376146770fc416127c41fbc15a436761855be/0_0_2560_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tinnie listens to music while having an fMRI scan of his brain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tinnie listens to music while having an fMRI scan of his brain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s always been a strong connection between music and emotion. We listen to sad songs when we\u2019re down, put upbeat music on to dance to when we\u2019re happy. It amplifies our emotions, punctuates the big moments in life, makes the everyday a bit more fun: we sing at weddings, we play music at funerals, commute with headphones on, lose ourselves in festival gigs.<br></p> <p>From their different perspectives, the scientists and musician both agree on music\u2019s emotional power.<br></p> <p>Nasuto argues that music has always had \u201ca very strong emotional affect on humans. There is a very primeval link between us and music \u2013 it has been with us for a very long time, probably the beginning of human culture.\u201d<br></p> <p>In scientific terms, Nasuto describes music as \u201ca very powerful type of stimulation which can evoke emotional responses\u201d, and it\u2019s this effect that has lead them to study how it works on the brain. If you can see what\u2019s happening inside someone\u2019s brain when they are listening to a happy or a sad song, then it\u2019s a starting point to understanding how music affects human beings.<br></p> <p>Of course, then you have to find a way to define everyday terms like \u201chappy\u201d or \u201csad\u201d in a way that makes sense in a laboratory; in other words, to find a way to quantify and measure emotions.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9396115a2224bb7526329f9107df87fd8e568844\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9396115a2224bb7526329f9107df87fd8e568844/0_0_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tinie Tempah puts on an EEG hat, which looks like a weird swimming cap with wires sticking out of it.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tinie Tempah puts on an EEG hat, which looks like a weird swimming cap with wires sticking out of it.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For their study, the team at Reading use a \u201cvalence arousal circumplex model\u201d \u2013 a graph which \u201cmaps all of the complexity of human emotions onto two axes.\u201d The valence axis, Daly explains, shows \u201chow pleasant or unpleasant an experience is\u201d, while the arousal axis measures \u201chow exciting or boring an experience is.\u201d In this way it\u2019s possible to plot an emotional response between the two. For example, \u201cfear is an emotion which is highly arousing and very low valence, both exciting and unpleasant\u201d says Daly, whereas \u201ccalm\u201d would be unarousing and low valence \u2013 a pleasant but not very exciting experience.<br></p> <p>By combining data sets, a fuller picture of what\u2019s happening when we experience emotions emerges; we can see what areas of the brain are being stimulated when our brains are listening to music, and how much activity there is. In other words, what your brain looks like \u201con music\u201d.<br></p> <p>In their studies, the scientists play their subjects a combination of classical and \u201csynthetic music\u201d \u2013 not electroclash or EDM, but music generated by a computer algorithm developed by Professor Eduardo Miranda, Dr Alexis Kirke and Dr Duncan Williams at Plymouth University that helps to create a controlled test (it\u2019s the abstract music you can hear playing in the interactive here).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/seat/music/interactive/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/seat/music/interactive/boot.js\" data-alt=\"interactive\"> </figure>  <p>The idea, says Nasuto, is to create music that\u2019s as near as possible to laboratory conditions; Plymouth\u2019s algorithmic music generation \u201cenables us to provide as simple as possible stimulus by reducing the complexity, but it also gives us a much stronger control on manipulating individual features.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Daly explains: \u201ctechnically the synthetic music is music, but it\u2019s not really the most exciting stuff to listen to, so we play classical music to all our participants to get a bit more of an in-depth look at how people respond to different types of music.<br></p> <p>\u201cYour emotional response to music changes for the second or third hearing \u2013 the first time you hear a piece of music you react differently. So if we can use generated music you can guarantee that they\u2019ve never heard that piece of music before. Whereas if we use real music, whether it\u2019s pop music or classical music, it\u2019s quite likely that the participant may have heard that piece of music before.\u201d<br></p> <p>Nasuto continues, \u201cmusic itself is a very complex acoustic signal or stimulus \u2013 it interacts with us on many different dimensions. It is an acoustic stimulus like anything you hear, but also it interacts with us on a cognitive level because we can appreciate the structure of the music, the patterning of the melody and so on.\u201d If they used normal music for the whole study it would be \u201cvery difficult to isolate and pinpoint the causes of particular emotional changes in the subject,\u201d he says.<br></p> <p>According to Daly, the test shows that \u201cwe\u2019re able to identify which regions of Tinie\u2019s brain are responding to music-induced emotion.\u201d As for bringing the worlds of science and music together to share their experience of emotion, perhaps the scientists have learned as much from Tinie as he has from the experiment.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2016/sep/12/the-science-of-sound-tinie-tempahs-brain-on-music\">The science of sound: Tinie Tempah\u2019s brain on music</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was interesting to listen to Tinie\u2019s explanation that when he comes to compose music it has to feel right for him \u2013 there is an element of a very intuitive, qualitative assessment which he seems to be using which refers to his personal feelings about how the music feels to him, a kind of body resonance with the music,\u201d says Nasuto. \u201cIt\u2019s not an assessment that is very explicitly cognitive \u2013 although perhaps there are some cognitive processes going on when he actually decides how to develop the piece of music. But whether he\u2019s satisfied with it or not goes back to this basic emotional response.\u201d<br></p> <p>For Tinie, his takeaway from the experience is more straightforward. \u201cWhether you\u2019re in a festival or at your house, music can make you come out of yourself, be like an ultimate version of yourself. It\u2019s interesting to know what affects my mood, what makes me happy. At the end of the day music is always going to be an emotional thing for me, it\u2019s a feeling.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>You probably won\u2019t remember me but I stood against you in Maidenhead in the 2001 general election. I was the Labour candidate returning to my home town, you were the local Tory MP secretly aiming for the very top; it was like the beginning of a really bad romcom. Anyway, I thought you ought to know what it was like growing up in your constituency under the grammar school system and how it had a negative effect on my family and others in the town for which, despite my best efforts, you are still the Conservative member of parliament.</p> <p>When I was at primary school, we read one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/28/in-priase-tove-jansson-euro-coin\">Tove Jansson</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/25/70th-anniversary-tove-jansson-moomins\">Moomin books</a>, and I remember it featured this huge comet that was heading straight towards them. It was terrifying, it was getting closer and closer, filling the sky and all their thoughts. Well, that\u2019s basically what the 11-plus felt like.

I remember my dad frantically driving us around Maidenhead before school, and Pat rushing into various newsagents and stationers\u2019 looking for a wooden ruler. He kept running out, increasingly terrified, saying: \u201cNo, they\u2019ve only got plastic ones \u2026\u201d and Dad would screech off in the car looking for another shop, aware that if Pat was late, he\u2019d get the cane for that. And even though I was only seven, I remember thinking \u201cThis is insane!\u201d</p> <p>My parents quickly came to the same conclusion and after six weeks Pat was put back into the state system, although the headmaster there said he had \u201clost his sparkle\u201d.</p> <p>In the event, Courthouse got him through his 11-plus, but of course the nature of the system was that most of his classmates had to be failed. We got a lift home from the mum of a girl in Pat\u2019s class. He climbed into the car and said: \u201cI passed my 11-plus!\u201d Then as an aside to Sarah\u2019s mum: \u201cSarah failed though.\u201d That\u2019s how Sarah\u2019s mum found out about her daughter\u2019s educational future. I feel there should be a new rule, Theresa, that when you talk about bringing back grammar schools, you have to add \u201cand secondary moderns for most children\u201d.</p> <p>It divided your constituency right down the middle. A year or two later Pat was cycling home in his grammar school uniform and was badly beaten up by two bigger boys from Gordon Road secondary modern (you won\u2019t know that one, it was closed down soon after).

Gunatillake wants to build a bridge between the two strands of mindfulness \u2013 traditional and digital \u2013 with teachers more involved in app design.</p> <p>With apps reaching more people than face-to-face teaching can, he says, \u201cnothing will influence how mindfulness is perceived and practised in our culture more in the next 20 years\u201d.</p>",

It showed that children from local state primary schools had been less successful than in previous years, while a higher proportion of privately educated pupils had passed.</p> <p>With two more years of test data and further evidence from CEM released under the Freedom of Information Act, the group claims the evidence against the test is stronger than ever. It shows a continuing strong bias against children from the most deprived postcodes (measured by the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_deprivation_affecting_children_index_%28UK%29\">income deprivation affecting children</a> \u2013 IDACI).</p> <p>Only weeks after the prime minister announced she would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/27/theresa-may-announces-audit-to-tackle-public-sector-racial-disparities\">scrutinising public services</a> for their promotion of racial equality, it also suggests the test is biased against children from certain minority ethnic backgrounds. Results from 2014 and 2015 show that, after white British children, the largest ethnic group of grammar school applicants in Buckinghamshire was Pakistani children, who made up 11% of the cohort. In 2015 only 10% of grammar school applicants from Pakistani heritage backgrounds passed the 11-plus, compared with 21% of children from white British backgrounds. According to the campaign group, disadvantage for some minority ethnic groups exists even when families aren\u2019t on low incomes.</p> <p>\u201cBME [black and minority ethic] disadvantage is very pronounced among those not eligible for free school meals, so it is not the case that some BME pupils have lower scores simply because more of them are eligible for free school meals,\u201d says Rebecca Hickman, founder member of the group.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/23/argument-for-grammar-schools-selective-education-theresa-may\">Got a good argument for\u00a0the return of grammar schools?

It suggested test outcomes might be related to either primary schooling, culture or the applicant\u2019s local community.</p> <p>Even with identical test results at the end of primary school, higher-attaining children from the poorer postcodes scored, on average, 20 marks less in the new Bucks test (the pass mark is 121 marks) than their better-off peers. The data suggests a similar bias against children from some BME groups, including Pakistani.</p> <p>In 2014 there were 276 Buckinghamshire children eligible for free school meals who took the 11-plus. Just 10 passed it.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.swbgs.com/\">Sir William Borlase\u2019s</a> grammar school, whose plans to expand into May\u2019s Maidenhead constituency are being supported by the PM, has only three children eligible for free school meals.</p> <p>\u201cBuckinghamshire is a particularly good area in which to analyse how the 11-plus test works in practice,\u201d says Hickman. \u201cUnlike other selective areas in England, all the children at Buckinghamshire state primary schools are entered into the 11-plus exam unless their parents opt out.</p> <p>\u201cSo if the test was resistant to coaching we should by now be seeing substantial narrowing of results between children from different backgrounds. The fact that the evidence shows the reverse raises uncomfortable questions about why a test that consistently selects on the basis of prior opportunity and social background is still allowed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4cc33513a46add77f842324e74870cf9e313439d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cc33513a46add77f842324e74870cf9e313439d/134_7_354_354/354.jpg\" alt=\"Rafiq Raja, Muslim Parents Association in High Wycombe\" width=\"354\" height=\"354\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rafiq Raja of the Muslim Parents Association: \u2018The 11-plus is a legalised form of discrimination\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>CEM has quietly withdrawn its brochure claiming that the test, which is believed to be worth <a href=\"http://schoolsweek.co.uk/campaigners-question-1m-tutor-proof-11-plus-tests/\">\u00a31m a year</a> to the university, can assess \u201cnatural\u201d ability. And <a href=\"https://www.dur.ac.uk/education/staff/profile/?id=614\">Prof Robert Coe</a>, director of CEM, says his researchers are still looking at why certain groups are not doing well in the test.</p> <p>\u201cThe concept of ability is very problematic and comes with a lot of other baggage. I wouldn\u2019t use the term \u2018natural ability\u2019 and we did remove it from our online material,\u201d he says. \u201cWhatever system you use it is imprecise, there are false positives and negatives and probably more of those than people realise.</p> <p>\u201cIf I was designing a system from scratch I wouldn\u2019t suggest creating grammar schools and I wouldn\u2019t support the expansion of grammars on the grounds of social mobility. But given that we still have them for political reasons, we are interested in trying to make the system fairer. Even though it is a murky world there are lots of things we can do to make the system better.\u201d</p> <p>However, the findings come as no surprise to Rafiq Raja, of the Muslim Parents Association in High Wycombe, which contains the three wards with the highest concentration of Pakistani heritage families in Buckinghamshire.</p> <p>\u201cGrammar schools do a good job for the pupils who gain admittance,\u201d he says. \u201cBut selection is having a negative impact on the majority of children, especially those from BME backgrounds where parents are aspirant but often see a glass ceiling, linked to their own experience, which limits their ambitions for their children. They may not know how to help their children, or be able to afford the extra coaching.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/04/school-divided-society-eu-referendum-segregating-children\">Much of Britain's bitter division began in school</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Raja believes the selection process can never be completely \u201cblind\u201d as the tests are inevitably culturally biased, and weighted towards English language skills in a community where families often still speak Punjabi or Urdu at home and children may get fewer extracurricular experiences. \u201cAs things stand, the 11-plus is a legalised form of discriminatory practice,\u201d says Raja.</p> <p>So will it ever be possible to overcome the impact of family background and environment on this type of selection process? According to <a href=\"https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=TISAA27\">Tina Isaacs</a>, senior lecturer in educational assessment at the UCL Institute of Education, the idea that ability is fixed is now discredited. And testing for \u201cfuture potential\u201d is fraught with difficulties.</p> <p>\u201cIn the 1940s and 50s most people believed that IQ was fixed,\u201d she says. \u201cMost reputable opinion now believes that there is a mix of heritability and environment in intelligence. Scientists differ about how much is genetic and how much is environmental but no one disputes that it is a mix of the two.\u201d</p> <p>Isaacs believes most 11-plus test providers have tried to ensure that individual tests questions are unbiased and culturally neutral though, like Coe, she admits there is inevitably some \u201cmeasurement error\u201d that is impossible to get rid of. This could be to do with a range of personal or local circumstances on the day.</p> <p>\u201cSo any reliable assessment of future potential would have to consist of much more than a single test,\u201d she says. \u201cI would defy anyone to come up with an 11-plus test that isn\u2019t in some way related to prior learning and practice \u2013 that is just common sense. The more you practise something, the more chance of success you have.\u201d</p> <p>Local Equal Excellent has now asked the Buckinghamshire grammar schools to withdraw what it calls a \u201cdiscredited\u201d test. \u201cEither the grammar schools and the test providers are suggesting that children from certain backgrounds have inherently less academic potential, or they must concede that the 11-plus exam is failing to do what they claim it does,\u201d says Hickman.</p> <p>\u201cIf the government is truly concerned with helping all children to fulfil their potential, far from toying with expanding selection, they should instead be working out the best way to get rid of it altogether.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The UK must immediately kickstart an industry to capture and bury carbon emissions in order to save consumers billions a year from the cost of meeting climate change targets, according to a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ccsassociation.org/news-and-events/reports-and-publications/parliamentary-advisory-group-on-ccs-report/\">high-level advisory group appointed by ministers</a>.</p> <p>This requires the setting up of a new state-backed company to create the network needed to pipe the emissions into exhausted oil and gas fields under the North Sea, the group said. </p> <p>With this government backing, carbon capture and storage (CCS) could deliver clean electricity at a lower cost than an expanded Hinkley Point nuclear power station and almost all renewables, the group\u2019s report states.</p> <p>A CCS industry could also provide thousands of jobs, particularly in industrial heartlands such as Teesside and Grangemouth, and help reverse the fortunes of the declining North Sea fossil fuel industry. It could even tackle the major problem of cutting emissions from gas boilers, by enabling clean-burning hydrogen to be pumped into the grid.</p> <p>Failing to deliver CCS would hugely increase the cost of tackling climate change, according to the <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/power-sector-scenarios-for-the-fifth-carbon-budget/\">government\u2019s official climate advisors</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/20/treasury-cut-carbon-capture-storage-cost-uk-30bn\">National Audit Office</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/02/rapid-carbon-emission-cuts-severe-impact-climate-change-ipcc-report\">UN\u2019s climate science panel</a>. </p> <p>But in November the government made a shock decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/25/uk-cancels-pioneering-1bn-carbon-capture-and-storage-competition\">cancel a \u00a31bn CCS development competition</a> at the last minute, citing high costs. The new report, commissioned in the aftermath by then energy secretary Amber Rudd, says using a state-backed company would slash the price.</p> <p>\u201cMoney spent now will save money later,\u201d said Lord Ron Oxburgh, an independent member of the House of Lords and former chairman of Shell Transport and Trading, who led the report. \u201cCCS is a priority for Britain if our 2050 climate goals are to be achieved at least expense. Government intervention and leadership is crucial and, in common with major projects such as the delivery of the London Olympics, the role of the public sector will be crucial in the early years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere were a number of people in our group that were sceptical that this really was the least-cost way forward, but even our hard-nosed bankers and businessmen agreed,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Lord Oxburgh said, despite the technology being ready, no commercial company could justify investing in the CCS pipe network by itself: \u201cThere is no serious commercial incentive and it will stay that way unless the state demonstrates there is a business there.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Stuart Haszeldine, a CCS expert at Edinburgh University and a member of the advisory group, said another crucial immediate action is to take into temporary public ownership the offshore pipelines to the gas fields of Atlantic, Goldeneye and Hamilton, which are imminently due to be decommissioned but would be ideal for transporting CO2 to storage sites.</p> <p>The report will be presented to Rudd\u2019s successor, Greg Clark, who is secretary of state at the new Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). A spokeswoman for BEIS said the recommendations of the report would be carefully considered, but that the costs of CCS had to be competitive if it was to play a part in the long-term decarbonisation of the UK\u2019s economy. </p> <p>\u201cWe will need a range of technologies as we create a clean energy future but above all we must ensure they are affordable,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The report argues this can be achieved for CCS if the government immediately sets up a state-backed company which would then build gas-fired power stations with CCS technology and develop the network to transport and bury the CO2. </p> <p>With the pipes in place, the company would then be able to take and store CO2 from other power and industrial plants, charging for the service. Income would come from the levies on consumer energy bills that currently support low carbon electricity such as renewables and nuclear power. The report says support of \u00a385/MWh would be sufficient, cheaper than all renewables bar onshore wind \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/18/tories-end-onshore-windfarm-subsidies-2016\">now virtually halted by the government</a> \u2013 and Hinkley Point C.</p> <p>The company would need \u00a3200-\u00a3300m of government seed funding, the report says, with private investors providing the rest. Once established, the power plants could be privatised and the transport and storage enterprise run as a regulated utility with prices capped, like a water company. </p> <p>\u201cIt is not government subsidy, this is government investment, and with any luck the government will get its money back and better as time goes on,\u201d said Lord Oxburgh. CCS could capture 40% of the UK\u2019s emissions by 2050, according to the report, saving up to \u00a35bn a year compared to alternative strategies.</p> <p>CCS could also potentially enable hydrogen to solve the problem of cutting the emissions from the nation\u2019s gas boilers and stoves, currently 25% of all emissions and a major factor in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/09/uk-will-miss-its-2020-renewable-energy-targets-warn-mps\">UK\u2019s imminent failure to meet clean energy targets</a>.</p> <p>Natural gas can be converted to hydrogen and the CO2 produced buried using CCS. The hydrogen, which produces only water when burned, could then replace the gas in the national grid. This could also provide fuel for hydrogen-powered cars, as well as cutting the significant air pollution caused by gas boilers.</p> <p>Lord Oxburgh said he only partly blamed the big fossil fuel companies for not developing CCS themselves, in order to protect their businesses from climate change laws: \u201cUltimately you have to answer to your shareholders. As far as they are concerned, if you have a company that is doing alright and making money, why waste time and money doing something that may or may not pay off? </p> <p>\u201cIt really has to do with how convinced people were that the government was serious about climate change. Once the government really shows its commitment, CCS will take off.\u201d</p>",

The subcommittee, which will include all Indigenous MPs and representatives of bush seats, will concentrate on delivering Labor\u2019s promise of local decision-making powers, and to progress public discussion on a treaty.<br></p> <p>Gunner dismissed concerns the treaty focus could derail the federal move for constitutional recognition, which he supported, and said people had to be \u201cmature enough\u201d for parallel conversations. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very clear there is a message for treaty, a demand for treaty, and the first step is listening.\u201d</p> <p>Gunner also noted that Mark Yingiya Guyula, the independent MP who unseated the Labor deputy leader in Nhulunbuy, had campaigned on pushing for a treaty.</p> <p>Natasha Fyles, who retained the seat of Nightcliff with one of the biggest margins in the election, is the attorney general and minister for justice, and will be sworn in as the minister for health and leader of government business.<br></p> <p>Fyles said Australian parliaments, and particularly the NT\u2019s had made a transition over the past couple of decades, and \u201cthis parliament is a reflection of that change\u201d.</p> <p>Fyles told ABC radio the assistant ministries were \u201can opportunity to include people, particularly in key areas\u201d.</p> <p>The 62.5% female rate eclipses that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/16/the-palaszczuk-ministry-includes-a-majority-of-women-but-dont-expect-a-revolution\">Queensland\u2019s Labor cabinet under premier Annastacia Palaszczuk,</a> which was the first Australian majority-female cabinet.<br></p> <p>The current federal parliament is 17% women, and its cabinet 35.3%.</p> <p>At June this year 22.8% of all national parliamentarians in the world were women, according to UN women. Just 17% of ministries were held by women, the majority of them in social sectors.</p> <p>Just one member of the NT Labor government \u2013 Gerry McCarthy \u2013 has previous experience as a minister. McCarthy held a number of portfolios under the Henderson government, including corrections, and is expected to be involved in some manner with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/royal-commission-into-northern-territory-juvenile-detention\">royal commission into the protection and detention of children.</a></p> <p>Under the Gunner government McCarthy will oversee housing and community development, essential services and public employment.</p> <p>The new NT parliament will move to their offices in Darwin\u2019s parliament house on Monday, and the Country Liberal party, which saw just two members elected, will form the opposition.</p> <p>Defeated chief minister Adam Giles wrote \u201ca final word\u201d <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AdamGilesNT/posts/673665386115065\">on Facebook on Monday morning</a> rejecting accusations he was not taking responsibility for his party\u2019s loss.</p> <p>He said it was \u201csimply not true\u201d, and the result was not surprising \u201cgiven some of the distractions\u201d which occurred. </p> <p>\u201cAs I said on election night \u2013 as the leader of government the buck stops with me,\u201d Giles said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I wanted to also emphasise was that disunity in politics is a disaster for governments, particularly those seeking a second term. For this reason I will not respond to personal attacks by any detractors who do not realise that their comments perpetuate disunity. Leadership requires you to shut up sometimes knowing that the way forward for the party and the NT is to work together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am immensely proud of the work our Country Liberals team achieved during its four-year term. My government built the Territory for its future. We will be remembered for this legacy.</p> <p>Giles had been criticised for his comments on election night that <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-28/nt-election-adam-giles-says-he-new-defeat-was-coming/7792170\">his career was \u201cstarting\u201d</a> and the loss was a \u201cstepping stone\u201d for him.</p> <p>He signed off his Monday note with \u201cBye ... for now.\u201d</p>"
