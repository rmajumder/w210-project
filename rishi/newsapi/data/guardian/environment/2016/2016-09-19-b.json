And the dream was achieved when, in 2011, the American TV network HBO began production of a series called Game of Thrones at Titanic Studios, based in the shipyards where the doomed ocean-liner had been built.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/18/game-of-thrones-emmy-awards-2016-breaks-record-best-drama\">Emmys 2016: Game of Thrones breaks Frasier's record and wins best drama again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was a clever move by HBO because the Northern Irish landscape was beautifully ancient without being distractingly familiar to global audiences in the way that the terrain of America or the Antipodes might have been. </p> <p>The Belfast production base also gave an advantage in the casting. Game of Thrones has learned from the Harry Potter and Tolkien films that British classical actors in cameo roles lend an extra heft to fantasy scripts, so Diana Rigg, Jonathan Pryce, Anton Lesser and Julian Glover were among those flown in across the Irish Sea to play featured roles in the series. </p> <p>The overall budget was helped, though, by the choice in the lead roles of British actors such as Kit Harington and Michelle Fairley and the American Peter Dinklage, who, at the time, were fairly unknown. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e506a2d05552a8ff4daf67d6cd51b5bf5ff423d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e506a2d05552a8ff4daf67d6cd51b5bf5ff423d/0_0_3000_2154/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the cast of Game of Thrones pose following the Emmy awards ceremony.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"718\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of the cast of Game of Thrones pose following the Emmy awards ceremony.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This reflects a decision to position the series as an overall brand \u2013 aimed at the large fan base that the George RR Martin source books already had \u2013 rather than relying on big-name actors to draw audiences. In Game of Thrones, the story is the star.</p> <p>A clue to why the show has now won more awards than any other fiction series in the history of the Emmys can be seen in the other series that took home trophies this year \u2013 Veep (about politics), The People vs OJ Simpson (race), Bloodline (violence), and Downton Abbey (history).</p> <p>Politics, race, history and violence thrive in the plot lines of Game of Thrones, which also features large amounts of a commodity that has rarely driven audiences away \u2013 sex.

  "<p>When Virginia Woolf wrote the fantastical biographical novel Orlando, she broke all the rules of time and gender. The protagonist lives for four centuries but ages just 36 years; halfway through, with no explanation, he switches from being a man to a woman. </p> <p>Orlando was Christopher Bailey\u2019s starting point for Burberry\u2019s show, a link more fundamental than the way in which this season\u2019s Cavalry women\u2019s jacket recalls the handsome boy-prince costumes worn by Tilda Swinton in the 1992 film.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca775a12ba62cd8b5195f2147dedcbe7835f8b57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca775a12ba62cd8b5195f2147dedcbe7835f8b57/0_43_992_595/500.jpg\" alt=\"Tilda Swinton in Orlando.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tilda Swinton in Orlando.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liam Longman Adventure Pictures Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The show was staged in the husk of Foyles bookshop, with a copy of Orlando on every seat. At the champagne reception before the show, Cara Delevingne was being snapchatted metres away from a workbench at which craftswomen demonstrated the traditional passementerie arts of tassel making: the present and past of fashion, cheek by jowl. </p> <p>\u201cWhat I love about Orlando is that nothing is specific to one time or one gender,\u201d said designer Christopher Bailey after the show. \u201cIt is a book about emotion and beauty, which is what I feel fashion is about.\u201d<br><br>The downside of a high-concept fashion week event is that the clothes themselves inevitably feel like walk ons, rather than the main event. There was a fashion message, in the blurring of male and female style: the trenchcoat, after all, is genderless, a point that was underscored by a collection that went big on velvet blazers, wide trousers, piped silk pyjama shirts, and other gender-fluid pieces. Long sheer lace skirts were worn over silk, Bermuda-length bloomers.</p> <p>A catwalk show with the purpose of selling trenchcoats can never exist on the same cultural plane as a a masterpiece of experimental fiction. But in the very different world of global luxury retail, Burberry is attempting something like a commercial version of Woolf\u2019s genteel iconoclasm.</p> <p>The September show, as this was called, broke with the arcane structures of fashion week. Instead of showing clothes six months before they go on sale and segregating womenswear from menswear in different fashion weeks, these clothes for both men and women were on sale immediately. Jettisoning the pedantic labels of AW16 and SS17 \u2013 the internal filing system of fashion are no more compelling to the outside world than any other industry\u2019s office admin \u2013 these clothes were \u201cseasonless\u201d.

But the dissolution of the traditional fashion timetable is just as revolutionary.</p> <p>According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, stream of consciousness is a narrative technique in which \u201cto represent the full richness, speed, and subtlety of the mind at work, the writer incorporates snatches of incoherent thought, ungrammatical constructions, and free associations of ideas, images and words\u201d. This technique, which Woolf used in Orlando, also serves as a fair description of the way in which ideas and trends are disseminated from fashion shows in the age of social media.</p> <p>This collection was on sale online at the same time it was on the catwalk; some key names, including British Fashion Council chairman Natalie Massenet and pop star Taylor Swift, had been photographed wearing the clothes some days before the show took place. The tight reins of long-lead fashion are on the way out, and a new era of stream-of-consciousness fashion is beginning. </p> <p>Elsewhere, Christopher Kane\u2019s tenth anniversary show celebrated iconoclasm of a different kind, reminding the audience how he can take the most unpromising looks \u2013 here, plastic Crocs and pencil skirts in \u201croad kill fur\u201d \u2013 and turn them into want-it-now fashion. \u201cFor my very first collection, I made pieces out of stockings that I bought on Ridley Road market\u201d, he said after the show. </p> <p>\u201cI have always been able to make anything out of nothing. Those dresses are like holy relics to us now. We get them out and look at them every season.\u201d</p> <p>Roksanda stands in serene contrast to Kane\u2019s gleeful bad taste. Her label combines a boldness with colour \u2013 Elastoplast pink with brick red, in this instance \u2013 with a cool eye and an unerring taste level. It is this instinct for the true north of chic which has evolved her label from a niche brand for art collectors and wealthy gallerists into a go-to name for A-list soft-power dressers including Samantha Cameron and Michelle Obama. </p> <p>The penultimate day of London fashion week took a darker turn at Erdem, and a collection conceived when the designer read about the story of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/21/400-year-old-dress-found-in-shipwreck-sheds-light-on-plot-to-pawn-crown-jewels\">Jean Kerr, lady-in-waiting to the consort of Charles I </a> and sometime spy for the King of Spain, whose wardrobe was lost at sea during a daring mission to pawn the crown jewels to raise money for the royalists on the eve of the English civil war. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd246a2477fb89700759ce809b3f07087b689387\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd246a2477fb89700759ce809b3f07087b689387/0_169_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Models on the catwalk at the Erdem show at London fashion week on Monday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Models on the catwalk at the Erdem show at London fashion week on Monday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Harvey/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This elaborate backstory gave Erdem a character for the season (a society woman whose elegant dress conceals a daredevil character) and a stage set (a very picturesque, sympathetically lit shipwreck).

You should all be proud.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the mutual back-slapping, honorary medals and lavish praise of the organisers, there were still boos for the politicians and relieved smiles from many of those involved because these Games have been touch-and-go at times, coming at the end of a remarkably turbulent and gruelling period.</p> <p>From the world\u2019s biggest sustainability conference in 2012, through Pope Francis\u2019s first overseas visit in 2013, the World Cup in 2014 and now this year\u2019s Olympics, this Brazilian city has somehow come through a series of epic challenges largely unscathed \u2013 and, in some areas, improved \u2013 despite government collapse, mass protests, eye-popping corruption, rampant crime and the Zika virus health emergency.</p> <p>In no small part that is thanks to the city\u2019s astonishing natural beauty which has always absolved many of the sins of its residents and visitors. Regardless of poor organisation, social inequality, or the dubious quality of the water in the pool or the bay, every contest has looked spectacular set against blue skies, verdant mountains and ocean horizons. These images will shape the memory of the billions who experienced Rio through distant TV screens or laptops.</p> <p>The Paralympics was notable for its absences as well as its achievements. The entire Russian team were banned for systematic use of illegal performance\u2011enhancing drugs. The head of the IOC, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/09/police-in-rio-2016-ticket-touting-case-seek-to-question-ioc-chief-thomas-bach\">Thomas Bach, failed to show up to his own party</a> perhaps not coincidentally because Brazilian police wanted to question him about ticket-touting allegations against his close ally, the head of the Irish Olympic council, Pat Hickey.</p> <p>Rio\u2019s Games \u2013 the first in South America \u2013 were also going to be a little different. Veteran Olympic officials have said privately they were the most chaotic, politically troubled, financially insecure Games of modern times, but they ended without major calamity.</p> <p>There were individual tragedies, too. The death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/18/iranian-paralympics-cyclist-bahman-golbarnezhad-dies-in-rio-crash\">the Iranian cyclist Bahman Golbarnezhad</a> in a crash on the final Saturday was marked by a moment of silence. The fatalities of the more than a dozen construction workers who died building the facilities went unremarked. There were also several embarrassing setbacks, such as problems with the accommodation at the athletes\u2019 village, but impressive sporting displays and warm crowds \u2013 particularly at the Paralympics, when ticket prices were finally dropped within an affordable range for the local population \u2013 helped to leave a good impression.</p> <p>Lamartine da Costa, a professor of Sports History at the Gama Filho University, said the mobilisation of the public made the Paralympics more of a success than its preceeding events. \u201cThe population is in the legacy. In fact, it\u2019s beyond a legacy. It\u2019s a feeling of belonging. And this becomes a political fact.\u201d</p> <p>The final debt for Rio\u2019s taxpayers has yet to be calculated. Despite promises not to use public money, emergency loans had to be provided by the national government in June to meet a shortfall in the Rio state security budget. Last month, the city had to provide another 150m reais (\u00a335m) to bail out the cash-strapped Paralympics. A late boost in ticket sales \u2013 from 200,000 to 2.1m in less than a month \u2013 will have helped to cover part of this hole. In a closing press conference the Rio 2016 chief executive, Sidney Levy, said that at most 1% of the organising committee budget will come from public funds, and overall the Games were within budget.</p> <p>Thanks also to an infusion of private cash and federal funds, Bruno Barth Sobral, an economics professor at Rio\u2019s State University, said the Rio government would not be left with a financial bomb as was the case with the Panamerican Games and the World Cup, but he said poor planning meant the city\u2019s short-term economic boost from the mega-events would not maintain momentum in the long run.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/19/paralympic-glory-harsh-reality-everyday-struggles\">Paralympic glory must not cover up harsh reality of daily struggles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Overall he said Rio\u2019s biggest achievement was to overcome Brazil\u2019s \u201cstray dog\u201d inferiority. \u201cIt showed the world that we are capable of hosting these events, contrary to the prejudiced view that they are only suitable for the first world.\u201d</p> <p>Few of the politicians who brought this cascade of events to the city will be around to reap the rewards.</p> <p>The Olympics and Paralympics has coincided with a seismic shift in national politics. Last month the Workers Party president Dilma Rousseff was impeached and replaced by the equally unpopular Michel Temer, who has been loudly booed at every appearance during these Games. At the closing ceremony on Sunday, one of the nation\u2019s favourite bands \u2013 Na\u00e7ao Zumbi \u2013 unveiled a banner reading \u201cFora Temer\u201d (Temer Out). The Rio mayor, Eduardo Paes, was also jeered by the crowd, though he has done more than any other politician to push the Games through against the odds. He is expected to run in the future for state governor, and perhaps president of Brazil. But at the end of this year, he will stand down as mayor and move to New York.</p> <p>It is part of an exodus. Stadiums are being dismantled. Troops are returning to their barracks. IOC dignitaries are flying back to their Swiss mountain chalets. Gale\u00e3o airport is packed with departing athletes, sports officials, and journalists. Foreign correspondents, most of them based here for the past few years, are also leaving in droves, many of them unlikely to be replaced as the world\u2019s attention switches elsewhere.</p> <p>Cariocas are about to get their city back to themselves.

Arrogant towards critics and governments, glutted with cash and yet plainly out of ideas, Apple is elegant shorthand for a redundant economic system.</p> <p>None of this is how we\u2019re meant to think of Apple, the multinational that is both on your side yet restlessly questing ahead. While launching the iPhone 7 this month, its marketing chief, Phil Schiller, explained why this model came without a earphone socket: \u201cIt really comes down to one word: courage. The courage to move on, do something new, that betters all of us.\u201d Such patchouli-scented Californian dipshittery was lapped up by the 7,000-strong crowd and lightly mocked by the press \u2013 but it also helps to obscure some of the less tolerable aspect of the iPhone business model, such as the conditions in which it is made.</p> <p>If you own an iPhone it was assembled by workers at one of three firms in China: Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron. The biggest and most famous, Foxconn, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/16/foxconn-suicide-china-society\">came to international prominence</a> in 2010 when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn_suicides#2010\">an estimated 18 of its employees</a> tried to kill themselves. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/05/woman-nearly-died-making-ipad\">At least 14 workers died</a>. The company\u2019s response was to put up suicide nets, to catch people trying to jump to their death. That year, staff at Foxconn\u2019s Longhua factory made <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2010/09/10/this-man-makes-137000-iphones-a-day/\">137,000 iPhones a day</a>, or around 90 a minute.</p> <p>One of those attempted suicides, a 17-year-old called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/05/woman-nearly-died-making-ipad\">Tian Yu</a>, flung herself from the fourth floor of a factory dormitory and ended up paralysed from the waist down. Speaking later to academic researchers, she <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ntwe.12007/full\">described her working conditions</a> in remarkable testimony that I then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/05/woman-nearly-died-making-ipad\">covered for the Guardian</a>. She was essentially a human battery hen, working over 12 hours a day, six days a week, swapped between day and night shifts and kept in an eight-person dorm room.</p> <p>After the scandals of 2010, Apple vowed to improve conditions for its Chinese workers. It has since published a number of glossy brochures extolling its commitments to them. Yet there is no evidence that the Californian firm has given back a single penny of its gigantic profit margins to its contractors to ensure better treatment of the people who actually make its products.</p> <p>Over the past year, the US-based NGO China Labor Watch has published a series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/29/apple-investugates-claims-china-factory\">investigations</a> into Pegatron, another iPhone assembler. It sent a researcher on to the assembly line, interviewed dozens of Pegatron staff and analysed hundreds of pay stubs. Among its <a href=\"http://www.chinalaborwatch.org/pdf/apple_s_unkept_promises.pdf\">findings</a> are that staff still work 12 hours a day, six days a week \u2013 one and a half hours of that unpaid. They are forced to do overtime, claims the NGO, and provided with illegally low levels of safety training.</p> <p>The researcher was working on one iPhone motherboard every 3.75 seconds, standing up for the entirety of his 10.5-hour shift. Such is the punishment endured at Apple\u2019s contractors to make a living wage, apparently.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ad9092ebb230915f866f5450b65a7d6bbb5e2db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ad9092ebb230915f866f5450b65a7d6bbb5e2db/0_102_3958_2375/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Cook with dancer Maddie Ziegler.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Cook with dancer Maddie Ziegler.

Teenagers doing degrees in accountancy or business management were sent for months to an assembly line at Wistron. This is a serious violation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Labour_Organization\">International Labour Organisation</a> convention, yet investigators for Danwatch found evidence that thousands of students were doing the same work and backbreaking hours there as the adults \u2013 but costing less.</p> <p>The teenagers told Danwatch that they were working against their will. \u201cWe are all depressed,\u201d one 19-year-old girl said. \u201cBut we have no choice, because the school told us that if we refused, we would not get our diploma.\u201d Despite several requests for comment, Wistron did not respond.</p> <p>That investigation was not at a factory making iPhones, but Apple confirmed that Wistron and Pegatron were two of their major assemblers in China. While it did not wish to say anything on the record, Apple\u2019s press officers pointed me to the audits it had commissioned into its supplier factories.

  "<p>New and more effective. That\u2019s how Theresa May describes the migration policy she proposed to the world on Monday ahead of the UN general assembly . The prime minister wants to combat migration by helping more refugees to stay in the first country they reach; by distinguishing better between people fleeing war, and those fleeing poverty; and by giving countries more licence to protect their borders by force, or with a fence. Wrapped within this three-part plan is the implicit idea that it is better to enable developing countries than to offer sanctuary to the refugees stuck in them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/18/angela-merkels-refugee-policy-must-succeed-for-europes-sake\">Angela Merkel\u2019s refugee policy must succeed \u2013 for Europe\u2019s sake | Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de </a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the global context, May\u2019s comments are something of a sideshow; a British leader\u2019s interventions in world affairs arguably matter less today than at any stage in the past few centuries. But it\u2019s useful to examine May\u2019s vision.</p> <p>In short: it is neither particularly effective, nor new. The first plank of her plan \u2013 the suggestion that more refugees should be encouraged to stay in the first country they reach \u2013 is not a new idea. This is the status quo \u2013 and the situation that is driving migration in the first place.</p> <p>Just look at the statistics. More than 86% of refugees live in the developing world, and the vast majority of them live in the first country they reach. Almost all of the refugees in Turkey, which has the world\u2019s largest refugee population, have crossed the border from neighbouring Syria or Iraq. Lebanon hosts more refugees per capita and per square kilometre than any other; its 1.2&#xa0;million Syrian refugees also came from next door. The Somalis at the world\u2019s largest refugee camp in Kenya came from the next country along. The three million Afghans in Pakistan crossed just one border too.</p> <p>So the problem is not that too few refugees are staying in neighbouring countries. It\u2019s that too many are forced to do so. Since the west has refused to resettle meaningful numbers of refugees from the Middle East, or from Pakistan or east Africa, those refugees have been forced to choose between a life of limbo \u2013 in places where they do not have access to education, healthcare or work rights \u2013 or irregular migration to the west. And in 2015, a significant minority chose the latter, leading to what we have termed the European refugee crisis.</p> <p>If May wants a new and effective policy, then organised resettlement \u2013 and the provision of safe and legal routes \u2013 is one option available to her. Instead, Britain was at the heart of behind-the-scenes moves to take out a pledge to resettle 10% of the world\u2019s refugees from a new treaty signed on Monday at the UN summit in New York.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1cbf4e510a84daaf236267f25668a6720dd08627\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cbf4e510a84daaf236267f25668a6720dd08627/881_238_1361_1701/800.jpg\" alt=\"Lifejackets that have been used by refugees to cross the sea to Europe and representing refugees who have died trying to reach Europe since 2015 are laid out in Parliament Square as the UN Migration Summit takes place in New York.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lifejackets that have been used by refugees to cross the sea to Europe and representing refugees who have died trying to reach Europe since 2015 are laid out in Parliament Square as the UN Migration Summit takes place in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What about the increased border protection May speaks of? It\u2019s certainly not new. This has been the knee-jerk migration policy of choice in Europe over the past 15 years. It\u2019s not very effective, with walls simply shifting migrants elsewhere, and often forces them into the hands of smugglers. Increased policing of the Canary islands\u2019 maritime borders, and ever-higher fences between Morocco and Spain, proved meaningless once migration routes shifted through Libya. Greece and Bulgaria\u2019s two fences along their respective Turkish borders saw migrants take new routes to the Greek islands. Hungary\u2019s Serbian fence routed people west through Croatia. And while Macedonia\u2019s fence along its Greek border has significantly reduced Balkan migration numbers this year, at least 25,000 people have still passed through the Balkans since the Macedonian fenceborder was sealed in March.</p> <p>What\u2019s next on May\u2019s shopping list? Differentiation between refugees and economic migrants. Taken at face value, this suggestion is at best misguided. One of the lessons I\u2019ve learnt from reporting on migration in more than 20 countries is that the line between who\u2019s fleeing poverty and who\u2019s fleeing war is rarely clear-cut. How do you classify someone who left Senegal to find work in Libya, but then fled Libya to escape a war? What about a Syrian who reached Turkey from bombed-out Aleppo, and then left Turkey because he wasn\u2019t allowed to work?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/25/theresa-may-scrapping-minister-syria-refugees-disgraceful\">Theresa May's scrapping of minister for refugees 'utterly disgraceful'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>May isn\u2019t interested in such nuances. She isn\u2019t after better definitions \u2013 she simply wants to change them so that fewer vulnerable people qualify for legal protection in Britain. Again, this isn\u2019t new. Last year, the Home Office, which she ran, adopted highly controversial guidelines that made it far harder for Eritreans to qualify for asylum in Britain. This change in classification didn\u2019t make things better \u2013 a few months later a UN committee accused the Eritrean government of committing widespread crimes against humanity against its own people. But it did reduce the number of people able to seek sanctuary in the UK.</p> <p>Finally, there\u2019s the implicit suggestion that investment in developing countries should be pursued at the expense of resettlement programmes. Development is indeed essential in the general sense, and in the long term it may reduce migration. But migration researchers have shown it is no silver bullet. As specialists such as <a href=\"http://heindehaas.blogspot.com/2011/05/development-leads-to-more-migration.html?m=1\" title=\"\">Hein de Haas have explained: \u201cEmigration initially goes up with levels of development</a>, and only goes down once countries move into high development categories. It indicates that if poor countries become wealthier, emigration will increase.\u201d</p> <p>The world certainly needs new and more effective means of addressing protracted refugee crises. But the ideas set out by Theresa May don\u2019t fall in either category.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/19/nujeen-mustafa-syria-isis-germany\" title=\"\">idea of a refugee</a> or a displaced person means different things to different people. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/17/world-will-not-face-up-to-refugee-crisis-un-obama\" title=\"\">the human suffering they encompass</a> is often much the same. Europeans might envisage families in leaky boats adrift in the Mediterranean, or quietly determined crowds trekking northwards along highways. For people in the Middle East, it might be row upon row of tents in a refugee camp; for Africans, stories of men, women and children trafficked across the Sahel, only to end up in a sordid detention centre run by militias in Libya. In Asia, it might be desperate boat people being turned back, or the island camps where those who hope to find a new life in Australia find themselves detained.</p> <p>Across the globe, the 21st century has become an era of disruption and exodus. An&#xa0;unprecedented 65 million people are fleeing war or persecution, or migrating in search of training, an education or a job. The response is asymmetrical: most refugees only go as far as a neighbouring country. According to Britain\u2019s Refugee Council, 44% of refugees are in the Middle East and Africa, and 27% in Europe. Turkey, Pakistan and Lebanon are all sheltering more than 1 million from Syria and Afghanistan. The UK, according to the UNHCR, hosts about 170,000.</p> <p>And beyond the human trauma, there are the geopolitical consequences. The stability of democracies is jeopardised when scenes of chaotic population movements fuel demagoguery and populism; authoritarian regimes or their proxies exploit refugee flows as weapons of war to destabilise adversaries whose resources will be suddenly stretched, or as a technique to score points in a diplomatic negotiation. Against that backdrop, <a href=\"http://refugeesmigrants.un.org/summit\" title=\"\">a UN summit</a> devoted to the crisis can only be applauded \u2013 especially considering the topic had never been addressed before in a diplomatic gathering of all nations. Yet to many, today\u2019s event in New York turned out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/refugee-crisis-rests-on-obama-summit-un-talks-fail\" title=\"\">to be a disappointment</a>.</p> <p>It is more than 60 years since the world agreed that such huge population flows were a matter of global responsibility. Now the <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/uk/1951-refugee-convention.html\" title=\"\">Geneva convention on refugees</a>, signed by 144 states in 1951, is facing a profound threat as politicians respond to domestic pressure by looking for ways to evade its obligations. Across the world, the power of a global moral imperative is being undermined by the rise of nationalism and identity politics, driven partly by a traditional fear of the other, partly by the impact of recession on governments\u2019 capacity to provide public services.</p> <p>At the UN this week, there will be much empathy and little concrete action. The great hope of the NGOs and other humanitarian lobbyists was for a commitment for the global north to resettle 10% of the world\u2019s refugees. Instead, although the text of what is to be known as the <a href=\"https://refugeesmigrants.un.org/declaration\" title=\"\">New York declaration</a> recognises the scale of the crisis, it fails to lay out concrete measures. Signatories are asked to continue to work towards a global compact to be reached by 2018. Whether the second summit, convened by President Obama, will do any better seems uncertain. Its objective is to encourage individual state pledges of aid to refugees, not develop a global strategy.</p> <p>All of this leaves unaddressed the no less important matter of preventing or resolving the conflicts that drive mass migration. Hopes for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/19/week-old-syrian-ceasefire-hangs-in-balance\" title=\"\">a ceasefire in Syria</a> have all but dwindled. Alone, this conflict has forced 12&#xa0;million people from their homes in the last&#xa0;five years.</p> <p>The wider picture is that politicians across the world feel little incentive to act \u2013 after all, refugees have no voice, no vote, and scant organisation. The moral commitment to them was made in the aftermath of what the world\u2019s leaders thought was an unrepeatable catastrophe. It was not supposed to happen again. In that context, small as the results of the refugee summit appear, the mere restatement of the commitment was a small victory. Now President Obama will hope at least to incentivise some positive action.</p> <p>But here\u2019s the paradox: political leaders won\u2019t reduce the risks they fear for themselves (and their careers) by sitting idle in the face of an unprecedented exodus. Creating safe channels for refugees and organising migration routes, not building fences, may be a better way. It has been tried before. Thirty years ago, hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese boat people were saved by a coordinated and comprehensive plan. Globalisation increases mobility. Instead of resisting it, nations should consider organising it. Save lives, rather than&#xa0;creating conditions that only aid the people smugglers. Inaction breeds more chaos, not&#xa0;less.</p>",
  "<p>Silicon Valley, with its roots in a counter-culture of dreamy cyber-gurus and anti-establishment hackers, has always thought itself different. As Steve Jobs put it, they are \u201cthe crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in square holes\u201d. Unlike Wall St, so the press releases said, they did no evil.</p> <p>For nations looking to replicate the success of the Valley, the question has long been asked: why don\u2019t we have a Google, an Apple or a Facebook. It was asked again on BBC\u2019s flagship Today programme this morning. The question is a good one. To <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37400411\" title=\"\">some the answer</a> is money \u2013 there\u2019s a lack of patient, long-term capital in the City \u2013 and entrepreneurial culture, a lack of \u201ccrazy ones\u201d. Public money, in the form of defence spending and top-class research universities, made Silicon Valley. The advent of the personal computer as a tool for individual liberation introduced a culture of ethical egotism. With the arrival of social media, digital technology now considers itself a force for global good. It helps that science feels like a religion with a priesthood whose canonical texts cannot be easily understood by policymakers. Little wonder information technology has become one of the western world\u2019s most lightly regulated industries. The result is ruthless, red-in-tooth-and-claw capitalism. Many of the tech revolutionaries have simply invented new ways to extract huge profits by unregulated means.</p> <p>Despite the rhetoric of competition and markets, the ultimate aim of the tech evangelists is often to create monopolies which are the quickest ways to profit. Free social tools are concentrating wealth in the hands of a few programmers and investors. In search, that\u2019s Google (revenues $75bn). In social media, that\u2019s Facebook (1.65 billion users, sales $5bn). In online retail it\u2019s Amazon (last quarter profits of almost $900m).</p> <p>Politicians don\u2019t want to end up defending the past. But they need to regulate global giants in the national interest. Last year when Britain\u2019s Conservative-led coalition lifted the restriction on homeowners letting out their property for less than three months, it was supposed to benefit the <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/new-rules-mean-londoners-can-earn-thousands-by-renting-rooms-on-sites-like-airbnb-10033375.html\" title=\"\">\u201csharing economy\u201d</a>. Instead, the <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/home-affairs/opinion/64659/karen-buck-mp-short-let-deregulation-will-drive-rents-london\" title=\"\">big winner is Airbnb</a>, the room booking app, which appears to be <a href=\"https://news.rla.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/The-Rental-Revolution-What-is-the-Sharing-Economy-doing-to-the-PRS.pdf https://news.rla.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/The-Bedroom-Boom-Airbnb-and-London.pdf\" title=\"\">benefiting as flats get taken off the market to cater for high-paying short lets</a>. This keeps prices high and makes it harder for low- and middle-income residents to live there.</p> <p>Despite claiming to reinvent travel, the secret behind Uber, the tax-hailing app, is that it circumvents local rules around safety and insurance. London mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s plans to regulate the firm\u2019s drivers is a good step to privatise costs the app sought to socialise. Uber\u2019s use of customer data is instructive. It <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/05/22/uber-app-can-detect-when-a-users-phone-is-about-to-die/\" title=\"\">knows a person is more willing to accept higher or \u201csurge\u201d prices</a> when their phone is about to run out of battery \u2013 but says it doesn\u2019t use this information to charge higher prices. We have no way of checking that. Uber, like other algorithm-driven firms, should be asked to reveal such practices, something that the government could look at during the passage of the digital economy bill. Today, an algorithm is increasingly likely to be your boss or tell you what to read. We should not be creating companies that ruthlessly exploit consumers and workers. Big data that sorts us into piles of \u201cworthy\u201d and \u201cunworthy\u201d needs to be transparent. We don\u2019t need Silicon Valley; we need responsible capitalism.</p>",

When victims come to us with concerns over the risks they face, no matter what stage they are at in their life, the Met takes take these concerns very seriously.</p> <p>\u201cPolice have a responsibility to act to protect vulnerable people and prevent people, especially the vulnerable, from becoming victims of crime.

You ask whether Cameron \u201cshould have foreseen a disaster\u201d: given the example of Iraq, and having set out to overthrow the state and support Islamist rebels, the consequences are surely a matter of deliberate intent rather than a potentially innocent absence of foresight.<br><strong>Peter McKenna</strong><br><em>Liverpool</em></p> <p>\u2022 MPs on the foreign affairs select committee deserve some credit for recognising the failures of the war in Libya (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/mps-deliver-damning-verdict-on-camerons-libya-intervention\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 14 September).

From Iraq to Afghanistan to Libya, it is clear that the UK armed forces neither protect people in Britain nor make the world safer.</p> <p>The select committee concluded that non-military intervention might have \u201cdelivered civilian protection, regime change and reform at lesser cost to the UK and to Libya\u201d.

A combination of Scottish government grants and public donations of more than \u00a31m paid for the revamp of the Grade B-listed library building in Bridgeton, which is now its first permanent home. \u201cWe are in a golden period now,\u201d says John, \u201cwhen we are talking to national galleries and national libraries as equals.

Yet what we do know is that we now inhabit an age in which it\u2019s logistically straightforward to commit attacks designed to kill and create mayhem, and there are clear ideological rationales for doing so. This toxic combination, along with an occasional willingness to die while carrying out the \u201coperation\u201d, makes this new foe \u2013 call him a terrorist or a disturbed individual \u2013 particularly difficult to thwart. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/new-york-and-new-jersey-explosive-devices-what-we-know\">New York and New Jersey explosive devices: what we know</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It used to take some degree of preparation to carry off a successful attack, especially in the west. The fact that some bombs in New Jersey and one in Manhattan failed to explode is a reminder that building explosives takes some degree of skill if you\u2019re to be successful. Also, convincing your radical comrades to engage in a conspiracy opens you up to penetration by the cops or intelligence services. That is an additional challenge.</p> <p>But stabbing people in a mall or shooting people in a club requires little preparation. You don\u2019t need any particular specialized training anymore except to pull a trigger, drive a car, be willing to kill and desire to be killed. </p> <p>We\u2019ve seen this DIY violence elsewhere. For example, the atrocity in Nice, France, killed <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-crash-minister-idUSKCN0ZV0BK?il=0\">over 80</a> people, and while multiple suspects were arrested following the attack only one person carried out the operation. In this instance the assailant, Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, drove a large truck into a crowd, crushing scores of people. The carnage only stopped after police shot him dead. </p> <p>Soft, crowded targets are plentiful in our free, open societies. There is little the authorities can do to keep a determined attacker from striking pedestrians enjoying a balmy Saturday night in New York City. Guns, gates and guards can only provide so much protection against a wily, creative adversary who is willing to risk oblivion. </p> <p>What makes confronting these DIY terrorists even more difficult is that there\u2019s an organization actively and successfully disseminating a death-cult message: the Islamic State. Through its slick social media messaging and global network of personal connections, this organization has been convincing the misguided \u2013 some of whom are lone wolves \u2013 to cause havoc in their home countries. This is no accident, but a long-held plan; terror operations outside Iraq and Syria have and will always be <a href=\"http://thecipherbrief.com/article/middle-east/dna-isis\">part and parcel</a> of the Islamic State\u2019s DNA.</p> <p>For those who wanted to kill people more generally for their own reasons, Islamic State provides them a rationale by which to do so. For example, the San Bernardino killer Syed Rizwan Farook bought his weapons <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/03/us/how-mass-shooters-got-their-guns.html?_r=0\">years before</a> he killed 14 people at a holiday party. Why didn\u2019t he commit his crime earlier? We won\u2019t ever know, since he (along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik) is dead, but perhaps Islamic State appears to have given him a reason and a mission to finally take the plunge and destroy himself.</p> <p>As long as Islamic State steadfastly pursues its \u201cvictory\u201d narrative, so long as it survives in one physical form or another, people will use its existence as a warped rationale for murderous behavior. Destroying Islamic State and draining the swamp will go a long way to denting the ideological allure of attacking civilians. </p> <p>At the time of writing, we still don\u2019t quite know the motivations of the NYC bomber or the Minnesota stabber. But we do know that if they were motivated by a jihadist ideology, crushing Islamic State will go a long way to reducing the rationale for this kind of behavior, making our streets safer.</p> <p>This will require sacrifice and great political capital to see it through to the end. Islamic State is fully committed to this conflict, will give no quarter, and will continue to use its power to cause havoc on our streets. </p> <p>Western nations must be committed to defeating Isis. In the meantime, our societies must be resilient enough to absorb \u201cinspired\u201d or \u201cdirected\u201d attacks from the Islamic state and its DIY acolytes for the foreseeable future. <br></p>",

Long and short, that means debt relief and putting discussion of it on the table. To get there Athens needs to complete the current round of prior actions, or milestone reforms, it failed to deal with over the summer. Upon them not only rests the next installment of bailout aid \u2013 at \u20ac2.8bn critical for the debt-wracked economy - but the onset of official debate over what to do about Greece\u2019s unsustainable debt load, at 180% of national output by far the highest in the eurozone. \u201cThe idea is to push the multi-bill with all these measures through parliament this week,\u201d said one well-placed source.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1822cf2e6697073542e66e07f00d9f40fcc2e5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1822cf2e6697073542e66e07f00d9f40fcc2e5f/0_133_3979_2388/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greece\u2019s prime minister Alexis Tsipras at last wek\u2019s informal EU summit in Bratislava.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greece\u2019s prime minister Alexis Tsipras at last wek\u2019s informal EU summit in Bratislava.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STRINGER/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Among the measures will be the appointment of a supervisory board for the country\u2019s new privatisation fund - an issue Athens has rowed about vociferously with creditors \u2013 and the formal inclusion of several loss-making public entities in the body. </p> <p>With Greece\u2019s debt-repayment timetable far from pressing, creditors - though peaved with the slow pace of reforms - are not piling on the pressure. Instead it is the government, that feeling the pinch of public hostility, is now keen to move on to the next step of passing the reforms so the Euro Working Group can agree to disburse the aid when it next meets on September 29. If that goal is achieved, the hope is the next bailout review will begin on October 17 \u2013 and with it the much anticipated issue of debt forgiveness. </p> <p>Addressing his Syriza party\u2019s central committee over the weekend, prime minister Alexis Tsipras insisted \u201cthere will be developments on the debt issue soon.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

  "<p>Angela Merkel has taken responsibility for her party\u2019s disastrous showing in Sunday\u2019s Berlin state election, admitting mistakes in her handling of last year\u2019s refugee crisis.</p> <p>In an unusually self-critical but also combative speech, the German chancellor said on Monday afternoon she was fighting to make sure there would be no repetition of last year\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/08/refugee-crisis-germany-creaks-under-strain-of-open-door-policy\">chaotic scenes on Germany\u2019s borders</a>, when \u201cfor some time, we didn\u2019t have enough control\u201d. \u201cNo one wants a repeat of last year\u2019s situation, including me,\u201d Merkel said.</p> <p>However, she did not distance herself from her decision last September to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/05/refugees-travelling-from-hungary-can-enter-germany-and-austria\">keep open Germany\u2019s borders</a> to thousands of refugees stranded at Keleti station in Budapest. The mistake, the chancellor said, was that she and her government had not been quicker to prepare for the mass movement of people triggered by conflicts in the Middle East. </p> <p>\u201cIf I was able to, I would turn back time by many, many years, so that I could have prepared the whole government and the authorities for the situation which hit us out of the blue in the late summer of 2015,\u201d she said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/angela-merkels-party-suffers-slump-in-berlin-election\"> Sunday\u2019s election</a> ushered in a new era of multi-party politics for the German capital, with the two governing establishment parties, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Social Democratic party (SPD) plummeting to the worst Berlin result in their parties\u2019 histories, while the leftwing Die Linke and anti-immigrant Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) enjoyed impressive gains.</p> <p>On Monday, Merkel admitted she had failed to sufficiently explain her refugee policy, and that her phrase \u201c<em tabindex=\"-1\">Wir schaffen das\u201d </em>(\u201cWe will manage\u201d) had provoked some of those who did not agree with her political course. Her words will be interpreted as an olive branch to the leader of her CDU\u2019s sister party, the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), who has repeatedly called on her to distance herself from the much-cited slogan.</p> <p>For too long, Merkel said, she had relied on procedure according to the Dublin resolution, \u201cwhich, to put it simply, had taken the problem off Germany\u2019s hands\u201d, adding: \u201cAnd that was not good.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b56b8d2837d6cfe2161c9570cd7c597e32a23a18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b56b8d2837d6cfe2161c9570cd7c597e32a23a18/0_4_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Georg Pazderski, the Berlin leader of Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Georg Pazderski, the Berlin leader of Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland.

Banning people from entering the country on the basis of their religion, she said, would be incompatible with Germany\u2019s constitution and her own party\u2019s \u201cethical foundations\u201d.</p> <p>She lamented that the European Union as a whole was failing to recognise the refugee crisis as \u201ca global and a moral challenge\u201d. \u201cWhat we are seeing in Europe is a realisation that we are no longer leading the field when it comes to globalisation, we are not setting the pace.</p> <p>\u201cIn 1990, when the wall fell, the cold war came to an end and freedom blossomed everywhere; it looked like we were on an irreversible road to victory, and that it was just up to the rest of the world to join our model. Freedom had won. It now turns out things aren\u2019t that simple\u201d.</p> <p>Sunday\u2019s result served to illustrate the extent to which party political landscapes across Europe are becoming ever more fractured. The Social Democrats had unwittingly hit the nail on the head when predicting in their poster campaign that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LorenzMaroldt/status/777795404893151232\">\u201cBerlin will stay multifaceted\u201d</a>.</p> <p>AfD\u2019s Berlin leader, Georg Pazderski, on Monday hailed his party as \u201cthe biggest democratic project of the last few decades\u201d after it entered its 10th state parliament in a row.

  "<p>The day before Pako Ayestar\u00e1n flew to Singapore to meet the Valencia owner Peter Lim and discuss becoming the manager at Mestalla, he phoned Gary Neville to ask for his blessing. Neville was the one who had taken him there in the first place, after all, the man who had publicly insisted \u201cwhen I go, Pako goes\u201d, and now Ayesteran was about to take his job. It was an \u201cawkward\u201d phone call but, if the Englishman wasn\u2019t entirely pleased, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/pako-ayestaran-gary-neville-valencia-best-man-job\">he told Ayestar\u00e1n to go for it</a>. He also told Lim that his former assistant was the best man for the job. At the time, the new manager was grateful. He might not be so sure now. They might not be, either.</p> <p>Six months on, Valencia are bottom of the table, the only side without a single point. On the eve of their opening game of the new season Ayestar\u00e1n promised \u201cwe\u2019re going to enjoy it\u201d \u2013 but no one is enjoying this. Four games later, they\u2019re the worst team in Spain, and he\u2019s the worst manager in their history. That\u2019s what the statistics say, anyway. Mario Kempes, meanwhile, says this: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to Valencia is very worrying; there\u2019s no project, no ideas, just pure footballing impotence.\u201d Which would be bad enough anyway but Kempes isn\u2019t just arguably Valencia\u2019s best player ever; he\u2019s also their ambassador.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/18/la-liga-real-madrid-espanyol-james-rodriguez\">La Liga round-up: Real Madrid break club record with win over Espanyol</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kempes represents the club, or is supposed to. If what he said was telling, the fact that he said it was even more so: a portrait of the way things sometimes are at a club where Neville admits feeling people greeting him with looks that said \u201cyou won\u2019t be here for long\u201d; where, if they did, they were right. On Sunday night Kempes backed the coach \u2026 and then made a pitch for his job. It is one he thinks might become available again soon, and he is not alone.</p> <p>Ayestar\u00e1n is under pressure for sure. Over the last seven seasons, Valencia\u2019s position after four games reads: sixth, third, third, first, sixth, second, second. This time, they\u2019re 20th, bottom of the pile. Played four, lost four, conceded 10. It is the joint-worst start in their history. The last three teams to start like this \u2013 Osasuna, Sporting and X\u00e9rez \u2013 all went down. Away at Athletic Bilbao is never easy but this time it was set up as the game they had to win; a \u201cfinal\u201d already, with 34 games still to go. As one paper put it, they were obliged to wipe out that zero by their name. They didn\u2019t: two goals from Aritz Aduriz saw them defeated 2-1 at San Mam\u00e9s.</p> <p>This is Valencia\u2019s joint-worst start ever yet, oddly, despite the results it hasn\u2019t all been bad. Not <em>that</em> bad, anyway.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s missing,\u201d goalkeeper Diego Alves said on Sunday. \u201cIn every game we have shown that we have the qualities to win, but we have no points,\u201d Mario Su\u00e1rez noted. Luck always feels like a desperately weak explanation for anything but it plays its part. Las Palmas coach Quique Seti\u00e9n admitted that Valencia deserved more when his side beat them 4-2 on the opening night; the week after they should have been four or five up by half-time against Eibar, but lost 1-0 to a Pedro Len penalty; and the week after that they came from 2-0 down to equalise against Betis, and could have won it before conceding a late goal. On Sunday, they went a goal ahead inside three minutes.</p> <p>Yet again, though, Valencia were fragile; defensively they have been appalling, mentally they appear weak, belief slipping away. Mistakes are damaging them; more of them individual than systemic. Opponents find space too easily. It doesn\u2019t take much to create chances against them. They do not compete: \u201cEven their milk teeth haven\u2019t come through yet,\u201d as Cayetano Ros put it. Centre-backs Ezequiel Garay and Eliaquim Mangala arrived on the final day of the transfer window but they have not yet remedied their ills \u2013 Garay was injured on Sunday, while Aduriz destroyed Mangala. There is little real control in the middle, and up front they miss chances. Against Athletic it was just the one, but it was a clear one.</p> <p>And so here they are; here the manager is, under pressure. It is not just this season, either. Valencia lost the last three games of last season too. Seven consecutive defeats is their worst ever run. Over the last eight games, Valencia\u2019s record reads: lost seven, drawn one \u2013 their last win was back in April. It is not just the results that matter but the reaction they provoke; the instability is inescapable. That filters into the dressing room; Mestalla is treated as transient by many of them. There is something about the culture, the structure, that Neville believed was not conducive to sustainable success. Not yet, at least. The manager, certainly, is at risk of becoming a passing presence \u2013 and accepted as such, a short-term solution that is increasingly not a solution at all.</p> <p>Kempes said that the manager should be supported, but then <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESPNMarioKempes/status/777586954024148992?lang=en\">he tweeted</a>: \u201cTo all those asking: I\u2019d do it with all my desire if they asked me to.\u201d Soon, Ossie Ardiles <a href=\"https://twitter.com/osvaldooardiles/status/777607107394887681\">was offering himself as assistant</a>: \u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d he wrote. The former striker Fernando Morientes called Kempes\u2019s words \u201cunethical\u201d. Meanwhile, over at Super Deporte, they were running a poll. Was it necessary to sack Ayestar\u00e1n? Not desirable, <em>necessary;</em> 90% said yes. \u201cPaKO,\u201d they called him. Valencia are looking at alternatives, reports say. Whether it\u2019s actually an alternative is another matter. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the manager,\u201d the former goalkeeper Santiago Ca\u00f1izares insists. \u201cThe situation disgusts me,\u201d says the former captain David Albelda.</p> <p>Valencia have had eight managers since Unai Emery departed in the summer of 2012 season. Since Lim took over in October 2014, they have had Pizzi, Nuno and Voro (as caretaker), then Neville \u2013 whose arrival was presented, damagingly, more as a favour to a friend than the arrival of the ideal coach \u2013 and then Ayestar\u00e1n. Under him, Valencia have picked up 10 points from a possible 36; under Neville, the man he replaced, and the man who replaced Nuno, they picked up 14 from 48. That\u2019s 0.29 points a game under Neville, 0.27 under Ayestar\u00e1n. So much for his sacking solving things; so much for any sacking doing so. With each of the last three managers things have got worse, Valencia are becoming the old lady who swallowed a fly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e5daae1d83b70c57b1a844971483ec6eccbd506\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e5daae1d83b70c57b1a844971483ec6eccbd506/0_0_4096_2393/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Athletic players celebrate going 2-1 up against Valencia at San Mames.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"584\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Athletic players celebrate going 2-1 up against Valencia at San Mames.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luis Tejido/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like his predecessors, Ayestar\u00e1n works with what he has been given and within an environment not entirely of his own making. \u201cI didn\u2019t say I was happy with the squad,\u201d he pointed out last week. This summer Valencia\u2019s best player departed early. Their captain and top-scorer left a few days after the president said he wouldn\u2019t. The centre-back who was not for sale got sold. The centre-backs who were for sale didn\u2019t. They tried to get rid of their goalkeeper but couldn\u2019t \u2013 now he\u2019s first choice again. Their former captain said he wanted to go too, but they wouldn\u2019t let him. He was isolated until he apologised. Garay and Mangala arrived \u2013 two more Mendes men to replace the last two, who failed. And the starting centre-backs in the B team couldn\u2019t be temporarily called up to the first team because they are over 23.</p> <p>And yet, take a step back and the summer business actually does not look bad. Financial regulations forced them to sell and they sold pretty well; over \u20ac100m was raised and they managed to get rid of some players they saw as problematic. On the face of it, the squad is reasonably strong; there are good players there. The football has not always been bad, even if the defending has. It doesn\u2019t look good, no \u2013 this is a team that should aspire to a Champions League place and it\u2019s bottom of La Liga instead, one whose results have been poor going back five months now, and where the explanations don\u2019t always convince \u2013 but then the last time they began with four defeats they finished third and reached the Champions League final.</p> <p>After Sunday\u2019s defeat the first question was direct: \u201cAre you capable of turning this around?\u201d Ayestar\u00e1n\u2019s lips moved but no words came out until the man sitting next to him flicked the switch. The microphone was on now, so Ayestar\u00e1n repeated himself. \u201cTotally,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth me and the players.\u201d</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 Legan\u00e9s\u2019s posters advertising the visit of Barcelona on Saturday ran with the slogan: \u201cLet God decide\u201d.

Even without a formal arrangement, EU law already provides for limited recognition of non-EU regulatory regimes for the purpose of undertaking investment and banking business, it said.</p> <p>Simon Ainsworth, the senior vice-president at Moody\u2019s, said a scheme to harmonise regulations across the EU could provide an alternative way to access the single market.</p> <p>\u201cThe complexity of (quickly) unwinding the status quo and a desire to minimise the initial impact on European domiciled banks will likely lead to the preservation of most cross-border rights to undertake business,\u201d said Ainsworth.</p> <p>Moody\u2019s added that there would be less certainty for firms as access would depend on a judgment by the European commission, which might take time to make and could be withdrawn later.</p> <p>Ainsworth said: \u201cWhile banks that use the UK as an entry point for most EU operations should not suffer materially altered credit fundamentals if they lost their EU passports, the uncertainty around the outcome of any new arrangements mean that it is likely that some banks may choose to move some UK-based activities to the EU before the UK\u2019s withdrawal negotiations are complete.\u201d<br></p> <p>Mark Boleat, the policy chairman at the City of London Corporation, said: \u201cPassporting is still a crucial issue for financial services firms and the uncertainty is causing real problems for some businesses.

I suspect at one time or another we\u2019ve all uttered the words \u201cdon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s nothing serious\u201d, or struggled in only to be greeted by a concerned colleague who politely asked us to go home and stop sneezing on them.</p> <p>Whether it\u2019s guilt about letting down the team, concern your tasks won\u2019t get covered or more likely some fear that it might be counted against you, the trend for employees to come into work or to work longer hours when they should be taking time off has been growing.</p> <p>Research by Simplyhealth and the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), where I work as chief executive, shows \u201cpresenteeism\u201d is on the rise. Our <a href=\"https://www.cipd.co.uk/research/absence-management-survey.aspx\" title=\"\">2015 survey</a> showed that in the preceding 12 months, a third of firms reported a rise in employees working when they\u2019re sick, and this has some pretty clear negative effects on employee wellbeing.

Many of the companies and employees we talk to cite job insecurity as a reason for increased presenteeism, with employees fearing that a competitive job market, and the growth of automation, will make them more replaceable.</p> <p>But leaders and managers set the tone, and have a responsibility not just to their organisation but also to the wellbeing of their employees. As our research shows, increasing presenteeism leads to increased prevalence of stress, and there is a wealth of evidence, such as the Towers Watson <a href=\"file:///Volumes/Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/Towers-Watson-Insider-Workers-Still-Uneasy-About-Financial.pdf\" title=\"\">2014 Global Benefits Attitudes survey</a>, which clearly shows that workplace stress leads to less productive employees.</p> <p>So why, then, do more than half of all organisations admit that they aren\u2019t doing anything to combat this growing problem? It may well be that they believe that promoting long-term employee wellbeing might come at the expense of the short-term success of an organisation, but it can also be a lack of awareness of the growth of a corporate culture that accepts or even encourages presenteeism.</p> <p>To perform at our best, people need to be well both physically and mentally. If businesses want employees who are engaged and motivated, then employees need to feel that their organisation, their managers and bosses are supporting them, and not pressuring them to work when they are not properly fit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/08/zero-hours-contracts-used-far-beyond-short-term-work-research-says\">Zero-hours contracts used far beyond short-term work, research says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How do we change this culture? It has to come from the top down. Employees won\u2019t feel empowered to take time off when they\u2019re sick if their manager\u2019s behaviour runs counter to that. The second action businesses can take is to build a culture that emphasises healthy living.</p> <p>Health should be promoted in the workplace, with people given the opportunity to learn more about their own health, to exercise and eat well within the workplace and beyond. At the CIPD, we host discounted zumba and yoga classes each week. TransferWise takes all its staff on annual company holidays, while the law firm Allen &amp; Overy has GPs and dentists on site. Those are at the more expensive end of the scale, but even simple things like free fruit for staff, a perk offered by just 15% of employers, can help instil a healthier work culture.</p> <p>Mental health and particularly the understanding of stress is equally important and is perhaps even more challenging. Much more needs to be done to educate managers in how to show understanding and ask the right questions, and how and where to find the right support. Leaders in this field, such as Google, have built good mental health into their culture by offering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/google-meditation-mindfulness-technology\" title=\"\">mindfulness classes</a> to staff, while many large employers in the City, such as KPMG and Deloitte, have launched the <a href=\"http://citymha.org.uk/\" title=\"\">City Mental Health Alliance</a>, working with charities to end the stigma attached to mental health problems.</p> <p>The message to business is clear; a workforce that is well, works well. Clinton may have wanted to preserve her image of strength, but she wasn\u2019t being honest with herself.

  "<p>It\u2019s 26 years since Paul Romer shook the discipline of economics with a single research paper. Entitled Endogenous Technological Change, Romer\u2019s article showed how information technology changed something fundamental about our world \u2013 moving the focus of economics away from land, labour and capital towards \u201cpeople, ideas and things\u201d. Last week, a generation later, Romer published what many see as <a href=\"https://paulromer.net/the-trouble-with-macro/\" title=\"\">an equally significant intervention</a>. Macroeconomics, he argues, is like a science that has not only stalled for three decades, but has actually gone backwards in its ability to understand reality.</p> <p>In the late 1970s, as the old certainties of Keynesianism collapsed, a new generation of economists moved the discipline on to the terrain of super-abstract equations. Their assumption was that the economy tends towards equilibrium, and that only unpredictable shocks from outside the system can disturb it. Since the shocks come from outside, for the purposes of these mathematical models, the economist has to imagine what they might be. In The Trouble With Macroeconomics, Romer mocks these imaginary disruptions. He compares the result to a kind of physics that only works if there are \u201ctrolls, gremlins and aether\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s not a new line of attack. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/10/stop-another-great-depression-debt\" title=\"\">The Kingston University economist Steve Keen</a> has long argued that reliance on flawed models contributed to the scale of the 2008 crash \u2013 by encouraging decision-makers to underestimate risks, economic theory has the power to make the world more dangerous. But Keen is a lifelong rebel; Romer is a doyen of the profession, and from the heart of the US academic mainstream. His attack on some of the most esteemed and influential economists of our time is a big thing.</p> <p>And the stakes are big, too. One of the theories that, even now, eight years after the crash, continues to disorient policymakers is the assumption that actions by central banks are irrelevant. A total of $12tn (\u00a39.1tn) has been printed by central banks to stave off global depression, yet the threat remains real. Stagnation is a threat that keeps central bankers, governments and social theorists awake at night \u2013 with the palliative always being looser monetary policy.</p> <p>Yet orthodox economic theory insists it would have no real effect if the central banks pulled all this support \u2013 since the equations tell them there is no correlation between monetary policy and output. Mark Carney or Mario Draghi could double interest rates and slash quantitative easing and the economy should grow at just the same rate, says the theory.</p> <p>Romer, scathingly, calls this \u201cpost-real\u201d economics, and suggests a horribly simple explanation for its popularity: human frailty. Comparing the economics elite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/jun/16/has-physics-gone-too-far\" title=\"\">with its equivalent in theoretical physics</a>, Romer notes the same problems: over-confidence, \u201can unusually monolithic community\u201d, near-religious group loyalties, a tendency to disregard results that don\u2019t match the theory \u2013 and too little consideration of the risks of being wrong.</p> <p>This is not just a problem for economics. Romer says the parallels between bad physics and bad economics suggest there might be a \u201cgeneral failure mode\u201d in any discipline that becomes over-reliant on maths. Basically, the kudos goes to people at the cutting edge of designing mathematical models, not to those whose models match reality. If Romer is right, there are big implications for the way governments and central banks make policy. Instead of abstract models, you would need something much closer to reality \u2013 and, with the rise of computer simulation technologies, that is close at hand.</p> <p>The agent-based model, instead of reducing reality to a few variables, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/04/economy-accurate-model-greek-debt-social-house-building\" title=\"\">tries to replicate reality \u2013 and its randomness \u2013 in detail</a>. Such models are common in weather prediction, or city transport planning: think of them as a professional version of the computer game Sim City. In an agent-based model, you don\u2019t try to work out whether a&#xa0;million people will, on aggregate, buy more bread or less bread. You create a million digital \u201cpeople\u201d and unleash them in world with digital bread and digital money.</p> <p>Oxford professor J Doyne Farmer <a href=\"http://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/projects/view/158\" title=\"\">has long advocated the adoption of agent-based modelling in economics</a>; the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2015/speech812.pdf\" title=\"\">is a convert</a>. Reality, says Haldane, is not only more complex than the maths-based economics imagines, it is also not rational. The sum of buying and selling decisions we take each day \u2013 from the cappuccino and croissant on the way to work, to the fund we keep our pension in \u2013 are driven by something other than the rationality that mainstream economists assume. As a result, while the old, maths-based economist expects stability and assumes a \u201cgremlin\u201d where it is disrupted, the heterodox economist expects big and unpredictable shocks.</p> <p>If you stood close enough to Marx\u2019s grave in Highgate, since Romer\u2019s paper got released last week, you might hear a deep Germanic chuckle coming from beneath the stones. Marx, too, was a fan of abstraction \u2013 and worried so much that he was out of the loop of maths-based economics in the 1870s that he produced <a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1881/mathematical-manuscripts/\" title=\"\">a 1,000-page notebook documenting his attempts to learn differential calculus</a>.</p> <p>But, in the end, Marx wanted to use maths to model the core unpredictabilities that have become so obvious to us in the past 10 years: boom-bust cycles that the professionals told us were impossible; depressions that the giants of modern academia assured us had been solved decades ago. Marx never even came close to achieving this \u2013 and since then, economics has veered between stability and instability theories, about every 25 years.</p> <p>Romer\u2019s huge mea culpa on behalf of mainstream economics is a sign that, after a decade-long hunt for trolls and gremlins as the cause of crisis, academia now has to begin the search for the cause of instablity inside the system, not outside it. My hunch is that the answer lies in large, agent-based simulations, in which millions of virtual people take random decisions driven by irrational urges \u2013 such as sex and altruism \u2013 not just the pursuit of wealth.</p> <p>What the left can bring to the design of these models are the insights that still draw lines of emnity through elite campuses: that class, gender and race exist as economic facts; that the 1% always acts with more information than the 99%; that crises are unavoidable but can be mitigated by accepting they might happen.</p> <p>And above all: that sacking or excluding people who insist \u201ccapitalism is unstable\u201d is a bad idea if you are running, say, a treasury, a major political party or a central bank.</p>",
  "<p>By now, we all know the greatest priority of Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government is its relationship with Indigenous peoples. How could we miss the weekly reminders? <br></p> <p>Trudeau graciously wrapping himself in ceremonial blankets. Hauling jugs of drinking water door-to-door on a northern reserve lacking potable water. Paddling the Ottawa river in his dad\u2019s buckskin jacket and moccasins with Indigenous youth, after a sunrise ritual at dawn.</p> <p>Welcome to the era of reconciliation, ushered in by a Prime Minister so different in appearance from his predecessors. Free of prejudices. Moved to tears by the country\u2019s dark history. Committed to the need for deep, fundamental change. </p> <p>Except this carefully scripted story, <a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/shoal-lake-trip-was-key-element-in-trudeau-government-post-budget-messaging-blitz\">managed even more tightly</a> than ex-Prime Minister Stephen Harper\u2019s, has long been unravelling. </p> <p>It began with the fraying of Trudeau\u2019s official platform. A legal order issued to the Liberals to end racial discrimination against Indigenous children? <a href=\"http://aptn.ca/news/2016/09/15/tribunal-orders-canada-again-to-comply-with-its-ruling-on-first-nation-child-welfare/\">Repeatedly ignored</a>. Compensation for 16,000 individuals snatched from their homes and adopted by non-Indigenous families in the Sixties Scoop? <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2016/08/22/ottawa-must-apologize-for-sixties-scoop-and-compensate-survivors-editorial.html\">Opposed in court</a>. And that historic budget for First Nations? Turned out most of the funds <a href=\"http://aptn.ca/news/2016/03/22/federal-liberal-budget-failed-first-nation-children-families-blackstock/\">would flow</a> only in 2020\u2014after the next election. Not exactly the \u201cnew relationship\u201d that Trudeau announced to rapturous international applause.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s what hasn\u2019t made the headlines. In British Columbia, Quebec, the Atlantic provinces and elsewhere through Canada, there are scores of First Nations who have never signed away their Aboriginal title through treaties. For years they\u2019ve racked up debt while in negotiations with the government over lands sought after by mineral, forestry, hydro and oil companies. But as a pre-condition for any compensation, they\u2019re <a href=\"https://ricochet.media/en/1154/trudeau-cloaks-continued-attack-on-first-nations-sovereignty-with-charm\">forced to extinguish</a> their rights to 9 out of every 10 parcels of their territory\u2014rivers, forests, mountains, farmland, and everything underneath.</p> <p>Fair to have expected a change under Trudeau? Instead the Liberals have given negotiators marching orders from a Harper-commissioned report that <a href=\"https://ricochet.media/en/125/harper-first-nations-assimilation-agenda\">advises</a> how to force through energy infrastructure. That\u2019s because Indigenous rights stand in the way of pipelines, mega-dams like Site C, giant fracked gas terminals\u2014and $650bn in resource projects over the next ten years that the Liberals are trumpeting as much as the Conservatives did.</p> <p>Never mind that recent Supreme Court decisions, and the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples before them, call for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2014/oct/21/the-indigenous-land-rights-ruling-that-could-transform-canada\">shared sovereignty or management</a> over these lands. Or that many more Canadians are realizing that Indigenous stewardship of large swathes of territory\u2014instead of its mismanagement by multi-national corporations\u2014would be to the benefit of everyone. </p> <p>Trudeau may indeed want to do right by Indigenous peoples, but the government is locked into a logic of its own: quietly maintaining exclusive control over Indigenous peoples\u2019 lands and resources. Is this what Trudeau meant when he said his government would \u201cthink seven generations out\u201d?</p> <p>Turning the language of liberation into a contraption of conquest is nothing new: it\u2019s part of Liberal heritage. In the early 1990s, as calls for Indigenous self-determination gained steam on the heels of widespread protest and the Oka crisis, the Liberals appeared to embrace the movement\u2019s demand. They named their policy \u201cthe Inherent Right to Self-Government.\u201d </p> <p>Yet this policy\u2014still on the books\u2014only grants First Nations rights such as policing, education, and the licensing of marriages; the government keeps all powers of trade, diplomacy and serious economic development and decision-making to themselves. No wonder Indigenous critics have said it turns First Nations into \u201cethnic municipalities\u201d: it is nothing like a genuine third-order of government. </p> <p>The Liberals latest utterances appear just as soothingly promising: \u201creconciliation,\u201d \u201cnation-to-nation,\u201d even \u201cdecolonization.\u201d The most slippery of all has been their use of \u201cconsent.\u201d Though the Liberals have proclaimed their support for the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\u2014at whose heart lies the right of \u201cfree, prior and informed consent\u201d\u2014they\u2019ve been loath to recognize it in practice on the ground. </p> <p>It\u2019s obvious why: the right of consent sends shudders through corporate boardrooms whose goodwill the Liberals covet. As an alternative, the government has <a href=\"http://aptn.ca/news/2016/05/09/trudeau-government-eyeing-nwts-collaborate-consent-model-as-part-of-undrip-implementation/\">wheeled</a> out a hazy concept of \u201ccollaborative consent.\u201d All that\u2019s clear is it studiously avoids recognizing the actual right to say no to destructive resource projects. Indigenous feminists have <a href=\"http://landbodydefense.org/\">underlined</a> the hollowness of this half-measure: whether it\u2019s territories or bodies, if you don\u2019t have the power to say no, then \u201cconsent\u201d is meaningless.</p> <p>The extractivist worldview\u2014bent on treating everything as a commodity\u2014that lay behind Stephen Harper\u2019s resource agenda just as powerfully shapes Trudeau\u2019s. In fact, the Liberals\u2019 attempt to wrap themselves in the UN Declaration without embracing its central right may constitute a new, more subtle form of extraction: the extraction from Indigenous territory of consent itself.</p> <p>Liberal moves to extract and manufacture consent and support for outdated policies are evident elsewhere: restoring funding to the Assembly of First Nations, a government-dependent organization that has since plumped frequently for them; appointing an Indigenous Justice Minister, even though Indigenous critics argue she has sided with the government agenda throughout her political career; and agreeing to call an inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women, but with a <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/missing-women-marion-buller-reaction-mmiw-inquiry-1.3705804\">mandate</a> far short of what impacted families wanted. As the weight of reality presses against Trudeau\u2019s rhetoric, the ability to generate consent is crumbling.</p> <p>Reconciliation is a powerful hope, an uplifting prospect, a deeply desired new relationship that Trudeau has compellingly invoked. But if reconciliation does not include the restitution of land, the recognition of real self-government, the reigning in of abusive police, the remediation of rivers and forests, it will remain a vacant notion, a cynical ploy to preserve a status quo in need not of tinkering but transformation.

  "<p>Some of the most important stories published by the Guardian have come from whistleblowers. Their disclosures have been vital in exposing stories of huge public interest, sometimes with global ramifications. Our pledge is to protect our sources \u2010 and not to disclose their identities, or our communications with them, unless their approval has been given. If you want to get in touch with us in a way that protects your security and anonymity, there are a number of technical options that may help \u2013 although, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/data-computer-security\">of course</a>, none of them can be 100% guaranteed.</p> <h2>Messaging apps</h2> <p>Phone apps do little to hide who and where you are, but if your priority is confidentiality rather than anonymity, there are a number of apps that offer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption\">\u201cend to end\u201d encryption</a>. They include Signal (from the <a href=\"https://whispersystems.org/\">Open Whisper Systems</a> not-for-profit organisation) and <a href=\"https://threema.ch/en\">Threema</a>. (These are examples. We don\u2019t endorse any particular security app.) The Guardian investigation teams can all be contacted using Signal:</p> <ul> <li><p>London: <a href=\"tel:+447584640566\">+44 7584 640566</a><br></p></li> <li><p>New York: <a href=\"tel:+16469260436\">+1 646 926 0436</a></p></li> <li><p>Sydney: <a href=\"tel:+61457262172\">+61 457 262172</a></p></li> </ul> <p>End to end encryption means \u2010 theoretically \u2010 nobody else will be able to see the content of any message you send. To get started, you need to share mobile phone numbers with a reporter. That\u2019s not difficult to do; you can ring the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/help/contact-us\">Guardian head office</a> from a landline (preferably not from work or home, which could be easy to trace) to get put through to the reporter concerned, and then share details. Or you can do so using one of the following methods.</p> <h2>Email</h2> <p>If you plan to write an email to a Guardian journalist about a sensitive matter, look into <a href=\"https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/introduction-public-key-cryptography-and-pgp\">PGP encryption</a>. It\u2019s more complicated than using apps, but is probably more secure in practice, and email is much easier for sending longer messages and attachments. Used properly, PGP should make a message or document unreadable to anyone except the person who sent it and the person for whom it was encrypted.</p> <p>How does it work? With PGP, you will use a \u201cpublic key\u201d that belongs to the person you are writing to, but is freely available on the internet. This key turns your message into an unreadable jumble. Your recipient \u2013 and no one else \u2013 has a corresponding \u201cprivate key\u201d which can unlock messages that were encrypted by their public key.</p> <p>Public keys for Guardian journalists can be found on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/pgp\">https://www.theguardian.com/pgp</a> and on many writers\u2019 profile pages.</p> <p>Two popular PGP encryption software packages are <a href=\"https://www.gpg4win.org/\">Gpg4win</a> for Windows and <a href=\"https://gpgtools.org/gpgsuite.html\">GPG Suite</a> for Macs. If you use a browser to access a webmail service, such as Gmail or Yahoo! Mail, you may want to look at <a href=\"https://www.mailvelope.com/\">Mailvelope</a>.</p> <p>PGP can be a bit fiddly. It\u2019s best to play around with it first by sending an email containing relatively innocuous content.</p> <p>Although there\u2019s no easy way to break PGP codes, it does have shortcomings. An encrypted email message can still reveal the identity of the sender. One way to reduce that risk could be to create an independent email address solely for contacting the Guardian. You may want to use computers that aren\u2019t associated with you when setting up and when using such an account. Going to an internet cafe is one option \u2010 just be careful about who can see your screen and whether there are CCTV cameras nearby. And think about the information you provide while signing up to a new account. Does any of it link the new address back to you?</p> <p>If you\u2019re using a shared computer, remember that email and browser software normally retains a history of what you\u2019ve been doing, unless you clear it or use a private browsing or incognito option. And consider the times at which you send messages. Could that information help prove that you sent them?</p> <h2>Tor</h2> <p>Even an anonymous email address doesn\u2019t conceal the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address\">IP address</a> from which a message has been sent, and an IP address could be traced back to you. To help avoid this you could use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)\">Tor network</a>, which bounces your message through a series of relays to hide the source location. To access the Tor network you will need to install <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\">Tor software</a>. Tor browsers can be configured to discard your browsing history and to minimise the amount of information you share.</p> <p>As with email, if your computer is being monitored at source, Tor does not protect you from that.</p> <h2>Tails</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/\">Tails</a>, which is short for \u201cThe Amnesiac and Incognito Live System\u201d, is a computer operating system designed to preserve security. It connects to the internet using the Tor network; it helps guard against local monitoring; and when you log out, it wipes any unencrypted content. It is far more secure than using a normal computer or phone.</p> <h2>SecureDrop</h2> <p>The best way to contact the Guardian securely is through our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/securedrop\">SecureDrop</a> document portal.</p> <p>The SecureDrop site is only accessible over the Tor network. All submitted messages and documents are automatically encrypted. We download those encrypted files on to Tails computers and then decode them in a secure environment on a computer that is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gap_(networking)\">completely offline</a>. SecureDrop does not record where things came from: all we can see is what has been sent to us, the time it arrived, and a randomly generated code name for whoever submitted it.</p> <p>For maximum security and anonymity, contact us via SecureDrop from a computer that you are confident is not being monitored.</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to provide us with a means of contacting you but it can sometimes be useful for us to be able to do so. It can also help us if you are able to provide some background about what is in the documents and why you think they might be of interest to us.</p> <p><em>We previously mentioned WhatsApp in the Messaging Apps section of this page. In view of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/13/whatsapp-backdoor-allows-snooping-on-encrypted-messages\">concerns over its implementation of encryption</a>, we have removed it.</em></p>",

Corbyn said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Thank you to Apulina and Raestory for your questions. I have voiced my support for decriminalisation in the past, motivated by not wanting those engaged in prostitution to become criminals, but I recognise there are a range of passionately-held views by those currently in sex work, and those such as Raestory, who identify themselves as survivors, by campaigners, and women\u2019s rights activists. All these people have women\u2019s interests and equality at heart. Where we can agree is that women in prostitution and sex work should not be criminalised or stigmatised, and have their human and citizen rights protected, and have access to the support of social, health, public services and justice. This is no less than all women deserve.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that a \u201chard\u201d Brexit would eliminate most manufacturing in the UK. </strong>Someone asked him about Brexit, saying that one notable economist has said a \u201chard\u201d Brexit would mostly eliminate manufacturing.

I always try to see something good in all the people I am dealing with. And whilst the mainstream media have been fairly hostile it\u2019s not my experience when travelling around the country and indeed in my office we have a wall of postcards from people of all ages from all parts of the country giving positive supportive opinions and wishing us well.

I have many political influences, from my mother and father and also as a late teenager living and working in Jamaica and travelling throughout Latin America, I could see the dreadful levels of inequality there.

And even if that proves compelling, was nine months really enough time before MPs tried to oust a politician elected by the party\u2019s membership?</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t in favour of there being a challenge,\u201d says Smith quickly. \u201cBut once a challenge had been made then I felt I needed to stand because I felt that I had something to say about the future of the Labour party, and a lot of other people in the PLP [parliamentary Labour party] felt that about me, which is why they asked me to stand.\u201d</p> <p>So Smith would have preferred to see Corbyn allowed to carry on for longer?</p> <p>\u201cYes, is the honest answer,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Not that this is an admission of regret about his bid to topple the sitting leader.</p> <p>\u201cThe truth is, things weren\u2019t going well, things aren\u2019t going well. Nine months may be a short period of time but it\u2019s a period of time in which the Labour party has gone backwards,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are at a lower ebb than we\u2019ve been in the polls at any time since 1982, and we\u2019re six years into a Tory government and right now they are unfettered, they feel able to act with total impunity.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>And here is the interview in full.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/19/owen-smith-labour-leadership-more-crucial-than-my-northern-ireland-peace-role\">Owen Smith: Labour leadership more crucial than my NI peace role</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57dfc258e4b0a646ec15cf40\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-19T11:26:35.128Z\">12.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Number 10 lobby briefing - Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the main points from the Number 10 lobby briefing.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Downing Street defended Liam Fox\u2019s decision to tell businesses they should invest more abroad.</strong> According to ITV\u2019s Robert Peston, the international trade secretary delivered this message recently at a meeting hosted by the CBI.<a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/2016-09-17/fox-tells-uk-businesses-to-invest-more-abroad/\"> Peston says some of those in the audience thought Fox was \u201cbonkers\u201d.</a> Here is an extract from his blog.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cRight now we need as much investment here as we can possibly get, to prevent a rise in unemployment - which is what many of us believe will be the painful reality of leaving the EU\u201d, said the head of a huge UK company. \u201cFew of us could really believe that he was telling us to invest more in other parts of the world. There was a real sense in the room of \u2018this is bonkers\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>A senior City figure said: \u201cWe assumed he would be telling us to invest here. It was literally amazing that he said we should do precisely the opposite\u201d.</p> <p>Another said the atmosphere in the room was \u201cicy\u201d - and said Mr Fox left without the usual applause.</p> </blockquote> <p>The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said that Fox was making the point that \u201cover time we need a balance of inward and outward investment for the national current account\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><strong>The spokesman insisted that the UK would not defy EU law when discussing future trade deals with countries outside the EU. </strong>Yesterday <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/britain-risks-eu-fines-over-trade-8b5mx5bdm\">the Sunday Times (subscription) revealed that leaked documents show that Fox has been advised that, if the UK opens trade talks while still a member of the EU, it could be fined by the European commission. </a>The spokesman would not comment specifically on the leaked document. He said the government was engaged in a \u201cdialogue\u201d with other countries about what its future trade relations might look like. But it would not defy EU rules, he said.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whilst we remain a member of the EU, we will comply with our responsibilities.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Number 10 snubbed the Telegraph campaign calling for the Royal Yacht Britannia to be recommissioned to assist in future trade talks. </strong>On Saturday the Telegraph splashed <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/16/bring-back-britannia-to-rule-the-waves-after-brexit/\">on a story saying dozens of MPs were backing the newspaper\u2019s campaign for the yacht to be brought out of retirement</a>. In<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2016/09/17/the-royal-yacht-should-sail-again/\"> an editorial</a> the paper said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Brexit, and the need to negotiate new trade deals, is calling the royal yacht back to service. A debate has begun over whether or not to return Britannia to sea or to commission a replacement. It has demonstrated its potential before: Britannia brought in an estimated \u00a33 billion in commercial deals between 1991 and 1995. Now that the UK is taking back control of its national trade arrangements from Brussels, engagement with countries such as Australia and Canada is primed to begin. Britain is rediscovering its ancient role as a seafaring, mercantile power. In that context, the symbolism of the royal yacht is striking.</p> </blockquote> <p>But, when the spokesman was asked if the prime minister supported this campaign, he said the government was looking at \u201ca number of ways\u201d in which the government could achieve its ambition of turning the UK into a \u201cglobal leader for free trade\u201d. He went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As far as I\u2019m aware, the recommissioning of Britannia is not on the agenda for that.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Downing Street defended the work of the Iraq Historical Abuse Team, following reports today that</strong><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3795778/David-Cameron-overruled-wanted-end-Iraq-abuse-probes.html\"><strong> David Cameron tried to close it down when he was prime minister</strong>. </a>The spokesman said that the work of IHAT had recently been reviewed and that the review found it to be \u201cwell led and operating well\u201d. It would soon be moving to a position where it had a much reduced caseload, he said, and it was expected it would finish its work by the end of 2019.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The spokesman said the government was raising the case of the \u201cChennai Six\u201d at the highest level with the Indian government - but he refused to say if the government thought they had been wrongly jailed.</strong><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1807193/british-war-heroes-rotting-in-indian-prison-for-crimes-they-didnt-commit-beg-for-government-to-help-them/\"> Campaigners claim that the six former British servicemen, who were jailed for having weapons which they say they were using legitimately for anti-piracy work, are victims of a miscarriage of justice.</a> The spokesman said that Theresa May was aware of the case and that British consular officials were \u201cproviding a full package of support\u201d. The case has also been raised with the Indian government \u201cat the highest level\u201d, the spokesman said.

When it was put to him that Johnson had called him \u201cincompetent\u201d, \u201cuseless\u201d and \u201cincapable\u201d, Corbyn replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Very kind of Alan. How generous of him ... Alan hasn\u2019t fully understood what my concerns were in the past. My concerns were when a Labour government led by Tony Blair took us into war in Iraq, I opposed that. When he tried to bring in, and indeed did bring in, tuition fees, I opposed him on that. I think he should understand my opposition to those issues was on the politics of it. I didn\u2019t indulge in that language that many have used against me, and I never will. </p> </blockquote> <p>Here is a flavour of what Johnson said in the interview.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Corbyn] is totally incompetent and incapable of being the leader of a political party and he knows it,\u201d he says. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t got a huge ego but it\u2019s got bigger and he\u2019s self-righteous. There\u2019s this adulation out there, it goes to your head. No compromise with the electorate was the left\u2019s theme in the early Eighties and God forbid we go back to that.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn rejected suggestions that he was avoiding giving interviews to mainstream media outlets. </strong>Nick Robinson, who was interviewing Corbyn, said this was the first interview with Today Corbyn had agreed to do since the leadership contest started. Citing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/17/jeremy-corbyn-should-be-tougher-not-my-style\">what Corbyn said in his Guardian interview on Saturday about how \u201ccommunication is everything\u201d </a>, Robinson put it to him that if he avoided interviews with the mainstream media, he could not win an election. Corbyn did not accept this. He insisted that he had done plenty of media:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With the deepest and greatest respect to the Today programme - I know it\u2019s the most important radio programme on the whole planet - it is not the only radio programme on the whole planet.

Referring to the list Coyle said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If this is their attempt at reaching out or an attempt at engagement, then they are failing abysmally. He [Mr Corbyn] knew about it and did nothing to stop it being drawn up, did nothing to stop it being published, and has done nothing to demonstrate that he is interested in a unified party, which is why I say to any Labour members still listening who haven\u2019t voted yet, they still have until Wednesday to make sure we end this nonsense. </p> <p>They are not interested in party unity.

He was asked why he thought being able to get hundreds of people to attend a rally could lead to him gaining power. Corbyn said that tens of thousands of people had attended his rallies over the summer. That showed there was a real \u201cinterest in politics\u201d, he said.

Asked by the Guardian whether she would consider calls for Britain to resettle more refugees, she said: \u201cWe have always taken the view that we can help more Syrian refugees by putting aid into the region.\u201d </p> <p>She added that some Syrians were also coming to the UK through the normal asylum-seeking routes, as well as 3,000 children from the region.</p> <p>Her answer appears to confirm that May will take the same approach as David <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/david-cameron-concessions-syrian-child-refugees\">Cameron, who only agreed to the programme for vulnerable refugees from Syria under pressure</a>.

She said: \u201cWe are working with local authorities and NGOs in relation to delivering on the Dubs amendment and we have for example speeded up our processes for ensuring family reunification can take place.\u201d</p> <p>May\u2019s main intervention at the UN summit will be to awarn of the dangers that mass uncontrolled migration poses. She will call for a better global system to manage the movement of people and propose better differentiation between refugees and economic migrants. It is understood that she is unlikely to announce any increase in the quota of refugees to be accepted, but the UK is expected to commit more money and humanitarian aid at the summit.</p> <p>Obama and the outgoing UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon hope to make progress in getting world leaders to pledge more help for refugees before the end of their tenures. Amnesty and other groups, however, have criticised the declaration due to be adopted at the UN summit for lacking teeth and merely reiterating humanitarian principles.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/12/rowan-williams-200-faith-leaders-open-letter-revise-refugee-policy\">Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, was one of 200 religious leaders who called last week for more action from the UK</a>, criticising the government\u2019s response to the refugee crisis as \u201ctoo slow, too low and too narrow\u201d.</p> <p>David Miliband, the head of the International Rescue Committee in New York, said this weekend that May should use the summit to promise that the UK would resettle more refugees. \u201cFrankly, the UK should be saying \u2018we\u2019ll take 20,000 or 25,000 a year\u2019, so four times the current level to match the commitment of countries like Canada.\u201d</p> <p>Maurice Wren, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: \u201cThese proposals indicate that the prime minister is intent on attempting to reinforce the untenable status quo, blocking off people\u2019s escape routes and leaving poor countries looking after nearly nine out of 10 of the world\u2019s refugees. </p> <p>\u201cWhat we really need to see instead is the UK leading by example, adopting sustainable solutions aimed at saving refugees\u2019 lives and implementing a more equitable system for sharing responsibility for protecting them.\u201d</p> <p>Yvette Cooper, the chair of Labour\u2019s refugee taskforce, called on May to meet the government\u2019s pledge to resettle 20,000 Syrians two years early and offer more help to those fleeing the war. \u201cThis will be a terrible missed opportunity if we don\u2019t get strong international action, and if Britain doesn\u2019t show the leadership needed,\u201d she said. </p> <p>\u201cThe prime minister is not doing enough. She is right to say there is a distinction between refugees and economic migrants, that is exactly why Britain should be doing more to help those fleeing persecution and war. Alongside border controls, we also need safe, legal routes to sanctuary including speeding up family reunion which is far too slow and mired in bureaucracy.</p> <p>\u201cAfter a 14-year-old boy died in Calais trying to reach his brother in the UK, children\u2019s safety should be the top of the agenda. There are 900 children alone in Calais at serious risk of harm and exploitation. It is a complete disgrace that still not a single child has been helped under the Dubs legislation parliament voted for, and that Home Office delays are blocking hundreds of unaccompanied children from reaching their family and safety.\u201d</p> <p>As well as making an intervention on migration, May will host a \u201cround table\u201d on stopping modern slavery and trafficking - one of her personal priorities as home secretary.</p> <p>The prime minister will point to the UK\u2019s new taskforce and announce that the heads of Mi5, Mi6, GCHQ and Interpol will join it when required. \u201cJust as it was Britain that took an historic stand to ban slavery two centuries ago, I am determined that the United Kingdom will once again lead the way in defeating modern slavery,\u201d she said ahead of the session for world leaders.</p> <p>In her maiden speech to the UN on Tuesday, May will call on the UN to deal better with problems that need a global response such as terrorism, mass migration and modern slavery. </p> <p>At the summit, May will also defend the vote for Brexit in her speech to the UN, saying the British people \u201cdid not vote to turn inwards or walk away from any of our partners in the world\u201d but they did want \u201ca politics that is more in touch with their concerns and bold action to address them\u201d.</p> <p>She will echo her claim made at the G20 in China that too many people are feeling left behind by globalisation.</p> <p>May is expected to have bilateral meetings with Ban Ki-moon, and the prime ministers of Pakistan, New Zealand, Egypt, and Turkey. She will also meet the prime minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, for the second time in a fortnight, after Tokyo\u2019s warning at the G20 summit that it\u2019s businesses could leave the UK without more clarity about the consequences the Brexit vote.</p> <p>On Monday evening, May will hold a reception for about 60 executives from companies such as Amazon, Goldman Sachs, IBM, Morgan Stanley and Black Rock, as the UK attempts to calm investors\u2019 fears about Brexit.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I will be talking about with both American and British leaders is about how we can encourage that trade and investment between the countries,\u201d May said. \u201cSomething like a million [British] people wake up each morning and go to work for an American company.\u201d </p>",

  "<h2>\u2026 BUT LOOK AT THE LIKES!</h2> <p>What a difference a week makes. Eight days, to be precise \u2013 that\u2019s all it has taken for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s new and improved Manchester United to tumble off their perch. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/18/watford-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">Sunday\u2019s 3-1 humbling by Watford</a>, following defeats by Manchester City and Feyenoord, sealed Mourinho\u2019s first losing three-peat in a season since 2002. It was also Watford\u2019s first win over United since 1986, forcing Lord Ferg to solemnly add another footnote to his Big Book O\u2019United Records.</p> <p>\u201cAgainst Feyenoord, we were the only team that wants to win, and we lose, and today was exactly the same,\u201d Mourinho parped afterwards, calling out the negative tactics of two teams who risked giving up creditable draws in pursuit of late winners. \u201cI feel that some individuals probably feel too much pressure and that responsibility,\u201d he added, simultaneously handing his charges a weak excuse, and all of the blame. Mourinho has also lost to two rivals in Pep Guardiola and Walter Mazzarri \u2013 an occupational hazard when you start beef with everyone you meet, for 15 years \u2013 and doesn\u2019t even seem up for the mind games any more. The Special (Three-) One is missing his mojo, and increasingly resembles a Mourinho lookalike in a Channel 5 documentary, available for hire to moan about Mark Clattenburg at a sales conference near you.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/19/marouane-fellaini-wayne-rooney-short-manchester-united-watford\">Fellaini and Rooney out of place in altered Manchester United system | Michael Cox</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He\u2019s not the only one. United fans are watching Wayne Rooney with the disquiet of a child encountering a scruffy, outsized version of SpongeBob SquarePants at a seaside resort. At Vicarage Road, Rooney was deployed in midfield and then as a No10 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/18/wayne-rooney-manchester-united-midfield-mess-jose-mourinho\">to equally dismal effect</a>, and Mourinho is running out of places to hide his captain. Guardiola might look at Rooney\u2019s ability to spray passes to either flank and stick him in goal, while the man himself favours a role where he shouts, points, huffs and puffs while the game goes on around him. A false footballer, if you will. </p> <p>Tea-timely emails that subsist on low-hanging fruit can at least rejoice that laughing at Manchester United is back. Maybe it\u2019s all part of the plan; after all, the club are financially no worse off for three seasons of farce, so monetisation of social media bantz is an obvious next step. Where will it end? Live match streaming on the Dubiously Sourced Bible? Tears of Joy named official emoji partner? The possibilities are endless. On the other hand, this could just be a negotiable early-season blip. When Troy Deeney is openly mocking your world-record signing at full-time, you know it\u2019s been a tough day at the office, but had Paul Pogba\u2019s shot dipped another few inches in the first half, nobody would be laughing.

Singapore is a key Asian market, where until now all top, top Premier League matches have kicked off on Sunday at 12.30pm GMT/7.30pm here. It\u2019s a complete lack of respect for the global market that has invested heavily in the Premier League Brand. I for one will be cancelling my subscription immediately. The 12.30pm kick-off time is sacrosanct and I can\u2019t believe that the clubs agreed to this all for the sake of an extra few billion pounds each.

  "<h2>1 | Crack down on illicit financial flows and tax evasion</h2> <p>An estimated $1tn [\u00a30.8tn] flows illegally out of developing countries and emerging economies each year \u2013 more than they receive in foreign direct investment and aid combined. Beyond bleeding the world\u2019s poorest economies, this propels crime, corruption and tax evasion. Most of the money is lost through trade mis-invoicing \u2013 where trade invoices are manipulated to change the value to secretly move money across borders. Folks in the water and sanitation sector could help promote the importance of raising more domestic revenue by combating tax evasion and avoidance, and push for some of that money to go towards water and sanitation projects. <em>Christine Clough, programme manager, <a href=\"http://www.gfintegrity.org/\">Global Financial Integrity</a></em></p> <h2>2 | Increase public investment<br></h2> <p>The most important route towards financing sanitation and water is increased domestic government investment. For example, a recent estimate of the annual sanitation financing gap in Ghana is $93m [\u00a371m]. <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/ghana\">Ghana\u2019s GDP</a> is around $38bn [\u00a328bn] and its total tax revenues amount to about 21% of GDP \u2013 a pretty good percentage for a low- to middle-income country. But the Ghanaian government currently invests only $7m [\u00a35m] yearly in sanitation: a tiny, trivial amount. If it were instead to invest 0.5% of GDP in sanitation, we\u2019d be looking at about $190m [\u00a3145m] \u2013 more than enough to cover the country\u2019s financing gap. The bottom line is that countries need to use equitable taxation to support the provision of basic services for poorer citizens. <em>Guy Norman, director of research &amp; evaluation, <a href=\"http://www.wsup.com/\">WSUP</a></em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/feb/16/atms-cheap-safe-water-nairobis-slums\">The ATMs bringing cheap, safe water to Nairobi's slums</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>3 | Consider development impact bonds</h2> <p>Development impact bonds (DIBs) for water and sanitation have huge potential; they open up interesting revenue streams from private investors and allow public entities to transfer the risk of failure to private investors. Another benefit is that they force people in the sector to better understand and measure the benefits of interventions. <em>Carlos Hurtado Aguilar, sustainable development manager, <a href=\"http://fundacionfemsa.org/\">Femsa Foundation</a></em></p> <p>DIBs need clear outcome metrics, and problems may arise if there\u2019s a focus on easily measurable quick wins. For example, using DIBs to build one million toilets sounds great and is easily measurable, but those toilets won\u2019t make much difference if they\u2019re not part of a sustainable locally-led sanitation system. <em>Guy Norman</em></p> <p>And, currently, there is a lack of measurable outputs to use as universal indicators in water and sanitation \u2013 this makes the sector tricky for DIBs. There needs to be a universally accepted, quantifiable and indicative metric \u2013 such as CO2 emissions in climate change \u2013 by which to measure results. The potential for DIBs to be used for water and sanitation has also become more complicated by the move towards water as a service rather than a project; the number of toilets built is no longer a sensible indicator as it does not reflect behaviour change. <em>Duncan Goose, founder, <a href=\"http://giffwater.org/\">Global Investment Fund for Water</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://onedifference.org/\">One Water</a></em><br></p> <h2>4 | Invest in services, not just infrastructure<br></h2> <p>Most approaches to services in the sector are wrong, based on \u201cdrill and leave for the community to manage\u201d. A couple of countries are hitting 80% coverage but despite massive injections of funds, they are not moving towards the SDG of universal and equitable access because the systems are not there to do the monitoring, the fixing, the training of technicians, or to support the markets to develop for the technicians to be there in the first place. Service provision needs people. <em>Catarina Fonseca, head of international department, <a href=\"http://www.ircwash.org/\">IRC</a></em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/aug/17/can-microfinance-help-boost-sanitation-coverage\">Can microfinance help boost sanitation coverage?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>5 | Support water financing facilities</h2> <p>The Dutch government is working to set up <a href=\"http://climatefinancelab.org/idea/water-finance/\">Water Financing Facilities</a> (WFF) \u2013 facilities at the national level that can provide long-term, lower-cost loans to public or private water utilities with little to no access to finance in the market. The loans are linked to specific water infrastructure investments that are designed to enhance climate resilience and mitigation. Incomes generated by water utilities are ringfenced to provide creditworthiness beyond the utilities\u2019 own balance sheet for the loans. <em>Dick van Ginhoven, senior adviser \u2013 water &amp; sanitation, <a href=\"http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/ministeries/bz\">Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a></em></p> <h2>6 | Put a levy on bottled water</h2> <p>After running <a href=\"http://www.onedifference.org/\">One Water</a> for a little over a decade, I realised that we needed to be much more ambitious. The idea behind the <a href=\"http://giffwater.org/\">Global Investment Fund for Water</a> is to generate a one cent per litre micro levy from the global bottled water sector. We have a feasibility study underway with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation and the idea seems to be gaining traction. Hypothetically, the fund could raise $4bn [\u00a33bn] if it was applied across the entire global bottled water sector. We think a realistic target to aim for is around $200m [\u00a3153m] in the first few years, and use that to spur investments and test different kinds of funding mechanisms. <em>Duncan Goose</em></p> <h2><strong>7 | Support microfinance, where suitable</strong></h2> <p>Microfinance works where a service is already being provided that can be accessed, for example piped schemes and on-site sanitation. It seems to have been most effective in urban areas, small towns and densely rural populated areas in Asia. But for the large number of unserved people in sub-Saharan countries, there is no service provider to get connected to or buy toilets from, even if access to financial services is becoming easier. <em>Catarina Fonseca</em></p> <p>Microfinance can work when it is focused on a specific market failure. For example, <a href=\"http://water.org/\">Water.org</a> has a great model which provides microfinance to households so they can pay for the last stage connection from standpipe to house. People want it and can afford to pay the subsidised finance. When it is poorly targeted, though, microfinance can lead to terrible debt problems. <em>Duncan Goose</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/11/india-amma-15-million-dollars-toilets-open-defecation-clean-ganges\">Can $15m worth of toilets finally clean up the Ganges?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>8 | Spend money more wisely</h2> <p>While it is important to strengthen countries\u2019 tax systems and improve their incomes, making expenditures more efficient is a key first step. Several countries implement inadequate or inefficient water and sanitation programmes. No amount of money will be able to solve the problem with this kind of spending.

  "<p>The world is witnessing an unprecedented surge in wildlife trafficking that is stealing the irreplaceable natural wealth of countries, greatly hindering development, paralysing efforts to eradicate poverty, and undermining conservation efforts. This illicit trade in wildlife is well organised, transnational and happening across every region.<br></p> <p>As countries prepare to meet in Johannesburgthis weekend for the <a href=\"https://cites.org/cop17\">17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to Cites (CoP17)</a>, there is increasing recognition that to curb the global surge in wildlife trafficking we must counter the corrosive corruption that enables it.</p> <p>Corruption aids and abets transnational organised crime, and is particularly rife where there is high-volume wildlife trafficking, such as with raw elephant ivory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/30/kenya-poaching-elephant-ivory-rhino-horn-future-communities\">Kenya's new front in poaching battle: 'the future is in the hands of our communities'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first ever World Wildlife Crime report, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/24/un-calls-for-overhaul-of-national-laws-to-tackle-wildlife\">published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) earlier this year</a>, says more than 7,000 species of wild animals and plants are threatened by this illicit trade. It highlights that certain forms of illegal wildlife trade, such as the international illicit trade in rhino horn, would not be possible without corruption. </p> <p>It is well established that corruption harms people, undermining the rule of law, institutions and sustainable development. By enabling wildlife trafficking, it is also helping to drive species of wild animals and plants to extinction. </p> <p>Animals like elephants and rhinos are being slaughtered for their ivory and horn. Corruption often enables the passage of goods from source, through transit, to illicit markets and the unscrupulous dealers who may be many thousands of kilometres away from where the specimens were stolen. </p> <p>It\u2019s not just iconic species being affected. Pangolins are being wiped out for their meat and scales. Rosewood is being plundered from forests for timber. Smuggling of rare iguanas for the pet trade is decimating wild populations, an illicit trade that spans three continents, with the animals being poached in the Bahamas, trafficked into Europe and south-east Asia, and involving nationals from at least five countries. Illicit trade affects every country across the globe.</p> <p>The vast majority of officials are honest and committed. We salute them. Yet we also see customs and police officials bribed, logging and hunting licences forged, and poachers and wildlife traffickers set free due to obstructed prosecutions. We must root out the \u201cbad apples\u201d and deepen efforts to build and maintain properly paid, trained and equipped civil services, in every country, including Cites and enforcement authorities and park rangers. </p> <p>We cannot afford to turn a blind eye to this serious challenge. We have no option but to confront corruption head-on by fully deploying the international agreements created to combat corruption and to regulate wildlife trade in a coherent manner. </p> <p>That is why, in December 2015, corruption and wildlife and forest crime was the focus of a dedicated side event that we co-hosted at the sixth session of the Meeting of the Parties to the UN Convention Against Corruption.</p> <p>Cooperation between the UN Convention against Corruption and Cites is strong and we look forward to achieving universal membership for both conventions in the near future. UNODC and Cites are working together to integrate the tools to prevent corruption, and to facilitate the prosecution and punishment of offenders, with the international rules set for trade in wildlife. </p> <p>We are determined to help countries shatter the international criminal networks that supply this illicit trade and we are united in the belief that by aggressively addressing corruption, we can deal a lethal blow to all those involved in these highly destructive transnational organised crimes.</p> <p>Since Cites parties last <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/03/thailand-outlaw-ivory-trade\">met in Bangkok in 2013</a>, discussions of the scourge of corruption has shifted from the corridors into open plenary and at this month\u2019s meeting parties will have before them, for the first time, a dedicated resolution on prohibiting, preventing and countering corruption.</p> <p></p> <p><strong><br></strong><br></p>",

After three or four months, Musa followed his advice, but when he reached Libya, he ended up being imprisoned. \u2018Libya is worse than hell. I spent one year [there], but I cannot tell you anything about Libya,\u2019 he says. He lived in a small house with 40 to 50 people, working from 6am until the evening, and food was only provided once a day. He was asked for a ransom for his release, but with no family to pay for him, he thought he would be left to die.<br></p> <p>One night, however, he was told not to sleep. Two men with guns came to collect him and brought him to a place where hundreds of people were waiting to board a boat to cross the Mediterranean. With no choice but to board, he did. After a 17-hour journey, they were rescued and brought to Italy.<br></p> <p>Musa now volunteers as a translator at the Italian Red Cross health clinic, as he speaks English, Arabic, and a number of local languages from the Gambia. \u2018I\u2019m just hoping for the best now.

He was born with a congenital malformation, and cannot walk. He made the journey to Europe, which took a total of four months, with his friend Monday, whom he met while travelling from Nigeria to Libya. Whenever the pair had to walk, Monday would carry Yusuf on his back.</p> <p>Yusuf decided to leave Nigeria because of the difficulties that people with disabilities face there. Both left without telling their families, for fear that they would persuade them not to make the journey.<br></p> <p>Yusuf left Nigeria in May, and then spent two weeks in Niger, looking for a driver to take them through the Sahara desert \u2013 most refused to carry him because of his disability, believing he would not survive the journey. When he finally persuaded a driver to take him, they drove for four days through the desert, with no food or water. Finally, they reached Libya, where they waited for more than three months for a boat that would take them to Europe. According to Yusuf, \u2018Libya is not a country someone should stay.\u2019<br></p> <p> Eventually, they boarded a boat and after five hours at sea, they were rescued and brought to Catania port. This was the most difficult part of the journey, he and Monday say. \u2018There is no guarantee. As soon as you board the boat, it\u2019s only you and God.\u2019</p> <p>Both now live in a shared room at Mineo reception centre in Sicily.

  "<p>Beleaguered dairy farmers in Britain are enjoying an increase in the price they receive for milk after suffering years of deflation.</p> <p>Dairy Crest, one of the biggest dairy companies in the UK, said there had been a \u201csudden\u201d increase in the price it pays for milk. The company said it has upped the price it pays farmers for milk by 12% since June while the price of cream has doubled.</p> <p>The comments from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/dairycrestgroup\">Dairy Crest</a>, the owner of Cathedral City cheese and Clover margarine, are supported by official statistics. Figures from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) show the average UK farm-gate price for milk rose 3.3% in July compared with June. However, the price of milk was still 13% down on a year earlier.</p> <p>Dairy farmers have endured three years of falling milk prices due to pressure from supermarkets to lower prices and falling overseas sales of British milk. </p> <p>The squeeze on the agricultural sector came to a head last summer when Aldi, Lidl, Asda and Morrisons were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/14/milk-row-aldi-morrisons-asda-raise-price\">targeted by protesters</a> who claimed they were paying less than the cost of production.

Cathedral City has been relaunched this year with new branding and marketing.</p> <p>Darren Shirley, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: \u201cWhilst we fully expect Dairy Crest to be a beneficiary of inflation in UK and global dairy prices over the medium term, in the short term we keep a cautionary eye on the UK cream price, which has more than doubled since May 2016, and which could be expected to negatively impact butter volumes and margin through the second half.\u201d</p>",

  "<p> </p> <p>Beneath the shadow of the demise of Kids Company, I find myself enormously inspired by the actions of a group of chief executives from youth charities I have had the recent privilege to work with. This group of senior leaders came together to do more than lament the headlines. They wanted to step up and find creative and practical solutions to support the charities and communities they love. </p> <p>Our <a href=\"http://www.cloresocialleadership.org.uk/userfiles/documents/Research%20reports/2016/Clore%20Social%20reports/Clore-Learning-Lessons-paper1-FINAL08082016.pdf\">recently published report</a> (pdf) examines the need for effective leadership development and previous opportunities. Although there is room for improvement, there has been a lot of good work. However, the requirements and skills to become and operate as an effective leader have evolved, and the sector must evolve too. <br></p> <p>Gone are the days of the heroic leader whose mandates were often followed unquestioningly. Today we recognise that leaders are distributed across all levels in our organisations, and among them are the people who will be our future chief executives and directors. <br></p> <p>Coupled with this, in these technology-led times, we can\u2019t forget the immediacy that\u2019s often required of people in leadership roles. Rapid changes demand rapid responses. The sector needs responsible leaders who act, will challenge the media hyperbole and become the instigators of social change to secure the future of the communities we serve. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2016/sep/09/social-media-charity-leaders-brexit-vote\">How social media can help charity leaders in an uncertain world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This need for effective leadership is imperative, regardless of whether you are running the country or an organisation. Recent political events illustrate this point perfectly. Our sector has had its fair share of knocks, resulting in a widespread re-evaluation of the role of charities, and questions about how they are run, alongside the matter of how to restore public trust. </p> <p>Yes, we are going through tough challenges, but they are in no way insurmountable. Charities exist to serve the community, they are part of the fabric of modern society. In recognition of this, our sector needs to find ways to work through the difficult times while making the most of current and potential opportunities. But how? It all comes back to strong leadership that has collaborative action at its heart. </p> <p>Acknowledging that strong leadership is pivotal to success, the chief executives who approached us to help them find and develop their next generation of leaders had looked ahead to the future and identified the need to cultivate a talent pipeline of leaders. Clore6: Youth Sector Leadership Programme<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em>is the<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em>product of our partnership. In October, 22 emerging leaders from 22 youth charities will take part in this inaugural programme. </p> <p>What I find particularly inspiring is that I fully appreciate the gargantuan effort this group of leaders is making. Leadership development requires investment \u2013 time, commitment, hard work and money \u2013 and with tight resources and demanding workloads this sort of investment often slips off the radar. Our sector needs to prioritise and value this development, and we can all learn from the collaborative and generous leadership these senior leaders are modelling. </p> <p>Every aspect of our new programme is built on collaboration, which is precisely what the sector needs as we move away from siloed working. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2016/aug/26/a-year-after-the-kids-companys-demise-what-have-we-learned\">A year after the Kids Company's demise, what have we learned?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Leaders and senior managers from more than 20 youth charities \u2013 including <a href=\"https://vinspired.com/\">vInspired</a>, <a href=\"http://foyer.net/\">the Foyer Federation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/\">Girlguiding UK</a> and <a href=\"http://scouts.org.uk/home/\">the Scout Association</a> \u2013 worked together to develop the six-month programme, which is built on the foundations of Clore Social Leadership capabilities framework. The framework was born out of eight years\u2019 experience in generating social leaders, so the leadership development we offer is multi-faceted. Programme participants have the opportunity to acquire new skills and develop strategic thinking, but they get much more than that. These emerging leaders are given the space and time to reflect on the good and bad aspects of their work and get to grips with understanding how their behaviour affects those they work with so that they can find new ways to grow. <br></p> <p>Ultimately leadership is about relationships. Our programmes provide people with a network of peers who they can rely on throughout their careers. Together they tussle with ideas and come up with new ones that they immediately put into practice to embed their learnings, all within a supportive training environment. <br></p> <p>This ethos of collaborative leadership through action is the cornerstone of this programme.

  "<p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a bacon sandwich,\u201d says Owen Smith, perking up as he walks into a Birmingham cafe for a quick bite to eat. \u201cAnd you can film it,\u201d he adds with a laugh \u2013 in reference to that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/19/photo-politicians-fear-of-them-eating-cameron-miliband-bacon-sandwich-hot-dog\">unflattering snap of Ed Miliband</a>.</p> <p>The former BBC journalist (who actually goes on to opt for beef with the camera switched off) looks a little tired after eight weeks of relentless campaigning for the Labour leadership. </p> <p>This day in Birmingham follows a now regular pattern for Smith: a members\u2019 meeting in the evening (there have been almost 60 in total) after a day of fact-finding in constituencies about the issues a Labour government would hope to address.</p> <p>Smith says he is determined to carry on at the same rate even in the face of polling (\u201cone poll\u201d, he stresses) that suggests he is on track to lose, perhaps badly.</p> <p>\u201cLoads of people haven\u2019t voted, I think it is all to play for,\u201d he says, slightly raising his voice. </p> <p>His team insists that its own data from phone banks offers a very different outlook on the race, and believes that even in these final few days undecided voters could still swing the result. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"038a86e2662ff78ffdd41df8f941c33c8b9ca2f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/038a86e2662ff78ffdd41df8f941c33c8b9ca2f3/0_251_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Smith has a selfie taken with a supporter at a Manchester rally.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smith has a selfie taken with a supporter at a Manchester rally.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Smith, it has been a sometimes \u201clonely\u201d pursuit, away from his wife, Liz, and their three children, and not always surrounded by MPs, many of whom took the opportunity of a break during the summer months.</p> <p>But he doesn\u2019t hold back in arguing that it was worth it, claiming that he sees this attempt to oust Jeremy Corbyn as the most critical job of his working life.</p> <p>Asked about putting himself forward for this leadership contest, Smith said: \u201cI always thought this was the most important thing I\u2019d ever do, having previously worked on the [Northern Ireland] peace process and thought that was the most important thing I\u2019d ever do.\u201d</p> <p>Smith worked for Labour\u2019s Paul Murphy as a special adviser from 2002-05, first while Murphy was Welsh secretary, then following him when he became the Northern Ireland secretary during the peace process. Now a peer, Lord Murphy has described his former aide as having been his \u201cright-hand man\u201d during \u201chugely difficult times\u201d, and as someone who understood the complexities of the negotiations. </p> <p>Smith said his challenge now was stark. \u201cIn jeopardy right now is the future of the Labour party. Without a Labour party that is able to speak for this country we run the risk of there not being a progressive government of any sort.\u201d</p> <p>That, says Smith, is already allowing Theresa May to \u201crun amok with some of the more outlandish rightwing policies they\u2019ve been dreaming of for years \u2026 Not even Thatcher dared to bring back grammar schools.\u201d</p> <p>He says the Conservative party is now presiding over an economy with more than 1m zero-hours contracts, and growing hospital waiting lists. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"92f73b9a04acfece0aa6d87fb6eafc85f7bce5a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92f73b9a04acfece0aa6d87fb6eafc85f7bce5a7/0_361_1614_2016/801.jpg\" alt=\"Corbyn (L) and Smith at a Labour leadership debate in Birmingham.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Corbyn (L) and Smith at a Labour leadership debate in Birmingham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But what is his evidence that Corbyn can\u2019t provide the necessary leadership in opposition? And even if that proves compelling, was nine months really enough time before MPs tried to oust a politician elected by the party\u2019s membership?</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t in favour of there being a challenge,\u201d says Smith quickly. \u201cBut once a challenge had been made then I felt I needed to stand because I felt that I had something to say about the future of the Labour party, and a lot of other people in the PLP [parliamentary Labour party] felt that about me, which is why they asked me to stand.\u201d</p> <p>So Smith would have preferred to see Corbyn allowed to carry on for longer? </p> <p>\u201cYes, is the honest answer,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Not that this is an admission of regret about his bid to topple the sitting leader.</p> <p>\u201cThe truth is, things weren\u2019t going well, things aren\u2019t going well. Nine months may be a short period of time but it\u2019s a period of time in which the Labour party has gone backwards,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are at a lower ebb than we\u2019ve been in the polls at any time since 1982, and we\u2019re six years into a Tory government and right now they are unfettered, they feel able to act with total impunity.\u201d<br></p> <p>The MP for Pontypridd says Labour\u2019s poor position is the result of Corbyn\u2019s weak leadership. But the leader\u2019s team thinks that is unfair, blaming the party\u2019s current polling on the destabilising contest.</p> <p>Shaking his head and looking irritated, Smith talks about the situation before the EU referendum, which acted as a catalyst for the leadership contest. \u201cHe was behind on 85 out of 89 polls. Just pause on that for a minute, because Jeremy supporters and Jeremy keep suggesting he was ahead; he wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>The night before this interview, Smith was at a hustings 100 miles away. He then arrived in Birmingham for an early meeting with care workers in the GMB union, followed by a session at an NHS walk-in centre, and then a photocall with the local MP, Jack Dromey, gripping hold of a lollipop warden\u2019s stop sign to highlight a cut in their numbers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"71a0b4d416fee0c78c764235acd6b9c7d4f2520b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71a0b4d416fee0c78c764235acd6b9c7d4f2520b/208_512_2816_3520/800.jpg\" alt=\"Smith campaigns with Dromey to highlight a cut in the number of lollipop wardens.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smith campaigns with Dromey to highlight a cut in the number of lollipop wardens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His campaign style is in stark contrast to that of Corbyn, with a more professional but perhaps occasionally staid feel.</p> <p>A Corbyn rally in Ramsgate has bands playing in advance and speakers standing on top of the leader\u2019s signature fire engine warming up the crowd by getting them to shout \u201cJC, JC\u201d. <br></p> <p>In central Birmingham, Smith ends his day at a smart conference space, with pots of tea and water lined up on tables, and members seated in long rows of chairs. Dromey is on standby to gee up the activists, who overwhelmingly support Smith but aren\u2019t about to start chanting his name. </p> <p>There is a mantra, however, from the Erdington MP, who repeatedly punctuates his warmup address with the same four words: \u201cWe have to win \u2026 we have to win \u2026 we have to win.\u201d</p> <p>Dromey\u2019s voice becomes charged as he turns to the subject of Corbyn\u2019s popularity. \u201cDon\u2019t anyone tell me about rallies,\u201d the MP booms. \u201cI organised the people\u2019s march for jobs in 1981.\u201d </p> <p>To loud applause, he argues that Michael Foot, the then Labour leader, attracted crowds of 20,000 but still oversaw Labour\u2019s \u201ccrushing defeat\u201d which saw the Conservatives take a 144-seat majority. \u201cWithout power we can\u2019t put our principles into effect.\u201d</p> <p>This is the argument for Smith boiled down into a snapshot: the idea driving the \u201cSaving Labour\u201d campaign \u2013 with the help of some high-profile supporters, such as the author JK Rowling \u2013 that Labour is unelectable under the current leadership.</p> <p>After Dromey comes Laura McWilliams, who joined the party to back Corbyn before being persuaded to switch allegiances to Smith after watching him in \u201cawe\u201d.</p> <p>Passion spills from the voice of this effervescent and likeable woman, whose friends have told her that no one will vote for a Labour party led by Corbyn. </p> <p>And it is the same message with which Smith himself bounds out to a standing ovation, dressed in smart grey trousers and a white shirt, with his sleeves rolled up.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian again, Smith wants to keep to a message about the campaign and his efforts to win, but he knows he also has to look beyond Saturday\u2019s result. </p> <p>If he wins, Smith has promised a \u201cshadow\u201d shadow cabinet made up of members, alongside the one with MPs, and more powers for party conference.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/16/owen-smith-britain-wont-be-more-prosperous-or-secure-with-corbyn-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53a5z\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2723703\"            data-video-name=\"Owen Smith: 'Britain won't be more prosperous or secure with Corbyn' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57dbdf06e4b05caf65ecdd12\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/16/160916OwenSmith_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/16/160916OwenSmith.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11882468&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/16/owen-smith-britain-wont-be-more-prosperous-or-secure-with-corbyn-video\">Owen Smith: \u2018Britain won\u2019t be more prosperous or secure with Corbyn\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>But if, as that poll heavily predicts, he loses, then what?

But I think he thinks, unlike me, that the Labour party is just one vehicle. And he can imagine a world in which the Labour party falls away and something else takes its place.\u201d</p> <p>Smith is clear about the argument he wants to articulate, but he knows he has let himself down by his choice of words on more than one occasion. He looks sheepish and a little ashamed about the impact of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/27/corbyn-campaign-criticises-owen-smith-for-smashing-theresa-may-remark\">suggestion that he would like to \u201csmash\u201d Theresa May back on her \u201cheels\u201d</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe language I\u2019ve used on a couple of occasions has been crass and ugly, and I\u2019ve learned through this that language matters incredibly much.

Inside sat his wife, Sano Bomjan, and nine-year-old daughter, Alisha.</p> <p> Alongside Lalik was his uncle, Juwralal Lama, himself a bus driver for 16 years. Juwralal was uneasy about the way the driver was handling the bus, which was massively overcrowded \u2013 about 80 people were on board the 35-seater vehicle. It was registered with a syndicate called the Araniko Transport Service Committee; the route, to a remote area called Madan Kudari, has been controlled by the ATSC for 22 years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/01/halve-traffic-accident-deaths-injuries-2020\">Halve traffic accident deaths and injuries by 2020: can it be done?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI warned the others on the roof that the driver [was] not driving well,\u201d he Juwralal said. \u201cI told them to be careful and to be ready to jump if something happens.\u201d<br></p> <p>The bus stalled and began to slip back down the track.

At least 334 people were killed between mid-June and mid-August, 58 more than in the same period last year, according to the police.

Dahal acknowledged the problem in his speech, saying: \u201cThis government is committed to breaking the net of syndicates.\u201d</p> <p>Leela Mani Poudyal, the government\u2019s former chief secretary who was recently appointed ambassador to China, said politicians were complicit in the syndicate system. \u201cThe members of the bus committees [syndicates] have strong connections with all political parties. They all join hands to protect the syndicate system,\u201d said Poudyal, who has been campaigning against the syndicates. \u201cThere are many reasons for the accidents, but the fundamental reason is the syndicates.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>Juwralal also blamed the bus companies: \u201c[They] are profit-orientated, so they put as many people in the bus as possible. Because of the syndicate there is only one bus company [on this route], so people are forced to take that bus or they can\u2019t go \u2026 If another company tries to use those routes, they would do anything to stop them, even destroy their bus. If the government wanted to ban syndicates they could, but politicians and other leaders get money out of syndicates.\u201d</p> <p>It is a charge Jeet Bahadur Bharati, the recently retired president of the ATSC, denied. He argued that bus service monopolies are a good thing because they reduce the risk of accidents. \u201cWe have run a bus on this route for 22 years and this is the first major accident,\u201d said Bharati. \u201cThat bus was only five years old. The accident happened because of a fault in the bus. It happens sometimes.\u201d </p> <p>Syndicates can also guarantee that accident victims receive compensation, according to Bharati. \u201cIn Nepal, there are lots of accidents and the government has declared that 500,000 rupees [\u00a33,500] must be paid in compensation when someone dies,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if there are many deaths, a single owner cannot bear that cost.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/oct/25/nepal-earthquake-six-month-anniversary-children-orphans-people-traffickers\">Nepal earthquakes leave bitter legacy as children become quarry for traffickers | Sam Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, Poudyal said that in some cases other syndicates have used their power to bargain down the amount of compensation to be paid. \u201c[In the case of an accident] the bus committees will arrange compensation for the victims, but they influence the administration to weaken the compensation. The bus committees also try to minimise the legal action against their drivers, so the drivers become emboldened.\u201d <br></p> <p>Juwralal agreed: \u201cIf an accident happens, the bus owner doesn\u2019t have to worry about anything. The syndicate will cover everything.

But this was unlike anything she, or anyone else, had ever dealt with.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s been anything else like this in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cThe potential is there for major devastation.\u201d Keith said the disease hadn\u2019t yet spread to crops, like coffee, but it threatens a whole family of metrosideros trees and shrubs found mainly in the Pacific.</p> <p>But the plight of the ohi\u2019a is not unique - it\u2019s part of a quiet crisis playing out in forests across America. Drought, disease, insects and wildfire are chewing up tens of millions of trees at an incredible pace, much of it driven by climate change. </p> <h2>\u2018Mountainsides dying\u2019</h2> <p>Forestry officials and scientists are increasingly alarmed, and say the essential role of trees \u2013 providing clean water, locking up carbon and sheltering whole ecosystems \u2013 is being undermined on a grand scale. </p> <p>California and mountain states have suffered particularly big die-offs in recent years, with 66m trees killed in the Sierra Nevada alone since 2010, according to the Forestry Service. </p> <p>In northern California, an invasive pathogen called Sudden Oak Death is infecting hundreds of different plants, from redwoods and ferns to backyard oaks and bay laurels. The disease is distantly related to the cause of the 19th-century Irish potato famine, and appears to have arrived with two \u201cTyphoid Marys\u201d, rhododendrons and bay laurels, said Dr David Rizzo, of the University of California, Davis.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking millions of trees killed, whole mountain sides dying,\u201d Rizzo said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"86674e095888352cbfe1f5095bedf60037e1400b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86674e095888352cbfe1f5095bedf60037e1400b/0_165_5137_3083/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oozing from the bark of a live oak (Quercus) suffering from Sudden Oak Death.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oozing from the bark of a live oak (Quercus) suffering from Sudden Oak Death.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Inga Spence/Getty Images/Visuals Unlimited</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite its name, the pathogen slowly saps the life from oaks over the course of two to five years, turning them sickly brown. The disease spreads mostly through water, like rain splashing off an infected leaf on to a healthy neighbor. Rizzo said wind-driven rain could carry it miles at a time, and that it already ranged from the Oregon border down through the forests of Big Sur.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re talking millions of trees killed, whole mountain sides dying</p> <footer> <cite>Dr David Rizzo</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The pestilence appears to have arrived in the US through nursery plants in the 1980s, said Matteo Garbelotto, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who researches the genetics of the disease and trees that resist it. Garbelotto said researchers have found three distinct \u201csubspecies\u201d of the pathogen in the US \u2013 only one of which has escaped into the wild.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of concern here that maybe we\u2019re not doing enough to prevent introduction of other two lineages,\u201d he said. Authorities have quarantined 15 counties to keep infected plants from leaving, but Garbelotto fears that authorities lack the resources to do more.</p> <p>Native American tribes are helping Rizzo\u2019s research near Oregon, and Garbelotto\u2019s team developed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://nature.berkeley.edu/garbelottowp/?p=2880\">a mobile app</a> that users can direct at a given tree to determine its risk for disease, and what they can do to protect it.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like talking about mosquito abatement and malaria,\u201d Garbelotto said of efforts to protect some trees by isolating them. \u201cYou try to reduce the number of vectors, eliminate immediate neighbors, a bit like putting a mosquito net around the tree.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Insect eruptions\u2019</h2> <p>Five <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/13/california-el-nino-drought-rain-snowpack\">years of drought</a> in the west have not only starved trees of water but weakened their defenses and created conditions for \u201cinsect eruptions\u201d across the US, said Diana Six, an entomologist at the University of Montana. Bark beetles and mountain pine beetles, usually held in check by wet winters, now have more time to breed and roam. The latter have already expanded their range from British Columbia across the Rockies, to the Yukon border and eastward, into jack pine forests that have never seen the bug. </p> <p>The outbreak is \u201csomething like 10 times bigger than normal, I would argue a lot more than that,\u201d Six said. \u201cBasically a native insect is acting outside of the norm, because of climate change, and become an exotic in forests it\u2019s never been before. We haven\u2019t seen very good outcomes of exotics moving into native forests.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3fd2e4fc8799342ea0270e6011434634e6754f46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fd2e4fc8799342ea0270e6011434634e6754f46/0_275_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thousands of trees killed by mountain pine beetles in western Rocky Mountain national park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thousands of trees killed by mountain pine beetles in western Rocky Mountain national park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Parks Service</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Boosted by climate change, various beetles and the fungi they carry have already wiped out millions of acres of trees, and Six and Rizzo both warned of cascading effects. In the redwoods, Rizzo said, the loss of tanoaks and their relatives would strip away nut-producing species, leaving birds and mammals that rely on them without food. The loss of mountain pines, Six said, threatens grizzly bears and the critical snowpack that supplies water to life below.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In a few decades, Americans might not even recognize forests they see</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s virtually nothing you can do to stop the beetles, either, unless they\u2019ve killed everything and run out of food,\u201d Six said. \u201cOr unless the climate cools, and I don\u2019t think anyones expecting that anytime soon.\u201d</p> <p>In Hawaii, warming temperatures have helped spread four types of beetles that bore into ohi\u2019a bark to feed. The beetles carry disease spore on their wings, in their guts and in the sawdust of burrows, spreading it from tree to tree. <br></p> <p>The beetles are part of scolylinae, a \u201cvery destructive family\u201d that is also decimating trees in California, according to Curtis Ewing, an entomologist at the University of Hawaii.</p> <p>\u201cThey are exploding around the world due to global warming,\u201d he said. They appear unstoppable: spraying each tree with insecticide would be time-consuming and made futile by rain, and pheromone-laced traps also appear ineffective. The university\u2019s arboretum has started collecting ohi\u2019a seeds in the face of a doomsday scenario that was recently unimaginable for such a common tree.</p> <h2>\u2018An ecological emergency\u2019</h2> <p>Scientists in Keith\u2019s lab have made some progress, finding that the fungal disease was part of the common ceratocystis family. It was probably imported to Hawaii by an ornamental plant, but a global DNA database drew a blank; this was an entirely new strain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"07d0de27e35c817465e352a3633cc88ff89322a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07d0de27e35c817465e352a3633cc88ff89322a8/791_0_1981_2477/800.jpg\" alt=\"The effects of the goldspotted oak borer beetle in California.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The effects of the goldspotted oak borer beetle in California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Blake/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI would\u2019ve thought that with the extensive information there, there would\u2019ve been a match,\u201d Keith said. \u201cIt\u2019s a worry.\u201d</p> <p>The spores look golden under the microscope and give off a fruity smell.

Six said genetic research has begun to try to understand why some survive the swarms of millions of insects. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s really going to help our forests move into the future with climate change is adaptation,\u201d she said. \u201cForests need to actually adapt with genetic change.\u201d</p> <p>In a few decades, Americans might not even recognize forests they see, Rizzo said.

  "<p>It\u2019s a sign of how overheated everything has become that the idea of having a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/18/momentum-to-start-childrens-wing-to-boost-involvement-in-labour-movement\" title=\"\">creche at a political meeting</a> is greeted as weird and sinister.

I am no fan of Momentum or Jeremy Corbyn at all but I applaud any political organisation that seeks to help women engage. This is also a relief compared with most Momentum utterances which seem to be about deselection, betrayal or denials of misogyny. For too long, many of the guys involved in the global class struggle have entirely ignored the more local struggle of who cares for the kids. Any social movement or attempt at participatory democracy needs to bring in women and children and is more effective for it.</p> <p>Indeed, in the last couple of years, we have seen that many of the protests around housing have been organised by young single mothers who pool childcare. This energy is counter to the professionalisation we\u2019ve seen in political parties, where the conversation around childcare has gone backwards, and it\u2019s regarded as a private and individual issue.</p> <p>Feminists have long recognised that this attitude curtails women\u2019s involvement in politics and tried to do something about it. When my children were small I was able to go to all sorts of events and conferences because childcare was provided. It didn\u2019t always work out. Children don\u2019t all like creches. Or behave in them. During a discussion on domestic labour, I had to be summoned to the creche as my daughter was in a fracas with another toddler who would not give up the toy iron and ironing board.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/schneiderhome/status/777688177758920708\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Amount of Nazi shit I&#39;m getting for Momentum Kids is breathtaking.<br><br>Context: compare Schneiders in Poland in 1938 to 1945.

Sometimes, I heard, literally. Men would be doing the childcare, so women could participate. This is simply about opening up political space, making it more woman-friendly. The Women\u2019s Equality party, which I am involved in, provides financial support to candidates for childcare because we recognise childcare is key to women\u2019s participation and empowerment.</p> <p>The idea of childcare as a cooperative enterprise is surely good, whoever it comes from? Those muttering about indoctrination should go and supervise some soft play \u2013 they clearly have not been near a child or a creche for years. The question of who looks after the kids does not exist \u201coutside\u2019\u2019 politics but is fundamental to it. Why shoot down this recognition?</p>",

They found that carbon dioxide at higher levels than today (400 ppm) did not significantly change plant growth, while higher temperatures had a negative effect.</p> <h2><strong>The oversimplified myth of \u2018CO2 is plant food\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Those who benefit from the status quo of burning copious amounts of fossil fuels love to argue that more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will benefit plant life.

However, <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/co2-plant-food.htm\">reality is far more complicated</a> than the oversimplification of \u2018CO2 is plant food.\u2019 Unlike in the controlled environment of a greenhouse, the increasing greenhouse effect on Earth causes temperatures to rise and the climate to change in various ways that can be bad for plant life. We can\u2019t control all the other variables the way we can in a greenhouse.<br></p> <p>So far, as contrarians like Rupert Murdoch love to point out, the plant food effect has won out. Earth has become greener in recent decades (although <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/news.php?f=ridley-murdoch-lomborg-greenwash-global-warming\">that trend may now be reversing</a>). The situation is not unlike a human diet \u2013 at relatively low calorie levels, more food is beneficial. But as calorie intake continues to rise, at a certain point it\u2019s no longer benefiting the human body. More food is good, but only up to a certain point, as <a href=\"http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/obesity/en/\">the global obesity epidemic</a> makes clear.</p> <h2><strong>The experiment</strong></h2> <p>The Stanford scientists set up 132 plots of flowers and grass in California and introduced varying levels of carbon dioxide, temperature, water, and nitrogen. The scientists conducted the experiments over 16 growing seasons between 1998 and 2014. They found that only higher nitrogen levels resulted in higher plant productivity, while higher temperatures caused it to decline. <br></p> <p>While this experiment was specific to California grasslands, other studies have similarly undermined the \u2018more CO2 is great\u2019 myth. For example, <a href=\"http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10850600268344775265&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,5\">a 2012 paper</a> found that higher temperatures are detrimental to French corn yields. While French corn production has increased steadily in recent decades due to a combination of technological improvements and CO2 fertilization (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ed_hawkins/status/290586887901564928\">the former far more than the latter</a>), yields have leveled off in recent years, <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/news.php?f=ridley-murdoch-lomborg-greenwash-global-warming\">and were particularly low when struck by heat waves</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>A significant reduction in maize yield is found for each day with a maximum temperature above 32\u00b0C, in broad agreement with previous estimates. The recent increase in such hot days has likely contributed to the observed yield stagnation.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Another <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate3115.html\">study published in Nature Climate Change</a> last week concluded that higher temperatures will cause wheat production to decline. Just a 1\u00b0C rise in global temperature will <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/09/12/climate-change-is-really-bad-for-wheat-which-is-really-bad-for-us/?utm_term=.19807c0d409b\">decrease wheat yields by about 5%</a> (approximately 35 million tons). Climate change is bad news for several of our staple crops.<br></p> <h2><strong>Carbon pollution and rapid climate change are dangerous</strong></h2> <p>The evidence thus suggests we\u2019re at or near the point where rising atmospheric CO2 levels will no longer benefit overall plant growth, while the rising heat that comes along with that carbon are generally detrimental to plant productivity.<br></p> <p>There are also many ways in which dumping more carbon pollution into the atmosphere has negative effects, on plants and also animal species. Climate change is causing increased heat waves, flooding, and other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2016/sep/15/was-that-climate-change-scientists-are-getting-faster-at-linking-extreme-weather-to-warming\">extreme weather events</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/14/military-experts-climate-change-significant-security-risk\">national security threats</a>; <a href=\"https://www.skepticalscience.com/ocean-acidification-global-warming-intermediate.htm\">ocean acidification</a>; <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/sea-level-rise-intermediate.htm\">sea level rise</a>; <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/sixth-mass-extinction.html\">wide-scale species extinctions</a>; and <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-positives-negatives-advanced.htm\">so on</a>.</p> <p>There will certainly be some positive climate change outcomes as well, but all evidence suggests <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-positives-negatives-advanced.htm\">the negatives will far outweigh the positives</a>.

Her name is Esther, and we met in June in the <a href=\"https://kanere.org/about-kakuma-refugee-camp/\">Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya</a>, in the country\u2019s far northwest. Esther is an 18-year-old South Sudanese girl who showed me around the camp, which has been her home since she was 11 when she, her two sisters and her mother fled their home in Juba. It took a long time to get Esther\u2019s paperwork sorted so that she could go to school and when she did get in most people wondered why she was bothering. Her mother couldn\u2019t read or write, they said, and she would never amount to anything, either \u2013 better to get married and have children as soon as possible.</p> <p>Esther decided to prove her doubters wrong. As it happened, a new privately-financed school for girls had just opened in Kakuma \u2013 well built, with better facilities and solar-powered lighting \u2013 and once the idea of walking through its gates had got under her skin, she studied day and night and won a coveted place. Somewhere along the line she got on the internet and read about becoming a surgeon \u2013 a neurosurgeon, to be exact \u2013 and in the way that children do, Esther decided, \u201cOK, I want to be South Sudan\u2019s first female neurosurgeon.\u201d</p> <p>It is an inspiring story \u2013 but I left out a few details.</p> <p>Just by completing secondary school, Esther has overcome huge odds. Across the world, one in two refugee children is in primary school and fewer than one in four in secondary. By contrast, more than 90% of primary-age non-refugee children are in school, as are 84% of secondary-age children. As for higher education, a paltry <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/uk/education.html\">one in a hundred</a> refugee children makes it that far. That compares badly with the worldwide figure of 34.5%, but it compares even worse with North America and western Europe, where nearly three-quarters of young people are in some form of higher education.</p> <p>The most protracted refugee situations now last an average of more than 20 years. That means a child born to refugees can reach adulthood without ever having known the country of their parents. It means that many children who were forced to flee to safety will become adolescents and then grown-ups with only the haziest memories of home.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2015/nov/29/german-schools-taking-refugee-children-syria\">No teacher lets them suffer: inside the German schools taking in refugees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet one day they will return.

We want them to be academically curious, to develop their capacity for critical thinking, explore new ideas, to acquire the means to realise their ambitions and aspirations. Indeed, in wealthy countries a government that does not provide an education for its people is considered incompetent. So why do we fail to do this with refugees?

  "<p>Milk producers are lapping it up at the moment as prices soar, particularly for cream.</p> <p><strong>Dairy Crest</strong>, the spreads company behind Clover, Country Life and Cathedral City, said it had recently had to raise the prices it paid to farmers by 12%. Chief executive Mark Allen said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Recently we have seen inflation across all dairy markets. To date we have announced increases amounting to 12% in the milk price we pay to farmers. Cream prices have been particularly affected, doubling over a very short period. This sudden cost inflation is likely to have an impact on butter volumes and margins in the second half.</p> </blockquote> <p>But as \u201ca strongly branded and added value business\u201d, he said Dairy Crest was well placed to deal with inflationary pressures and so its outlook for the full year remained unchanged.</p> <p>The comments came as Dairy Crest - now a pure food producer having sold its loss-making dairies division - said first half sales volumes of its four key brands would be ahead of last year. </p> <p>But pitching Cathedral City as a premium product and relaunching its branding and packaging , it discounted prices by less than competitors, leading to a small volume decline in the first half. However it said margins had improved and customers had responded positively to the new packaging and marketing campaign.</p> <p>On the price rises, Peel Hunt analyst Charles Hall said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dairy prices are recovering sharply due to the improving global market, weaker sterling and lower UK milk production. This is resulting in a sharp price appreciation in raw milk and associated products. For instance spot milk has risen in recent weeks from 15p to 37p per litre with cream prices doubling from 80p to 160p. </p> <p>The industry is responding to this by increasing prices to farmers. For instance Dairy Crest increased its raw milk price by 1ppl to 22.7p in September and announced on Friday a further 1.5p increase spread over October and November. Other producers are seeing a similar trajectory, with some having to increase at a faster rate in order to hold onto their milk producers. We expect the price increases to be recovered in the market, with own label cheese suppliers, in particular, needing to recover higher prices in the short term. From Dairy Crest\u2019s point of view this should be helpful for margins given the timing of milk purchases and maturation period for cheese. </p> <p>In the spreads division, the main impact is on butter where Dairy Crest sells around 14,000t. Again the price increases will need to be passed on to customers by the industry, though Dairy Crest is relatively protected by its supply agreement. The company has highlighted that the price increases are likely to impact butter volumes and margins in the short term, which is not a surprise. This should be offset by higher cheese margins.</p> </blockquote> <p>Dairy Crest shares have dropped 2% to 654.5p following the news.</p> <p>Overall the market is moving higher as oil prices recover and investors await key interest rate meetings this week from both the Bank of Japan and the US Federal Reserve.

They said she would also be making new British commitments.</p> <p>Samantha Power, the US envoy to the UN, made it clear that any other world leader wanting to speak at the event would have to come up with genuinely new and meaningful offers of help. </p> <p>\u201cWe are leveraging the additional steps that we are taking to get other countries also to do their part, given that up to this point a small number of countries have been carrying a disproportionate share of the refugee opportunity and burden,\u201d Power said. </p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to have dozens of countries present at the meeting. I can\u2019t give you an exact number now because we\u2019re still in a whirl of countries coming to us and saying, this is what we\u2019re going to commit, and us saying, actually, that\u2019s not new or significant, and then some of those countries going back to the drawing board. But it will be dozens of countries and you\u2019ll be able to see a very significant return on this format of meeting.\u201d</p> <p>Helen Clark, New Zealand\u2019s former prime minister who is now head of the UN Development Programme, said that even if the summit produced a significant increase in support for refugees, it would not help the majority of the record 65 million people forced from their homes by conflict or persecution around the world \u2013 internally displaced persons (IDPs) who flee their homes but do not cross into another country.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cOf the 65 million, my understanding is that the clear majority are IDPs and they\u2019re not dealt with, so that means there is more work to do to raise awareness of those needs,\u201d Clark said. </p> <p>She said it was possible IDPs were getting less attention because by not leaving their country of origin they did not pose such a direct threat to the political stability and budgets of the developed world. </p> <p>\u201cThat might be a factor. All I can say is that the IDPs also want their kids in school,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThe IDPs are unfinished business, obviously.\u201d</p> <p>On the eve of the UN summit, the head of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), Pierre Krahenbuhl, urged leaders not to forget the plight of long-term refugees, nearly half of whom are Palestinians.</p> <p>\u201cThe summiteers are clear that no one must be left behind and I urged that this must include the 5.2 million Palestine refugees registered with UNRWA,\u201d Krahenbuhl said. \u201cThey represent 44% of the world\u2019s long-term refugees, the largest in scale and most protracted in duration of any refugee situation today.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the failure of world leaders to agree firm commitments for the UN summit on Monday, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said the draft of its final non-binding declaration would still make a difference by reaffirming the global community\u2019s collective responsibility for refugees, encouraging longer-term responses to prolonged refugee crises, which are currently often dealt with in a knee-jerk way.<br></p> <p>Volker Turk, the UNHCR\u2019s assistant high commissioner for protection, said: \u201cI see it as the beginning of an exciting process \u2026 it identifies a response framework that consolidates the nuts and bolts of what is needed if a country is faced with a large-scale [refugee] situation.\u201d<br></p> <p>The declaration was also praised by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), which was pleased that it engaged with migrants as well as refugees. \u201cWe\u2019re not disappointed in any way,\u201d said Leonard Doyle, IOM\u2019s chief spokesman.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But others are. Record numbers of people are displaced worldwide, and given the gravity of the crisis, rights campaigners along with countries hosting large numbers of refugees are frustrated that the declaration has achieved no concrete measures, and concrete proposals will not be approved until 2018.<br></p> <p>Lebanon has a higher number of refugees per capita and per square mile than any other country in the world \u2013 and its ambassador to the UN, Nawaf Salam, said the proposals did not go nearly far enough.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cFrom our perspective, all this falls way behind what is needed to address, one, the plight of refugees and, two, the needs of host communities,\u201d Salam said. \u201cThere are no commitments in terms of responsibility-sharing, no agreement on relocation of refugees, no real commitment to [the creation of] development funds that could address the needs of refugee and host communities.\u201d</p> <p>Salam said he would have liked to have seen international partners \u201cmake good on pledges already made. We need to shift from only humanitarian aid to development aid <em>and</em> humanitarian aid. We need to give more help to host communities. And we need to prepare plans for a safe and dignified return [of Syrians to Syria] \u2026 That\u2019s not implementable today, but preparations need to start today, to be implemented when conditions permit.\u201d</p> <p>The watered-down nature of Monday\u2019s summit means that the stakes on Tuesday are far greater, Miliband argued. \u201cIt would be better not to have a summit at all than to have a summit that doesn\u2019t lead to substantive change,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Tuesday\u2019s summit achieves nothing, if the convening power of the American president on Tuesday doesn\u2019t deliver, it will further drain confidence that the international system gets it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>For most of the first half, it looked like the New England Patriots had discovered their Next Tom Brady. OK, that may be a stretch, but it at least looked like they had found a player they could sell as a potential Next Tom Brady to one of the many quarterback-starved teams once the Actual Tom Brady returned from his four week league-mandated vacation. In his second game as a starter, Jimmy Garoppolo went 18-for-27, passing for 234 yards as the Patriots built up a 21-0 lead over the Miami Dolphins. Garoppolo, coming off New England\u2019s huge Week 1 road win over the Arizona Cardinals, was once again putting in an impressive showing without the help of Rob Gronkowski, who missed his straight game with a hamstring injury.</p> <p>Then, shortly before half-time, Garoppolo <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000704364/article/jimmy-garoppolo-injures-shoulder-in-patriots-win\">went down</a> with a shoulder injury after a hard hit from Kiko Alonso. He would not return, meaning that it was up to rookie third-string quarterback Jacoby Brissett to finish the game. Capitalizing on Garoppolo\u2019s absence, Miami quarterback Ryan Tannenhill lead his team to a near-comeback in the second half, one only snuffed in the game\u2019s final seconds when his attempt at a game-tying touchdown was intercepted by Duron Harmon. The Patriots held on to a 31-24 victory in their home opener, but they made it far closer than it probably should have been. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/19/sam-bradford-minnesota-vikings-green-bay-packers-adrian-peterson\">Sam Bradford stars as Vikings beat Packers but Adrian Peterson injures knee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Patriots\u2019 second half struggles shouldn\u2019t be entirely blamed on Brissett. The 23 year-old <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/blog/new-england-patriots/post/_/id/4795835/getting-to-know-patriots-rookie-quarterback-jacoby-brissett\">third-round pick</a> helped set up a LaGarrette Blount touchdown run that gave New England a seemingly insurmountable 31-3 lead early in the third quarter. Brissett also helped the team build an five-minute drive at the end of the game that would have put the Patriots up two scores with a minute remaining had not normally reliable kicker Stephen Gostkowski missed a 39-yard field goal. While Brissett\u2019s 6 for 9, 92 yard performance in little over two quarters of work didn\u2019t add up to a head-turning outing, especially after what we\u2019ve seen from Garoppolo in these first two games, but it\u2019s what one could reasonably expect under the circumstances. If anything, it offered further evidence that head coach Bill Belichick\u2019s offensive system is effective no matter who is at the QB position.</p> <p>Instead, the problem for the Patriots in the second half lay primarily with the defense, which allowed three touchdowns to a Dolphins offense that had been laughably sloppy for the game\u2019s first two quarters. It\u2019s hard to tell how much of it was New England\u2019s defense letting up when it looked like the game would be a blowout and how much of it was an inability to pick up on Miami\u2019s halftime adjustments.<br></p> <p>The diagnosis of <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000704364/article/garoppolo-suffers-sprained-ac-joint-in-patriots-win\">an AC joint strain</a> makes it highly unlikely that Garoppolo will play the Thursday night game against the Houston Texans. He could be out for <a href=\"http://boston.cbslocal.com/2016/09/18/jimmy-garoppolo-leaves-dolphins-game-with-injury/?cid=twitter_985thesportshub\">as long as six weeks</a>.

The good thing about it being this early in the season is that we don\u2019t have to struggle with picking anyone other than Newton for this distinction.

This could potentially be a devastating blow to the Vikings who have already lost Teddy Bridgewater for the season. Minnesota felt strongly enough about their team this season that, after Bridgewater\u2019s injury, they scrambled and made a questionable trade for former No1 pick Sam Bradford (who, it has to be said, had a good game on Sunday night). If they lose Peterson for a long stretch of time as well, we\u2019re looking at a potentially lost season for Minnesota.</p> <p>\u2022 The Rams somehow\u2026 won their Los Angeles return?

The Rams now have one more win this season than <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/one-impossibly-bad-statistic-perfectly-defines-the-2016-los-angeles-rams/\">they have touchdowns</a>, winning 9-3 after making three field goals to Seattle\u2019s one. The game marks the end of Russell Wilson\u2019s streak of 17 straight games where he\u2019s thrown a passing touchdown.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/777647381747761156\"> Blaine Gabbert</a> now has the longest streak, with 12.

Forced to flee her native Iraq when she was four months pregnant, she sought relative safety across the border in Syria. How desperate must a person be to regard the crossing into Syria as the lesser of two evils? In Nadia\u2019s case, she was driven by the sight of a car full of fellow Yazidi girls being burned alive by extremists, a fate she feared awaited her own family.</p> <p>After a desperate spell in Syria, Nadia made the journey to Greece in an unseaworthy, leaking boat when nine months pregnant. Her unborn child died on the journey, the inevitable result of malnutrition and stress.</p> <p>On arrival in Greece, Nadia was given a hurried caesarean. She recalls: \u201cThey didn\u2019t even let me see my baby. They just took him away and buried him in a mass grave \u2026 I cried and cried for days. I cannot even visit my son\u2019s grave.\u201d When Care and Women for Refugee Women call out for the dignified and fair treatment of refugees, it is for women such as Nadia.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When a woman\u2019s situation is so desperate that she is forced to engage in 'survival sex', that\u2019s a feminist issue</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As another woman, Dana, summarised: \u201cIn Syria, you can die one day from a bomb, but on this journey you die every single day.\u201d Dana \u2013 a mother of two \u2013 currently lives in a refugee camp in Serbia. She arrived carrying few possessions, but a weight of misery that no woman, no human, should have to bear.</p> <p>And stories like these are 10 a penny across Europe right now. When a woman\u2019s situation is so desperate that she is forced to engage in \u201csurvival sex\u201d to secure a male protector for her journey, that\u2019s a feminist issue. When a woman is forced to trudge for hundreds of miles on foot, heavily pregnant and with malnourished children in her arms, that is a feminist issue.</p> <p>When young girls are being married off at a heartbreakingly young age because it\u2019s seen as their greatest chance of survival; when women are miscarrying on the side of the road in an unfamiliar country; when mothers are forced to send their children unaccompanied on dinghies in the dark, unconvinced they\u2019ll ever see them alive again; when women are reaching the UK and being abused and degraded, or detained while pregnant for the crime of seeking refuge: these are feminist issues. Urgent, desperate, outrageous feminist issues. And, as feminists, we must act.</p> <p>Ahead of the global refugee summits, we are making some very plain demands of world leaders. First, ensure more support in developing countries for refugee women; second, secure safe, legal routes for vulnerable refugee women so that they don\u2019t have to take dangerous journeys at the hands of smugglers; third, take action to protect women and girls from sexual violence and trafficking. And fourth, specifically to the UK government, give refugee women in the UK dignity and a fair hearing.</p> <p>The refugee crisis is controversial, and in these turbulent times calls to offer added protection for refugees are increasingly met with opposition. But I look at the media\u2019s portrayal of refugees \u2013 the objectification, the dehumanisation \u2013 and I see history repeating itself: the same history that sent my own ancestors fleeing for their lives. For I am the daughter and granddaughter of refugees. On the famous suffragette Pankhurst side, my grandmother Sylvia\u2019s partner was an Italian anarchist who came to call the UK home; and my mother originally came from Romania in 1938, fleeing the rise of fascism.</p> <p>Wherever in history we see vast swaths of people forced out \u2013 or worse, wiped out \u2013 you can guarantee it\u2019s accompanied, somewhere, by propaganda insinuating that these lives are disposable. As a country we were on the right side of history when fascism and nazism took hold. We must ensure the same applies today.</p> <p>The shame of this crisis will not be whitewashed in the history books; it will scar our collective conscience for generations. We have an individual and collective responsibility to act now.</p>",

(Essex Lydia is good value, too.)</p> <p>The star of this opening (careful, watch out for hermit crabs) episode is a man famous for shouting into a big phone. Dom Joly reluctantly agrees to be leader for a day. He names the island (Pissflapia), commissions a rousing national anthem from Aston Merrygold (ex-JLS), appoints a health minister (Embarrassing Bodies\u2019 Dr Dawn Harper) and a fashion minister (Ollie).</p> <p>By the following morning, the reluctance and \u201cfor a day\u201d parts of Joly\u2019s leadership seem to have been entirelyforgotten, along with democracy. Megalomania has taken its hold. \u201cI was expelled from school, and look at this. Fuck you, Haileybury, running my own country now,\u201d he shouts, menacingly. He now demands deference at all times, plus sexual favours from his subjects. He\u2019s calling himself president, but it looks like dictatorship to me. Papa Dom. And it\u2019s very amusing \u2013 put that man on all shows like this.</p> <p>You can\u2019t live entirely off power though. He sends out a party \u2013 including Olly and Lydia \u2013 to look for water. They fail miserably, get lost and thirsty, and end up pressing the emergency SOS button; Bear\u2019s safety team comes to rescue them less than 24 hours into the adventure. It\u2019s all too much for Olly, who really wanted to prove \u201cthat I\u2019m not a complete idiot and I\u2019m actually quite good at stuff and not this stupid kind of pink-wearing guy that I think a lot of people think I am\u201d. Not much change then, in the thinking. Never mind, though, there\u2019s always tomorrow.</p> <p>So the following day, Olly and Lydia are sent out to find water again. \u201cIf someone gave me a bag of, like, brand new makeup right now, I\u2019d say: \u2018No thank you, I\u2019d rather have a bottle of water,\u2019\u201d says Lydia.

Unless we rebuild that coalition, Labour will never again win power and deliver the change Britain needs.</p> <p>I believe there\u2019s a new approach to immigration that Labour, and Britain, must take in the post-referendum era. It\u2019s no cheap imitation of Ukip, nor an \u201celectoral ploy\u201d, but an approach born of progressive values and our desire to see them realised. The starting point must be to view our core values through the prism of immigration, and to conclude that immigration itself is not a leftwing value. I am resolutely pro-immigration, yet I don\u2019t see immigration as a value; I see it as a social and economic dynamic. The difference is vital.</p> <p>Being pro-immigration means making it an economic, social and political success in the long term: as much immigration as is possible and sustainable, limited only by our ability to create the environment for all of Britain to thrive and feel valued.</p> <p>The referendum had a clear message: the limitless nature of freedom of movement, despite its proven economic benefits, is not socially and politically sustainable. That\u2019s why opposing freedom of movement isn\u2019t the same as opposing immigration.</p> <p>Two key values of the society we must build are openness and non-racism. These values aren\u2019t defined by the number of immigrants, but by the quality of experience every person has of this country. This allows us to set out the role of immigration within that: as much immigration as possible, without driving social tensions to such an extent that racism breaks out.</p> <p>It says we can be pro-immigration and champion immigrants as part of a non-racist and open society, while recognising we have to manage immigration so those values aren\u2019t threatened.</p> <p>This is facing up to a human truth: nobody is born racist, but immigration that reaches levels beyond a society\u2019s capacity to cope can lead, in extremes, to racism. That racism fuels a vicious, ugly backlash, in which there is tremendous anger in one community and tremendous fear in another. Nobody wins and everyone suffers. It sets back our ideal of an open and non-racist society, makes further immigration politically unsustainable and, as we\u2019ve seen in relation to Syria, means we cannot show our humanity to the refugees who need us.</p> <p>This approach doesn\u2019t mean we become less pro-immigration, just that we recognise we must balance our desire to encourage immigration with our ability to manage immigration and its impact.</p> <p>So, what would managed immigration look like in practice?</p> <p>The answer will be driven by how we judge who should be able to receive work permits. This must be a carefully calibrated approach so will likely have to be a system predicated on the applicant\u2019s skills and qualifications; the need for those skills in the economy; and their economic context.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A managed balance is what makes immigration sustainable and takes us ever closer to a non-racist, open society</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While the priority is designing a transition to a system based on work permits, this requires a comprehensive approach that stretches across almost every responsibility of government, from entry requirements and integration support, to economic and public service investment to combat marginalisation. This managed balance is what makes immigration sustainable and takes us ever closer to a non-racist, open society.</p> <p>These are complex questions, both in the process we create but also what the answers say about the nature of our country, with implications for our economic, trading and international future. We can\u2019t be squeamish about having a comprehensive discussion about how we do this \u2013 getting it right is too important.</p> <p>Some will say managing immigration is a \u201ctough\u201d approach. If limiting immigrant numbers were the defining objective, I would agree. But it is not.</p> <p>The managed immigration approach I am proposing is rooted in leftwing values and anchored in the reality of post-referendum Britain. It will allow us to build an open and non-racist society, and help rebuild Labour\u2019s electoral coalition, staying true to the values and pragmatism that have been the basis of our historic successes and support. It is a means to an end, not an end in itself.</p> <p>It is also an approach that will be vital to Britain in a post-Brexit age: in the era of increasing globalisation, the people and countries who are successful in the future will be those open to other cultures, international opportunities and to new technologies. And the successful governments will be the ones that bring their people together, to make immigration work for all.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The full version of this article, which sets out the required shift in the immigration debate more comprehensively, can be seen in the new Fabian publication Facing the Unknown: Building a Progressive Response to Brexit </em></p>",

  "<p>Although they both served successive Labour governments, it would be hard to think of two politicians more different than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/28/ed-balls-labour-minister-memoir\">Ed Balls</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/05/alan-johnson-lay-off-last-labour-government-if-you-want-to-get-elected\">Alan Johnson</a>. Balls, a middle-class product of Oxford and Harvard, was a bright, driven, occasionally intimidating presence throughout 13 years of Labour government. For much of that time he was a backroom boy at the frenetic court of chancellor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/10/inspiring-view-britishness-defeat-brexit-isolationists\">Gordon Brown</a>, ending up as education secretary in Brown\u2019s cabinet.</p> <p>Johnson, by contrast, was the orphaned child of an impoverished single mother, who started his working life as a warehouse assistant in the Hammersmith branch of Tesco, rising by some almost miraculous process, via the postal sorting office at Slough, to hold five cabinet posts.</p> <p>For all that Balls had a reputation as a political bruiser, <strong>Speaking Out</strong> is a thoughtful memoir, sometimes self-deprecating, occasionally boastful, but always rational and balanced. There are hints at the difficulty of working for so volatile and demanding a political master as Gordon Brown, but no great revelations. Of the low-intensity warfare between Downing Street and the Treasury that dogged Tony Blair\u2019s premiership, in which Balls undoubtedly played a part, he says little except that there was fault on both sides.</p> <p>Clearly there was no love lost between Balls and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/09/ed-miliband-endorses-owen-smith-for-labour-leader\">Ed Miliband</a>, whom he worked alongside both in the Treasury and later as shadow chancellor under Miliband\u2019s leadership.

As a casual reading of Brown\u2019s annual Mansion House speeches demonstrates, he became more and more sycophantic with each year that passed. Towards the end of his term, the chancellor was positively euphoric, singing the praises of the City for inventing \u201cthe most modern instruments of finance\u201d and going so far as to assert that, thanks to the genius of the City, we were living in \u201ca new golden age\u201d. All this addressed to some of the very people who helped bring the global financial system to the edge of ruin. Presumably Balls had something to do with it. Indeed, he gave one or two similar speeches of his own. It would be of interest to know how such intelligent people as Balls and Brown could possibly have bought into such nonsense, and yet the author offers little by way of explanation.</p> <p>Balls is at his best when he is in a reflective mood. There are chapters entitled Ambition, Image, Risks, Spin, Emotion, Mistakes, Hinterland. In a chapter headed Assumptions, he points out that just about all the assumptions he shared with the other bright young things in his class at Harvard 25 years ago turned out to be wide of the mark or just plain wrong. No one foresaw the rise of China or that the impact of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/globalisation\">globalisation</a> would become about the movement of people \u2013 rich and poor \u2013 with the potential to destabilise existing economic systems.</p> <p>Come the general election in May 2015, Balls\u2019s world fell apart. Had Labour won, he would have become chancellor. In the event, not only did the chancellorship elude him, but he lost his seat in parliament. Suddenly, after 20 years at the centre of events, he found himself out of work, aged only 48. Even so, he is not short of things to do, lecturing at Harvard, chairing the board of his beloved Norwich City, competing in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/04/strictly-come-dancing-launch-show-draws-more-than-10m-viewers\"><em>Strictly Come Dancing</em></a>. Plus, of course, he has more time to devote to his family. This book is part memoir, part therapy.

  "<p>The social housing sector is a bit like the Labour party \u2013 deeply divided, although not quite so nasty. </p> <p>On the one side are the pragmatists, those prepared to go with the flow and do the government\u2019s bidding, with its trajectory towards home ownership. Some in this group see a bright future in a more commercial environment, where they build homes for sale and private rent. A tiny few look forward to a future where they can break free from the shackles of state control and become fully private companies.</p> <p>On the other side are the traditionalists, those who see social rented housing as worth fighting for and who argue the case for public investment to provide low-cost homes for rent, to boost the economy and to cut the <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/7762\">\u00a326bn</a> a year spent on housing benefits.</p> <p>The pragmatists have accused the traditionalists of being dinosaurs, harking back to a golden age of social housing that never was. The traditionalists accuse the pragmatists of selling out the sector for the sake of their own careers. And so it goes on. In truth, as it celebrates <a href=\"http://www.housingday.co.uk/\">National Housing Day</a> on 19 September, the social housing sector is in a dangerous place.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2015/oct/07/david-cameron-kill-off-social-housing-affordable-homes\">David Cameron is on track to kill off social housing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The exact legal status of housing associations has been unclear for decades. The National Housing Federation has long argued that they are private, independent, charitable organisations, but last October the Office for National Statistics, swayed by the ability of ministers to appoint board members and managers to associations and by the fact that consent is required before they can dispose of properties, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2015/oct/30/end-housing-associations-ons-public-sector\">reclassified housing association as public bodies</a>. </p> <p>That decision means there is an ever-present danger that their assets could be sold off to the private sector. The pragmatists are therefore right to point out that it would be foolish to challenge or annoy the government in any way, and defend last year\u2019s decision to agree with the government a voluntary deal to extend right-to-buy to social housing tenants. For traditionalists, though, that deal is simply an example of a supine approach.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It doesn\u2019t help that the latest analysis of chief executive salaries shows inflation-busting pay increases across the board \u2013 something that is bound to annoy the Tory right, given that the bulk of housing association income comes from the taxpayer. An own goal, say the traditionalists.</p> <p>The only hope of reuniting the sector is if the new government ditches the Cameron/Osborne obsession with home ownership and realises the sense of investing in genuinely affordable homes. </p> <p>The housing minister, Gavin Barwell, has flagged up a possible change of approach. This week he said that we need \u201cto build more homes of every single type and not focus on one single tenure\u201d. Whether that signals a genuine change of approach remains to be seen. </p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/housing/\">Sign up</a> for your free Guardian Housing network newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you on the last Friday of the month.

Welcome to the Global Development podcast. This episode looks at the challenge of getting more girls into education.<br></p> <p><strong> JGR</strong> I think education is vital for any country if it\u2019s going to be successful; and there are millions and millions of children out of school, as we speak, who don\u2019t have the chance to learn. But within that we know that of those children it\u2019s most likely to be girls who are missing out.</p> <p><strong> JG</strong> At the current rate of change for girls in sub-Saharan Africa we won\u2019t see the first generation of girls who universally go to primary and lower secondary school until into the next century, 2111.</p> <p><strong> PR</strong> So girls are by far the worst affected in conflict situations. Only around 4% of adolescent girls complete lower secondary school. </p> <p><strong> LL </strong>In this podcast I visit rural communities in southern Zimbabwe to investigate some of the obstacles that are keeping girls out of education. And I speak to those leading programmes that are aiming to make a difference. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/06/poorest-countries-hit-hardest-world-lags-behind-global-education-goals-unesco-report\">Poorest countries hit hardest as world lags behind on global education goals</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong> ND</strong> I\u2019ll give you one example of a girl that actually kind of like sits out, showcases exactly how we do. She\u2019s called Rehema. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> Nasikiwa Duke is the programme manager at the NGO Camfed in Tanzania. She supports young women through Camfed\u2019s alumnae network, known as Cama, and is recalling the experience of Rehema, one of the girls who came through the scheme. </p> <p><strong> ND</strong> She realised that one of the girls was not attending school for about two or three weeks so she reported to the teacher mentor to see if she\u2019s also aware of this situation. She realised that the girl is not going to school but it\u2019s not because she\u2019s sick or anything. The girl told her, \u201cMy mother wants to marry me off.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cBecause she said she cannot take care of me any more.\u201d So the teacher said, \u201cWhat actually is the reason?\u201d \u201cHer mother is saying they are living in poverty, the school fees and other costs are too much for her to bear.\u201d So the teacher said, \u201cOK, actually tell the girl to come back to school and we will see how we\u2019ll support her.\u201d </p> <p> A week later the girl came back to school. The girl continued at least for a term, and then later she dropped out again. Rehema made the follow up. And the mother said, \u201cWell you supported me then, you don\u2019t support me now, and you know the only thing I can do is for her to get a husband so you know she has someone to take care of her.\u201d </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> According to the Global Partnership for Education, 63 million girls around the world are out of school. The reasons for this are complex and often country specific. Professor Pauline Rose is director of the Research for Equitable Access and Learning Centre in the faculty of education at Cambridge University. </p> <p><strong> PR</strong> There might not be any schools for them. Their schools are more likely to be destroyed. So where there are only all girls\u2019 schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan, for example, they can be the direct target of conflict. Girls can also face physical violence on the way to school. In the Democratic Republic of Congo over half of girls report that they\u2019ve been physically assaulted on the way to school or in other situations, which means that it\u2019s unsafe for them to go to school. Girls themselves can be part of the conflict. In some west African countries, around three-quarters of child suicide bombers are actually female. And we forget that they are actually also caught up in the conflict themselves. </p> <p> Syrian refugees living in Jordan are more likely \u2013 far more likely \u2013 now to be getting married earlier. They\u2019re 18 times more likely to get married early partly because of the consequence of the security issues. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> This was also the case for the girl supported by Rehema, the young woman in Camfed\u2019s Tanzanian alumnae network. Nasikiwa.</p> <p><strong> ND</strong> When they realised that she was already processed into that initiation ceremony to get her to be married off, now they had to step up and call even more government leaders and local authorities, the executive officers, the wide councillors in the village to actually sit down and see how we can make sure this girl does not drop out again. And right now that girl is back in school.</p> <p> And the mother has joined the parents support group; she\u2019s now advocating for more parents to change and not see poverty, yes it is a barrier, but if we pull up the efforts together we can actually fight it. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/14/africa-shortage-of-engineering-skills-and-female-students-will-stunt-its-growth\">Africa's shortage of engineering skills \u2018will stunt its growth\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong> LL</strong> At Gomututu primary school near Zvishavane I meet Ethel Kufa. Ethel works as an education programme facilitator for the Improving Girls\u2019 Access through Transforming Education programme, known as Igate. Supported by DfID\u2019s Girls Education Challenge Fund the programme aims to reach 100,000 marginalised girls from 467 schools located in four provinces in Zimbabwe. Ethel explains that some schools don\u2019t yet provide the most fundamental facilities for girls. </p> <p><strong> EK</strong> When you look at this school environment, is it friendly to the pupils? Is it friendly to the girl child? Is it friendly to the boy child? Because when you look at the girl friendly toilets and the issue of menstrual hygiene, that means this needs to be supported by the school development committees and the school head. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> And when girls don\u2019t have the resources for sanitary products they simply don\u2019t go to school.</p> <p><strong> BG</strong> My name is Beauty Ganyannee. I work for Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council as community distributor. The major challenge that we are facing is mothers group in the ramp making, is that we don\u2019t have enough money to purchase the material for ramp making. Ramps basically these are reusable menstrual pads. So these many made pads, they\u2019re handmade pads, they\u2019re made by hands using those threads and needles. These ramps, we need material to make these ramps, such as fleece material and the water-proof material to make these ramps. At the moment, due to drought, we can\u2019t afford to purchase these materials because many families they are focusing on buying food, mealie meal and cereal for their family members. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> Another very practical barrier to girls attending school is the distance a girl may have to travel. One very popular solution I witnessed in Zimbabwe has been providing bikes for girls to get to school. Fiona Mavhinga leads the Zimbabwean branch of Cama.</p> <p><strong> FM</strong> Indeed, distance to school is a challenge. I remember at my former school that I went to in rural Wedza in Zimbabwe, the parents\u2019 support groups that Nasikiwa referred to came together and built a house to make sure that girls have safe accommodation, the girls that were coming from long distances. </p> <p> And one of the mothers, the leader of mothers of the parents\u2019 support groups, volunteered to become a hostel matron for that group, volunteering her time and making sure that the girls, while they are there, they are safe. I think this has been the response mechanism to address that across Zambia and Tanzania as well where we have a lot of community hostels that are being supported by parents working together with Camfed. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> Now a lawyer, Fiona was herself one of the girls supported by Camfed when it was set up in 1993; a network which started with just 32 and which has now grown to more than 55,000.</p> <p><strong> FM</strong> Picture me 12 years ago when I started working as a lawyer in a law firm with 13 lawyers, 12 who were males and only one female. And picture me 12 years before that, I was this girl growing up in rural Zimbabwe, waking up at 4am every morning with my grandmother to go and sell vegetables so that we can raise money for food, we can raise money for school stationery; and my mother in turn trading dried fish for maize, which she also later on sold to raise fees for myself. Many times we went without food, so many times I was at risk of dropping out of school.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/30/girls-india-learn-app-coding-navigate-way-out-mumbai-slum\">Girls learn app coding to navigate a way out of their Mumbai slum</a> </p> </aside>  <p> My life really of a girl struggling to maintain her grip on an education is, as you know, not so different from millions of girls with a background of poverty. And when I think of myself now and the life of my friends that I grew up with in the same village as me, our lives are totally different just because of one thing: an education.</p> <p><strong> LL</strong> Julia Gillard, the former prime minister of Australia, is the board chair for the Global Partnership for Education. </p> <p><strong> JG</strong> Well, it\u2019s partly about conflict and fragility and the capacity of their nations to offer education; it\u2019s partly about poverty. It\u2019s about cultural attitudes that if you\u2019re a very poor family and can only afford to send one child to school then it is the boy who goes. It\u2019s about early marriage and the perceptions of what girls life roles are going to be; and consequently how much education they need.</p> <p><strong> LL</strong> As Nasikiwa explains, poverty creates a ripple effect that can lead to psychological challenges. </p> <p><strong> ND</strong> The psychosocial challenges are many and one of them is self-esteem, which is most of the cases being affiliated to issues around poverty, to issues around the community acknowledging your value, community accepting you, being listened to, having people actually seeing you as a person of potential. You might have parents, but not understanding the worth of a child having education. So we have to make sure that we have that understanding in the community that you work with, but also the children to see the value in themselves, because that will give them a push to excel.</p> <p><strong> PZ</strong> My name is Prudence Zurumba and I am turning 19 in May. I am part of the team the defending champion of the Coca Cola tournament. I play centre-back. I think it\u2019s because I\u2019m intelligent, I think fast. You have to be someone who thinks fast to clear the ball because you\u2019ll be the only person the whole team would be depending on. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> Prudence is from Chidyamakondo high school near Masvingo in southern Zimbabwe. As well as being a star footballer, she is bright and confident and hopes to continue her education but, as ever, money is an issue. </p> <p><strong> PZ</strong> If I pass I would like to go to the university and study law \u2026 My older sister wants to go to university and my older brother is just staying at home. If things go well with my father, maybe she will go. The issue is the money. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> So what are the routes available to get more girls into education? Ethel has been working with the community in Gomututu, helping them to set up their own support groups. </p> <p><strong> EK</strong> So you have seen that we have capacitated these community members. They can do some of these fundraising issues on their own without the support of external donors. The impact of Igate we have seen that girl child they are being re-enrolled in school. Parents they now afford to pay some parents who are in the village settings and then in groups they now afford to pay school fees for their pupils. The girls they are saying they now have confidence. They can do activities likes poems, dramas. Some of them they are performing very well in class and the parents they are saying they have enlightened us. We can now afford to send our children to school. We now afford to buy school uniforms for our kids. So I think we are making some impact. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/05/new-financial-bond-helping-us-get-more-girls-into-schools-india-education\">A new financial bond is helping us get more girls into schools in India</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong> LL</strong> Beauty Ganyannee helps run one of the mothers\u2019 group initiatives. </p> <p><strong> BG</strong> As a mothers\u2019 group we conducted door-to-door campaigns on the importance of education. Since the inception of Igate in 2013 we have managed to re-enrol seven students from secondary school and three from primary. Of the four pupils that re-enrolled at secondary level, they were having problems of menstrual hygiene so when they re-enrolled to school they were supplied with menstrual pads, these reusable menstrual pads. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> Like Igate, Camfed works closely with the community. </p> <p><strong> ND</strong> One of the things that we do is making sure the community sees the value of a girl going to school, because then they will take the responsibility to make sure that she goes and stays there. So we have in collaborations with parents, with local leaders, government leaders, chiefs, especially in Zimbabwe, we get them engaged. But also getting engaged in partnerships with government at the highest level of policy making and influence, to make sure that there is a support from the ground up to the national level.</p> <p> We make sure that there is peer support, especially to the young girls who are going to school, to make sure they have someone to confide in, someone whom they can rely on for advice, for support, because sometimes there is not that direct support, especially psychosocial issues when it comes to the family level.</p> <p><strong> LL</strong> As well as chairing the board of Global Partnership for Education, Julia Gillard is also patron of Camfed. She values their grassroot networks approach but is also working on the bigger picture, fostering support at national and international level.</p> <p><strong> JG</strong> It\u2019s a very individual model of change where girls themselves are in the lead but a growing and sustainable model of change; because the evidence is each girl who\u2019s been supported tends to support at least two or three more girls, so it\u2019s got great growth.</p> <p> GPE, the Global Partnership for Education, works on a whole-systems basis. We fundamentally believe that if you are going to give children a chance, then you have to have a high quality education system that offers equity and learning. So every child gets to go to school, the schools are of high quality, the system functions well and children learn. And so we work with developing country governments, we work with stakeholders within country. So it\u2019s moving the big levers of change.</p> <p><strong> LL</strong> At the Girls Education Forum held in London in July this year, the focus was on working collectively to get girls in school.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/07/uk-government-pledges-100m-poorest-girls-universal-primary-secondary-education-2030\">UK government pledges \u00a3100m to help world's poorest girls make the grade</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Justine Greening, then the UK\u2019s secretary of state for international development, is now education minister. </p> <p><strong> JGR</strong> We particularly want to focus on those girls who may have already missed out but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s too late for them to learn. And we want to put some investment into those girls who are most likely to be out of school to help them still get an education. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> So today you committed \u00a3100m, over what period? </p> <p><strong> JGR</strong> This will be over the next eight years, up to essentially just beyond 2020. And what we\u2019ll be doing is focusing on girls who may have never been in school in the first place and have missed out, say, in primary school.</p> <p><strong> LL</strong> While the millennium development goals got more children into primary schools, the new sustainable development goals will try to tackle both quality and access for those that are still left behind.</p> <p><strong> JG</strong> The purpose of sitting in school isn\u2019t to simply sit in something called a schoolhouse, it\u2019s actually to learn. I think from that MDG approach we now know as a global community that we\u2019ve got to focus on access and learning at the same time. We know more about who is most at risk of getting left behind, and obviously it is the girls \u2013 particularly the most impoverished girls \u2013 who are at most risk of getting left behind. We\u2019re clearer than we used to be about the impact of conflict and crisis and some of the ways we can support children and their families in humanitarian crisis so they still get education. I think it\u2019s about getting all that we\u2019ve learned and now better resourcing what works so that we are making more and more change.</p> <p><strong> LL</strong> That\u2019s all for this edition of the Global Development podcast.

  "<p>A year on from the \u201cDieselgate\u201d scandal that engulfed Volkswagen, damning new research reveals that all major diesel car brands, including Fiat, Vauxhall and Suzuki, are selling models that emit far higher levels of pollution than the shamed German carmaker.</p> <p>The car industry has faced fierce scrutiny since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/18/epa-california-investigate-volkswagen-clean-air-violations\">US government ordered Volkswagen</a> to recall almost 500,000 cars in 2015 after discovering it had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/25/volkswagen-scandal-qa-what-you-need-to-know-about-diesel\">installed illegal software on its diesel vehicles to cheat emissions tests</a>. But a new in-depth study by campaign group <a href=\"http://www.transportenvironment.org/publications/dont-breathe-here-tackling-air-pollution-vehicles\">Transport &amp; Environment (T&amp;E)</a> found not one brand complies with the latest \u201cEuro 6\u201d air pollution limits when driven on the road and that Volkswagen is far from being the worst offender.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had this focus on Volkswagen as a \u2018dirty carmaker\u2019 but when you look at the emissions of other manufacturers you find there are no really clean carmakers,\u201d says Greg Archer, clean vehicles director at T&amp;E. \u201cVolkswagen is not the carmaker producing the diesel cars with highest nitrogen oxides emissions and the failure to investigate other companies brings disgrace on the European regulatory system.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/03/eco-guide-to-electric-vehicles\">The eco guide to electric vehicles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>T&amp;E analysed emissions test data from around 230 diesel car models to rank the worst performing car brands based on their emissions in real-world driving conditions. Fiat and Suzuki (which use Fiat engines) top the list with their newest diesels, designed to meet Euro 6 requirements, spewing out 15 times the NOx limit; while Renault-Nissan vehicle emissions were judged to be more than 14 times higher. General Motors\u2019 brands Opel-Vauxhall also fared badly with emissions found to be 10 times higher than permitted levels.</p> <p>The new models are not breaking the law and the manufacturers say they comply with all current regulations. But cars are are able to be on the road because of the difference between emissions produced in lab tests and real on-road driving situations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-18T17:51:48/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graphic on Euro 6 NOx emission limits across the industry\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-18T17:51:48/embed.html\">Graphic on Euro 6 NOx emission limits across the industry</a> </figure>  <p>Since September 2015 new diesel cars have had to comply with a new European exhaust emissions standard called Euro 6 which set a limit of 0.08g per km. The new rules heralded a significant reduction from the previous \u201cEuro 5\u201d standard which allowed 0.18g per km. NOx pollution is considered to be a serious public health risk, causing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/13/government-passing-the-buck-air-pollution-campaigners\">early deaths of 23,500 people a year</a> in the UK alone.</p> <p>The report \u2013 which also drew on data from investigations conducted by the British, French and German governments, as well as a <a href=\"http://equaindex.com/equa-air-quality-index/\">large public database</a> \u2013 surprisingly found Volkswagen to be selling among the cleanest diesel vehicles under the Euro 6 rules. Archer says this was not, however, evidence of the carmaker \u201clearning its lesson\u201d as these models were available before last year\u2019s scandal broke. The Dieselgate engines were mostly of the previous Euro 5 era which were sold between 2011 and 2015. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-18T17:58:44/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graphic on Euro 5 NOx emission limits across the industry\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-18T17:58:44/embed.html\">Graphic on Euro 5 NOx emission limits across the industry</a> </figure>  <p>T&amp;E estimates that there are 29m \u201cdirty\u201d diesel cars and vans on Europe\u2019s roads \u2013 a number that is still growing \u2013 with 4.3m of them being driven in the UK. The group classify a car as \u201cdirty\u201d if emissions are more than three times over the relevant NOx limit. Archer argues that a mass recall of dirty Euro 5 and 6 vehicles is required given the average lifetime of a car is 17 years. \u201cSoftware upgrades could easily be implemented to ensure the exhaust systems operate in normal driving conditions as the law clearly states,\u201d he argues.</p> <p>For Euro 5 vehicles, the five worst performing companies were, in order of the highest emissions: Renault (including Dacia), Land Rover, Hyundai, Opel/Vauxhall (including Chevrolet) and Nissan. For current Euro 6 cars a different pattern emerges. The worst performers are: Fiat (including Alfa Romeo) and Suzuki (to whom Fiat supply engines), Renault (including Nissan, Dacia and Infiniti), Opel/Vauxhall, Hyundai and Mercedes-Benz.</p> <p>Last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/01/french-inquiry-confirms-widespread-irregularities-in-diesel-emissions-data\">French investigators</a> said they had found that a large number of diesel cars emitted much higher levels of pollution than their European manufacturers claim. According to the independent committee\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Rapport_Commission_independante.pdf\">report</a>, around a third of the 86 diesel vehicles tested produced levels of NOx well above European limits.

  "<p>Most of us have wondered what we might do if we didn\u2019t need to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/work-and-careers\" title=\"\">work</a> \u2013 if we woke up one morning to discover we had won the lottery, say. We entertain ourselves with visions of multiple homes, trips around the world or the players we would sign after buying Arsenal. For many of us, the most tantalising aspect of such visions is the freedom it would bring: to do what one wants, when one wants and how one wants.</p> <p>But imagine how that vision might change if such freedom were extended to everyone. Some day, probably not in our lifetimes but perhaps not long after, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/13/artificial-intelligence-robots-threat-jobs-forrester-report\" title=\"\">machines will be able to do most of the tasks</a> that people can.

Just as a lottery cheque does not free the winner from the shackles of the human condition, all-purpose machine intelligence will not magically allow us all to get along. And what is especially tricky about a world without work is that we must begin building the social institutions to survive it long before the technological obsolescence of human workers actually arrives.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/13/artificial-intelligence-robots-threat-jobs-forrester-report\">Robots will eliminate 6% of all US jobs by 2021, report says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite impressive progress in robotics and machine intelligence, those of us alive today can expect to keep on labouring until retirement. But while Star Trek-style replicators and robot nannies remain generations away, the digital revolution is nonetheless beginning to wreak havoc. Economists and politicians have puzzled over the struggles workers have experienced in recent decades: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/27/uk-joins-greece-at-bottom-of-wage-growth-league-tuc-oecd\" title=\"\">pitiful rate of growth in wages</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/13/oxfam-calls-on-theresa-may-to-tackle-rising-uk-inequality\" title=\"\">rising inequality</a>, and the growing flow of national income to profits and rents rather than pay cheques. The primary culprit is technology. The digital revolution has helped supercharge globalisation, automated routine jobs, and allowed small teams of highly skilled workers to manage tasks that once required scores of people. The result has been a glut of labour that economies have struggled to digest.</p> <p>Labour markets have coped the only way they are able: workers needing jobs have little option but to accept dismally low wages. Bosses shrug and use people to do jobs that could, if necessary, be done by machines. Big retailers and delivery firms feel less pressure to turn their warehouses over to robots when there are long queues of people willing to move boxes around for low pay. Law offices put off plans to invest in sophisticated document scanning and analysis technology because legal assistants are a dime a dozen. People continue to staff checkout counters when machines would often, if not always, be just as good. Ironically, the first symptoms of a dawning era of technological abundance are to be found in the growth of low-wage, low-productivity employment. And this mess starts to reveal just how tricky the construction of a workless world will be. The most difficult challenge posed by an economic revolution is not how to come up with the magical new technologies in the first place; it is how to reshape society so that the technologies can be put to good use while also keeping the great mass of workers satisfied with their lot in life. So far, we are failing.</p> <p>Preparing for a world without work means grappling with the roles work plays in society, and finding potential substitutes. First and foremost, we rely on work to distribute purchasing power: to give us the dough to buy our bread. Eventually, in our distant Star Trek future, we might get rid of money and prices altogether, as soaring productivity allows society to provide people with all they need at near-zero cost.</p> <p>For a good while longer, wages will continue to be the main way people come by money, and prices will be needed to ration access to scarce goods and services. But in the absence of any broader social change, pushing people out of work will simply redirect the flow of income from workers to firm-owners: the rich will get richer. Freeing people from work without social collapse will therefore require society to find ways other than pay for labour to channel money to those not on the job. People might come to receive more of their income in the form of state-led redistribution: through the payment of a basic income, for instance, or direct public provision of services such as education, healthcare and housing. Or, perhaps, everyone could be given a capital allotment at birth.</p> <p>These sorts of arrangements don\u2019t magically materialise as machines become more powerful. They must be brought into existence through political action. And that\u2019s where things start to get complicated. One problem is that large-scale social overhaul takes a long time to emerge and have an effect. Another is that money for nothing is not necessarily what the displaced masses are interested in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/07/robots-replacing-jobs-luddites-economics-labor\">Are robots going to steal your job? Probably | Moshe Y Vardi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ongoing political debates illustrate the problem. There are lots of ways a government could boost workers\u2019 pay. It could raise the minimum wage, increase wage subsidies, enact a basic income, or use more heavy-handed regulation to protect industries and force firms to share more of their profits with labourers. Tellingly, workers and trade unions seem least interested in the policies, such as a basic income, that break the link between compensation and work. This makes the building of our eventual utopia tricky; a hefty rise in the minimum wage would benefit lots of workers, but it would also discourage some firms from using the cheap labour they have been soaking up, forcing the jobless to get along in a world in which they cannot find work yet also lack the monetary means to stay out of poverty.</p> <p>Workers\u2019 preferences are easy to understand. Work is not just a means for distributing purchasing power. It is also among the most important sources of identity and purpose in individuals\u2019 lives. If the role of work in society is to shrink, other sources of purpose and identity will need to grow. Some people will manage to find these things for themselves: pursuing passions too uneconomic to live on or engaging in voluntarism, just as many retirees find satisfying ways to fill their days. But others will find themselves at a loss.</p> <p>Workers are sure to feel uncomfortable with reforms designed to clear a path to their own economic irrelevance. They are not the only ones likely to object. Redistribution implies taking as well as giving. And while some tech entrepreneurs seem to be warming to the idea of something like a universal basic income, perhaps seeing it as a moral licence to disrupt, the reservoir of resentment at those perceived to be getting too good a deal from the government never runs dry. Rich Americans are already annoyed enough at the \u201ctakers\u201d among their countrymen, those Mitt Romney labelled an incorrigible 47% in his 2012 campaign for the presidency, who pay no federal income tax \u2013 even though most work, pay other taxes, and are simply too poor to owe any income tax to the federal government. The haves who will inevitably provide a disproportionate share of the funding for future welfare states will need convincing to part with their cash.</p> <p>So societies might decide that people must be made to contribute in some way to the community to qualify for state support. Those not in work, for example, might have to participate in community service or other activity. Another approach might be more seductive. Those still in work might be less grumpy about funding a more generous welfare state if beneficiaries are deemed to be enough like them: fellow tribesmen, people of similar background and therefore felt to be deserving of charity.</p> <p>Around the rich world, it is interesting to note that it is not so much the generosity of state redistribution that is provoking societal unrest, but the fact that out groups \u2013 from Latinos to Poles to refugees \u2013are grabbing a share.</p> <p>Building a workless utopia in which wealth is broadly shared, people are mostly satisfied with their lot in life, and the peace isn\u2019t kept by excluding any inconvenient foreigners, is no easy task. The grappling has already begun, and the initial rounds of negotiation are more than a little discouraging. Two centuries from now, I am confident, we will have worked everything out splendidly. Assuming, that is, that those of us alive now can manage the first painful steps without wrecking the world in the process.</p>",

As soon as he reached the ravaged city, he found six survivors of the bombing whose personal narratives captured the horror of the tragedy from the awful moment of the explosion. This gave Hersey his opening sentence, a unique point of view, and a narrative thread through a chaotic and overwhelming mass of material. In a style later developed and popularised by the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/New-Journalism\" title=\"\">\u201cnew journalism\u201d</a> of the 1960s, the opening of Hiroshima pitches the reader into the heart of the story, from the viewpoint of one of its victims:</p> <p>At exactly 15 minutes past eight in the morning on 6 August, 1945, Japanese time, at the moment when the atomic bomb flashed above Hiroshima, Miss Toshiko Sasaki, a clerk in the personnel department of the East Asia Tin Works, had just sat down at her place in the plant office and was turning her head to speak to the girl at the next desk.</p> <p>From here, Hersey embarks on an exploration of the lives of five other interlocutors: the Rev Mr Kiyoshi Tanimoto, of the Hiroshima Methodist church, who suffers radiation sickness; Mrs Hatsuyo Nakamura, a widow with three children; one European, Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, a German Jesuit priest who had endured exposure to radiation; and finally, two doctors \u2013 Masakazu Fujii and Terufumi Sasaki (not related to Miss Sasaki). Some of these interviewees had been less than 1,500 yards (1,370m) from the site of the explosion, and their harrowing accounts of vaporised, burnt and mutilated bodies, of blasted survivors, of hot winds and a devastated city tormented by raging fires, a scene from hell, gave a voice to a people with whom the US and its allies had been brutally at war only a year earlier. Hersey\u2019s brilliant reportage gave his story an existential dimension:</p> <blockquote> They still wonder why they lived when so many others died. Each of them counts many small items of chance or volition \u2013 a step taken in time, a decision to go indoors, catching one streetcar instead of the next \u2013 that spared him. And now each knows that in the act of survival he lived a dozen lives and saw more death than he ever thought he would see. At the time, none of them knew anything. <br> </blockquote> <p>Hersey also used all his skill as a novelist and as a war reporter to bring home the horror of what he, one of the first correspondents into Hiroshima, had learned:</p> <blockquote> Dr Sasaki had not looked outside the hospital all day; the scene inside was so terrible and so compelling that it had not occurred to him to ask any questions about what had happened beyond the windows and doors. Ceilings and partitions had fallen; plaster, dust, blood, and vomit were everywhere. Patients were dying by the hundreds, but there was nobody to carry away the corpses. Some of the hospital staff distributed biscuits and rice balls, but the charnel-house smell was so strong that few were hungry. By three o\u2019clock the next morning, after nineteen hours of his gruesome work, Dr Sasaki was incapable of dressing another wound. <br> </blockquote> <p>Hersey\u2019s decision to use the testaments of Dr Sasaki, Mrs Namakura and the others, was both an inspired creative and also a tactically brilliant decision. The US army of occupation had prevented many US journalists from taking material out of the country, censoring photographs and tape-recordings alike. Hersey avoided such restrictions. He would stay only a few weeks in Hiroshima, but he returned to New York with a suitcase full of extraordinary first-hand material, and now set about fashioning a four-part piece for the <em>New Yorker</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d76f515256a4394a207ad775e5603151e6c8ac6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d76f515256a4394a207ad775e5603151e6c8ac6e/0_0_300_435/300.jpg\" alt=\"Hiroshima by John Hersey, which has never been out of print since it was first published in 1946.\" width=\"300\" height=\"435\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hiroshima by John Hersey, which has never been out of print since it was first published in 1946.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Part I, A Noiseless Flash, introduced Hersey\u2019s six witnesses. Part II, The Fire, reported the immediate, horrific aftermath of the explosion. Part III, Details are Being Investigated, described the wider, Japanese response to this unimaginable act of war. Part IV, Panic Grass and Feverfew, followed Father Kleinsorge and the sufferings of Hersey\u2019s other witnesses in the weeks after the bombing, describing the Japanese people\u2019s hatred for the Americans who had perpetrated this \u201cwar crime\u201d. So soon after the end of the second world war, with feelings still running high, to achieve any kind of objectivity was a remarkable challenge.</p> <p>In hindsight, Hersey frankly acknowledged the first technical difficulty he encountered with this story: there was no way he could bring his usual style to bear on his material, he said. \u201cA show of passion would have brought me into the story as a mediator. I wanted to avoid such mediation, so the reader\u2019s experience would be as direct as possible.\u201d Instead, he went for cool and low key. As the <em>New Yorker</em> writer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrik_Hertzberg\" title=\"\">Hendrik Herzberg</a> has written: \u201cHersey\u2019s reporting was so meticulous, his sentences and paragraphs were so clear, calm and restrained, that the horror of the story he had to tell came through all the more chillingly.\u201d Hersey\u2019s flat, plain, deliberately unemotional style immediately caught the imagination of his editors, Ross and Shawn. In conditions of great secrecy, they decided to do something unprecedented: devote an entire edition of their magazine to the story of Hiroshima.</p> <p>The ironic cover of the 31 August 1946 edition of<em> </em>the <em>New Yorker</em> gives nothing away: a summer-in-the-park illustration of a carefree picnic. It was not until the reader turned past Goings on About Town and the usual metropolitan advertisements for motor cars and diamonds that the editors\u2019 intentions were revealed in a simple statement: \u201cTO OUR READERS. The <em>New Yorker</em> this week devotes its entire editorial space to an article on the almost complete obliteration of a city by one atomic bomb, and what happened to the people of that city. It does so in the conviction that few of us have yet comprehended the all but incredible destructive power of this weapon, and that everyone might well take time to consider the terrible implications of its use.\u201d</p> <p>The impact of this <em>New Yorker </em>was extraordinary. The edition sold out 300,000 copies within hours of publication, inspiring a storm of commentary across the US, and abroad, especially on radio. Harold Ross said he had never got \u201cas much satisfaction out of anything else\u201d in his life. Hersey\u2019s piece was reprinted worldwide. Albert Einstein, an outspoken opponent of the bomb, who tried to buy a thousand copies of the <em>New Yorker</em> to send to fellow scientists, had to settle for a facsimile version. Copies of the original edition changed hands at many times the cover price.</p> <p>The <em>New Yorker</em>\u2019s rival, <em>Time</em> magazine, gave the best immediate verdict:</p> <blockquote> Every American who has permitted himself to make jokes about atom bombs, or who has come to regard them as just one sensational phenomenon that can now be accepted as part of civilisation, like the airplane and the gasoline engine, or who has allowed himself to speculate as to what we might do with them if we were forced into another war, ought to read Mr Hersey. When this magazine article appears in book form the critics will say that it is in its fashion a classic. But it is rather more than that. </blockquote> <p>Within a year, Knopf had published Hiroshima as a book. It has never since been out of print, and has now sold upwards of 3m copies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/23/hiroshima-john-hersey-bomb-new-yorker-1946-enduring-reportage-rachel-cooke-shelf-life\">Hiroshima by John Hersey: an enduring memory of reportage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>John Hersey returned to Hiroshima in 1985 to meet his informants once again, and to write a retrospective, The Aftermath, which described the postwar lives of the <em>hibakusha</em>*.

Instead, here are the three lessons Europeans should take.</p> <h2><strong>Costs too much</strong></h2> <p>The reality is that most countries won\u2019t be able to use Australia\u2019s techniques to stop people movements due to the number of arrivals and the prohibitive expense involved.</p> <p>It is true that Australia has had <a href=\"https://www.themonthly.com.au/nation-reviewed-robert-manne-comment-asylum-seekers-2706\">success in stopping the boats</a> through disrupting people smugglers\u2019 business model. This has involved turning back boats to Indonesia, offshore processing and the use of detention centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea based on a policy that boat arrivals will never be resettled in Australia. Australia has shown that government can influence the number of arrivals through policy settings.</p> <p>However, Australia\u2019s success is not replicable in most other countries. It can only be attempted by the richest of countries which have low refugee numbers.</p> <p>Per capita, the financial cost is enormous. This week\u2019s Australian National Audit Office report details a cost of <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-13/immigration-dept-criticised-by-audit-office-offshore-centres/7839902\">$573,111 per person per year</a> for holding on Manus Island and Nauru. Australia spends more than <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-14/cost-of-offshore-processing-united-nations-fact-check/6609764\">$1bn per year on offshore processing</a> for fewer than 2,000 people. This is not a model the EU can emulate with migration flows of <a href=\"http://www.iom.int/news/mediterranean-migrant-arrivals-2016-204311-deaths-2443\">more than 200,000</a> in January to May this year alone.</p> <p>It is also worth mentioning the non-fiscal costs related to this policy. Australia\u2019s international relationships have been effected, particularly with Nauru and Papua New Guinea where Australia is accused of <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-18/governor-slams-neo-colonialist-png-asylum-seek-deal/5977560\">neo-colonialism</a> and, crucially, with rising power Indonesia where issues around migration have <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-20/indonesia-relationship-at-low-point-labor-says/6560952\">created friction</a> in one of Australia\u2019s most important relationships.</p> <p>The detention of refugees has a demonstrably high cost for those in detention. The Australian Human Rights Commission\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.humanrights.gov.au/our-work/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/publications/forgotten-children-national-inquiry-children\">National Inquiry into Children in Immigration Detention</a> is unequivocal on the negative impact of prolonged detention on detainees\u2019 mental and physical health.</p> <p>The bottom line is that you can\u2019t stop people movements of the scale occurring in Europe by adopting Australia\u2019s border policies.</p> <h2><strong>Migration can work</strong></h2> <p>The second lesson to be taken from Australia is more positive: it is that mass migration can really work.</p> <p>The Australian experience shows the economic and cultural benefits of mass migration. From a small white settler society at the end of the second world war, Australia has been transformed to a vibrant multicultural nation. Statistics show that <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/lookup/3412.0Media%20Release12014-15\">28% of the population was born overseas</a> \u2013 with at least <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/lookup/2071.0main+features902012-2013\">another 20%</a> the child of an overseas-born parent.</p> <p>This is a dramatic change and results have been broadly positive. For example, Australia is one of only three countries in the world where <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/education/children-of-migrants-outclassing-the-locals-at-school/story-fn59nlz9-1226136191182\">children of migrants</a> score better at school than children of non-migrants.</p> <p>Australia has reaped the economic benefits of migration. Tracing Australia\u2019s history, George Megalogenis links <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/george-megalogenis-on-australias-second-chance/6794052\">periods of economic growth to times when Australia was open to migration</a>. The current prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, drew this lesson: \u201copenness and multiculturalism based on mutual respect is what has defined most of the most successful societies in the world\u201d.</p> <p>When Europeans worry about the impossibility of integration of those with different cultural or religious backgrounds, Australia is a salutary case study of what is possible.</p> <h2><strong>It\u2019s under control</strong></h2> <p>The final lesson to be drawn from Australia is that the second lesson is tied to the first: to achieve societal acceptance of mass migration, the public has to be convinced that the process is under control.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/22/the-claim-that-locking-asylum-seekers-up-in-nauru-and-png-saves-lives-is-bogus\">The claim that locking asylum seekers up in Nauru and PNG saves lives is bogus | Philippe Legrain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is the fascinating lesson from John Howard\u2019s prime ministership. The prime minister who took such a hard line on border security was also the one who oversaw significant increases in overall migration; in 2007 the number of permanent migrants hit 191,000: <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-11-27/berg---immigration/4394382\">the largest cohort since the second world war</a>.</p> <p>He understood this truth: that to build acceptance of mass migration, governments have to convince the public that the process is under control.</p> <p>The core aim of Australia\u2019s migration program is that it is orderly.

  "<p>The Australian Conservation Foundation has renewed its legal challenge to Adani\u2019s Carmichael mine, appealing against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/12/adanis-carmichael-coalmine-proves-environment-laws-too-weak-report\">a federal court ruling that endorsed its approval by the commonwealth</a>.</p> <p>The ACF on Monday lodged an appeal against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/29/greg-hunts-approval-of-adanis-queensland-mine-upheld-by-federal-court\">last month\u2019s decision</a>, which found the then federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, was entitled to find the impact on global warming and the Great Barrier Reef from the Queensland mine\u2019s 4.6bn tonnes of carbon emissions \u201cspeculative\u201d.</p> <p>The president of the ACF, Geoff Cousins, said Australia\u2019s national environment protection laws were \u201cbroken\u201d if the minister could approve \u201ca mega-polluting coalmine \u2013 the biggest in Australia\u2019s history \u2013 and claim it will have no impact on the global warming and the reef\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf our environment laws are too weak to actually protect Australia\u2019s unique species and places, they effectively give companies like Adani a licence to kill,\u201d Cousins said.</p> <p>\u201cBe in no doubt, Adani\u2019s Carmichael proposal is massive and will lock in decades of damaging climate pollution if it goes ahead, further wrecking the reef.</p> <p>\u201cThe science is clear that we can have coal or the reef \u2013 but we can\u2019t have both.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/05/linking-adani-coal-mine-to-social-uplift-in-india-ridiculous-says-conservationist\">Linking Adani coalmine to social uplift in India ridiculous, says conservationist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Queensland Resources Council applauded the court\u2019s rejection of the original ACF challenge, saying it was a \u201cnonsense case\u201d akin to holding the Saudi Arabian government responsible for emissions from Australian cars running on their oil.</p> <p>The ACF argued Hunt had made an \u201cerror of law\u201d by not factoring in the impact of overseas \u201ccombustion\u201d of the coal over the 60-year life of the mine.</p> <p>Hunt had found it was \u201cnot possible to draw robust conclusions on the likely contribution of the project to a specific increase in global temperature\u201d.</p> <p>It was therefore \u201cdifficult to identify the necessary relationship between the taking of the action and any possible impacts on relevant matters of national environmental significance\u201d.</p> <p>Justice John Griffiths ruled it was \u201cplain that the minister did give consideration to greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the combustion emissions and made an express finding that the proposed action would not have an unacceptable impact on the world heritage values of the reef\u201d.</p> <p>Cousins said Griffiths had acknowledged \u201cconsiderable public interest\u201d in the case and ACF was \u201cin no doubt that we represent the concerns of the majority of Australians\u201d.</p> <p>He referred to a ReachTel survey of 2,600 Australians around the same time as the federal court ruling showing 81% backed stronger national environment laws and 75% backed environment groups\u2019 right to bring legal challenges to mining projects.</p> <p>\u201cAnd 75% support environment groups\u2019 right to use legal avenues to uphold existing environmental laws.</p> <p>\u201cIt comes down to this.
