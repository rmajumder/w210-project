  "<p>Britain can jettison hundreds of costly agricultural regulations which have pushed up food prices, offsetting the extra costs of European Union tariffs, according to a report by a free market thinktank.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://iea.us1.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=708e119fa74cd33e6a28f949a&amp;id=af16a20cc3&amp;e=a54acb4b9f\">study by the Institute of Economic Affairs</a> argues that Brussels has fallen victim to intense lobbying by pressure groups which benefit from tighter rules on food standards, animal welfare and the environment.</p> <p>These rules often have little benefit for consumer health or reduce risks, but \u201ccreate deadweight costs\u201d, it said.</p> <p>The IEA said banning all synthetic pesticides currently allowed under the EU\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) could add as much as \u00a37.5bn to the cost of food production should the UK remain within the EU. Behind the calculation is a move towards imposing organic standards on farmers, the report said, which would lower crop yields.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/14/organic-farming-agriculture-world-hunger\">If all food were grown organically</a>, it said wheat yields would halve, leading to a price rise of nearly 70%, potato yields would fall by 44% leading to a price increase of nearly 200%, and bean yields would fall by a quarter, leading to a price rise of more than 50%.<br></p> <p>The report attacks Friends of the Earth and farmers\u2019 unions for persuading EU officials to widen the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/22/farmers-divided-on-eu-referendum-brexit-agriculture\">remit of the CAP</a> to include regulation of food production. It said the CAP had evolved into an \u201cinterventionist\u201d and complex bureaucracy with \u201ca remit that covers a multitude of areas, from biodiversity to food safety to environmental protection, all of which have led to a huge regulatory burden on the food industry\u201d. </p> <p>Mark Littlewood, the IEA\u2019s director general, said he was concerned that official figures showed existing agricultural regulations were already costing nearly \u00a3600m every year in England. </p> <p>\u201cEU member states face staggering food price rises unless the march of increased regulation is halted. The UK is fortunate that it now has the opportunity to repatriate control of its farming regulations. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s crucial that decisions stem from good scientific evidence, and pay attention to consumers\u2019 interests and the potential crippling costs that overregulation can have in pushing up food prices and the cost of living.\u201d</p> <p>The report said consumers should be allowed to buy cheaper food, including genetically modified products, without the intervention of Brussels officials \u201ccaptured\u201d by special interest groups. </p> <p>It added: \u201cSince the 1990s, the growth of regulation and subsidies has gone hand-in-hand as subsidies have been increasingly tied to environmental requirements imposed on farmers. This leads to costs for consumers and taxpayers alike.<br></p> <p>\u201cOne cause of the growth in regulation is the use of the precautionary principle. This is poorly defined. However, in general, it means that the benefit of the doubt is given to the protection against any possible harm at the expense of consumer, business or economic interests.</p> <p>\u201cThe result has been a drift towards overregulation and a jettisoning of rational principles of managing and taking into account risk.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p> </p> <p>Recruiting children aged 16 and 17 into the British army places them at greater risk of death, injury and long-term mental health problems than those recruited as adults, according to a new <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_f0UKLAPEC9elA1ZGtUeFo3dlpTVEpRYk01ZHlOMXJmeGZv/view\">report</a>.</p> <p>The public health charity <a href=\"http://www.medact.org/\">Medact</a> uses its report, published on Tuesday, to call for the minimum recruitment age to be raised to 18.</p> <p>\u201cMinimum age laws exist to protect children from smoking, drinking, driving and watching violent films,\u201d said Dr David McCoy, director of Medact. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the UK to fall in step with the vast majority of countries and raise the minimum recruitment age to 18.\u201d</p> <p>The UK is the only country in Europe, and only permanent member of the UN security council, to still allow recruitment from age 16. A <a href=\"http://forceswatch.net//sites/default/files/IPSOSsurvey2014-Forces_age.pdf\">nationwide poll</a> in 2014 found that 77% of the general public support a rise in the recruitment age to 18. </p> <p>The army\u2019s policy of recruiting children has been <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2014-11-17/214739\">strongly criticised</a> by multiple UN and <a href=\"https://childrenandarmedconflict.un.org/.../MachelStudy-10YearStrategicReview_en.pdf\">UK</a> parliamentary bodies, <a href=\"http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/docs/AdvanceVersions/CRC.C.GBR.CO.4.pdf\">child rights organisations</a> and human rights groups.</p> <p>Despite the criticism, Medact found child recruits to the British army are more likely to be deployed on the frontline. In Afghanistan, British soldiers who enlisted at 16 were <a href=\"http://child-soldiers.org/research_report_reader.php?id=699\">approximately twice as likely to be killed or injured</a> when compared with soldiers who enlisted when they were over 18.</p> <p>Child recruits are also more vulnerable to suicide, self-harm, post-traumatic stress disorder and alcohol abuse than adult recruits, the report found.</p> <p>Steve Brown joined the army cadets aged 13 in 1995 and the army three years later. \u201cI became a child soldier in the British army because they\u2019d groomed me since the moment I joined the cadets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe army turned up every couple of months with motorcycle displays and other spectacles, and promised us life in the army would be glamorous, fun and well-paid. There was no mention of the downsides, even at the recruitment office itself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b0075a34a1dfd6be57532e6eff439b7dd4b9965e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0075a34a1dfd6be57532e6eff439b7dd4b9965e/0_55_526_657/400.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Brown\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Brown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brown family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Brown left the army after his second tour of Iraq in 2006. Now 35, he struggles with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. \u201cA decade after leaving the army, I\u2019m still recovering from the damage it did to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI joined straight out of school, so didn\u2019t have a chance to become an individual. When I left, I realised that I had never learned how to make my own decisions or have my own opinions. Because I\u2019d joined so young, I had been completely moulded by the army and life outside was almost impossible.\u201d</p> <p>The army accepts applications from children aged 15 years and 7 months. In the last financial year, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uk-armed-forces-biannual-diversity-statistics-2016\">22.2% of recruits were under 18</a>. New recruits under 18 have to sign<a href=\"http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/TermsofService.pdf\"> terms of service </a>which can prevent them from leaving the army for up to six years.</p> <p>McCoy said that how the UK armed forces recruits children breaches its own definition of \u201cinformed consent\u201d. He said: \u201cFull and informed consent of these children is not always gained. There are compliance issues with the <a href=\"https://childrenandarmedconflict.un.org/mandate/opac/\">Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict</a>, which the UK has signed.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.kcl.ac.uk/kcmhr/publications/assetfiles/.../resilience-paper.pdf\">Young veterans, aged 16-24, are more likely to kill themselves when compared with the general population</a>: between 1984 and 2013, male soldiers aged under 20 were 47% more likely to kill themselves than the same age group in the general population. \u201cThese findings are mainly a result of a higher prevalence of pre-service vulnerabilities amongst young recruits to the armed forces,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>The report comes after the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/04/150-army-cadet-units-open-state-schools-michael-fallon\">announced that cadet army units </a>would be expanded in state schools. While the government argues that the cadet programme helps raise pupils\u2019 attainment, campaigners have expressed fears that these units act as a channel of recruitment into the armed forces, and that military activities for children as young as 12 are inappropriate in the educational environment.</p> <p> Citing evidence that military marketing strategies which glamorise war \u201ctake advantage\u201d of the tendency of adolescents to be driven by immediate social rewards and risk-taking behaviours, the report also accuses the army of not being truthful enough about life in the military.</p> <p>\u201cThe recruitment approach is designed to appeal to adolescent decision-making biases by portraying military life in glamorous terms whilst frequently using terms such as \u2018big guns\u2019, \u2018awesome armour\u2019 and \u2018big boys\u2019 toys\u2019,\u201d the report notes.</p> <p>Recruitment materials \u201coften fail to provide complete and accurate information about the terms and conditions of service for potential recruits\u201d, the report says. They also don\u2019t include information about the difficulties and long-term risks of an armed forces career while briefing materials for parents do not fully explain the demands or risks of military life.</p> <p>\u201cAll too often, the claim is made that military life can be good for troubled adolescents,\u201d said McCoy. \u201cThe argument is that the military can provide discipline and a sense of purpose for individuals who may be struggling with education, or who are engaged in self-harming or antisocial behaviour. </p> <p>\u201cThere are two things wrong with this viewpoint. First, there is evidence that military life may be harmful to the health and wellbeing of those recruited as adolescents,\u201d he said. \u201cSecond, there are other ways to support adolescents who are struggling with their education and social situation, and if the military is presented as the only viable option, then the recruitment of under-18s cannot be considered to be consensual.\u201d</p> <p>A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: \u201cThe armed forces offer young people opportunities that aren\u2019t available elsewhere, from basic literacy education and support for postgraduate degrees, to high-quality accredited training and unique employment prospects. Like everyone who serves our country, under-18s \u2013 who can only sign up with formal written consent of a parent or guardian \u2013 are fully supported throughout their service career.\u201d</p> <h2><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7d438c84721ee377788ea1a27b56f7f4696e4e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7d438c84721ee377788ea1a27b56f7f4696e4e8/0_196_1246_747/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wayne Sharrocks at 17 in 2006 in the Falklands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wayne Sharrocks at 17 in 2006 in the Falklands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sharrocks family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Case study: Wayne Sharrocks</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> My father was in the army but I didn\u2019t consider it as a career until I was 15 and the Iraq war was happening. I was manipulated by the media: soldiers were always referred to as \u201cheroes\u201d and being in the army, fighting these terrorists, was presented as being the noblest thing a man could do. At 15, you desperately want to be a man. I was immature and naive: I didn\u2019t even think about any of the realistic aspects of going to war and no one told me about them.</p> <p> I tried to sign up at 15 but problems with my eyes meant I had to wait. I joined the day I turned 17. The manipulation started immediately: we were battered into following orders without thinking, the loyalty to our unit was absolute and \u2013 most psychologically damaging \u2013 we had our human instincts destroyed, so killing someone wasn\u2019t a big deal and always being ready to fight was second nature.</p> <p> If I\u2019d been older, perhaps the training wouldn\u2019t have affected me mentally in the way it did. But as a child, I accepted it entirely. My friends now say that I became hyper-aggressive and super-angry as a result of my army training. At the time, I thought that was a really good thing. As I say, I was a child. I had no wider experience of life to give me perspective. I was used by the army.</p> <p> I decided to leave after seeing two colleagues seriously hurt and being badly hurt myself in Afghanistan in 2011. But I was still so brainwashed that it took me a couple of years to actually get out.</p> <p> I spent the next few years in a terrible state. I\u2019d lost my army family, my support system, my bubble of existence. The army promises you qualifications but they\u2019re not transferable: I went from a position of responsibility in the army to spraying kitchen furniture as a civilian. There was nothing else I could do.</p> <p> I eventually had a breakdown. I was going to ask the army to take me back: I thought I couldn\u2019t survive outside it. But I\u2019ve had counselling and am working my way back up. I\u2019m 27 now. The army has taken 10 years of my life. And yes, I\u2019m angry about that. Very angry.</p> </blockquote> <p> </p>",
  "<p>If the world was watching, as the hype would suggest, then Liverpool and Manchester United owe a lot of apologies. The biggest ticket the Premier League has to sell to a global audience did not include incident or entertainment at Anfield and J\u00fcrgen Klopp looked beyond convenient excuses to lament his team\u2019s responsibility for the non-event.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you are in a good moment you can play much better and it should not depend on how the opposition defends because the spaces are always similar,\u201d he said. \u201cOur problem was that we didn\u2019t see them tonight.\u201d When his adrenaline levels subside in a few days\u2019 time, however, the Liverpool manager may place greater value on a point and a first clean sheet of the Premier League season than a below-par display he said stemmed from the fact his team \u201ccouldn\u2019t get rid of the hectic\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/17/liverpool-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">David de Gea ensures Manchester United hold Liverpool in stalemate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Liverpool, lacking several key components in central midfield, were a reflection of their goalkeeper Loris Karius \u2013 unconvincing but unscathed. The German goalkeeper twice fluffed his lines but was reprieved by refereeing decisions against Zlatan Ibrahimovic on both occasions. The home side\u2019s main flaw was a lack of intelligence in possession, according to Klopp, and his selection issues did provide an explanation despite his lack of interest in excuses.</p> <p>The first game to be played under the floodlights of the revamped Anfield turned the spotlight on Liverpool\u2019s strength in depth for the first time this term. Klopp had no cause to change his central midfield trio of Adam Lallana, Jordan Henderson and Georginio Wijnaldum, with the former Southampton man enjoying the finest spell of his Anfield career, the club captain flourishing in the holding role, where he had been developing by the game, and the \u00a325m summer signing from Newcastle United settling instantly. They have enhanced Liverpool\u2019s threat and ability to harry opponents according to their manager\u2019s wishes, but injury deprived Klopp of two thirds of his preferred midfield and it had a major bearing on Liverpool\u2019s performance.</p> <p>Only when Lallana replaced Daniel Sturridge in the second half and Roberto Firmino shifted into the central striking position did Anfield catch a glimpse of the team\u2019s potential.</p> <p>For the first time in the Premier League, Liverpool started without Lallana-Henderson-Wijnaldum in the centre. Lallana was only deemed fit enough for the substitutes\u2019 bench having suffered a groin injury in the win at Swansea City before the international break and trained for two days. Wijnaldum did not get that far, with the hip injury picked up in Holland\u2019s World Cup-qualifying defeat by France ruling him out completely.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/17/paul-pogba-manchester-united-liverpool-premier-league\">Manchester United\u2019s Paul Pogba fails to live up to price tag in draw at Liverpool</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The disruption resulted in Emre Can making his first start of the campaign in place of Lallana and Philippe Coutinho dropping into the Dutchman\u2019s position to the left of Henderson, but was not confined to personnel. There was a lack of energy, adventure and understanding at the heart of the Liverpool team and that, more than any stifling tactics from Mourinho, was responsible for the flattest of the three league fixtures at Anfield.</p> <p>Dropping Coutinho into the deeper role made sense in so much as that positional change had ignited Liverpool\u2019s display when the Brazilian replaced the injured Lallana at Swansea. A reduction in the home side\u2019s menace and movement was inevitable with their creative force 50 yards further away from David de Gea\u2019s goal, but the extent of its impact clearly shocked and enraged Klopp. His furious instructions to his disjointed midfield was the stand-out feature of an otherwise incident-free first half, although it was Can on the receiving end of most of the managerial volleys.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/17/jose-mourinho-liverpool-anfield-manchester-united-jurgen-klopp\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho criticises cautious Liverpool after bore draw at Anfield</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The German international\u2019s only other start this season had come in the EFL Cup <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/aug/23/burton-albion-liverpool-efl-cup-second-round-live\">tie at Burton Albion</a> on 23 August, when he aggravated an ankle injury. Rusty would be the kindest description of his return to the side as Can lost possession and challenges too easily against Marouane Fellaini and Ashley Young, while his reluctance to break forward prompted Klopp\u2019s first outburst in his compatriot\u2019s direction.</p> <p>Coutinho confirmed he is not averse to dog\u2019s work when he chased Antonio Valencia across the pitch and roused an already fired up Anfield with a precise tackle on the United right-back. Otherwise, with Henderson\u2019s distribution below-par, Coutinho unable to compensate for Wijnaldum\u2019s ability to protect the Liverpool defence when United countered and Can toiling, there was a distinct lack of cohesion to the home team. Even Zeljko Buvac, Klopp\u2019s first assistant coach, made a rare appearance in the technical area to cajole an improvement from the Liverpool midfield.</p> <p>Naturally, midfield problems had a knock-on effect for the isolated Sturridge, Sadio Man\u00e9 and Firmino. Lallana\u2019s arrival came moments after Can almost rectified his contribution with a low shot that brought a superb save from De Gea and with the England international injecting urgency, Coutinho also forced a stunning stop from the United keeper from distance. \u201cWe had a few good moments but not enough to deserve the win,\u201d Klopp said.</p>",

Daesh [an Arabic acronym for Isis] are mostly moving around on motorbike and have small and heavy guns. The planes started bombing Mosul around one in the morning today, and they are in the sky constantly and occasionally striking targets. I would say the airstrikes are very precise but around 10% of casualties, in my estimate, are civilians. </p> <p>Daesh are moving into civilian houses and mixing with the population. For example Daesh has placed a large depot of IEDs in a house next to my cousin\u2019s. I begged him to leave his house and bring his family to stay with me, as the house could be targeted by coalition. He refused and said [he accepts] whatever destiny brings. </p> <p>People have had enough in Mosul. The majority want Daesh to go as soon as possible and would like to see the Iraqi army and peshmerga to enter the city. </p> <p>We have seen too many beheadings, people being drowned in cafes, thrown from buildings, etc. People have even offered to sacrifice animals if they see Daesh [go[ and get rid of them. I myself saw a man thrown off a building near the governor\u2019s office around three months ago. I could not sleep for a week afterwards. </p> <p>It\u2019s difficult for civilians to leave the city because a ditch has been dug around many neighborhoods, especially east of the city.

Their presence indicates that US troops, while not formally in a combat role, are on the frontlines and willing to use substantial airpower on Iraq\u2019s second city.</p> <p>The US command\u2019s acknowledgment of their presence is a departure from previous battles in two years\u2019 worth of war against Isis. Members of Congress have criticised the Pentagon for relaying airstrike spotting through coordination cells far from the fight, including in an operations centre in the Iraqi Kurdish capital of Erbil.</p> <p>Having US troops spotting airstrikes is both the latest departure from Barack Obama\u2019s pledge against having \u201cboots on the ground\u201d and an effort at ensuring greater specificity and lethality against Isis targets in the city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/mosul-zip/giv-1406yxT7GAC08tV7/\" data-alt=\"mosul\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/mosul-zip/giv-1406yxT7GAC08tV7/\">mosul</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cJTACs are the difference between precision bombing and area bombing,\u201d said Christopher Harmer, a former US Navy pilot who said their presence indicated the US is willing to \u201cincur casualties\u201d in Mosul.</p> <p>\u201cWith JTACs, you can select individual targets in real time and accurately strike them. Without JTACs, you can only bomb a general area and hope for success.\u201d</p> <p>The UK and France are also believed to have their own special forces involved in retaking Mosul. Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/exploding-drone-sent-by-isis-allies-kills-and-wounds-troops-in-iraq-report\">two French special operations forces training peshmerga were seriously injured</a> by abooby-trapped Isis drone that exploded after crashing near them in Dohuk, 46 miles (75km) north of the city.</p> <p>While it is unclear what specifically the UK and French contributions to the battle are, it is believed British special forces will also aid in calling in airstrikes. France has sent approximately 150 troops to operate four 155mm Caeser howitzers as part of its Task Force Wagram. The French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, carrying 24 Rafale combat planes, is also in the eastern Mediterranean to support the war.</p> <p>As the long-anticipated battle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/iraqi-forces-begin-assault-on-isis-stronghold-mosul\">began on Monday</a>, US warplanes launched substantial bombing runs on positions around Mosul. The US reported attacking three units of Isis fighters, two staging areas for their operations, 12 Isis rally points and even a bridge. Six tunnel entrances, an anti-artillery system, four generators powering communications-signal towers and four mortar systems were destroyed, according to the US military.</p> <p>In a sign that the coalition is bracing for a gruelling campaign, Townsend said the fight was likely to last \u201cweeks, possibly longer\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/17/us-military-troops-on-ground-mosul-iraq-isis-obama\">Mosul offensive: officials confirm US troops are on the ground</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T19:28:25.114Z\">at 8.28pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5804e26ee4b08feb7300a4bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T14:49:38.364Z\">3.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Fawaz Ali, an engineer from Mosul, who now lives in Turkey, told my colleague Mona Mahmood that his family remaining in the Iraqi city are afraid they may face repercussions from the Shia militias fighting to oust Islamic State.

In a rare press conference in London he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We oppose any kind of involvement by the Shia militias.

We tracked what happened on the internet and the amount of traffic for extremist websites and recruitment shot up by 150%.</p> <p>If they go into Mosul which is many times larger than Falluja I would expect the negative reaction will be tremendous and if there are mass killings, it could end up being a bonanza for violent extremists, and recruitment for Daesh. It could add fuel to the sectarian fires raging in the region and so we have urged the Iraqi government not to use the Shia militias. That is the greatest danger that we see. We actually told them to disband them, and yet they have not. They are being managed by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. They are brutal.</p> </blockquote> <p>He added that although there had been reassurances from the Iraqi government about the deployment of Shia militias, he was not sure the Iraqi government was fully in control. He said the Iranians played a role, the Revolutionary Guards played a role, and sometimes the militias acted independently of the government. He said he supported the attack on Mosul, adding: \u201cWe support any objective which is to destroy al-Qaida absolutely.\u201d</p> <p>But he did not propose the Saudis should play a role in the reconstruction of Mosul if it is liberated.

He recently fled Mosul and now lives in Sulaimaniya.<em><br></em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m in Sulaimaniya, counting the days to get back home. It has been a real hardship since I left Mosul seven months ago and fled to Turkey with my family. I stayed in Turkey for 15 days and then returned to Sulaimaniya as I could not cope with expensive life in Turkey. It was so hard to stay in Telafer after Isis militants took over of Mosul. I\u2019m a government employee and did not get a salary for more than a year and a half \u2013 how can I feed my five kids? </p> <p>If I had stayed in Mosul my family would have died, there was no work, no freedom, no life. The strict rules of Isis were a nightmare that I challenge any human being to be able to accept them. </p> <p>I still have three brothers in Mosul with their families, they said that the battle is still at the suburbs of Mosul. They could not flee because they could not afford the cost of traveling to Turkey. Besides it is very risky, if Isis militants get hold of any one fleeing, they will execute him immediately. I paid more than $2,000 to flee with the help of a smuggler who took us to Syria and then to Turkey.</p> <p>When Isis first came, they said they came just to change the situation for the interest of Mosul civilians who suffered a great deal of injustice from the Iraqi army. Something that made all the people happy to have them and look at them as saviours from the devil, but it turned that was not right and they began to impose their hardline Islamic doctrine on people. They made our life a complete hell.</p> <p>When I had to flee I could not take anything with me and thought it was better to let my neighbour stay in my house. At least he would guard it and Isis would not confiscate it. I will get back to Mosul as soon as it is liberated. Only God knows how long the battle will last because Isis won\u2019t give up easily. They have been reinforcing their forces to be ready for the attack. They will not hand over Mosul easily, which is one of their main fortresses in Iraq.</p> <p>I will get back to my home, even if Shia militia take the city as they did in other Sunni-liberated areas in Iraq. I do not care any more, I prefer to die in my home and not to be a refugee. I will never repeat this mistake again. </p> <p>I live with my sister in Sulaimaniyia now and we are really struggling to provide the daily basics for the kids. I have run out of all my savings and am borrowing money from sister all the time.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T14:04:29.646Z\">at 3.04pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5804cea7e4b04312166ed772\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T13:27:52.539Z\">2.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The UN refugee agency has called on warring parties in Iraq to spare the lives of civilians and not to use them as hostages or human shields, the Associated Press reports.<br></p> <p>Speaking to reporters in Baghdad, the UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, says he raised the issue of the protection of civilians with the Iraqi government and received \u201cstrongest assurances\u201d from the prime minister, Haider al-Abadi.<br></p> <p>Grandi underlined that protection for civilians \u201cwill be indispensable for the future of Iraq, for the future in which the people of Iraq live together and build a prosperous country.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce49c8696a1791417b52292dc67b576d6e68d3f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce49c8696a1791417b52292dc67b576d6e68d3f1/542_164_4023_2414/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Filippo Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,  speaks with the media in Baghdad, where he called on warring parties in Iraq to spare the lives of civilians\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Filippo Grandi, the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, speaks to the media in Baghdad, where he called on warring parties in Iraq to spare the lives of civilians</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hadi Mizban/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T14:06:47.763Z\">at 3.06pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5804cd61e4b04312166ed768\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T13:14:05.517Z\">2.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Isis says it has counterattacked with suicide bombers</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>An Islamic State news agency says the group has launched a series of suicide attacks targeting Kurdish forces leading the assault on Mosul. </p> <p>The Aamaq news agency is claiming eight suicide attacks against Kurdish peshmerga and says Isis destroyed two Humvees belonging to the Kurdish forces and Shia militias east of the city on Monday, according to an Associated Press report.<br></p> <p>The update comes as US Army Maj.

She said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the campaign to retake Mosul is a success, it would not only be a massive military defeat for IS but more importantly it would be massive blow to its ideological stance. Mosul symbolises the heart of the caliphate for the group and removing this would mark the beginning of the end for a group who is already struggling for survival. The group is no longer the powerhouse that it once appeared and is in fact struggling not only to gain support but to keep the support in place that it currently has. </p> <p>The international community needs to be extremely careful in how it approaches this campaign, keeping in mind that this is not just a fight for territory, but also a fight for the hearts and minds of those who are the most fragile \u2013 the citizens of Iraq. In order for this to be a success there cannot be a repeat of the debacle that followed the 2003 invasion where the US-led coalition were essentially understaffed and unplanned for the scope of instability that would emerge across Iraq. For IS this would almost certainly be the hardest blow and would make it almost impossible for them to continue their propaganda campaign built around their creation of the caliphate. </p> <p>If Mosul were to be retaken by the allied coalition, a desperate IS may increase its levels of suicide attacks and other such methods to try to show its strength, but in reality the group is already weakened and has made little real ground in the last year. If anything they have been pushed back to levels not seen since its rapid emergence in 2014. It may be the beginning of the end for IS as we know them.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T12:02:35.659Z\">at 1.02pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5804a89ee4b047a4eaafd58c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T10:41:00.751Z\">11.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Smoke is rising over Mosul from the artillery and mortar fire and airstrikes from the US-led coalition backing Iraqi and irregular forces\u2019 assault.

  "<p>Nobody announces anything on a Sunday afternoon. Nobody except Rockstar, of course. </p> <p>The publisher behind the multimillion selling Grand Theft Auto series put out one tweet on the afternoon of 16 October \u2013 a refreshed version of its own logo, on a red background. That was it. So far the message has been retweeted 110,000 times. </p> <p>This is not how the games industry tends to hype its forthcoming announcements. Big companies pump millions of dollars into events like E3 or Gamescom to ensure a huge audience for their meticulously designed teaser trailers. They set up hashtags, get prominent YouTubers onboard, roll out pan-global campaigns from 24-hour command centres, then obsess over every column inch of coverage. Rockstar changed its logo colour. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/787639249864630273\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/BklXMlZ0UQ\">pic.twitter.com/BklXMlZ0UQ</a></p>&mdash; Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/787639249864630273\">October 16, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>What\u2019s this all about? Well, it\u2019s about Red Dead Redemption. </p> <p>The publisher\u2019s 2010 western epic was a massive critical and commercial hit, bringing the open-world dynamic of GTA to the American frontier of 1911. With a wizened, Eastwood-esque hero in the shape of John Marston, a bloody revenge narrative and an elegiac tone, the game presented a vision of the wild west every bit as compelling, brutish and beautiful as anything from Leone or Peckinpah. Now it appears, a new title is coming.<br></p> <p>But no one is quite sure what. A following tweet, posted 24 hours later, showed seven figures silhouetted against a huge orange sun \u2013 seemingly referencing The Magnificent Seven; a timely decision considering the recent movie remake. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/788001608827281408\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/iuwxwyL2cX\">pic.twitter.com/iuwxwyL2cX</a></p>&mdash; Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/788001608827281408\">October 17, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>It\u2019s totally unclear whether we should expect a HD remake of the original game (and/or its forbearer, Red Dead Revolver), a sequel or a prequel. Most fans are expecting the latter option, an earlier tale from the adventures of Marsten. Many have also seen <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/this-is-the-map-you-ll-be-playing-in-red-dead-redemption-2-1319101\">a leaked map of the game</a>, purporting to be the setting for the prequel \u2013 an area of land just to the east of Red Dead Redemption\u2019s territory. But none of this has been confirmed. Because Rockstar doesn\u2019t do confirmations. </p> <p>It doesn\u2019t need to. Within an hour of the first tweet, there was already news coverage of the logo alteration on every major gaming and tech site on the web, and with the second message, it has turned into a rolling story. A trailer is expected to follow, perhaps sometime this week, with a launch possible in October. Rockstar will reveal more when the company is good and ready.</p> <p>It\u2019s a fascinating story in this era of corporate messaging desperation; when the prevailing wisdom is, hit every platform hard. Rockstar doesn\u2019t attend big industry events like E3, Gamescom, Pax or EGX, and it doesn\u2019t align its announcements with the usual beats of the industry year. For Grand Theft Auto V, a tweet with just \u201c#GTAV\u201d arrived on 25 October, 2011, followed by a trailer a week later. That game went on to sell over 65m copies. Red Dead is smaller fry with sales of around 15m, but it\u2019s been so long since we heard anything from Rockstar, the company could probably have announced a follow-up to its under-appreciated 2006 release Table Tennis and it would have created a storm.</p> <p>As it is Red Dead is seen by some as Rockstar\u2019s true masterpiece, a less corrosive, less bombastic proposition than GTA, suffused in the mythology and slower pace of the western. Everyone was expecting some kind of follow-up this year, but the publisher has left it late to say anything \u2013 and really it still hasn\u2019t said anything. It must have known, however, the massive interest its two tweets would make, surely ruling out a mere HD update. Even Rockstar couldn\u2019t get away with that. </p> <p>The arch manipulator of video game fandom knows what it is doing. The slowest of slow burn releases. Let the forums and social media do the heavy lifting. If the game is as clever as its understated \u201cannouncement\u201d it will surely live up to the anti-hype.</p>",
  "<p>Fourteen children and adolescents arrived in south London today from the camp in Calais which is to be demolished, possibly as soon as next week. As a fraction of the eligible children in the \u201cJungle\u201d camp <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/17/rowan-williams-stop-foot-dragging-over-calais-child-refugees\" title=\"\">it is negligible</a>. There may be as many as a thousand children there who deserve to come to Britain and who are legally entitled to do so. As a fraction of the 88,000 child refugees adrift in Europe, 14 is infinitesimal. Yet by the standards of the British government, these 14 children represent a heroic humanitarian effort. There may ultimately be as many as 300 admitted, a&#xa0;figure that the home secretary, Amber Rudd, described as \u201ca good result\u201d.</p> <p>It is a \u201cgood result\u201d only from a perspective of remarkable smugness or meanness. The smugness would marvel at the fact that we have taken any refugees in at all when we have so successfully defied our moral and indeed legal obligations for so long. The meanness is both stingy and frightened. Britain is the sixth biggest economy in the world \u2013 at least for the moment \u2013 and it is absurd to suggest that we could not absorb more than 300 children. Even David Cameron promised last autumn that we could welcome as many as 20,000 over five years from Syria. And Syria is only one of the ravaged countries from which children now try to escape, carrying with them little but the hopes and prayers of the families they leave behind.</p> <p>Obviously, Britain cannot on its own solve the global refugee crisis. Nor has the government been stingy in supporting refugees who are prepared to stay away from here and languish in third countries. But this does not excuse the tactics of delay and obfuscation that have characterised the reactions of both the French and British governments right up until the moment when the destruction of the Calais refugee camp is imminent. This imposing record of resolute inaction suggests that the authorities on both sides of the channel really just want the refugees to disappear, and don\u2019t care too much about how this happens, so long as it is not embarrassing.</p> <p>It is our duty, then, to shame these two governments, and to hold up the threatened humanity of these refugees.</p> <p>Successive governments have been afraid of Ukip, and of the tabloid press, to the degree that they have attempted to define suffering out of existence through bureaucratic procedures. Months can be spent in registration and pointless inquiries. It is all deliberately and literally dehumanising. Against this, the direct actions&#xa0;of thousands of ordinary citizens (and some celebrities) express unmediated&#xa0;solidarity.</p> <p>Much of the reaction has been driven by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/12/faith-leaders-refugee-traffickers\" title=\"\">churches and Christian organisations</a>, who deserve credit for it. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, while he has expressed sympathy for the anxiety that some people feel about immigration, has also housed a refugee family in the grounds of his own palace. One of the most effective encouragements to the government came&#xa0;from Citizens UK, a collection of largely&#xa0;faith-based community groups, which managed to sue the government. About&#xa0;12,000 evangelical Christian families have offered to foster refugee children.</p> <p>All of the children so far rescued have come in under the provisions of the <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:180:0031:0059:EN:PDF\" title=\"\">Dublin III</a> agreement, which represents the absolute bare minimum that any government can do to recognise the humanity and human rights of refugees: children who have close family in this country may enter to be looked after by their relatives. But the plight of the orphans, the children who have no family at all, must surely be worse. They are or ought to be covered by the Dubs amendment, sponsored by a survivor of the Kindertransport. The&#xa0;next step must be to pressure the government to live up to its obligations under Dubs as well as Dublin. That might rescue as many as 3,000 children: a few grains of sand from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/17/world-will-not-face-up-to-refugee-crisis-un-obama\" title=\"\">a desert of despair</a>, but then, as the Jewish saying has it, to rescue one life is to rescue a whole world.</p>",

In the moment he went down, it was tough and, from our position, it was difficult to see what had happened. But it wasn\u2019t a big issue. It was a big knock, a heavy knock in his leg, but we hope it\u2019s not a big problem for the next week.\u201d</p> <p>Pochettino replaced Alderweireld with Dier at West Brom, after the player who he has converted into a defensive midfielder had started on the bench. Victor Wanyama has established himself as Pochettino\u2019s first choice in the holding-midfield role and the manager\u2019s switch to a 4\u20111\u20114\u20111 formation appears to have made it difficult for him to start Dier and Wanyama in midfield.</p> <p>Kevin Wimmer, who stepped into the centre of defence last season when Vertonghen was injured, will be bitterly disappointed if Pochettino does prefer Dier. Wimmer has made only one appearance for Tottenham this season \u2013 in the EFL Cup win against Gillingham. But Pochettino, who indicated that a game of this magnitude would come too soon for the 18-year-old centre-half Cameron Carter-Vickers, said that he had faith in Dier.</p> <p>\u201cThe important thing is we trust in him,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cIt\u2019s not important the position he will play. Midfield, centre-back or full-back \u2013 we believe and trust in him. We trust him as a person and his skills. For me, Eric is a player who can develop his game in different positions.\u201d</p> <p>Pochettino continues to be without the striker Harry Kane because of ankle ligament damage and, at various times this season, he has missed other key players \u2013 chief among them, the midfielder Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. But Tottenham have coped because, Pochettino believes , they have a deeper and sturdier squad.</p> <p>\u201cInjuries can always happen,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cAlways, the squad is important \u2013 25 players.

He was the rare detainee who presented himself to local authorities for questioning after 9/11. That fateful decision saw him transferred to US custody, first in Afghanistan, and then at Guant\u00e1namo. At the facility, his 2002 treatment was among the most abusive that has come to light. </p> <p>Guant\u00e1namo interrogators and detention personnel told Slahi that they had visions of Slahi dead. Unless Slahi cooperated with interrogators, they threatened to bring his mother to Guant\u00e1namo, which the detainee understood as a rape threat. They contorted his body into painful positions, deprived him of sleep and bombarded him with noise, and beat him after stuffing ice into his clothing during a harrowing night-time boat trip through the bay. The US defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, personally approved Slahi\u2019s interrogation regimen, which was overseen by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/18/american-police-brutality-chicago-guantanamo\">Chicago police detective</a>. </p> <p>Slahi wrote in his memoir that the torture made him willing to say whatever his tormentors desired, regardless of its truth. \u201cAs long as you are willing to buy, I am selling,\u201d he wrote. </p> <p>Afterwards, Slahi became a docile detainee, even striking up friendships with his guards. He wrote that he hoped to maintain those friendships in the event of his freedom. For much of the past decade, he had lived in a bungalow setting at Guant\u00e1namo, where he was permitted television and even gardening privileges. </p> <p>Over the years, Slahi sharpened his English by handwriting an account of his experiences at Guant\u00e1namo, which his attorneys helped him publish \u2013 and declassify, as the US military considers even detainees\u2019 personal memories to be classified information.

While Kyrgios is unsure, he has said that he does not know how to exist without tennis. It is both a blessing and a curse that he is a flawed genius with a racket in his right hand.</p> <p>It is easy to understand why the ATP, almost acting out of a duty of care, has banned and fined Kyrgios until 15 January for his conduct in his 6-3, 6-1 loss against Zverev. The lack of effort Kyrgios put into his serve and groundstrokes could be seen as a cry for help and given that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/06/nick-kyrgios-fine-wimbledon-umpire-warning\" title=\"\">he has been accused of tanking in the past</a>, the ATP had no choice but to act. The decision was not remotely controversial.</p> <p>For his part, Kyrgios apologised on Monday and there are indications that he will accept professional advice, with the ATP saying that his suspension will end on 7 November if he accepts the help of a sports psychologist. That would be a step in the right direction.</p> <p>Some of Kyrgios\u2019s critics see a spoilt brat who has been given too much too soon. Some of his antics have been in dismal taste, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/aug/13/nick-kyrgios-row-stan-wawrinka-montreal-tennis-need-grow-up\" title=\"\">slur he aimed at Stan Wawrinka and the Swiss player\u2019s girlfriend, Donna Vekic</a>, last year. Others have been those of a young man melting in the spotlight.</p> <p>Tennis is mentally punishing. All alone on the court, watched by thousands but unable to lean on any of them in the toughest moments, many players suffer and wilt in the heat of battle. No one is immune, even the very best. Novak Djokovic has slumped since completing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/05/french-open-2016-final-novak-djokovic-beats-andy-murray\" title=\"\">the career slam at the French Open in June</a>, a crucial dip in intensity denting the world No1\u2019s aura in the past few months. Who wants it more? It sounds like a cliche but it applies here. Sometimes, the top players sneak over the line thanks to their stubbornness.</p> <p>Kyrgios looks ill-equipped to succeed in such a demanding environment, hopping from one country to the next for yet another tournament, and he has often sounded racked by self-doubt while discussing whether he likes tennis.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a doubt that if I wanted to win grand slams, I would commit,\u201d he told the New York Times before the US Open. \u201cI\u2019d train two times a day, I\u2019d go to the gym every day, I\u2019d stretch, I\u2019d do rehab, I\u2019d eat right. But I don\u2019t know what I want at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>What does Kyrgios actually want? This is a professional athlete who warmed up for his defeat to Andy Murray at Wimbledon by playing computer games before admitting that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/jul/04/nick-kyrgios-meltodwn-andy-murray\" title=\"\">his performance was pathetic</a>. He called himself soft. His words hinted at a contradiction: his preparations were slack, but it was possible to detect disgust at the way he rolled over against Murray, which at least suggested that he does take pride in his output on the court.</p> <p>The ATP\u2019s tough love could be a turning point for Kyrgios. Only last week, however, he was rubbishing the idea that he would ever employ a coach who might be able to improve his focus. That, after all, does sound a lot like hard work.</p> <p>But a steadying influence is what Kyrgios needs and the situation is likely to become chronic without one. Maybe it makes no difference. Maybe tennis is not for him. Whatever path Kyrgios chooses, all we can do is hope that he does not end up with regrets.</p>",

Vice chairman Stanley Fischer said i<strong><a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/fischer20161017a.htm\">n a speech in New York</a></strong> there were three reasons to be concerned about low rates:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First, and most worrying, is the possibility that low long-term interest rates are a signal that the economy\u2019s long-run growth prospects are dim...A second concern is that low interest rates make the economy more vulnerable to adverse shocks that can put it in a recession...And the third concern is that low interest rates may also threaten financial stability as some investors reach for yield and compressed net interest margins make it harder for some financial institutions to build up capital buffers...</p> <p>Those are three powerful reasons to prefer interest rates that are higher than current rates. But, of course, Fed interest rates are kept very low at the moment because of the need to maintain aggregate demand at levels that will support the attainment of our dual policy goals of maximum sustainable employment and price stability, defined as the rate of inflation in the price level of personal consumption expenditures.. being at our target level of 2 percent.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said there were a variety of factors holding down interest rates - including slow economic growth, low investment, a slowdown in the global economy - and they may continue to go so for some time.</p> <p>But he added economic policy could help offset these factors, and boost the economy\u2019s growth potential:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While there is disagreement about what the most effective policies would be, some combination of more encouragement for private investment, improved public infrastructure, better education, and more effective regulation is likely to promote faster growth of productivity and living standards--and also to reduce the probability that the economy and, particularly, the central bank will in the future have to contend with the effective lower bound.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T17:09:00.287Z\">at 6.09pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5804f9b8e4b0cd26ff71e06f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T16:21:50.588Z\">5.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greek protestors as inspectors arrive</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over in Greece thousands of leftwing protestors are demonstrating outside the Athens parliament as pressure mounts on the government to revoke unpopular reforms demanded by the country\u201ds creditors.

Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Markets have started the week on a softer note with stocks and oil lower, yields streaking higher and havens including gold and the Japanese yen in demand.</p> <p>Reports of divisions between Chancellor Philip Hammond and the rest of Theresa May\u2019s cabinet over Brexit have caused investors to sell UK assets across the board.

But he said objections to migration were crucial to the failure of the talks\u2019 progress. </p> <p>Cable said: \u201cI and other ministers would come back and say, \u2018the Indians want improved access on Mode 4,\u2019 and the answer would be, \u2018Not on your nelly, we\u2019re not doing anything on this.\u2019 The message would go back to the EU that the British were not willing to budge.\u201d He added: \u201cThey [the Home Office] were very obstructive.\u201d</p> <p>The former business secretary said post-Brexit Britain would continue to struggle to complete a trade deal with India, unless May was willing to take a more flexible approach on immigration. He said: \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about trade in services rather than trade in goods, it involves people moving around \u2013 but they\u2019re pathologically opposed to people moving around.\u201d</p> <p>Some pro-Brexit ministers, including the international development secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/23/priti-patel-foreign-aid-world-poverty\">Priti Patel</a>, suggested during the referendum campaign that extricating Britain from the EU could eventually result in higher levels of migration from non-EU countries, including India.

In time, the idea shifted and the channel became more about painting a negative picture of the west.</p> <p>The channel was rebranded to distance itself from the Kremlin and from the very idea of Russianness, and launched amid pomp in Britain and the US, accompanied by advertising campaigns urging people to \u201cQuestion more\u201d and positioning itself as an alternative to the mainstream media. </p> <p>In 2013, at the opening of RT\u2019s new studios, Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, told Simonyan that the aim of the channel had been \u201cto break the Anglo-Saxon monopoly on global information streams\u201d. The mission had been completed successfully, Putin said.</p> <p>Often, questioning more meant wallowing in conspiracy theory, giving airtime to 9/11 \u201ctruthers\u201d and other basement bloggers. Away from the lunatic fringes, the channel often covered the same kind of stories in Britain and the US as the Guardian might. It focused on injustice and official malpractice, on social tensions and political demonstrations. Especially in the US, the channel built up a following for touching the kind of issues that many mainstream networks did not.</p> <p>The channel typically invites studio guests who endorse the Kremlin\u2019s anti-US views. Guests have included Jeremy Corbyn, Ken Livingstone and George Galloway. </p> <p>It ran a chatshow hosted by the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, and it lured the veteran US broadcaster Larry King to the channel to make a series of shows. While making marquee signings to boost its mainstream credibility, the channel also ran shows such as The Truthseeker, which claimed \u201cevery single terrorist attack in US history was a false flag operation\u201d.</p> <p>During the annexation of Crimea, RT did not report on the Russian soldiers deployed on the peninsula, and complained about \u201cmisinformation\u201d from western media outlets, which said that Russian forces were present. </p> <p>Putin himself later admitted as much, but the channel\u2019s skewed coverage of events in Russia\u2019s backyard also gained a small but devoted following abroad.

In the Commons <strong>Diane Abbott</strong>, the shadow home secretary, said this meant Rudd was open to \u201caccusations of misleading the committee\u201d. But Rudd said that Goddard strongly denied the allegations and that it would have been wrong for Rudd to have raised them with MPs. She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was asked [at the select committee] why Dame Lowell had gone. Dame Lowell had not spoken to me about her reasons, so I relied on the letter she had sent to the committee. In her letter she said she was lonely and felt that she could not deliver and that was why she stepped down. Dame Lowell has strongly refuted the allegations about her, and the only way we could understand properly why she resigned would be to hear from Dame Lowell herself. To echo any further allegations that are now likely to be the subject of legal dispute would have been entirely inappropriate. </p> </blockquote> <p>In response the Labour MP<strong> Lisa Nandy,</strong> who tabled the urgent question that led to Rudd addressing MPs, said Rudd\u2019s explanation was unsatisfactory. Nandy said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This inquiry was established to shine a spotlight on institutions characterized by a culture of secrecy, denial and cover-up in which child abusers were able to operate in plain sight without challenge or consequence.

They are:</p> <ul> <li>Cultural - examining attitudes, behaviours and values within institutions. </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Structural - looking at the legislative, governance and organisational frameworks within and between institutions. </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Financial - considering the financial, funding and resource arrangements for institutions and services. </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Professional and political - focusing on leadership, professional and practice issues for those working or volunteering in relevant institutions. </li> </ul> <p>Jay said a traditional public inquiry approach to the allegations would fail.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I believe that the concerns that our terms of reference cannot be delivered are founded on an assumption that we must seek to replicate a traditional public inquiry in respect of each of the thousands of institutions that fall within our remit. We will do so for some, but we would never finish if we did it for all.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jay ordered a review of how the inquiry operates when she took over as chair in August. She said today her review was not yet complete, and that it would be finished by the end of November.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today is about outlining the strategy I intend to pursue to make the inquiry manageable and deliverable in a specified timescale. If we were to pursue the traditional public hearing model that people associate with inquiries of this kind to the thousands and thousands of institutions in England and Wales, we would fail, so there\u2019s no possibility that we can do that.</p> </blockquote> <p>She said the four themes were \u201cabsolutely central to looking at institutions and their failings in the past, if any exist\u201d and that the inquiry would be holding public hearings related to the four themes. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For example, we might ask certain council leaders or police and crime commissioners to account publicly for what they\u2019ve done in relation to the subject of child sexual abuse within their areas of responsibility.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if her announcement was reducing the scope and scale of the inquiry, she replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s certainly not reducing the terms of reference in the inquiry. We have no intention to propose that any aspect of the terms of reference is dropped. But we do intend to use different models and ways of working to deliver the terms of reference. In that respect we consider that we can complete a significant amount of the inquiry\u2019s work by the end of 2020.</p> </blockquote> <p>She said no decisions have been made about the 13 investigations. Asked if some of them could be cut, she said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It really is impossible for me to say just now because it is quite a complex matter and we need to take the views of core participants and other relevant parties into account.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ff666de51f68321cb486492f5c40b2a6786ce4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ff666de51f68321cb486492f5c40b2a6786ce4b/0_79_2889_1734/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Professor Alexis Jay.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Professor Alexis Jay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Higgens/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5804ee0de4b0cd26ff71e038\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T15:29:23.773Z\">4.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Professor Alexis Jay</strong>, the new chair of the child abuse inquiry, has told the BBC that she will not seek \u201cany reduction or restriction\u201d in its scope,<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37680906\"> the BBC reports.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5804eb73e4b005f21833a555\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rowena-mason\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T15:23:51.220Z\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">No 10 says it was not involved in decision to shut down Russia Today's UK bank accounts</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Two subjects dominated at the Downing Street afternoon lobby briefing.

He is arguing like an accountant seeing the risk of everything rather than the opportunity.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>This morning <strong>Jeremy Hunt,</strong> the health secretary, was on the Today programme talking about maternity care and he got the chance. His response was ingenious (and not entirely wrong.) Cabinet ministers should be having vigorous arguments, he said. When it was put to him that this infighting was \u201cnot ideal\u201d, Hunt replied.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the contrary. If we weren\u2019t having lively debates in cabinet, you would be saying \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to cabinet government, why aren\u2019t you going through incredibly thoroughly all the different arguments to make sure we end up with the right decision?\u201d </p> <p>The British people changed the history of our country on the 23 June. The cabinet is absolutely united that we must respect that decision.</p> <p>But we need to then go through, very thoroughly and carefully, all the different options because we\u2019ve got to have a new immigration policy, a new trade policy, a new economic policy ....</p> </blockquote> <p>Hunt also rejected the suggestion that Hammond was trying to undermine Brexit. When this was put to him, he replied.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This isn\u2019t the first time in the history of government where you read reports in the newspapers that may not actually reflect what\u2019s happened. All I would say is that you would expect lively debates to be happening in government because we are going to get the right solution in terms of securing our borders, but also the right solution economically. </p> </blockquote> <p>Hunt is right to say ministers should be arguing through the policy options behind closed doors. That happens all the time in government. But what is significant about this row is that it has spilt out onto the front pages of the newspapers. When ministers start briefing against each other to the media, it becomes harder for them to act collectively when they do reach an agreed position.</p> <p>I will be covering more developments on this as the day goes on.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/17/maternity-wards-in-england-to-be-rated-by-safety-record\">Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, gives a speech setting out plans to make maternity units safer.</a></p> <p><em>9.45am: </em>The court hearing about whether the government is entitled to invoke article 50 starting the EU withdrawal process without a vote in parliament resumes.</p> <p><em>10am:</em> Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader and former deputy prime minister, gives a speech on the impact of Brexit on the food and drink industry.</p> <p><em>11am:</em> Number 10 lobby briefing.</p> <p><em>2.30pm:</em> Damian Green, the work and pensions secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> <p><em>4.30pm:</em> MPs begin a debate in Westminster Hall on Brexit.</p> <p><em>Afternoon:</em> Ukip\u2019s national executive committee meets to discuss the timetable for its leadership election.</p> <p>The chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond\">Philip Hammond</a>, has angered more pro-Brexit cabinet colleagues with his concerns over plans to swiftly restrict immigration from the EU, warning this could harm the economy, according to reports.</p> <p>As usual, I will be covering the breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

  "<h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Twnmhe948A\">MORE HYPER, HYPER THAN THIS</a>?</h2> <p>Twice a season in the north-west a celebration is held in which two football clubs honour the region\u2019s industrial past by creating clouds of toxic blather so vast that the area\u2019s seven million residents are cast into the dark and given a glimpse of what it was like to have lived in its muscularly glorious but poisonously polluted past. The first celebration this season has gone on a little longer than expected, mind, with guff from the buildup to Mega Magic Monday\u2019s hype-fest between Liverpool and Manchester United first being pumped out around the time the Premier League fixtures were drawn up in the summer. The other oddity is that some of the piffle being chuffed out has been far from toxic. In fact, when asked why Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was not everyone\u2019s favourite charismatic and trendy foreign manager any more, everyone\u2019s favourite charismatic and trendy foreign manager, J\u00fcrgen Klopp, leapt to his defence, giving the Portuguese the kind of special ego-stroke he hasn\u2019t been treated to by anyone for a long while.</p> <p>\u201cWho said this? Four people in Liverpool?\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/16/jurgen-klopp-jose-mourinho-liverpool-manchester-united\">barked Klopp</a>, sounding like he may be about to go off on a weird Beatles riff. \u201cIt\u2019s bull$hit. Rubbish. He has started badly at United? They won their first games. So now you are giving B grades for winning? He knows how successful football works. To like or not like the way he plays, why should he care? He has won [Big Cup] more times than I have played in it. That\u2019s how it is.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/16/jordan-henderson-liverpool-manchester-united-jose-mourinho-jurgen-klopp\">Jordan Henderson: \u2018Liverpool ready for whatever Manchester United throw at us\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As for Mourinho, he\u2019s been too busy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/16/jose-mourinho-i-am-not-to-blame-for-confusion-over-wayne-rooneys-role\">waffling on about Wayne Rooney</a> to say anything spiteful about Liverpool or Klopp, although like that kid at school who is wilfully bad at the yes-no game, his gums couldn\u2019t help but flap a wee bit on the subject of referee Anthony Taylor, who is obviously going to grant Liverpool 10 penalties just to show he isn\u2019t biased. \u201cI think Mr Taylor is a very good referee but because such pressure is being put on him I think it will be difficult for him to have a very good performance at Anfield,\u201d parped Mourinho, dangling a foot tantalisingly close to his cakehole. \u201cI don\u2019t really want to say too much more on the matter. I have my view but I have learned a lesson, if you want to call it that, by being punished so many times for my words about referees.\u201d Yes, predictably, Mourinho may well get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/16/manchester-united-jose-mourinho-fa-charge-referee-liverpool\">a slap on the tail from FA bods</a> for not being as good at learning lessons as he should be.</p> <p>In the meantime, Mourinho is busy trying to rebuild his captain\u2019s shattered confidence by blatantly telling porkies. \u201cAt Man Utd [Rooney] didn\u2019t lose [his] place. Not at all, for me, he\u2019s first-choice,\u201d honked Mourinho, scratching his brass neck and casually brushing off suggestions that he had indeed dropped him for the last three games. \u201cIf somebody confused him, it was not me. He can play everywhere \u2013 that\u2019s no problem.\u201d Klopp\u2019s biggest problem would appear to be whether to trust the hot-headed Emre Can to deputise for the cool-headed Georginio Wijnaldum, who is expected to miss out due to hip-knack. He will also be without groin-gah\u2019s Adam Lallana. It perhaps makes the predictions that Liverpool will give their rivals a gegen-lesson misplaced. And if Mourinho has done his homework and watched United\u2019s last two league wins at Anfield, he\u2019ll have seen that Louis van Gaal\u2019s more direct style, in which he instructed his defenders to not shy away from pumping the ball through the dark Anfield clouds towards Marouane Fellaini\u2019s noggin, won out. Perhaps Mourinho will see the light and follow suit. As for those seven million north-west residents, they\u2019d like to see the light too.

  "<p>A nuclear fusion world record has been set in the US, marking another step on the long road towards the unlocking of limitless clean energy. </p> <p>A team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) created the <a href=\"http://news.mit.edu/2016/alcator-c-mod-tokamak-nuclear-fusion-world-record-1014\">highest plasma pressure ever recorded</a>, using its Alcator C-Mod tokamak reactor. High pressures and extreme temperatures are vital in forcing atoms together to release huge amounts of energy. </p> <p>Nuclear fusion powers the sun and has long been touted as the ultimate solution to powering the world while halting climate change. But, as fusion sceptics often say, the reality has stubbornly remained a decade or two away for many years.</p> <p>Now MIT scientists have increased the record plasma pressure to more than two atmospheres, a 16% increase on the previous record set in 2005, at a temperature of 35 million C and lasting for two seconds. The breakthrough was presented at the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www-pub.iaea.org/iaeameetings/48315/26th-IAEA-Fusion-Energy-Conference\">International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s fusion summit in Japan on Monday</a>.</p> <p>Successful fusion means getting more energy out than is put in and this requires the combination of pressure, temperature and time to pass a critical value at which point the reaction becomes self-sustaining. This remains elusive but the MIT record shows that using very high magnetic fields to contain the plasma may be the most promising route to practical nuclear fusion reactors.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a remarkable achievement,\u201d said Dale Meade, former deputy director at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. \u201cThe record plasma pressure validates the high-magnetic-field approach as an attractive path to practical fusion energy.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Riccardo Betti, at the University of Rochester, New York, said: \u201cThis result confirms that the high pressures required for a burning plasma can be best achieved with high-magnetic-field tokamaks such as Alcator C-Mod.\u201d </p> <p>However, the world record was achieved on the last day of the MIT tokamak\u2019s operation, because funding from the US Department of Energy has now ended. The US, along with the EU, China, India, South Korea, Russia and Japan, are now ploughing their fusion funding into a <a href=\"https://www.iter.org/\">huge fusion reactor called ITER</a>. </p> <p>The giant, seven-storey-high tokamak is being built in southern France, with magnets <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/our-best-shot-at-nuclear-fusion-needs-magnets-weighing-1765662769\">weighing about the same as a Boeing 747</a>. The volume of ITER\u2019s tokamak will be 800 times bigger than the MIT vessel. ITER should be completed in 15-20 years and aims to deliver 500MW of power, about the same as today\u2019s large fission reactors. But the project has been hampered by delays.</p> <p>In the meantime, there are numerous private companies hoping to develop small scale nuclear fusion reactors. One is <a href=\"http://www.tokamakenergy.co.uk/\">Tokamak Energy</a>, a spin-off from the <a href=\"http://www.ccfe.ac.uk/\">UK\u2019s national fusion lab</a>, which uses high-temperature superconductors to create the magnetic field to contain the fusion plasma. The MIT tokamak used copper magnets, which require use more power.</p> <p>Dr David Kingham, chief executive of Tokamak Energy, said the important aspect of the MIT world record was that it showed extreme conditions can be created in small tokamaks: the volume of the MIT device is just one cubic metre. \u201cThe conventional view is that tokamaks have to be huge [like ITER] to be powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe MIT people disagree with that view, as do we.\u201d Kingham\u2019s target is for his company\u2019s compact reactors to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/24/nuclear-fusion-needs-a-wright-brothers-moment-says-firm-closing-on-the-target\">produce their first electricity by 2025</a>.</p> <p>Rival companies also backing small fusion reactors include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/16/has-lockheed-martin-really-made-a-breakthrough-on-nuclear-fusion\">Lockheed Martin\u2019s famous Skunk Works team</a>. In 2014 said they would produce a truck-sized fusion plant in a decade but attracted criticism for providing few details.</p> <p>Others in the field include <a href=\"http://www.trialphaenergy.com/\">Tri Alpha Energy</a>, which harnesses particle accelerator technology and is backed by Paul Allen, Microsoft\u2019s co-founder. <a href=\"http://www.generalfusion.com/\">General Fusion</a>, which uses a vortex of molten lead and lithium to contain the plasma, is backed by Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos. <a href=\"http://www.helionenergy.com/\">Helion Energy</a>, <a href=\"http://firstlightfusion.com/\">First Light Fusion</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.washington.edu/news/2014/10/08/uw-fusion-reactor-concept-could-be-cheaper-than-coal/\">University of Washington\u2019s Dynomak</a> are all also chasing the fusion dream.</p> <p>Prof Dennis Whyte, director of MIT\u2019s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, said small, non-tokamak approaches, though less familiar, could be promising: \u201cCompact, high-field tokamaks provide an exciting opportunity for accelerating fusion energy development, so that it\u2019s available soon enough to make a difference to problems like climate change and the future of clean energy, goals I think we all share.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s break time at a rehearsal space in south London and Katherine Parkinson keeps looking at the paper bag containing her very healthy lunch with a mixture of hunger and disappointment, a look familiar to any ravenous person who has ever opened the fridge to find only a piece of furred cheese. \u201cOne of the actors is on a regime,\u201d she says, an eyebrow just perceptibly raised. \u201cIt\u2019s intimidating me.\u201d She takes a gulp of green juice, then says, mainly to herself: \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</p> <p>She is two weeks into rehearsals for <a href=\"http://www.vaudeville-theatre.co.uk/Dead-Funny.html\">Dead Funny</a>, the comedy written and directed by Terry Johnson (it was first on in 1994).

It is the week that Frankie Howerd and Benny Hill have died, and the news has spread mawkishly among them.

In it, Ellie has told a horrible joke. \u201cI have to say a few lines that are quite, for want of a better word, dark,\u201d says Parkinson. \u201cI like that she lets herself down, because she\u2019s unhappy and she starts to become a little bit bitter. You can see her realising she\u2019s becoming that person.

I\u2019m talking about men. When a sort of ownership happens, I\u2019ve always felt quite excluded by that; it\u2019s just men quoting things from things. It\u2019s an avoidance actually, I think.

It\u2019s like collecting football cards or whatever.\u201d She pauses and laughs. \u201cI\u2019m just slagging off men.\u201d Then, in a funny, earnest voice: \u201cWhereas women celebrate humour with joy, and it\u2019s about social interaction and generosity of spirit.\u201d</p> <p>Parkinson grew up on Only Fools and Horses, French and Saunders, Tony Hancock.

It\u2019s disgusting, and not very cool to admit it, but that\u2019s basically where it comes from. I think I was probably quite shy, but then not when I was given a platform \u2013 and I think that\u2019s quite typical. I was more relaxed on stage than off. But I don\u2019t want to make out \u2026\u201d She stops. She has read about the type of actors who were cripplingly shy and whose first utterances were lines in an Ibsen play or something, and says she wasn\u2019t quite that bad. \u201cActually, say that \u2013 say I went to drama classes to bring me out of my shell, that I didn\u2019t speak until I was 10 on stage.\u201d She laughs. \u201cYeah, I like that.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t know any actors, or really think it could be a proper job, until she got to university \u2013 Oxford, where she read classics, via grammar school in Kingston upon Thames where she grew up \u2013 and \u201cthere were people who were acting and expecting to do it\u201d. She found Oxford intimidating at first, eventually building up the courage to audition for a play \u2013 A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream again. She got the part as Titania \u201cbecause my hair was very long and wild. And then I was off, really. I just found that there were a lot of really fun people doing acting and it meant I had a legitimate excuse not to do my work. For me, it was opting out, because I got a bit overwhelmed by the academic thing. Which is why when I meet people who are really driven in acting I\u2019m always a bit surprised because as far as I\u2019m concerned, we\u2019re all drop-outs.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2015/sep/20/katherine-parkinson-interview-new-review-q-and-a-the-kennedys-comedy-is-instinctive\">Katherine Parkinson: \u2018Comedy is instinctive \u2013 you don\u2019t have to do any homework\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How does she feel about the domination of acting by people from public school and Oxbridge backgrounds? She agrees it\u2019s a problem. One of her first jobs out of Lamda, the drama school she went to after university, came from an Oxford connection, she says: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely true that going somewhere like that helps.\u201d But if that hadn\u2019t happened, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford to spend most of her early 20s trying to be an actor. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any money to fall back on,\u201d she says. Those who can keep at it, riding out the years of failed auditions and bit parts, \u201ctend to have a private income, which means [acting is full] of a very small representation of the social demographic. It works quite well because there are so many period parts, posh parts, but I do think that\u2019s a shame. I\u2019ve seen people who were so talented who have had to drop out.\u201d</p> <p>Parkinson\u2019s first big television role was as receptionist, Pauline, in the Martin Clunes drama Doc Martin; before that, she had small parts in Casualty and Extras, and in her friend Katy Brand\u2019s show. Her role as Jen in the IT Crowd brought her something close to a cult following (it was that sort of show), as well as two British comedy awards and a Bafta. More recently, she was in the heavyweight Hugo Blick drama The Honourable Woman, and Kay Mellor\u2019s pregnancy drama In the Club. In theatre, she has done Before the Party at the Almeida, Season\u2019s Greetings at the National and was in the Royal Court\u2019s sparkling production of The Seagull, with Kristin Scott Thomas, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Carey Mulligan. \u201cIt is not necessarily the most famous names that come off best,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/jan/26/theatre1\">noted the Guardian\u2019s critic Michael Billington</a>, describing Parkinson\u2019s performance as \u201cbrilliant\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c4bbc9a65ceb551bf6148fadea4677693f9d77a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c4bbc9a65ceb551bf6148fadea4677693f9d77a/0_129_4704_2822/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katherine Parkinson and Michelle Terry in Before The Party at the Almeida theatre, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katherine Parkinson and Michelle Terry in Before The Party at the Almeida theatre, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She says she can\u2019t complain about the parts she\u2019s had, though, like many female actors, she has suffered constant irritations. \u201cI\u2019ve read scripts that describe the woman as \u2018feisty\u2019 and I just think that is criminal now,\u201d she says, green eyes widening. \u201cI just don\u2019t think there is any excuse now to describe any female part as \u2018her own person\u2019 or \u2018feisty\u2019. What does it mean in this day and age? It\u2019s amazing how much that comes up. I think \u2018feisty\u2019 should be banned from all character descriptions. I have to say I don\u2019t feel badly served at the age I am.\u201d A wry smile. \u201cBut that\u2019s probably because I was never getting parts for my tits and ass.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/07/revenge-of-the-synth-watch-the-exclusive-trailer-for-humans-series-two\">Revenge of the synth: watch the exclusive trailer for Humans series two</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most recently, she has been in Humans, the brilliant Channel 4 drama about the rise of humanoids known as synths, playing the harassed lawyer and mother-of-three, Laura.

In person, Parkinson is strikingly beautiful.) \u201cShe was very anti the synths and now she\u2019s their champion. She is concerned with the ethics and she feels, rightly, if it can think and it can feel then it has to have rights. I love the philosophical element to it. Laura says in this series \u2018there are two types of people \u2013 the person who stops to help the boys who have broken down by the side of the road at night and the one who wants to go on because the kids are in the back\u2019.

Over the coming weeks, if not months, the western-led coalition both on the ground and in the skies will almost certainly signal the end of Isis\u2019s control of territory in Iraq and will be the death knell of the so-called caliphate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/iraqi-forces-begin-assault-on-isis-stronghold-mosul\">Mosul offensive: forces launch mass attack on Iraqi city in bid to oust Isis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But what comes next? Iraq lacks the resources and the capacity to rebuild the towns and cities that have been destroyed since the campaign against Isis was launched two years ago. The Iraqi state is a fragile, if not failed, state and in some areas (including those outside Isis-controlled territory) it is no longer the principal provider of basic services and security.</p> <p>Iraq continues to suffer the consequences of corruption, sectarianism and dysfunctional governance, as well as a plethora of Shia militias and a highly fragmented security environment. In the coming period, the multi-phased operation to liberate Mosul will intensify. There are uncertainties surrounding the degree of resistance that Isis will provide. It is a largely opportunistic organisation that exploits and capitalises on the weaknesses of its opponents, using divisionary tactics to exhaust the resources of its opponents while shifting its focus to other areas.</p> <p>The group is unlikely to go head-to-head with Iraqi security forces and will almost certainly revert to insurgency mode and continue its fight in the urbanised environment that Mosul offers. That means it will blend into the local population, making it difficult to distinguish between the jihadi fighters and civilians.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/oct/17/mosul-battle-iraq-isis-islamic-state-peshmerga-latest\">Battle for Mosul: Isis city under attack from Iraqi and Kurdish forces \u2013 live news</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The strategy for liberating Mosul, much like the anti-Isis campaign more generally, is to clear areas of Isis fighters, maintain control over territory retaken from the group and rebuild the destroyed towns and cities. But who will do the rebuilding? Aside from Iraq\u2019s lack of resources to finance this rehabilitation, it also lacks a regular military that is capable, and that has the support of local populations to sustain control of territories captured from Isis.</p> <p>Arab Sunni tribal groups are expected to do most of the fighting in the city itself but these groups have their own rivalries and do not necessarily have support and legitimacy among locals in Mosul, particularly since they receive support and training from rival political factions in Iraq and external powers that are widely disdained by locals.</p> <p>The Mosul operation carries particular weight because the city\u2019s liberation would effectively signal the start of the \u201cday after Isis\u201d. There is an array of different powerful and heavily armed groups who have set upon Mosul and they have conflicting agendas and ambitions. Each see their influence and control over the province as potential leverage in relation to the outstanding disputes they have had over the past decade over territory, power-sharing and Iraq\u2019s energy resources.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/how-important-is-the-battle-for-mosul-iraq-islamic-state\">Five key questions about the battle for Mosul</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are intense rivalries between Shia militias who function autonomously of the state and Kurdish peshmerga and between these actors and the Iraqi security forces, which answer to the Baghdad government. Iran also has a significant presence and backs Shia militias, who have threatened to wage a war against Turkey unless it withdraws its troops from Mosul. Turkey has stationed them there to contain groups like the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), which has fought the Turkish state for a series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/06/what-about-our-human-rights-kurds-feel-force-turkeys-crackdown\">political and cultural rights for Turkey\u2019s Kurdish population</a>. The local Turkomen and Yazidi population have additionally formed their own militias under the patronage of local and foreign backers.</p> <p>In other words, the conditions that gave rise to Isis in the first place are still there and have been exacerbated, rather than alleviated, over the past two years since the jihadis took control of Mosul in 2014. While President Obama clearly does not want Isis (or rather the \u201ccaliphate\u201d) to outlive his presidency, there are no guarantees the US and the international community will continue their support and help to remedy these shortcomings, as well as mediate between rival factions.</p> <p>In the short- and medium-term, Isis will continue to commit terrorist atrocities such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/06/iraqs-interior-minister-resigns-in-wake-of-baghdad-bomb-attack\">July bombing in Karrada</a> that killed close to 300 people, and it still has its apparatus in Syria as a launching pad for attacks and atrocities elsewhere. This latest offensive on Mosul won\u2019t change that \u2013 and without substantial investment for rebuilding it\u2019s unlikely to help Iraq become a more peaceful, stable country.</p>",

  "<p>Walking down London Road in Ipswich, the only thing that strikes you is how normal it is. Children play in the front gardens of neat, bay-windowed houses. Barely a car drives by, despite the proximity to the town centre. It\u2019s a&#xa0;cliche, but it really could be anywhere in Britain.</p> <p>However, in the winter of 2006, the street was plunged into a media frenzy. First, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/dec/11/ukcrime.simonjeffery\" title=\"\">five sex workers were abducted and murdered</a> nearby, then a&#xa0;resident \u2013 Steve Wright \u2013 was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/feb/22/wright.sentenced\" title=\"\">convicted of their killings</a>.

A strong community spirit blossomed as neighbours tried to rebuild their street \u2013 a journey documented in the play London Road, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/09/london-road-serial-killer-film-musical-rufus-norris-interview\" title=\"\">which was adapted for the screen last year</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/11/london-road-film-review-gripping-macabre-verbatim-musical\">London Road review \u2013 gripping, macabre verbatim musical about real-life serial murders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Prior to the murders, the road had been struggling with the issue of prostitution for years. Men were propositioned while women were hassled by punters, turning it into a no-go area in the evenings. One resident, Julie Hyland, was so frustrated at the police\u2019s reluctance to tackle the problem that she had begun to take matters into her own hands, noting down registration numbers or shouting at cars to leave. \u201cI\u2019d just had enough,\u201d she says.</p> <p>However, the tragic events forced the police and the council to sit up. \u201cWe wanted to move the image of the town forward \u2013 we had a responsibility to ensure it didn\u2019t have this blight over it for ever,\u201d says Julia Stephens-Row, then assistant director of <a href=\"https://www.suffolk.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Suffolk county council</a>. The strategy of arresting and fining the women \u2013 only for them to return to the streets weeks later \u2013 had failed, and now five of them were dead.</p> <p>Along with Suffolk police\u2019s district commander, Alan Caton, she spearheaded a radical plan to help women leave prostitution safely while taking a zero-tolerance approach to the purchase of sex. Social workers, health authorities, housing associations and drug-treatment charities worked with 32 women, while the police made 139 arrests for kerb-crawling. It worked: street prostitution has not returned to Ipswich. Roads once littered with syringes and condoms are clean, and residents are no longer disturbed by punters, sex workers or their pimps.</p> <p>A key element of the policy was bringing residents on board, encouraging them to keep an eye out and report any goings-on. \u201cWe built some great relationships with the community,\u201d says Caton. \u201cWhen I explained that we were going to try to help the women, the majority recognised that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/23/suffolkmurders\" title=\"\">the old approach hadn\u2019t worked</a>.\u201d Stephens-Row adds: \u201cLocal people wanted the area cleaned up, but they also wanted help for those involved.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/25/ipswich-victims-families-friends\">Clare Dwyer Hogg talks to families and friends of Ipswich murder victims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is one of the most compelling effects of the murders on the town. Compared with crimes such as those of the Yorkshire Ripper, where the women were often portrayed as somehow deserving of their fate, Ipswich experienced an outpouring of sympathy for the victims and their families. \u201cIt helped change people\u2019s views, and they began to see them as human beings,\u201d Stephens-Row says.</p> <p>Brian Tobin, the co-founder of local drug-rehabilitation charity <a href=\"http://www.iceniipswich.org/\" title=\"\">Iceni</a>, which worked with many of the women, describes the switch in attitudes as \u201chumbling\u201d. He recalls the day a frail-looking man in his 80s came up to him and bundled a \u00a320 note into his hand. \u201cI could tell he wasn\u2019t a well-off man and I refused to take it at first, but he got very angry. He said to me: \u2018I\u2019m giving this to you because I\u2019m ashamed&#xa0;\u2013 I\u2019m ashamed that we haven\u2019t done more in Ipswich to help these girls.\u2019\u201d He continues: \u201cWe\u2019ve engineered society over the years so that people in these situations are hidden from view.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8fa7773e9529b331703413c332fad46ce1f7ea3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8fa7773e9529b331703413c332fad46ce1f7ea3/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from the film London Road.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the film London Road.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicola Dove</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Caton believes that police efforts to humanise the victims, and the determination of local press to refer to them as women, daughters and mothers&#xa0;\u2013 rather than simply \u201cprostitutes\u201d \u2013 helped challenge attitudes. But there is perhaps another, more personal reason behind the public sympathy. While Ipswich, with a population of 130,000, isn\u2019t exactly tiny, it\u2019s still a place where people know each other. Mention the murders today and you\u2019ll hear stories of connections: \u201cI went to school with Tania\u201d; \u201cI worked at the same office as Gemma\u201d; \u201cI dated Annette\u2019s sister\u201d. When crimes like this happen in relatively small, otherwise quiet towns, they resonate deeply.</p> <p>On London Road, residents banded together to try to rebuild their neighbourhood, upset at the media portrayal of the street as a seedy area. \u201cIt\u2019s very strange seeing your house on the news,\u201d says Gordon Lawrence, who lived next door to Wright. \u201cWe had friends ringing us up from overseas saying they\u2019d seen it on TV.\u201d Although he wasn\u2019t too bothered by Wright\u2019s presence (\u201cHe\u2019d only been there a few months; it would be different if he\u2019d lived there longer\u201d), Lawrence, like his neighbours, was intent on making the street a pleasant place to live again. \u201cPeople wanted to build the community and move forward,\u201d he recalls.</p> <p>The subsequent quiz nights, gardening competitions and street parties, organised by local Neighbourhood Watch members Hyland and Ron Alder, didn\u2019t go unnoticed \u2013 it was this newfound community spirit that so struck playwright Alecky Blythe on a visit that she decided to form a piece of theatre around it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/aug/13/london-road-review\" title=\"\">London Road</a> enjoyed a sellout run at the National Theatre, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/11/london-road-film-review-gripping-macabre-verbatim-musical\" title=\"\">film it inspired set the residents\u2019 own recorded words to a musical score</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/feb/10/musicals-we-love-london-road-mark-lawson\">Musicals we love: London Road</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The locals are now immensely proud of being immortalised on stage and screen, even if they were initially sceptical. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would get off the ground,\u201d admits Hyland. \u201cI thought: \u2018How are you ever going to make a play out of us? We\u2019re just normal people living in a normal road.\u2019\u201d They also had to battle negative attitudes from other people in the town, who mistakenly believed they were making money off the back of the murders.</p> <p>Hyland \u2013 who is still in close contact with Blythe \u2013 describes watching the play for the first time as \u201cextraordinary. It\u2019s incredible that she created it all from our voices\u201d. For Alder \u2013 who keeps a box containing the DVD, the script and the programme \u2013 the experience holds a special resonance. His wife, Rosie, who appears in the story, died four years ago. Indeed, several of the characters portrayed have since died, their voices given permanence through Blythe\u2019s work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d11bbaf274240a2d814028dd841151be42d9b958\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d11bbaf274240a2d814028dd841151be42d9b958/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from London Road performed at the Cottesloe, National Theatre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from London Road performed at the Cottesloe, National Theatre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the years go on, some of the legacy stays while other parts fade. Street sex work hasn\u2019t returned, and resources are now focused on preventing trafficking and child exploitation. When Iceni was faced with closure a few years ago, people in the town quickly rallied round to raise the cash it needed.</p> <p>However, as the neighbourhood evolves, the community spirit that inspired Blythe is becoming less resilient. Much of the accomodation on&#xa0;London Road is now rented, and temporary residents aren\u2019t as invested in nurturing connections. Some locals say the influx of eastern Europeans to the area over the past year or two has contributed to the new dynamic. \u201cThey aren\u2019t as interested in getting involved \u2013 they just want to earn their money then return home, which is fair enough,\u201d one neighbour says.</p> <p>Although the symptoms of addiction may be less visible, charities and health authorities still struggle to combat the underlying causes. \u201cOverall, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve moved on much [as a society],\u201d sighs Tobin. \u201cI think we might see a spike in addiction problems over the next couple of years due to lack of opportunities and DWP [Department for Work and Pensions] attempts to get people off benefits. Lots of people with drug and alcohol problems have been sanctioned far too quickly \u2013 of course, you miss appointments when you\u2019re off your head.\u201d Caton also describes the current climate as challenging: \u201cBenefit cuts and a culture of austerity mean people are going to be needy of money, so we may end up seeing more people turn to prostitution.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/apr/30/drugs-charity-donations-bbc-drama\">Suffolk drugs charity sees donations surge following BBC drama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While local residents are proud of having turned something so awful into a positive, there remains a sadness that the changes only came about because of the murders. \u201cIt took the slaughter of five girls for anything to be done,\u201d says Alder. \u201cMaybe if there had been a policy to help the girls before, it wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d Despite the close bonds formed, being in the centre of such a tragedy has inevitably changed their relationships with their environment. \u201cIt\u2019s made me more aware of my surroundings,\u201d explains Hyland. \u201cYou do tend to look out of your window and wonder what people are doing.\u201d</p> <p>As life moves on and residents come and go, the winter of 2006 will remain for ever woven into the area\u2019s history. Overall, Stephens-Row believes the town has dealt with its unwanted legacy well: \u201cWe owed it to the women that nothing like that would ever happen again. For those of us who were heavily involved, it\u2019s something we will never forget.\u201d</p>",

The place is the most important thing in my writing - it always started with the place. Even when I'm writing about objects, it's important. My favourite quotation, from a Finnish writer for a change, by Pentti Saarikoski, he said &quot;I'm not writing about the world and its places, I'm writing about the places and its worlds&quot; \u2013 or something similar. And when I studied literature, my topic was literature and the place, and the local, the place where you are, has always been the most important thing in the writing. There's an interesting question by Bruno Latour who asks where the local goes out to be global - it's two different levels of existence. And I try to establish a place, a here and a now. What I like in literature is this, but before I could articulate that, I just felt it. </p> <p>I read Kundera, and Knut Hamsen at the same time. Kundera is a classic postmodernist writer, he moves his character about; Hamsen is all about presence, no reflection, and I knew that was my preference. For me, all the reflections in my prose, is kind of a failure - it's the lack of ability to express it through flesh and blood and place. That's what I really want to do. That's what evokes the fantasy, and the writing itself - seeing a place. </p> <p>It's interesting in regard to what we were taught in the beginning of the 90s at university, when it was all about language, and we looked at realistic novels and the notion of the language being transparent - if you read Flaubert you can see the town - it was seen as completely naive. It was about language and science, and this was a postmodernist time. I loved that, I dived into it - I love the feeling that my teacher was a quantum mechanic, and it had that feeling to reading the letters in that way. But then I went back to childhood reading experiences, all about visualisation, and feelings. And that's what I'm doing. And yes, it's naive too.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5804bd5fe4b08feb7300a417\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T12:00:50.652Z\">1.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">'I don't like myself'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16832157\">Nicole R </a>asks:</p> <p><em>In the beginning of the first book in the \u201cMy Struggle\u201d series, you become very upset when your parents invalidate the \u201cface\u201d in the sea you saw on television.

For me personally, it's such a big part of my personality, that my father did that all the time. In the end, it was like something was broken. Because as a child, the most important thing is to be accepted and loved, and if you're criticised you know something is wrong with you - it could be a dangerous thing, because it has to do with your self-esteem, and whether you like yourself, which I don't. Then you get children yourself, and you see it's so easy to do that. It's easy to see them as children - it's very easy to transfer the same feeling to them, and not understand the consequences. It's a constant thing in my life - trying to understand how they're feeling. You could make a joke about them, but it could crush them. Their feelings are much more connected to the world than mine are as an adult - I've learned to deal with things, and they haven't yet. </p> <p>I don't like myself, no - that must be somehow rooted in my childhood experiences. I'm not blaming anyone, but yes, it comes from there I think.

I'm currently writing a film manuscript of my first novel. I never re-read them, but I had to read this one. The first one's first 190 pages are excellent, and the last 510 pages are written by a writer in love with himself and his own writing. And the strange thing is a colleague of mine told me that when the book was published, that the first bit was good and then it was terrible... when it was published in English, I could have taken out the bad parts, but I like the fact that it is what it is, and it reflects something. The second novel I've never re-read, I don't have the courage to do that.</p> <p>My own favourite novels are classical novels in a way. I would love to do that, of course. But for me, I can't write novels. Thomas Mann said a novelist is a person who can't really write novels, and the novel is in that struggle. I think James Joyce could write perfect short stories, but his first novel, it's struggling with the form - and it's a celebration of that. </p> <p>I would like to write one, still. An example would be Never Let Me Go - a traditional novel in a way, but it has to be unique in some way or another.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T13:30:44.572Z\">at 2.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5804bc95e4b0e0a93db99670\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T11:57:39.252Z\">12.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4335007\">marukun </a>asks: </p> <p><em>Do Norwegian people really drink as much alcohol as described in your books?

It's all based on memory, not documents.</p> <p>I always wanted to write a book that moves effortlessly in time and space, and you're part of a wave that goes down and up, left and right. The first book I read that had this quality is Marcel Proust, In Search of Lost Time. He is using metaphor of moving, changing levels. He has a metaphor, then a pocket of something else comes in, and in that pocket could be the future or past. The opera, with all the people in dresses going there, and it changes into an underwater world. It's not just a metaphor though. I was reading that when I was 35 or something, and I couldn't write myself - I couldn't write anything. And then two years later I could, I was writing 700 pages in a row, and it's connected to Proust - it's so influenced by it. But I didn't know that at the time. I'm interested in having a feeling of movement. If you listen to music there are no paragraphs, no chapters, it's just flowing, it can go from emotional and warm to something abstract and hard, and it's the same movement, the same journey. That's an aesthetic ideal I have - I've never managed it, but I like the idea. </p> <p>I just read an art historian, a critic who wrote a book about Edvard Munch, he gave a definition of style, and said it was a way of controlling information. If you are a painter there can be endless details - there has to be a way to stop. That's style.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T11:50:16.879Z\">at 12.50pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5804b947e4b04312166ed6fc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T11:43:31.570Z\">12.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15890036\">DavidFlynn</a> asks: </p> <p>Can you clarify the relationship between fact and fiction in the My Struggle series?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/live/2016/oct/13/karl-ove-knausgaard-webchat-some-rain-must-fall-my-struggle#comment-85613138\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16837940\" title=\"View KarlOveKnausgaard\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/16837940\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for KarlOveKnausgaard\"> </a> <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16837940\" title=\"View KarlOveKnausgaard\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">KarlOveKnausgaard</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/85613138\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">17 October 2016 12:35pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>When I started out, the thing is that this is a book about the past. About what I remember, what's inside my head. So all the things I'm writing about, I have memories of, but I never know if the memories are accurate or not. It's a very subjective book, and it's also about what it is to remember. And when you go back to something you remember, the distinction between what it was and how you remember are blurred, so in the childhood book, book three, my method was to enter the memories, visualise them, and set them into motion. One memory, I do remember, but I don't know what led up to it or afterwards, and those things are invented. Dramatising memory, that's the thing. But I do try to keep it as it was - but the details are invented. But I do remember the colour of the chair - but I don't remember a car passing. The dialogue is invented of course, but I had a sense of what I could have said, or my friends - that's why I call it a novel, and it's told in the language of a novel. I wanted the effect of a diary, where you are attached to the person. But to dramatise, open it up, make it move somehow. </p> <p>What people challenge things in My Struggle, it's the things really close to the present. But the childhood book, I sent that to friends I had in childhood, and they said: this is exactly the same! How can you remember? They have the same.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5804b8fde4b08feb7300a402\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T11:42:47.853Z\">12.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2471291\">bearcake </a>asks:</p> <p><em>In Some Rain Must Fall, (page 299 onwards) you play chess with Espen, who easily wins three times consecutively in a matter of minutes.

I care way way too much what people think about me, and that's what made the whole enterprise of writing My Struggle necessary for me. For the first time you wrote freely without thinking of what people would think about me, that was like walking into hell, and it was the worst thing for me to write, knowing that people would hate me for writing it. But it also felt extremely liberating. I can now do that in my writing, it's fine to publish controversial stuff or stuff that people will hate. But in a social setting it's still the same - I'm still desperate to be liked. When I do an event, I do anything to please the audience. It's horrifying - I can't control it. I'm so afraid of being disliked, and there I am, talking about myself for an hour. </p> <p>But another thing that happened was that I separated myself between me and what's out there in the media - I don't read it, and I know it's a cartoon, a character, it's impossible to identify with it. But my face has been attached to that caricature - when I look in the mirror I see 'Knausgaard', so I don't like to look at the mirror.

But my normal routine is that I just write and the book is done, but since the first book it has been very little editing. There are of course remarks... I start my day by reading the day before, edit, and continue to write. It's much more a matter of: if it's not working, I remove it, and write it again. It's very different when it comes to journalism, I've been working with American editors and that's a different story - that's hard work for two weeks on a piece. Very detailed, shaping and reshaping all the time - it's like making a sculpture. I love that - they're so professional, and sensitive to the text. The difference is my own writing is more personal and more like as it appears - it would be wrong to change it too much. I'm not interested in constructing something - I'm more interested in the flow. The writing itself is editing - it's working, it's working, then it's not, and I take it out.</p> <p>The Aesthetics of a Broken Nose, by Geir Angell Oygarden - it's really such a brilliant book, and it is completely original, in its thinking and in its method. Geir is a friend of mine, he was boxing for two or three years, studying boxers so he was beaten every day to be able to do that. He wanted to interview, but also participate - it makes it a very special and very interesting book. It really should be translated - it really is a great book about boxing, Scandinavia, the welfare state... publishers, you should pick it up!</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5804b24be4b08feb7300a3d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T11:14:36.636Z\">12.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Karl is with us now! </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"598415bc3373998e9c8fed482f81f260ce223db5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/598415bc3373998e9c8fed482f81f260ce223db5/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Karl Ove in the Guardian\u2019s offices.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karl Ove in the Guardian\u2019s offices.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Beaumont-Thomas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>First up is this from <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16830942\">Sean Healy</a>, who asks:</p> <p><em>I really love your books.

I read it when I was 10, and I re-read it a few years ago, and still find it as compelling and great as it was then. It felt like it had such a depth to it, in such a simple way - and is very adventurous. I find something of same in Borges and Calvino, and I always loved that fantastic literature. It's still as brilliant.</p> <p>When I was a teenager I discovered Salman Rushdie, Midnight's Children especially, and my first writing was very much inspired by him - I found his writing so rich, and expanding everything. That was a new concept to me. He added something to world, rather than the condition I come from is taking something away from it; minimalism. This was maximalism - that was very important for me. I still regard The Satanic Verses as a modern classic, a really truly great book in all senses.</p> <p>Then in my 20s I read Ulverton by Adam Thorpe, which was an amazing reading experience, how he managed to capture time and passing of time, of changing cultures. He opened up possibilities in thinking about what a novel could do, for me. And at the same time I read Ian McEwan and his book A Child of Time, not his most well known but a direct influence for me in my first novel. ONe of the subjects is regression and when I read that it was like the last piece of what I was going to do came into place. I owe that book a lot. </p> <p>And I'm reading Rachel Cusk, Outline. I read Life's Work by her, which is brilliant, and Outline is outstanding. She's one of the best writers at the moment, what I've read of her. I've got a feeling there's something new in there. </p> <p>And classics: Dracula by Bram Stoker. I've read it twenty times. I really want to write that book! And another book that I think I should write, but I don't have to because it's written - I think about it every other week. Never Let Me Go by Ishiguro - it has something magical about it. It's absolutely fantastic.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T13:28:02.126Z\">at 2.28pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fcde5fe4b03b22b4fb2401\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T08:50:16.493Z\">9.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Post your questions for Karl Ove Knausgaard</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One of the most powerfully honest \u2013 or to its critics, profoundly narcissistic \u2013 literary projects of recent years has been Karl Ove Knausgaard\u2019s My Struggle, a six-book autobiography that charts the Norwegian writer\u2019s personal trials and tribulations.

  "<p>No less than 17 years have passed since new rules were approved in the UK to save thousands of lives by limiting deadly air pollution in our towns and cities.<br></p> <p>Pollution is the \u201cinvisible killer\u201d because, for the most part, it goes unseen. Its impact on human health and the planet is why those laws were necessary. </p> <p>Yet disgracefully \u2013 and illegally \u2013 we are still subjected to excruciatingly dirty air. Conditions are sometimes so poor that you notice it in your nostrils or lungs. Those days, when the air feels thick with fumes, you may be under the impression that it\u2019s just one vehicle with a bad exhaust in front of you which is to blame. It\u2019s generally not.</p> <p>London\u2019s pollution \u2013 the worst in the UK \u2013 was visible on a trip I made to Canary Wharf a few weeks ago. From the 11th floor, a brown haze sat across the skyline, its deadly toxins testing the health of millions of city-dwellers and workers, particularly those who suffer from asthma, heart or respiratory conditions.</p> <p>Pollution is right there with you when you\u2019re puffing as you cycle through the park on a summer\u2019s day, or when you\u2019re chatting with friends on a visit to the shops on a Saturday morning, or when you\u2019re taking your child to school. </p> <p>Why are you and I are still inhaling unlawful levels of nitrogen dioxide nearly 20 years after it should have been cleaned up? </p> <p>There is a simple answer: because the UK government is breaking its own and the EU\u2019s laws. </p> <p>It has failed to protect your health and mine, and more importantly the health of our children. It has failed legally. And it has failed morally. </p> <p>ClientEarth is taking the government back to court on Tuesday, because of the lack of urgency, the failure to tackle the problem. Cleaning the air isn\u2019t rocket science. Not doing so is simply unacceptable political behaviour. </p> <p>The fact that it\u2019s taken the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs (Defra) 18 months <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/13/electric-vehicles-could-go-first-at-traffic-lights-under-uk-clean-air-zone-plans\">to launch a consultation on just five clean air zones</a> \u2013 when there are many more badly polluted towns and cities across the UK \u2013 is just one illustration of that lackadaisical attitude.</p> <p>In April last year, in our first legal challenge, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/29/supreme-court-orders-uk-to-draw-up-air-pollution-cleanup-plan\">the supreme court ordered the environment secretary to draw up a new Air Quality plan</a> to meet legal limits in the shortest time possible. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/17/illegal-air-pollution-will-blight-many-uk-cities-for-at-least-five-years\">The plan</a> was woefully inadequate and didn\u2019t envisage UK compliance on pollution levels until 2025. That would be 26 years since the rules were first approved. </p> <p>Not only that, but while motor manufacturers have been exploiting legal loopholes and using dubious techniques to pass emissions tests, the government has failed to hold them to account - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/26/uk-tried-to-block-tougher-eu-car-emissions-tests\">while bidding behind the scenes to allow increased emissions</a>. </p> <p>The Treasury, meanwhile, is still giving incentives through the tax system, for motorists to buy diesel cars. That is also unacceptable.</p> <p>A reason some give for not taking action to solve this public health crisis is the cost to the economy and the Treasury and the impact on business, hauliers and motorists. But surely the health impacts of pollution are worth more than that? </p> <p>Pollution is responsible for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/22/indoor-and-outdoor-air-pollution-claiming-at-least-40000-uk-lives-a-year\">40,000 premature deaths in the UK</a>. It triggers heart attacks and strokes. It can make existing heart conditions worse. It causes cancer and stunted lung growth in children. It aggravates respiratory conditions which can be fatal. </p> <p> But there is also a substantial economic and societal impact. Defra\u2019s own analysis suggests that the cost to the economy from early deaths by air pollution is \u00a327.5bn. Every year.</p> <p> So what should the government be doing? A national network of Clean Air Zones, preventing the worst polluting vehicles from entering our towns and city centres; a scheme to retrofit buses and heavy goods vehicles to make them compliant with legal emissions limits; and a targeted diesel scrappage scheme part funded by the car industry \u2013 used to fund low emission vehicles and alternatives to car use. </p> <p>Other solutions should run in tandem: a clean public transport system and a car labelling scheme so that motorists know they cars they are buying are compliant with emissions limits in the real world.</p> <p>That would be a start. There is also a great opportunity: to move the economy toward zero emission vehicles. We could become a leader in sustainable energy, and sustainable cities. </p> <p>The air law will be UK law under the government\u2019s Brexit plans. It should be made even stronger in future with a new Clean Air Act.</p> <p>First, we need to win this court case to make sure the government understands that pollution is a health hazard which we \u2013 or rather they \u2013 can solve. </p>",
  "<p>It is hard to know who to trust when you\u2019re a refugee, explains 25-year old Mohamad Albwab from Syria. People smugglers lie. The armies close the borders. The conduct of the police varies from country to country. Aid organisations are overwhelmed. Rumour is rife and reliable information is hard to find. </p> <p>In the face of such uncertainty, many refugees look to their smartphones to find out what\u2019s happening. But finding information they can trust is hard. <br><br>Albwab was studying electrical engineering at university when war broke out. He has been in Stockholm for six months now, reunited with his brother after travelling through Turkey, Greece, Macedonia and Germany. He has found navigating life as a refugee incredibly difficult. <br></p> <p>\u201cI needed to know what the registration procedure was in the camps we moved through, what documents I needed to support my asylum application, which agencies can provide food, healthcare and places to stay,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of information but nothing is trustworthy and no-one knows the truth.\u201d</p> <p>The refugee crisis has found a number of champions in the technology sector. <a href=\"http://refugeeaidapp.com/\">RefAid</a> for example, allows aid organisations to post resources by location and category, such as food, shelter, medical care or water, allowing refugees to search what\u2019s nearby, and fieldworkers with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/18/rumours-and-lies-the-refugee-crisis-is-an-information-crisis\">Mediterranean Rumour Tracker</a> visit camps in Greece to collect and dispel, via its website and Facebook pages, common rumours. </p> <p>But one new approach is to automate information via a chatbot, making it easier, in theory, to scale and distribute to new regions or groups, and to create a link between refugees, governments and charities. </p> <p>   Created by three Danish Master\u2019s students, Ciar\u00e1n Duffy, Caroline Arvidsson and K\u00e5re Solv\u00e5g, <a href=\"http://www.refugeetext.org/\">Refugee Text</a> enables refugees to access information via a chatbot, via either text messaging or Facebook\u2019s messenger service. Users can use either English and Arabic and there are plans to add Farsi and Dari. The bot asks which country they are in and which country they would like information about. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cc3c443d12eabca482cefffa57979c9a0b9c729a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc3c443d12eabca482cefffa57979c9a0b9c729a/0_0_7360_4416/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Photo taken from a research and prototyping trip to the Balkans last April.

It is also looking for aid organisations to work with in Greece. too. </p> <p>Working across the private, public and third sector has required a lot of patience and legwork, but it is essential, says Duffy.</p> <p>Duffy and his co-founders have applied for a grant from the <a href=\"http://www.elrha.org/hif/home/\">Humanitarian Innovation Fund</a>, to assist with their work with the Danish Refugee Council in Jordan, and recently launched a <a href=\"https://www.generosity.com/emergencies-fundraising/free-on-demand-information-for-refugees-in-greece\">crowdfunding campaign</a> to raise money for their work in Greece. </p> <p> Bryn Boyce, technical coordinator at the council, says partnering with Refugee Text could help his organisation save money, as well as demonstrating ways in which communication could be improved. \u201cThe real challenge for us is improving the quality of word of mouth information,\u201d says Boyce. <br></p> <p>He adds that the process of working with a private company can be complicated. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of patience and legwork to be done in the early stages to set those partnerships up on a stable footing, based on mutual understanding of what the interests are on each side,\u201d he points out. \u201cIt\u2019s not a simple process.\u201d </p> <p>In Jordan, up to 82% of Syrian refugees live in host communities and urban centres, making it difficult to find and speak to them, according to Boyce. The main way of reaching them is via community centres, but these require a lot of human resources and overheads. Refugee Text is one useful way, he says, to reach refugees with new information about the centres, which have services including legal advice, counselling and emergency cash. Another benefit is the data they will receive back from the platform, such as the types of questions refugees are asking. </p> <h2>Funding challenges<br></h2> <p>The start-up has been taken on by <a href=\"http://ciid.dk/\">Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design</a> incubator programme \u2013 known as the Nest, which is co-funded by the <a href=\"https://danishbusinessauthority.dk/\">Danish Business Authority</a> and supports initiatives which make a positive social impact. <br></p> <p>\u201cDesign often stops at [having] a beautiful concept of the future,\u201d says director of the Nest, Simona Maschi. \u201cBut real innovation requires it to be launched in the market for people to benefit from it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8898675bb3dc265a164ce5c4e172ec86ff6bd212\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8898675bb3dc265a164ce5c4e172ec86ff6bd212/2631_1471_4702_7478/629.jpg\" alt=\"A mobile phone with text on the screen.\" width=\"629\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An example of how Refugee Text works.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Refugee Text</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maschi also believes the Nest has had positive consequences for the wider private sector. \u201cIt\u2019s good for inspiring new ways of thinking,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen people from big organisations come to mentor at the Nest, they bring back something new for their own companies.\u201d</p> <p>But Duffy has met with resistance while looking elsewhere for funding. \u201cWe try to explain \u2013 it\u2019s not about paving the way for refugees to come to a particular country,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about providing them with information about the laws that already exist.

  "<p>An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/south-sudan-aid-worker-rape-attack-united-nations-un\">attack on aid workers</a> in South Sudan that left one person dead and in which NGO staff were assaulted and raped has brought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/sep/23/enough-is-enough-its-time-to-protect-aid-workers\">calls for radical reform</a>, amid concerns that agencies are not doing enough to protect their staff.  </p> <p>Experts say the attack highlights far more widespread failings within the humanitarian industry, with some warning that not enough has been done to make humanitarian staff safe in South Sudan since the attack.</p> <p>In early July, the South Sudan capital Juba was the scene of three days of heavy fighting between government forces loyal to Salva Kiir and supporters of Riek Machar, the former vice-president turned rebel leader. Aid workers and NGO staff living at a compound near the city were in \u201clock down\u201d mode behind barbed wire fences and locked gates. </p> <p>On 11 July between 80 and 100 soldiers shot their way into the compound. US contractor Jesse Bunch, who was shot and beaten in the attack, said the US embassy failed to let staff know how bad the violence was: \u201cIf somebody had told me how badly it was going on Wednesday [6 July] I would have been out of there.\u201d <br></p> <p>Several of the aid workers were raped, others were badly beaten, and some terrorised with mock executions. Local journalist <a href=\"http://internews.org/our-stories/project-updates/in-memory-john-gatluak-manguet-nhial\">John Gatluak was executed by the troops during the attack</a>, which lasted almost four hours.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/sep/15/attack-terrain-south-sudan-to-attacks-on-humanitarians\">An eye for an eye is the wrong response to attacks on humanitarians</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The UN peacekeeping force stationed less than a mile away <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/south-sudan-aid-worker-rape-attack-united-nations-un\">failed to respond to desperate calls for help</a>.

There has been significant discussion about this in the months since. </p> <p>But individuals who knew Terrain - the compound where aid workers were living - say that the NGO escape plans had never relied on the UN coming to the rescue.</p> <p>According to John (not his real name) a security expert who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, the plan was to seek shelter at the UN compound: \u201cWe had an exit strategy that you would go over the back fence and get to the UN by throwing blankets over the wire but ... during the attack there were troops everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>Now humanitarian experts say better communication and better risk management from the UN and from their own agencies and governments could have helped staff escape before the conflict escalated. They are concerned that not enough is being done to improve security even now. <br></p> <p>Bunch, who was working as a private contractor for aid agency Management Systems International, says the US embassy failed to keep aid workers informed. \u201cThe problem is that the UN mandate is completely under resourced for what it is being asked to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have been nice if they had rescued us \u2013 but we didn\u2019t really expect it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There were systemic failures and also incredible naivety.

That is a serious, serious thing. I\u2019m in touch with people there, people are aware of these [security] problems but they are committed to what they do.

Speaking to the Guardian anonymously, she said: \u201cThe Terrain attack, it had a huge reverberation. People had a false sense of protection ... The attack bust that myth. We have staff in Juba and that attack triggered a lot of internal discussion. It was seen as a watershed moment but as yet we haven\u2019t changed the compound our staff are living in.

Security is never perfect and is always low down on the food chain in terms of financing and budgeting but [my organisation] had actually invested heavily in security.

  "<p> </p> <p>On 8 July, fighting erupted in the capital of South Sudan between members of the presidential guard and forces loyal to then vice-president, Riek Machar. Over the following four days, humanitarians and residents of Juba were shelled, shot at, and in some cases, subjected to horrific acts of violence \u2013 including rape and gang rape, and a local journalist was killed. </p> <p>News of the outbreak of fighting made it into the international media almost immediately, but details of the attacks against humanitarian staff only surfaced publicly four weeks later when AP published a <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/237fa4c447d74698804be210512c3ed1/rampaging-south-sudan-troops-raped-foreigners-killed-local\">story</a> describing the brutal killing, rapes, and violence that occurred in one Juba hotel.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3deaf1d4c1569b61fb15ba4627c24d36b53e06fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3deaf1d4c1569b61fb15ba4627c24d36b53e06fd/0_0_6900_4493/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tuesday, Jan. 19, 2016, displaced people walk next to a razor wire fence at the United Nations base in the capital Juba, South Sudan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tuesday, Jan. 19, 2016, displaced people walk next to a razor wire fence at the United Nations base in the capital Juba, South Sudan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Patinkin/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many people outside of South Sudan questioned why it took four weeks for UN agencies and NGOs to publicly discuss the attack. In an article that was circulated among humanitarians but not published online, an NGO representative admonished the survivors and organisations for \u201cfailing to proactively speak out\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/19/how-should-the-media-report-and-sexual-violence\">How should the media report rape and sexual violence?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This silence, the paper suggested, contributed to an environment in which the cost of perpetrating these types of attacks had become increasingly negligible. The paper concluded that in these types of situations \u201cthe decision to speak out needs to be taken by those at a safe distance\u201d given the \u201cimpossible decisions\u201d facing staff on the ground. </p> <p>I\u2019ve been thinking about this. And I can\u2019t help but feel that while the dangers of silence are indeed real and may contribute to a continuation of impunity, the answer is not to further take away control from the survivors.</p> <p>In fact, this may achieve the opposite of what it intends. Knowing that the decision to share deeply personal information will be taken by someone \u201cat a safe distance\u201d is likely to prevent survivors from coming forward at all \u2013 meaning that not only will the issue not be addressed, but the survivor will be far less likely to receive critical medical, psychological and organisational support. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The decision to speak, or not to speak, should rest with the survivor</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of the most fundamental aspects of critical incident management in cases of sexual violence is helping the survivor to regain control over their lives and over the decisions that affect them. The decision to speak, or not to speak, should rest with the survivor, and our responsibility as organisations and as a humanitarian community is to create the conditions in which either one of those options is possible. If the survivor wants to speak out, we should do everything in our power to support that. And equally, if the survivor wants to keep their experiences private, we have an obligation to respect that as well. </p> <p>While the paper mentioned above specifically addressed reporting for advocacy purposes, the same principle applies to mandatory reporting within organisations for other reasons. Many NGOs and UN agencies require staff to report security incidents so that managers can track trends and understand the security environment. Both of these objectives are of course completely warranted (though as a general rule of thumb, managers should assume sexual violence is a risk, even if there is no evidence to prove it). But making reporting mandatory, regardless of the rationale, is simply counterproductive when it comes to cases involving sexual violence. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/oct/19/sexual-violence-aid-sector-ngo-action\">Sexual violence in the aid sector: what should NGOs be doing?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To take it to the hyperbolic extreme, threatening a survivor with negative consequences for not reporting an incident is much less effective than helping them to understand the positive benefits and support they would receive if they were to report voluntarily. Forcing someone to report under duress is only likely to contribute to a hostile work environment and discourage others from reporting in the future. </p> <p>With this context in mind, the question we should be asking ourselves is, \u201cWhat can be done to create an environment in which a survivor feels comfortable coming forward on their own?\u201d The first step to this process is understanding the barriers to reporting, so that one by one, these barriers can be broken down. Unsurprisingly, some of the most common fears of survivors are that confidentiality will not be respected, or that they will be pressured to do something they are not comfortable with, whether it\u2019s advocate publicly on the issue, or be evacuated to a location where they have no support network. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have to ask ourselves how we can better support survivors of sexual violence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The second step is making sure that the organisation is prepared to manage sexual violence cases so that they can respond effectively and sensitively if and when a survivor does come forward. This means ensuring that staff have been trained on managing incidents of sexual violence, providing psychological first aid, and respecting confidentiality, and that they know how to help survivors access appropriate medical and psychological care. Organisations cannot encourage (much less require) individuals to report sexual violence without first having these basic measures in place.</p> <p>We also have to ask ourselves how, as a broader humanitarian community, we can better support survivors of sexual violence. Stigma and the rumour mill are still significant barriers to reporting. For many people, a natural reaction to hearing about an incident of sexual violence is to find out as much information as they can (who it was, when it happened, how it happened), as if somehow by knowing all the details, they will find out something that means it won\u2019t happen to them. Unfortunately, knowing all the details is not only unlikely to make the person feel better, but it compromises the well-being and rights of the survivor. Briefing staff on the information that\u2019s available, and encouraging them not to gossip, can avoid this.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/17/how-should-sexual-violence-be-reported-ngos\">How should sexual violence be reported by humanitarian organisations?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finally, if and when a survivor does want to speak, we should be ready to support this as well. This requires standing together as a community: advocacy on these types of issues can rarely be done by one actor alone, particularly if the incidents are being perpetrated by men in uniform. This advocacy doesn\u2019t necessarily have to been done publicly (sometimes the greatest successes are won through private conversations), but regardless of the approach, there has to be solidarity in supporting one another to deliver a common message. This advocacy must be done on the survivors\u2019 terms. When done carefully and collectively, this type of unified action can make a powerful statement. </p> <p>Attacks on humanitarian staff have reached an alarming scale, and as a community we must all think through how we can best prevent and respond to these types of incidents. The most important issue is to maintain the focus on the survivors: while they may be humanitarians, they are first and foremost humans, and our role is to be there to support them.</p> <p><em>If you or your organisation needs advice on how to prepare for incidents of sexual violence, <a href=\"https://www.reporttheabuse.org/\">Report the Abuse</a> has a list of resources on their website, including this helpful <a href=\"http://www.reporttheabuse.org/website/wp-content/uploads/Prevention-Policy-and-Procedure-Checklist-Report-the-Abuse-August-2016.pdf\">preparedness checklist</a>.

  "<p>After months of planning, a long-awaited ground assault on the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, the last urban stronghold of Islamic State in the country, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/iraqi-forces-begin-assault-on-isis-stronghold-mosul\">has begun</a>. </p> <h2><strong>Why is Mosul significant to Islamic State?</strong></h2> <p>The city is Iraq\u2019s second biggest and was overrun by Isis in mid-2014. Since then, the terror group\u2019s \u201ccaliphate\u201d has shredded state authority in the region\u2019s heartland, led to a mass exodus of people, attempted a genocide of minorities and created grave doubts over the future of Iraq.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/oct/17/mosul-battle-iraq-isis-islamic-state-peshmerga-latest\">Battle for Mosul: Isis stronghold under attack from Iraqi and Kurdish forces \u2013 latest news</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The formation of a caliphate across the borders of already existing countries is essential to Isis ideology, and the terror group is the first in modern history to control its own state in such a way. Without a caliphate, Isis would find it significantly harder to call on recruits to join in its war against the rest of the world.</p> <p>But the jihadis have had a string of territorial defeats this year in both Iraq and Syria \u2013 only on Sunday they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/16/turkish-opposition-fighters-syria-dabiq-islamic-state\">lost the town of Dabiq to Syrian rebel fighters</a> backed by Turkey. The loss of Mosul would be one of its greatest, because the city was acquired after beating the US-backed Iraqi army. It was from Mosul\u2019s Great Mosque that Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi made a rare public speech in 2014 in which he declared himself the new global caliph and called on followers to \u201cdo jihad in the cause of God, incite the believers, and be patient in the face of this hardship\u201d.</p> <p>Losing Mosul would also make it easier for Isis\u2019s opponents to recapture the group\u2019s Syrian capital of Raqqa, because major supply routes from Iraq would be cut.</p> <p>For these reasons, the assault is expected to be a protracted and difficult one, with Isis thought to have between 5,000 and 8,000 fighters ready to defend Mosul. These fighters are hidden among a dwindling civilian population of approximately 600,000, most of whom are expected to flee as the battle intensifies.</p> <p>Isis have had months to prepare and will seek to use hit-and-run tactics, ambushes, snipers, bombs, berms and trenches to slow down the Iraqi forces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/mosul-irbil-zip/giv-1406dZmG6zVDudi1/\" data-alt=\"Mosul map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/mosul-irbil-zip/giv-1406dZmG6zVDudi1/\">Mosul map</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>Who is involved in the attack?</strong></h2> <p>The offensive is a joint operation by more than 30,000 troops from the Iraqi army, Kurdish peshmerga and a Shia paramilitary force.

The US said on Sunday night it was proud to stand with its allies in the offensive, and in a statement, the defence secretary, Ash Carter, called it \u201ca decisive moment in the campaign to deliver Isil [Isis] a lasting defeat\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe United States and the rest of the international coalition stand ready to support Iraqi security forces, peshmerga fighters and the people of Iraq in the difficult fight ahead.

Isis is also believed to have placed thousands of improvised explosives in villages on the road to Mosul, which are likely to make the going slow.<br></p> <p>Isis has also used mustard gas against Kurdish forces \u2013 up to 19 times in the past two years.

But while leaving can mean trekking through minefields, and the risk of discovery and punishment by Isis, those who stay know they face airstrikes, street battles, a potential siege by the Iraqi security forces (ISF) and the grim possibility of being used as human shields by Isis.</p> <p>Isis has used civilians for protection in other cities it lost control of in recent months, and militants have already moved into residential areas to try to blunt the impact of US airstrikes now landing near ordinary homes. Those stuck in Mosul are digging makeshift bomb shelters, stockpiling food, and, as the battle draws closer, mostly staying at home to avoid bombs or provoking militants. </p> <p>The United Nations and aid organisations warned that a huge number of civilians were in immediate danger as the operation got under way. \u201cI am extremely concerned for the safety of up to 1.5 million people,\u201d the UN deputy secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief, Stephen O\u2019Brien, said. \u201cDepending on the intensity and scope of the fighting, as many as 1 million people may be forced to flee their homes in a worst-case scenario.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/17/victory-isis-iraq-offensive-mosul\">Victory over Isis will not solve Iraq\u2019s problems | Ranj Alaaldin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Save the Children have said the lives of more than half a million children \u201cnow hang in the balance\u201d. The Norwegian Refugee Council said safe exits from Mosul must be provided or civilians would be faced with the \u201cbleakest of choices: stay behind and risk their lives under attack, or risk their lives trying to flee\u201d.<br></p> <p>One of the pressing questions is how to cater for what will potentially be the largest single exodus of people at any point since mid-2014. The new wave of displace people is likely to be far more difficult to manage than the war itself, and authorities and aid agencies were desperately trying to finalise plans before the attack. </p> <h2><strong>Why have sectarian concerns featured in the buildup to the fight?</strong></h2> <p>Sectarian tensions remained high in the region throughout the post-Saddam years, and peaked before Isis swept into Mosul in 2014. As the terror group arrived, Iraqi forces who were mostly Shia and had alienated the local population, quickly surrendered the city. Restoring trust with Baghdad and re-establishing basic governance therefore loom as the biggest challenge of the post-Isis period.<br></p> <p>Iraq\u2019s central government remains weak and has little influence in Sunni areas of the country. The US, which maintained a presence in Mosul until 2010, no longer has an occupying presence in Iraq. Barack Obama has made clear that the 6,000 troops his administration has redeployed are there only to fight Isis and not to provide military muscle in support of a diplomatic push to hold the country together.</p> <p>As for the offensive, Shia militias and Kurdish peshmerga forces which have played vital roles in the war against Isis are not slated to enter the largely Sunni Mosul. The Iraqi military, which is largely made up of Shia soldiers and officers, will take the lead in the battle. </p> <p>Iraq\u2019s counter-terrorism forces, which performed well in the four-week battle to retake Falluja in June, are expected to lead the fight. Peshmerga units are planning to take up blocking positions to the north and east, where they will also receive and screen fleeing civilians. The popular mobilisation units, known in Iraq as Hashd al-Sha\u2019bi, have been confined to a blocking role to the west of Mosul.</p> <p>An Iraqi intelligence official said: \u201cThere is an agreement about the structure, and the order in which [forces] come in. This is the last battle in Iraq and everyone wants to be included. It was a wise move to let the Shia militia be involved but in designated areas, and under control. I don\u2019t think after two years fighting Isis you can keep out the Shia in the last battle of Iraq.<br></p> <p> \u201cIf we cannot reassure Sunnis they will fight to the death. There are small elements trying to assassinate [Isis], and trying to make them feel uncomfortable, but it largely depends on the tribes. We are trying to tell the Sunnis inside this is coming, and people reaching out to them and saying they have a second chance.\u201d</p>",

So, for example, a Louis Vuitton Speedy bag is currently <a href=\"http://hypebeast.com/2016/10/cheap-luxury-products-london-brexit\">about $200 cheaper in the UK</a> for US visitors \u2013 although I wouldn\u2019t exactly count this as sticking it to the elites, as the leave campaign repeatedly claimed voting its way would achieve. But, someone at the back bellows, this will help the British industry as a whole. A surge of tourism! Bringing in money! To the economy! Yay!</p> <p>All right, little Mikey Gove, try to calm yourself. Maybe go and have an ice cream out the back, <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/13/brexit-to-blame-uks-biggest-retailer-is-running-out-of-ben-jerrys.html\">but not Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s because we can\u2019t afford that at the moment</a>. So some tourists might spend more at Harrods, but let\u2019s look at what this means on a more granular level, as proper columnists would put it. Yes, British exports will be cheaper, but only if they don\u2019t rely on imported goods and manufacturing. And, as much as it might pain certain members of the Tory party to hear this, pretty much every British fashion brand relies on those two things. This isn\u2019t because British fashion labels are trying to chisel their own nation\u2019s economy with cheap Chinese knockoffs and eastern European workers, but rather because it is simply not possible for most fashion labels to be entirely manufactured in this country, relying instead on European factories and skilled labour. So the net result of Brexit on all this is that British brands will become much more expensive for British customers, as companies find their costs going up and their workforce depleting. Um, yay sovereignty?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/15/brexit-britain-where-not-wanted\">When the Tories talk about curbs on foreign workers, they don\u2019t mean me. Or do they?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Also, let\u2019s look at British fashion as a whole. Now, what this country\u2019s fashion industry has always lacked in terms in of infrastructure, slickness and big-brand money, it has made up for in creativity. At least, that\u2019s what those who work in it love to tell themselves. OK, we don\u2019t have Dior or Calvin Klein, but look! We have the best fashion schools in the world, where the best students from around the world come to study. And look! We also produce some of the most acclaimed designers who then work at the biggest labels around Europe, such as Phoebe Philo (Chlo\u00e9, C\u00e9line), Stella McCartney (Chlo\u00e9), Alexander McQueen (Givenchy), John Galliano (Givenchy, Dior, Maison Margiela), etc, etc. Yay, Britain! But how, exactly, will this continue to work if it\u2019s harder for foreign students to come here and European companies have to sort out complex visas when they hire British workers? Oh stop worrying, says the leave camp, relying, perhaps, on British fashion\u2019s much-vaunted creativity to get around these little problems.</p> <p>Finally, I\u2019d say the ultimate problem is bigger and more amorphous than visas. So much in fashion is about image and association: buy a New York label and you\u2019re buying into the fantasy of Manhattan dynamism and power lunches; an Italian label suggests <em>dolce vita</em> glamour; French labels promise chic. British labels, more than any other country\u2019s, play on such national stereotypes: ideas of heritage (the tweed, the crown), punkish rebellion and, most of all, a kind of gonzo creativity in which Britain has always taken pride. But what image, Britain, do we have now, in our post-Brexit era on the global stage? I\u2019d wager it has a lot less to do with enviable sovereignty and more about a silly little country that cut off its nose to spite everyone\u2019s face. Is that the sort of look people want to buy into?</p> <p>Look, as even Boris Johnson would almost certainly admit if you caught him in a rare moment of honesty, Brexit has far bigger problems facing it than how it will affect the fashion industry. But all of these issues underline the central question of Brexit, which is: what kind of country do we want to live in? Because, at the risk of tipping into pomposity, fashion encapsulates fantasy and aspirational self-image. So when a country\u2019s fashion industry looks like it will struggle to achieve this, on both a practical and mental level, it\u2019s perhaps time to take a good long look in the mirror again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35d7098abcd9aab1d7fff9ebda937cd2e09233be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35d7098abcd9aab1d7fff9ebda937cd2e09233be/224_80_4359_2615/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The right look?

It also looks at possible responses to what it calls \u201can unprecedented double challenge\u201d to eradicate hunger and poverty and stabilise the global climate. </p> <p>There is, it says, \u201cno doubt that climate change will affect the agriculture sectors and food security and that its negative impact will become more severe as it accelerates. In some particularly vulnerable places, such as small islands or in areas affected by large-scale extreme weather and climate events, the impact could be catastrophic.\u201d </p> <p>In a best-case scenario, slow-moving climate change would allow farming to adapt through relatively simple techniques, at least in the near future. But it warns that more abrupt changes would make adequate adaptation almost impossible.</p> <p>Possible consequences include major declines in crop yields and increasingly high and volatile food prices, it says. \u201cIn the longer run, unless measures are put in place to halt and reverse climate change, food production could become impossible in large areas of the world.\u201d</p> <p>The report cites diversifying crop production, better integration of farming with the natural habitat, agroecology and \u201csustainable intensification\u201d as strategies to help small-scale farmers adapt to a warming world.</p> <p>It says some current policies, including subsidies for inputs such as synthetic fertilisers and pesticides, could hinder the adoption of more sustainable techniques.</p> <p>\u201cSocial protection programmes will need to play an important role \u2013 in helping smallholders better manage risk, reducing vulnerability to food price volatility, and enhancing the employment prospects of rural people who leave the land,\u201d it adds.</p> <p>The report comes as delegates arrive in Rome for the 43rd <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/cfs/en/\">Committee on World Food Security</a> meetings.</p> <p>On Friday, the FAO\u2019s director general, <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/news/audio-video/detail-audio/en/?uid=11922\">Jos\u00e9 Graziano da Silva, warned</a>: \u201cHigher temperatures and erratic weather patterns are already undermining the health of soils, forests and oceans on which agricultural sectors and food security depend.

After 2030, negative impacts could threaten farming and food systems in every region of the world. </p> <p>In September 2015, UN member states agreed to eradicate extreme poverty and end hunger by 2030 as part of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/ng-interactive/2015/jan/19/sustainable-development-goals-changing-world-17-steps-interactive\">sustainable development goals</a>.</p> <p>In December, world leaders signed the <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php\">Paris agreement</a>, which sets a framework for national action and international cooperation on climate change.</p> <p>Monday\u2019s report argues that now is the time for these political commitments to be put into action.</p> <p>It notes that agriculture and related land use alone accounts for at least one-fifth of global greenhouse-gas emissions \u2013 and that this must also be addressed. </p> <p>Globally, about <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/save-food/resources/keyfindings/en/\">one-third of all food produced is also lost or wasted</a>.

  "<p>Mid-morning in the Luquillo experimental forest in north-west Puerto Rico, and the thermometer already reads 26C. Tana Wood, an ecologist employed by the US Forest Service, pulls on a pair of heavy gloves for insulating against electrical shock. </p> <p>Over two years, her team here has laid out hexagonal plots four metres across, each about the size of a backyard trampoline. Industrial-strength heaters suspended several metres above the ground from metal scaffolding on the perimeter of three plots will heat the soil and undergrowth to 4C above the forest\u2019s ambient temperature. </p> <p>Wood is about to start up an experiment that may help climate scientists to figure out how jungles in the Amazon, the Congo and elsewhere will reacting to rising temperatures. Earth\u2019s equatorial band of forests might either slow down or speed up global warming, scientists say, depending on how it responds to higher temperatures.</p> <p>Each year fossil fuel exhaust adds about 30bn tonnes of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Half of it remains aloft. The rest is absorbed quickly \u2014 in about equal parts \u2014 by ocean water and plants on land, buffering the rate at which the insulating gas builds up. \u201cNature has done us a fantastic favour,\u201d says Scott Denning, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University, Fort Collins. </p> <p>But nature might not be so generous on a hotter planet, Denning says. While researchers expect little change in what the ocean does, vegetation on land, especially in the tropics, might soak up less or even convert into CO2 the vast stockpiles of carbon now locked up in their soils into CO2. </p> <p>Jerry Melillo, a scientist at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, said that increased atmospheric warming caused by CO2 emanating from tropical soil could further raise soil temperatures. The warmer soil could, in turn, release even more carbon dioxide, heating up the atmosphere even further. \u201cSo that warming will beget more warming.\u201d Some researchers say the mutually reinforcing feedback might be impossible to halt once set in motion.</p> <p>What happens in tropical jungles depends on how they respond to several anticipated changes: increased concentrations of CO2 in the air, warmer temperatures and changes in precipitation. Experiments have warmed up ecosystems elsewhere. Melillo has been heating a New England forest with buried cables since 1991. He says that for decades he\u2019s urging other scientists to run a similar experiment in the tropics.

One client, he says, has a checklist of 27 factors to compare various alternatives to London. These will include office space, infrastructure, language, the tax regime, ease of getting work visas for staff, the law, the local talent base, and the foreign investment track record, as well as proximity to London.</p> <p>On all of these Ireland scores well. A recent PwC report shows Ireland has gone up the rankings to overtake Luxembourg on a basket of factors.<br></p> <p>Owens believes the most obvious candidates for moving will be those working in fund management, rather than investment banking. Ireland is already a significant administrator of funds, second only to Luxembourg in Europe, he says.<br></p> <p>It also looks attractive from a legal point of view.

Nearly all banking contracts are based on British common law rather than the civil law system of Germany or France.</p> <p>As Ireland\u2019s legal system is also based on common law, document changes would be minimised. \u201cBanks would be very comforted by that,\u201d says Owens. \u201cRepapering would be a legal and administrative nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not just financial firms that might look west. Marina Donohoe, the EU and northern Europe director of Enterprise Ireland, says she has been fielding calls from other companies interested in the opportunities offered by being based in Ireland. \u201cWe are getting calls from people who are saying that they have been here for 10 years, \u2018I have got an engineering business, it is in the Midlands, I am employing and I am now thinking of moving lock, stock and barrel to Ireland, what is your interest in that?\u2019\u201d she said.</p> <h2>...to those who wait</h2> <p>Ireland has decades of experience luring multinationals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/07/google-ireland-staff-paid-less-than-half-their-london-colleagues\">such as Google</a>, Facebook and Pfizer to Dublin, with its low tax rates and anglophone, well-educated labour force.<br></p> <p>But capacity is a problem.

In women, lung cancer rates have peaked.</p> <p>That\u2019s because the proportion of adults in the US who smoke has decreased by about <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/tables/trends/cig_smoking\">50%</a> since the 1960s, due to public education, indoor smoking bans and higher prices due to higher tobacco taxes. This reduction happened despite the ongoing, vigorous efforts of tobacco companies to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/big-tobacco-aims-its-guns-to-kill-california-tobacco-tax-63750\">combat these public health initiatives</a>.</p> <p>Similar reductions in France and South Africa have been achieved <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1308383\">by increasing cigarette prices</a>.

You asked Google \u2013 here\u2019s the answer | Ranjana Srivastava</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Liver cancer: focus on vaccines and curing hepatitis C infections</h2> <p>Liver cancer is the <a href=\"http://globocan.iarc.fr/old/FactSheets/cancers/liver-new.asp\">second most common cause of cancer death worldwide</a>, killing about three-quarters of a million people. It is the <a href=\"http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/content/@research/documents/document/acspc-047079.pdf\">fifth most common cause of cancer death</a> in the US.</p> <p>The most common causes of liver cancer are infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus. In some countries the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11922091\">dietary contaminant aflatoxin</a>, produced by molds that grow on stored grains or nuts, exacerbates the risk that hepatitis B infection will cause liver cancer.</p> <p>Hepatitis B infection is almost entirely preventable by vaccination in infancy. In fact, an 80% decline in liver cancer rates has been observed in Taiwanese birth cohorts <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1089326115000021\">that have received the vaccination early in life</a>.</p> <p>While rates of infant hepatitis B vaccination are high around the world, <a href=\"http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/burden/vpd/surveillance_type/passive/HepB_map_schedule.jpg?ua=1\">many babies are still missing out</a>. Universal vaccination would lead to a further decline in liver disease and liver cancer globally.</p> <p>Hepatitis C causes about <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/carcin/bgp263\">a quarter of liver cancer</a> deaths worldwide. Curative therapies like the new drug <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/business/high-cost-of-hepatitis-c-drug-prompts-a-call-to-void-its-patents.html\">Sovaldi</a> may be another tool to prevent liver cancer. Researchers think that curing patients of their hepatitis C infection will prevent them from going on to develop liver cancer.</p> <p>But the current cost of these drugs is a <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMp1400160\">substantial barrier</a> to their use in both lower-income countries and in the US.</p> <p>However, in Egypt, public-private partnerships have made the drugs available <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/health/hepatitis-c-treatment-egypt.html\">at less than 1/100th</a> of their price in the United States. A vigorous international effort to use these new drugs to lower the number of infections would have a substantial impact on liver cancers caused by hepatitis C.</p> <p>Heavier <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/alcohol/alcohol-fact-sheet\">alcohol drinking also increases the risk</a> of liver cancer (as well as cancers of the breast, esophagus, pancreas, colon and rectum). According to the World Health Organization consumption has been increasing in the two most populous countries, <a href=\"http://gamapserver.who.int/gho/interactive_charts/gisah/consumption_change/atlas.html\">India and China</a>.</p> <h2>Cervical cancer: vaccines and Pap smears</h2> <p>Cervical cancer kills more than 250,000 women a year worldwide, making it the <a href=\"http://globocan.iarc.fr/old/summary_table_pop-html.asp?selection=224900&amp;title=World&amp;sex=2&amp;type=1&amp;window=1&amp;sort=2&amp;submit=%C2%A0Execute%C2%A0\">fourth-leading cause of cancer death among women</a>. In the US, however, <a href=\"http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/content/@research/documents/document/acspc-047079.pdf\">it is 14th</a>. From 1975 to 2012, the incidence of cervical cancer in the <a href=\"http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/cervix.html\">US decreased by half</a>, due to Pap smear tests screening and removal of precancerous lesions.</p> <p>However, almost all cases of cervical cancer are due to infection with the Human Papillomavirus (HPV), and we now have a vaccine against the main strains of HPV. In theory, cervical cancer is almost entirely preventable if HPV vaccination before the onset of sexual activity is followed by screening in adulthood to detect precancerous lesions caused by virus strains not covered by the vaccine. Yet the vaccine is not available <a href=\"http://www.gavi.org/uploadedImages/Types_of_support/NVS/HPV/HPV-vaccine-infographic-1600_source.jpg\">to most girls in the world</a>.</p> <p>The World Health Organization\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.who.int/immunization/programmes_systems/supply_chain/benefits_of_immunization/en/\">Expanded Program on Immunization</a> ensures that 85% of the world\u2019s young children now receive at least DPT vaccine against diptheria, pertussis and tetanus. This program created new distribution channels for vaccine and could be a model for increasing the number of prepubertal girls who receive the HPV vaccine.</p> <p>Making sure that more women around the world receive the decades-old Pap smear testing or introducing the new HPV tests would also help reduce cervical cancer incidence.</p> <h2>We can also tackle childhood leukemia and breast cancer</h2> <p>In developed countries, the most common form of childhood leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, is cured by conventional chemotherapy in over <a href=\"http://www.cancer.org/cancer/leukemiainchildren/detailedguide/childhood-leukemia-survival-rates\">80% of affected children</a>. These life-saving, relatively inexpensive drugs have been available in the US for decades. Yet in other parts of the world, most children with leukemia die because they do not receive treatment.</p> <p>Drugs like <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/research/10-years-tamoxifen\">Tamoxifen</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/breast-hormone-therapy-fact-sheet\">aromatase inhibitors</a> have decreased mortality from estrogen-fueled breast cancers in the developed world. Yet most women in the developing world with these cancers do not receive these inexpensive medications.</p> <p>While leukemia and breast cancer require relatively sophisticated diagnostic and treatment infrastructure, they don\u2019t require new treatments. The still-missing piece is the political will and funding to expand access to these long-established treatments.</p> <h2>Optimizing the technology and knowledge we already have</h2> <p>Pinning our hopes on new technologies isn\u2019t the only way to reduce cancer deaths worldwide. A moonshot-level impact could be guaranteed just by ensuring the interventions and treatments we already know to be effective are deployed around the world.</p> <p>Critically, we already have models that show how this can be done. Programs, such as <a href=\"http://www.pepfar.gov/\">the President\u2019s Emergency Fund for Aids Relief</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theglobalfund.org/en\">Global Fund for HIV, TB and Malaria</a> made lifesaving antiretroviral drugs available to millions of HIV patients by negotiating much lower drug prices. The programs also helped countries establish the necessary infrastructure to deliver the drugs and monitor patients.</p> <p>There is much more we can do to prevent cancer in the US. Although smoking rates have done down, <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/adult_data/cig_smoking/\">17% of adults still smoke</a>. Less than half of our teenage girls and boys received the recommended three doses of the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2011/p0825_hpv_vaccine.html\">HPV vaccine</a>. Racial disparities <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/research/areas/disparities\">still exist</a> in access to early detection and treatment of cancers.</p> <p>For the cancers we cannot prevent, we will always need new and better therapies. But we should not wait for future cures to do what we can to prevent cancer deaths around the world.</p> <p>We can choose to prevent many cancers and cancer deaths globally. In the words of <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/about/history/jsc40/jsc_gallery_people_image29.html\">President John F Kennedy</a> in launching the first moonshot:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>This story first appeared on <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us\">The Conversation</a>.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"counter\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/54077/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic&quot; alt=&quot;The Conversation&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",
  "<p>Son Heung-min is remembered at Bayer Leverkusen as an authentic global star; a player who scored important goals and fired Champions League qualifications and one who brought additional clout on the commercial front. Unfortunately for Son, who returns to his former club with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenham-hotspur\">Tottenham Hotspur</a> in the Champions League on Tuesday night, the manner of his departure remains fresh in the memory, too.</p> <p>Son began last season as a Leverkusen player, having started in the Bundesliga opener at home to Hoffenheim and the first leg of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague\">Champions League</a> play off away against Lazio. Then Tottenham ramped up their interest and, on the day before the return against Lazio, there was no sign of Son at Bayer\u2019s open training session.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/18/bayer-leverkusen-roger-schmidt-tottenham-mauricio-pochettino-champions-league\">Bayer Leverkusen\u2019s Roger Schmidt: 'I never wanted to be a football manager'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The South Korea international had been ill the previous weekend and he had missed Bayer\u2019s league fixture at Hannover. However, when he failed to make the game against Lazio, there was disappointment. Bayer were 1-0 down from the first leg and it felt as though they would need all of their attacking weapons.</p> <p>The Leverkusen sporting director, Rudi V\u00f6ller, said that Son \u201cwould not have played anyway because he was sick at the weekend\u201d but in the same interview he revealed that the forward had been in London to undergo his Tottenham medical. \u201cAt this moment, he is our player,\u201d Voller said, at the time. \u201cI saw many medicals in this business where there was no deal afterwards.\u201d</p> <p>It was a tough sell for V\u00f6ller and, you suspect, he knew it. On the upside, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/27/champions-league-riundup-bayer-leverkusen\">Bayer beat Lazio 3-0</a> to advance into the Champions League group phase but it is fair to say that some of the club\u2019s players and members of staff were unimpressed at Son\u2019s timing. Thirty-six hours later, Tottenham made the announcement that he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/28/tottenham-sign-son-heung-min-bayer-leverkusen-22m\">joined them on a five-year contract</a>.</p> <p>The incident stands to colour how the 24-year-old is welcomed back to the BayArena, with local commentators having predicted that his reception could be lukewarm. Son admitted on Monday that he was \u201cnot sure how it\u2019s going to be,\u201d although he made plain his affection for the club and its supporters. \u201cNacer Chadli didn\u2019t celebrate when he scored against us on Saturday [for West Bromwich Albion] and if I score on Tuesday, I will not celebrate,\u201d Son said. \u201cI respect Leverkusen too much.\u201d</p> <p>There is unlikely to be the venom that was directed towards Gonzalo Castro, the former Bayer trainee and club symbol, who moved to Borussia Dortmund over the summer and returned with his new employer at the beginning of the month. The 29-year-old\u2019s every touch during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/01/borussia-dortmund-bayer-leverkusen-bundesliga-match-report\">Bayer\u2019s 2-0 win</a> was jeered.</p> <p>But equally Son is not expected to receive the homecoming hero treatment, which is a pity because he did so much to endear himself during his two-year stint at the club. Never mind that it had long been clear Son saw the Bundesliga as a stepping stone to the Premier League, the way that he left \u2013 with the elements of friction \u2013 jarred with his nice-guy persona.</p> <p>Son is one of the nice guys. He has been almost bashful in his post-match dealings with the media in England and it says much about him that he lives in an unprepossessing apartment in Barnet with his parents. His transfer fee to Tottenham of \u00a322m made him the most expensive Asian footballer of all time and he is surely his continent\u2019s most recognisable, at present. Yet he is well known for his down-to-earth nature and one story from his Leverkusen days sums it up.</p> <p>The area has a sizeable Korean community and, when Bayer signed Son from Hamburg for a then club record \u20ac10m, their interest was piqued. A lot of Korean supporters attended Leverkusen matches and they would wait for Son by his car afterwards. There would be queues of 60 or 70 metres, with the fans wanting photographs or signatures. Son always obliged. His mother and father, who would be with him, routinely helped out by taking the pictures or smoothing the shirts for him to sign.</p> <p>Leverkusen previously had Michael Ballack but it was a different era when the Germany midfielder was rising to prominence with them at the turn of the millennium. Son represents worldwide box-office and the club were not slow to cash in on his appeal. Weeks after his arrival, they had signed a three-year deal with the South Korean company, LG Electronics, to make them their main sponsor and Son was installed as a brand ambassador. LG did not renew with Leverkusen over this past summer, largely because Son had left.</p> <p>Bayer also toured South Korea, at LG\u2019s invitation, in the summer of 2014, when they played a friendly against FC Seoul \u2013 the club at which Son had started his career at youth level. The soundtrack to Son\u2019s every move during the trip was provided by thousands of screaming girls.</p> <p>Son has long hooked the brands. When he was at Hamburg, another South Korean company, Kumho Tyre \u2013 who had previously sponsored Manchester United during Park Ji-sung\u2019s time at Old Trafford \u2013 agreed a two-year deal with them. In July of this year, Kumho linked up with Tottenham for two years. Tottenham\u2019s main sponsor is AIA, the pan-Asian insurance group, although they were in place before Son\u2019s arrival, while the club made Fun88 their Asian gaming partner over the summer. Fun88 had previously worked with Tottenham between 2012 and 2014.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"022bb7df0ff06b5492cabeff62b14bb23cafdcf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/022bb7df0ff06b5492cabeff62b14bb23cafdcf0/13_159_2979_1787/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Son Heung-min scored 29 goals in 87 appearances for Bayer Leverkusen \u2013 an impressive return for a wide attacker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Son Heung-min scored 29 goals in 87 appearances for Bayer Leverkusen \u2013 an impressive return for a wide attacker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lars Baron/Bongarts/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Son\u2019s association with Germany began when he was 16 and he swapped Seoul for the Hamburg academy \u2013 a move that advertised his determination to forge a successful career in Europe. He did not speak German or English when he arrived and the first year was tough.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know anybody and no one came with me,\u201d Son said. \u201cMy parents came when I moved to England. I felt so alone but so humble, because everyone was helping me. Sometimes, I missed Korea. It\u2019s my home and everyone misses their home when they are not there. But I wanted to play professional football in Europe and this was what I had to do.\u201d</p> <p>He credits Ruud Van Nistelrooy with helping him to settle. The Holland striker moved to Hamburg when Son was 17 while another Dutchman, Rafael Van Der Vaart, would be an influence. Van Der Vaart signed for Hamburg in the summer of 2012. \u201cVan Nistelrooy helped me a lot,\u201d Son said. \u201cHe saw my first training session and he talked to me. He told me I was a good player. He gave me confidence and I want to thank him for that. Also, Van Der Vaart came and he helped me. He told me more about English football and how tough it was. I tried to learn from what he was saying.\u201d</p> <p>Son has always felt like a young man in a hurry. He learned German quickly and, at 18, he scored on his debut for Hamburg. At Leverkusen, he scored 29 goals in 87 appearances \u2013 an impressive return for a wide attacker \u2013 and there were memorable ones, not least the winner against Werder Bremen on the final day of the 2013-14 Bundesliga season. Bayer had needed to win in order to secure fourth place ahead of Wolfsburg.</p> <p>In the Champions League play off at the start of the following season, he scored vital goals against Copenhagen while he helped Leverkusen to finish fourth again in the league. In both of his full seasons at the club, they reached the last 16 of the Champions League.</p> <p>Son returns to Germany on the crest of a wave, having scored five goals for Tottenham so far this season and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/02/heung-min-son-tottenham-manchester-city\">wowed, as a No9</a>, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/02/tottenham-hotspur-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">the 2-0 home win against Manchester City</a> at the beginning of the month \u2013 a game that was attended by the Leverkusen manager, Roger Schmidt.</p> <p>Son has put his disappointments from the summer behind him, chiefly, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/28/ottenham-son-heung-min-south-korea-olympic-disappointment\">quarter-final exit from the Rio Olympics</a> he endured with South Korea at the hands of Honduras and the uncertainty over his club future. His travails last season were well documented. After a lively start, he was set back by a foot injury and he flitted in and out of Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s starting XI. He was ready to leave in August, with several clubs from the Bundesliga interested in him, but Pochettino said no.<br></p> <p>The Olympic heartbreak served to fire the storyline about Son\u2019s military service which, according to South Korean law, all able-bodied males must begin before they turn 28 and which lasts for 21 months. Had South Korea won a medal of any colour in Rio, the players would have been excused the mandatory tour.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/15/west-bromwich-albion-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report\">Dele Alli strikes late to earn Tottenham draw at West Bromwich Albion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead the clock is ticking for Son, although he could yet gain exemption if he was to help his country win gold at the 2018 Asian Games. Tottenham have shut down questions on the subject and it has been possible to detect a nervousness about it from their side. However, it is understood, a solution is likely to be found that will not disrupt Son\u2019s football career. It could involve his service being postponed.</p> <p>Son did not go through pre-season at Tottenham last year \u2013 which is sometimes forgotten \u2013 as he joined them at the end of August, and he has benefited from working under Pochettino this time out. It was tougher than anything he had experienced in Germany; physically, he feels stronger.

Venus is often referred to as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/gallery/2007/nov/29/venus.express\">Earth\u2019s evil twin</a>, but conditions on the planet were not always so hellish, according to research that suggests it may have been the first place in the solar system to have become habitable.</p> <p>The study, due to be presented this week at the at the <a href=\"https://aas.org/meetings/dps48\">American Astronomical Society Meeting in Pasadena</a>, concludes that at a time when primitive bacteria were emerging on Earth, Venus may have had a balmy climate and vast oceans up to 2,000 metres (6,562 feet) deep.</p> <p>Michael Way, who led the work at the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City, said: \u201cIf you lived three billion years ago at a low latitude and low elevation the surface temperatures would not have been that different from that of a place in the tropics on Earth,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Venusian skies would have been cloudy with almost continual rain lashing down in some regions, however. \u201cSo while you might get nice sunsets you would have mostly overcast skies during the day and precipitation,\u201d Way added.</p> <p>Crucially, if the calculations are correct the oceans may have remained until 715m years ago - a long enough period of climate stability for microbial life to have plausibly sprung up.</p> <p>\u201cThe oceans of ancient Venus would have had more constant temperatures, and if life begins in the oceans - something which we are not certain of on Earth - then this would be a good starting place,\u201d said Way.</p> <p>Other planetary scientists agreed that, despite the differing fates of the two planets, early Earth and Venus may have been similar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4cf1d7e85f367bbe0be6c246c39dc0fa1ff957d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4cf1d7e85f367bbe0be6c246c39dc0fa1ff957d/0_4_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Artist\u2019s impression of an active volcano on Venus.

Environment-wise, probably Venus once had an ocean and probably the environment of Venus and the Earth might have been similar.\u201d</p> <p>With an average surface temperature of 462C (864F), Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system today, thanks to its proximity to the sun and its impenetrable carbon dioxide atmosphere, 90 times denser than Earth\u2019s.

In this virtual version, 2.9bn years ago Venus had an average surface temperature of 11C (52F) and this only increased to an average of 15C (59F) by 715m years ago, as the sun became more powerful.</p> <p>More precise measurements of the chemical makeup of Venus\u2019s surface and atmosphere could help establish how much water the planet had in the past, and when this began to disappear. </p> <p>Some of this information may be filled in by the Akatsuki mission, which is observing the Venusian weather systems in unprecedented detail. The spacecraft was supposed to enter orbit about the planet in 2010, but after its main engine blew out, it instead spent five years drifting around the sun like a miniature artificial planet. Last year, scientists used altitude thrusters to redirect it into an orbit, and the mission could yet answer longstanding questions about our planetary neighbour, including whether it has volcanic activity, whether lightning strikes in the sky and why its atmosphere is rotating 60 times faster than the planet itself.</p> <p>However, searching for traces of ancient microbial life would need a lander, and would be significantly more challenging.</p> <p>\u201cIt would take a great deal of technology development, and money of course, to build the requisite landing craft to survive the surface conditions of present day Venus and to be able to dig into the surface,\u201d said Way. \u201cBut if the investments were made it would be possible to search for such signs of life, including chemical traces.\u201d</p> <p>Details of the study are also published in the journal <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL069790/full\">Geophysical Research Letters</a>.</p>",

  "<p>\u201cMacrocritical resilience\u201d may be the most mystifying two-word phrase you need to know. Though you may never have heard these two words before, what they describe affects everything you live and strive for. Wonky as it sounds, it is a common sense idea: what generates value is more valuable than what we count in dollars. And yet, it is only in the last few years that we are truly beginning to understand that <em>macrocritical indicators</em>\u2014elements of human experience that shape the health and viability of the overall economy\u2014really do describe how and where value and capability come into being.</p> <p>On Christmas Eve, 2013, the small island nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines experienced the most intense rainfall in its history. 15 percent of gross domestic product was wiped out in just a few hours. In 2004, Hurricane Ivan caused $900 million worth of damage in Grenada\u2014more than twice the nation\u2019s GDP.

  "<p>The study of psychology is facing a crisis. A lot of research <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/aug/27/study-delivers-bleak-verdict-on-validity-of-psychology-experiment-results\"> doesn\u2019t show the same results</a> when the experiment is repeated, and it is critical we address this problem. But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2014/dec/17/ref-2014-why-is-it-such-a-big-deal\">Research Excellence Framework</a> has led to a research culture which is suffocating attempts to stabilise psychology in particular, and science in general. </p> <p>The Ref encourages universities to push for groundbreaking, novel, and exciting research in the form of 4* papers, but it does not reward the efforts of those who replicate studies. As universities gear up for the next Ref submission in 2021, many researchers will not even consider attempts to replicate results. </p> <h2>False information</h2> <p>The point of replicating a study is to test whether a statistically significant result will appear again if the experiment is repeated. Of course, a similar result may not appear \u2013 casting into question the validity of the results from the first experiment. </p> <p>Last year, the <a href=\"https://osf.io/vmrgu/\">Open Science Collaboration</a> attempted to replicate 100 studies from highly ranked psychological journals. While 97% of the original studies had a statistically significant result, just 36% of the replications had the same outcome. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/jun/08/scientists-arent-superheroes-failure-is-a-valid-result\">Scientists aren't superheroes \u2013 failure is a valid result</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Equally worrying: when an effect did appear, it was often much <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716.full\">smaller than previously thought</a>. </p> <p>Recent data calls into question some widely influential findings in psychological science. These problems are not confined to psychology however \u2013 many findings published in scientific literature may <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124\">actually be false</a>.</p> <p>Science is supposed to be self-correcting and reproducibility is a cornerstone of the scientific method. Yet, in the top 100 journals between 1900 and 2012, just<a href=\"http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/6/537\"> 1.6% of studies</a> were replications. We simply aren\u2019t invested in replicating findings. We all want to be good researchers and understand more about how the world works. So why are we so reluctant to check our conclusions are valid?</p> <h2>No incentive</h2> <p>One problem is the sheer volume of work \u2013 new publications emerge in the millions each year. But a larger issue is the systems we carry out our research in: US universities have a tenure model, where job security is achieved through high numbers of publications. In Australia, prestigious research fellowships are similarly focused on a \u201cpublish or perish\u201d mentality.</p> <p>Worryingly, many academics admit to engaging <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/23/5/524\">in at least one </a>questionable research practice in order to achieve publication. Examples of this include: coming up with a hypotheses after data is collected, stopping collecting data when an effect appears in case it disappears later, or only reporting the significant effects from collected data. Others simply fabricate data \u2013 Dutch psychologist Diederik Stapel shockingly falsified data from<a href=\"http://retractionwatch.com/2015/12/08/diederik-stapel-now-has-58-retractions/\"> more than 50 studies</a>.</p> <p> In the UK, the Ref ranks the published works of researchers according to their originality (how novel is the research?), significance (does it have practical or commercial importance?), and rigour (is the research technically sound?). Outputs are then awarded one to four stars. </p> <p>While research publications with 1* rankings are only recognised nationally for their originality, significance, and rigour, 4* rankings are considered world-leading. The cumulative total of 3* and 4* papers determines research funding allocation and has a knock-on effect on institutional position in league tables and therefore attractiveness to students. Obviously, the more publications the better.</p> <h2>Novelty bias</h2> <p>On the face of it, the Ref works quite well because it rewards quality work \u2013 it is better to publish fewer articles containing highly original and significant work. Those who do criticise it argue that the assessment process is overly <a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2011/06/10/ref-alternative-harzing-google-scholar/\">complex and expensive</a> and that universities can, and do, <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/twenty-per-cent-contracts-rise-in-run-up-to-ref/2007670.article\">game the system</a>. </p> <p>But we argue that these criticisms miss a bigger and more fundamental issue: the Ref completely undermines our efforts to produce a reliable body of knowledge. </p> <p>Why? The focus on originality and accessibility \u2013 publications exploring new areas of research using new paradigms, and avoiding testing well-established theories \u2013 is the exact opposite of what science needs to be doing to solve the troubling replication crisis. According to Ref standards, replicating an already published piece of work is simply uninteresting.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2014/dec/15/research-excellence-framework-five-reasons-not-fit-for-purpose\">Five reasons why the REF is not fit for purpose\u202c\u202c\u202c</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A BMJ study has shown that in science abstracts published between 1974 and 2015, the use of the words \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d, \u201cinnovative\u201d, and \u201cnovel\u201d <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h6467\">increased by 2500%</a>.

There would be charges of corporate manslaughter brought\u201d.</p> <p>At the tribunal, the NCB\u2019s lawyers argued that the collapse was due to a \u201ccritical geological environment\u201d and insisted there was no way of knowing that a slide was foreseeable. </p> <p>Edwards wrote: \u201cThis was the line Lord Robens had given to a (mostly gullible and deferential) press when he finally appeared in Aberfan some 36 hours after the disaster happened... Robens had powerful friends in politics and, it goes without saying, in the press\u201d.</p> <p>Gullible and deferential? And, it would appear, some were even willing to accept a muzzle. Before the tribunal opened, the attorney general, Elwyn Jones, <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/ukresilience/response/recovery_guidance/case_studies/g1_aberfan.aspx\">\u201cimposed restrictions on speculation in the media about the causes of the disaster\u201d</a>. </p> <p>Imposed restrictions on the media? Imagine that. Not that every editor obeyed, of course, but Robens - despite some reputational damage - went on, remarkably, to chair a government inquiry into workplace health and safety.</p> <p>A further point. Edwards believes there \u201cis a powerful parallel between the conduct and response of the NCB in 1966 and that of South Yorkshire police after Hillsborough in 1989\u201d. </p> <p>They were \u201cpublic bodies, led by strong-willed men, seemingly determined to put institutional face-saving before the needs of bereaved families\u201d.</p> <p>But there is an even more powerful parallel: in both instances, several newspapers allowed themselves to be spun by those institutions. That was a classic case of gullibility and deference. </p> <p>*Aberfan: The Fight for Justice is being screened on BBC1 tomorrow (18 October) at 10.45pm<br></p> <p>See also two recent Guardian articles,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/01/cantata-people-aberfan-karl-jenkins\"> A cantata for the people of Aberfan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/09/aberfan-50-years-owen-sheers-the-green-hollow-film-poem\">Aberfan 50 years on</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The full extent of the difficulties Pearson is facing following the sale of the Financial Times to focus on education has been laid bare, as jittery investors sent its share price tumbling 10% after the company reported worse than expected sales.</p> <p>Pearson\u2019s chief executive, John Fallon, sold the FT in 2015, as well as its 50% stake in the publisher of the Economist, for more than \u00a31.3bn to focus on Pearson\u2019s educational publishing business.</p> <p>Fallon\u2019s predecessor Marjorie Scardino, who had tidied up Pearson\u2019s sprawling conglomerate by selling assets including Madame Tussauds and Alton Towers theme park, tenaciously defended the ownership of the FT, memorably declaring she would sell the business newspaper \u201cover my dead body\u201d. Pearson had owned the paper for 58 years.</p> <p>However, Fallon, the former head of Pearson\u2019s international education division promoted to run the company in 2013, had few qualms selling off what had become non-core assets in its strategy to focus on global education.</p> <p>Since then the world\u2019s largest educational publisher has found itself facing tough trading conditions, reporting that underlying sales fell 7% in the first nine nine months of the year, and 9% in North America, its biggest market.</p> <p>Pearson blamed sluggish demand for higher education textbooks in the US as well as a decline in its exam marking businesses in the UK and America.</p> <p>Pearson looked to allay negative sentiment about the revenues decline by reiterating its full-year financial guidance, and pointed to a boost from the strength of the US dollar against the pound since the Brexit vote.</p> <p>However, jittery investors focused on the issue of sales which fell short of analysts\u2019 forecasts of 5-6% decline. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Pearson said sales trends had improved in September and October which, combined with cost cuts, enabled the company to stick with its forecast of adjusted operating profit of between \u00a3580m to \u00a3620m this year.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWhile market conditions continue to be challenging, particularly in higher education, thanks to tight cost management we are on track to deliver our guidance this year and to achieve our long-term growth goal,\u201d said Fallon.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The company added that if the pound continued to remain weak this year the earnings-per-share guidance range would increase by about 4.5p to 59.5p.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Pearson, which still owns a minority stake in book giant Penguin Random House in a joint venture with German firm Bertelsmann, announced in January that it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/21/pearson-cut-jobs-profit-warning\">cutting 4,000 jobs</a>.<br></p> <p>The company said 90% of those losses, which account for 10% of its global workforce, were complete. The cuts, which will incur a \u00a3320m restructuring bill this year, were announced after the company issued <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://%20https//www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/21/pearson-shares-profits-warning\">two profit warnings in three months</a>. Pearson said as a result of the \u201csimplification\u201d programme the company would save \u00a3350m a year.</p> <p>Thomas Singlehurst, an analyst at Citi, said Pearson\u2019s results were a mixed bag for investors. \u201cThe good news is that Pearson has reiterated its 2016 and 2018 guidance,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bad news is that while guidance has been reiterated, the third-quarter organic growth was -7% at group level and -9% in North America.\u201d</p> <p>Pearson is expected to sell off its 47% stake in Penguin Random House, the world\u2019s largest book publisher spanning titles including Fifty Shades of Grey, The Girl on the Train and Pippa Middleton and Nigella Lawson\u2019s recipe and craft books, next year.</p> <p>A sale of the business, which makes about \u00a3400m in profits and is valued at more than \u00a32.3bn, would mark Pearson\u2019s final exit from its once considerable non-education focused publishing empire.</p> <p>If the partnership with Bertlesmann were to reach five years \u2013 the joint venture deal was completed in 2013 \u2013 the companies have the option to sell shares in Penguin Random House in an initial public offering.</p> <p>Pearson held a conference call with analysts to explain its rationale for continuing to expect to hit full year financial expectations despite deteriorating sales.</p> <p>Ian Whittaker, an analyst at Liberum, said that it was an \u201cunconvincing call that will raise more doubts\u201d. Whittaker said the group\u2019s 7% decline in revenues was \u201cunlikely\u201d to recover in the final quarter of the year.</p> <p>\u201cTheir attempt to put the blame for US higher education weakness on bookstores\u2019 changing their buying patterns were not convincing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd their explanations as to why things will get better sound unconvincing.\u201d</p> <p>Liberum compared the financial performance and strategy of Pearson as akin to that of newspaper publishers, ironic given the company\u2019s recent exit from the newspaper market.</p> <p>\u201cPearson will resemble more and more the newspaper stocks, which are meeting earnings numbers by cost savings but seeing significant top-line declines,\u201d said Whittaker. \u201c[The trading update] is more evidence for Pearson being the \u2018new newspapers\u2019.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The Paris Agreement on Climate Change has been a big surprise to many. All countries agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, keeping the world \u201cwell below\u201d 2\u00b0C or even at 1.5\u00b0C of warming. By including the 1.5\u00b0C target, the Agreement has become more ambitious than many observers had expected. And the party is still not over: against the odds, countries required less than a year for the Agreement to enter into force. This seems a triumph for climate diplomacy.</p> <p>However, there is to date not a good understanding of how the world could swiftly enter into a period of substantial and sustained emission reductions. Therefore, the adoption of the 1.5\u00b0C target went along with an invitation to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to map out the state of the scientific knowledge on the 1.5\u00b0C goal in a report due in autumn 2018. <a href=\"http://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/press-release-detail/article/mcc-researcher-nominated-for-ipcc-expert-meeting.html\">A scoping meeting in Geneva in August of this year convened more than 60 experts and government officials</a> to determine the outline of such an assessment.</p> <p>While the IPCC had a pivotal role in generating a shared understanding of the nature and risks of climate change, it now needs to be more focused on responses to climate change. The costs, benefits and risks of political decisions need more systematic analysis and evaluation.</p> <p>The science so far suggests enormous challenges: the remaining net amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that can still be released to the atmosphere in order to keep temperature rise below 1.5\u00b0C is at best 200 Gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub>. With yearly emissions at around 40 Gt CO<sub>2</sub>, this leaves no more than five years at current rates of emissions. After this point, every single ton of carbon released by households, factories or cars would need to be taken back out of the atmosphere. Furthermore, countries\u2019 pledges to reduce emissions in the short-term - the intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) - are insufficient. In fact, the new energy infrastructure that is already in the pipeline for the coming years \u2013 most importantly coal-fired power plants - will quickly eat up the remaining budget. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/apps/eventmanager/documents/40/210920161009-Doc.11-Outline1.5.pdfhttp:/www.ipcc.ch/apps/eventmanager/documents/40/210920161009-Doc.11-Outline1.5.pdf\">suggested outline for the IPCC Special Report on the 1.5\u00b0C goal</a>, which is currently under discussion at the IPCC\u2019s plenary in Bangkok, includes a separate chapter that deals with the matter of how we can address these challenges. This would mean that finally the dissonance between ambition and action would be tackled. This dissonance is especially prevalent in three areas:</p> <p>First, achievement of the 1.5\u00b0C target is fundamentally dependent on our ability to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at large-scale: the available science suggests that 10 to 25 years of current emissions will need to be stored under the Earth\u2019s crust. If possible at all, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate2870.html\">this will require a range of CO<sub>2</sub> removal technologies</a>. Despite agreeing on highly ambitious climate targets, policymakers and negotiators show limited awareness of this technological dependence: none of the INDCs mentions negative emissions or carbon removal and very few have plans for advancing carbon capture and storage (CCS). So far, science has not come forward with systematic explorations of the role of carbon dioxide removal technology portfolios in climate change mitigation. How much carbon dioxide removal we need depending on alternative policy packages is still largely unexplored. For example, slower decarbonization in key sectors like transport, industry and agriculture will likely lead to a larger dependence on CO<sub>2</sub> removal.</p> <p>Second, negative emissions technologies such as carbon capture and storage and other large-scale climate change mitigation strategies have been subject to intense criticism, mostly due to the pressure on land that is needed for food and shelter for a growing world population. </p> <p>Above all, however, the IPCC will need to make progress in evaluating climate and energy policies. The entire focus of the climate debate is now shifting towards the question of how the required emission reductions can be achieved quickly enough. A precondition for supporting short-term action with robust science is to learn fast what policies work well and what policies do not. Unless the IPCC manages to put a new emphasis on solving the climate change challenge right at the core of its assessments, it risks becoming increasingly irrelevant. Given the immense, almost inconceivable challenges imposed by the 1.5\u00b0C, the Special Report is the ideal starting point for this shift.</p> <p>The risk is that the report will be business-as-usual, shedding little light on policy performance: the short-term features of mitigation and development pathways are present in the suggested outline, but are not prominent. It is therefore critical for the approval of the report outline to keep in mind that the Special Report does not only cover what would be needed in the second half of the century, but also takes into account the short term, including the amount of carbon-intensive infrastructure currently planned or under construction. </p> <p>For the IPCC - a hybrid organization that brings together scientists and policymakers in a well-formalized dialogue - conducting insightful policy assessments will bring new challenges. Rather than deepening conflict between scientists and policymakers, finding ways to synthesise knowledge without blaming and shaming countries needs to be the focus now.</p> <p>The IPCC Special Report on 1.5\u00b0C is an opportunity for the scientific community to deliver the insight needed by negotiators. An adoption of the suggested outline in Bangkok will already send the right signals to scientists and negotiators at when they meet next month in Marrakech. The time has come to bridge the gap between ambitions and action.</p>",

I was present as a student, and he shared many insights with me. It\u2019s one of the reasons I became so interested in urban matters.<br></p> <p>At university, I had believed that socialism would efficiently achieve high saving rates and high economic development \u2013 and produce greater equality. In fact I discovered it produced neither, so I became more and more interested in human settlements. I realised the way we build cities is much more important for the future happiness of people than economic development. For example, if we are able to save a couple of hectares of land for a public park, it can make people happier for thousands of years to come.</p> <p><strong>Forty years on, what is the most important issue cities need to tackle today?</strong><br></p> <p>Simply, land. Private property and the commercial market does not work in the case of land around growing cities \u2013 because when prices increase, the supply does not increase. It\u2019s not like the market for potatoes, or ketchup.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If all citizens are equal, then the public good should prevail over private interest</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The way cities grow should not be dictated by private interests, but by the government, which can identify the best places for development \u2013 to minimise transport distances and allow great parks to be created. Government intervention in land is crucial for the creation of good cities.</p> <p> Wherever possible, we must protect the principal of the public good prevailing over private interests \u2013 meaning the power of \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain\">eminent domain</a>\u201d should be imposed frequently. It is crucial to maintain control of the land, and to be able to acquire land or buildings to public spaces, parks, roads and housing projects for the city.</p> <p>There should never be private waterfronts in a democratic urban area. We are talking about the basic democratic principle which states that all citizens are equal. And if all citizens are equal, then all of them have the right to the same amount of road space, and the public good should prevail over private interest, and we should never have a golf course when there are no parks around.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f19c929db0b03d856a63edfcb88a6c426d5bd2f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f19c929db0b03d856a63edfcb88a6c426d5bd2f0/0_3_2784_1670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa\u2019s father organised the first Habitat conference in 1976.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guillermo Legaria/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You have long pioneered the importance of cycling and public transport in Bogot\u00e1. Do you feel vindicated by what you\u2019re seeing in cities around the world today?</strong><br></p> <p> When we introduced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/bogota-empowering-citizens-to-cycle\">bicycle paths in Bogot\u00e1 nearly 20 years ago</a>, when I was mayor here the first time, it was seen as a crazy idea. Back then, there were no bikeways in London, Paris, Madrid or New York. Now, of course, so many people are interested in this movement \u2013 particularly young people.</p> <p> Cities that move by bicycle and public transport are more democratic, more egalitarian. In a \u201cdeveloping country\u201d, a protected bikeway is not just a way of keeping the cyclist safe; it is a symbol that shows that a citizen riding a $50 bicycle is equally important to one driving a $50,000 car.</p> <p><strong>Yet most cities are still horribly clogged with traffic \u2026</strong><br></p> <p> Mobility is a very peculiar challenge for a city \u2013 different from health or education \u2013 because it\u2019s one problem that tends to get worse as societies get richer. But above all, we must understand that an advanced city is not one where poor residents use cars, but one where rich residents use public transport.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/13/utopian-future-lagos-what-african-cities-really-need-un-habitat-3\">I dream of a utopian Lagos \u2013 but here's what African cities really need to prosper</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If all citizens are equal, then somebody who is walking or on a bike has a right to the same amount of road space as somebody in a Rolls-Royce or luxury car. And a bus with 150 passengers has a right to 150 times more road space than a car with one passenger. Which means we should give exclusive lanes to buses and create Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems; it\u2019s the only solution.</p> <p>In Bogot\u00e1, our BRT has the same speed and the same capacity as a subway; indeed, we move more passengers per hour than any subway in Europe. And in the future, we will ensure \u2013 either via the new subway or BRT lines \u2013 that more than 80% of the city\u2019s population lives less than 1km from a mass transit line.<br></p> <p>Bogot\u00e1 has many problems and many failings, but one thing that is advanced here is that everybody accepts that buses should have exclusive lanes in every important road. Nobody questions that \u2013 even the people in cars who don\u2019t like it, they don\u2019t dare say it publicly.</p> <p>The whole challenge of urban mobility is not an engineering challenge but a political one.

Crime-prevention is crucial in this, because normally when there is too much crime, those most affected are women, children or the elderly.</p> <p>If you find trout in a mountain stream, it means the water is very pure, because the trout is a very delicate fish, susceptible to dirty water and a lack of oxygen. This is known as a \u201cspecies indicator\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If women feel comfortable walking at night in a city, that's a good sign</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the same way, I have always said that a species indicator for a good city is to see children by themselves in a street, or elderly people, people in wheelchairs, or women by themselves. If women feel comfortable walking at night in a city, this is a good sign.</p> <p>Conversely, crime is a huge problem for cities because it kills public space. I like to say that when shopping malls replace public space as a meeting place for people, it\u2019s a symptom that the city is ill.</p> <p><strong>What should the priority be for everyone gathering in Quito for Habitat III? </strong><br></p> <p> The main urban challenges of course come in developing-country cities, which are growing very rapidly. Even in a Latin American city such as Bogot\u00e1, in a country like Colombia which is already largely urbanised [about 75-80% urban] \u2013 even here, the built area of the city will more than double over the next 40 years.</p> <p>But in India, Asia and Africa, the built area of cities will increase by a multiple of 10 or more over the next 50 years \u2013 and therefore, I believe the biggest challenges are those cities that are yet to be built. </p> <p>These are not only the biggest challenges but the biggest possibilities, because we can make cities that are totally different \u2013 and better than those that exist today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6ef60229af774b0c2ed489d750df6626559cb1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6ef60229af774b0c2ed489d750df6626559cb1f/0_0_5130_3407/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Transit line in Bogota\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pe\u00f1alosa hopes that in the future, 80% of the city\u2019s population will live less than 1km away from a BRT line.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Coletti/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I would say there is not one developing-country city with more than 50% of streets where someone in a wheelchair can go from one corner to the other. In most of these cities, it\u2019s less than 10% of their streets.</p> <p>The biggest problem for cities has to do with equity: the right to have access to a park, the right to have access to transportation, to have access not just to the obvious things \u2013 health, food, education \u2013 but also to sports facilities and music lessons, to green spaces, and things like this.<br></p> <p><strong>Should cities have more control over their own destiny?</strong><br></p> <p>Many people say that cities should be given more control by their national governments \u2013 but I think what\u2019s even worse than having governments controlling cities is having a myriad of municipalities, each one doing whatever they want. It\u2019s completely mad.</p> <p> In Colombia, we have a constitution which gives a lot of independence to municipalities. If they are located exactly where a city needs to grow, they can simply decide \u201cno\u201d. And so that city is instead forced to grow very far away, in a low-density suburban development. </p> <p>The important thing in the relationship between national and local government is that we redistribute resources and responsibilities in a rational way. We must create institutions where you can really plan a large city well, and redistribute income from rich areas to poor areas.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/12/global-rise-female-mayors\">Can cities be feminist?

But I believe that conception is too Euro-centric; too \u201cadvanced city-centric\u201d, because I think developing-country cities which have not yet been built could be much better than London or Paris or New York.</p> <p>For example, they could be criss-crossed by hundreds of kilometres of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenway_(landscape)\">greenways</a>. For London, say, it is impossible to have 2,000km of greenways criss-crossing it in every direction \u2013 it\u2019s too late. But it\u2019s very easy for the African and Asian cities that are yet to be built to have this.</p> <p>There are so many possibilities to conceive a different kind of metropolis, for cities that are yet to be built. This is something you cannot do in New York or Paris, but it\u2019s very easy to do in the new urban areas that are going to be built in Asia and African cities, and even in some parts of Latin America.</p> <p>Right now, most developing-country cities really are not places for happy life; they are not places where rich and poor meet together in public spaces. They are very far from what good European cities are \u2013 and even further from the better cities that we could be making now.</p> <p><em>Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa is the current mayor of Bogot\u00e1.

As we speak the Labor left is having a specially convened caucus meeting to deal with tensions that have boiled over since <strong>Bill Shorten</strong> last Friday night backed his friend and factional ally, the controversial lawyer <strong>Kimberley Kitching</strong>, to replace the departing <strong>Stephen Conroy</strong>.<br></p> <p>Let\u2019s keep this as simple as possible. Tensions in the Victorian left have been bubbling away for months, ever since the majority of the faction tried to run the veteran leftwing powerbroker, <strong>Kim Carr</strong>, off the front bench. Folks aligned with Carr have been cranky that some of their Victorian colleagues lined up with colleagues in Sydney to try and remove Carr from the frontbench after the election.</p> <p>Let\u2019s call that a pre-existing condition.</p> <p>Then there was the Kitching transaction last week. Victorian Labor has been absolutely off the long run since Shorten decided he wanted Kitching in the Senate. Normally sedate people were quite literally tearing their hair out over that turn of events. Shorten was advised in the strongest possible terms not to bring Kitching to Canberra, that it would stir up animosities in the Labor caucus.</p> <p>It appears to have done exactly that. <strong>Gavin Marshall</strong> (a long time Carr ally) decided to tell Fairfax Media early on Monday that he might come after a couple of sitting MPs in the left when preselection time rolled around. He named <strong>Andrew Giles</strong> and <strong>Catherine King</strong>, the shadow health minister. </p> <p>Folks should know by way of background that Marshall lost a position he held in the last parliament, deputy Senate president, in the fight over Carr and the front bench. Clearly he\u2019s not that happy about it, and thought he might have a vent about people he views as being disloyal.</p> <p>The non-Carr left is now unhappy to put it mildly, hence tonight\u2019s special caucus meeting to determine whether peace can be declared, or whether things escalate.<br></p> <p>We can cut to the chase here, now all the background has been declared.<strong> Bill Shorten is the leader of the Labor party because he was underpinned institutionally by support from Conroy (now departed) and Carr (now the subject of acrimony from his factional fellow travellers).</strong><br></p> <p>That underpinning has been eroded since Conroy\u2019s departure. The caucus is something of a tinderbox after the Kitching decision. That might sound like an exaggeration, but it isn\u2019t. <strong>Malcolm Turnbull</strong> once talked about exciting times.

Darcy, the other potential father, is also alive and well, after being killed off in the previous book.

Where the romance is concerned, as always with Bridget, there\u2019s an abiding atmosphere of French farce \u2013 her suitors not quite jumping in and out of wardrobes, crying: \u201cOoh la la!\u201d, but you get the general drift.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In this day and age, Cleaver still groaning on about Bridget\u2019s \u201cmummy pants\u201d comes across as tragic, tacky, even creepy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Elsewhere, the \u201csmug marrieds\u201d have morphed into \u201csmug mums\u201d (before she becomes pregnant, Bridget is poisonously hailed as \u201ceveryone\u2019s favourite godmother\u201d), and our heroine has recurring cravings for \u201ccheesy potatoes\u201d.

It\u2019s all played for laughs, which would be fine, but while there are some good moments (Bridget\u2019s silly work environment is lampooned particularly well), the humour falls too flat, too often. While Bridget has always existed in a benign, idealised, feelgood annexe of real life, in an era when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/oct/09/sharon-horgan-queen-of-difficult-women\" title=\"\">Sharon Horgan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/21/rob-delaney-interview-catastrophe\" title=\"\">Rob Delaney</a> have dealt with pregnancy so pithily in <em>Catastrophe</em>, it just doesn\u2019t do for these baby diaries to feel so dated and soppy.</p> <p>There\u2019s also a problem with the two men she\u2019s torn between \u2013 the book needs us to believe, along with Bridget, that they\u2019re worth it, that they\u2019re \u201ctwo halves of the perfect man\u201d when, frankly, they\u2019re not. In this day and age, Cleaver still groaning on about Bridget\u2019s \u201cmummy pants\u201d comes across as tragic, tacky, even borderline creepy, while \u201canally retentive\u201d boarding school casualty Darcy is little better \u2013 constantly reacting to Bridget\u2019s behaviour by being pained and mortified, in a way that comes across as passive-aggressive. While both men are written as desirable in different ways, in truth, they\u2019re as grotty and tiresome as each other. You find yourself wishing for the payoff: \u201cReader, I dumped him.\u201d</p> <p>None of which matters so long as Bridget herself remains supremely relatable. Just as Harry Potter would be nothing without his spectacles and scar, Bridget wouldn\u2019t work without her much-vaunted everywoman superpower. Even when feminism fretted about Bridget\u2019s obsessions with men and weight, there was never any denying that she was a lively, defiant totem for the relaxed female psyche that didn\u2019t give a hoot for political correctness. With this book, Bridget remains relatable: though not so much as everywoman, more That Woman You Used to Know and Like. Moreover, this is only achieved with the backup of the considerable (and deserved) goodwill she and her creator have stored up over the years. Be careful, Ms Fielding, your franchise is showing distinct signs of wear and tear.

  "<p>\u201cWhat do you wonder?\u201d That is the question the Science Museum has been asking for many months now, in posters, celebrity videos and in online images. It\u2019s been part of the museum\u2019s strategy to ramp up excitement around its new \u201cWonderlab\u201d gallery, a space full of interactive science exhibits designed to inspire children. But what many have been wondering is how Statoil, a major oil and gas company with plans to drill up to seven new wells in the Arctic, was allowed to become the gallery\u2019s title sponsor? Welcome to Wonderlab \u2013 the Science Museum\u2019s latest ethical contradiction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/10/science-museum-condemned-for-oil-company-sponsorship\">Science Museum condemned for oil company sponsorship</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The museum has attempted to defend its decision to work with Statoil. In response to a Freedom of Information request, it highlighted that Statoil is a legally operating company in the UK. The trouble is, we live in a world where \u201clegal\u201d, at least at the corporate level, does not always align with \u201cethical\u201d. When Statoil\u2019s business plan goes against both the overwhelming evidence on climate change and the targets agreed by world leaders in the Paris Climate deal, it seems bizarre that the company\u2019s activity is still deemed acceptable, especially by a museum of science. The research organisation, Oil Change International, recently <a href=\"http://priceofoil.org/2016/09/22/the-skys-limit-report/\">crunched the numbers</a> underlying those targets signed in Paris. Their conclusion? That if we are to meet a 2-degree, let alone a 1.5-degree temperature target, then \u201cNo new fossil fuel extraction or transportation infrastructure should be built\u201d. </p> <p>In Australia, Statoil is still considering plans to drill a series of ultra deepwater wells in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/07/karoon-gas-given-permit-to-search-for-oil-in-great-australian-bight\">Great Australian Bight</a> \u2013 an internationally recognised whale sanctuary \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/11/bp-ditches-plans-to-drill-for-oil-in-the-great-australian-bight\">despite the decision this week of its strategic partner, BP, to pull out</a>. The two companies had previously joined forces to host a <a href=\"http://www.bp.com/en_au/australia/environment-society/community-grants.html\">grants scheme</a> for community groups in the region. While those accepting grants undertake important work for their communities, the scheme itself represents a very cheap way for multinational oil and gas companies with big budgets to effectively buy favour among key stakeholders. Statoil\u2019s sponsorship of Wonderlab comes from exactly the same \u201ccorporate social responsibility\u201d playbook. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.facebook.com/progressivescience/videos/1239938962730386/\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"400\" height=\"224\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/video/embed?video_id=1239938962730386\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Protestors talk about Statoil\u2019s sponsorship Of the new Science Museum\u2019s new Wonderlab Gallery.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The company\u2019s sponsorship of Wonderlab may look like a generous gesture from outside but in reality, Statoil is buying a social legitimacy it does not deserve \u2013 and it is particularly sinister to purchase that legitimacy at the expense of young people who will inherit a world with an unstable climate. This is an attempt to associate the future of science and technology with fossil fuels at a time when society and policy makers have finally accepted that that it is not compatible with a sustainable future and a stable climate. As the impacts of climate change intensify and the world shifts away from fossil fuels, the Science Museum will look ever more out of touch with the words \u201cthe Statoil gallery\u201d emblazoned upon its walls.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2016/may/20/the-science-museum-is-free-so-what-is-bp-buying\">The Science Museum is free \u2013 so what is BP buying?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Science Museum has previously had sponsorship deals with a range of unethical sponsors, from arms companies such as Airbus, to other fossil fuel companies such as BP and Shell. When Shell\u2019s influence over the Science Museum\u2019s climate science gallery was unearthed last year following Freedom of Information requests, the museum\u2019s director, Ian Blatchford, <a href=\"https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/funders-and-our-climate-science-gallery/\">sought to defend</a> the museum\u2019s engagement with fossil fuel funders. He wrote \u201cWhen it comes to the major challenges facing our society, from climate change to inspiring the next generation of engineers, we need to be engaging with all the key players including governments, industry and the public, not hiding away in a comfortable ivory tower.\u201d</p> <p>In reality, Blatchford is the one in the ivory tower \u2013 and not just because of the museum\u2019s ties to Statoil. Wonderlab replaces the museum\u2019s Launchpad gallery, a hub of interactive science exhibits designed to engage and inspire children. But unlike its predecessor, Wonderlab comes with an entry charge. Earlier this year, the science communication academic Dr Emily Dawson <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/per/?p=7065\">noted that</a> \u201ccharging for the museum\u2019s most popular children\u2019s gallery sends a clear message that science is for some families, but not for all\u201d. Thus Wonderlab represents a science communication mess as well as an ethical one.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>While the museum\u2019s decision to offer free school visits will allow some children from disadvantaged backgrounds the opportunity to experience Wonderlab, Dawson argues that \u201cit is not enough to use school visits as a panacea for exclusive practice\u201d. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/monitor-wave3-summary-wellcome-apr16.pdf\">Research recently undertaken</a> by the Wellcome Trust showed that likelihood of visiting a science museum or centre is related to social class. Entry charges are not the only obstacle in the way of public access to science, but perhaps the most symbolic for a major cultural institution - particularly where the primary audience is children.</p> <p>Museums clearly do face difficulties in a period of spending cuts, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/jun/06/science-museum-group-manchester-london\">but the Science Museum seems dogged by poor decision making in this area</a>. Young people should not pick up the bill for government cuts, nor should they encounter science branded by a company that is not genuinely invested in their future. It is perfectly reasonable to question the supposed \u201cgenerosity\u201d of this multi-billion dollar oil company. Why did the Science Museum decide that, despite going to an unethical sponsor with an image problem for funding, it still needed to introduce an entry charge? A <a href=\"https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/keep-the-science-museum-s-children-s-galleries-free\">petition</a> drawing out the connection between these two issues \u2013 access to science and access to oil \u2013 has already gained over 41 thousand signatures, and the numbers continue to grow. This is a stark signal of just how out of touch the museum has become - its time to think again.<br></p> <p><em>Dr Chris Garrard is a composer, researcher and activitist at </em><a href=\"http://www.artnotoil.org.uk/\"><em>Art Not Oil</em></a></p>",

  "<p>According to Women on the Tools, <a href=\"http://womenonthetools.org.uk/\">just 1% of people</a> working in manual trade are female. Women aren\u2019t just under-represented in skilled trades, they are almost entirely absent. So why is the sector so male-dominated? </p> <p>We asked our female readers to share their experiences of working in skilled trades. From tales of sexism to supportive colleagues, here are their stories:<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I often feel like the 'token woman', and not treated as an equal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2>Blokes would look me up and down and objectify me</h2> <p>Sometimes I feel things have not moved on [since the 1950s] in most manual trade workplaces. I have often felt like the \u201ctoken woman\u201d, employed to make the company look good but not treated as an equal. When I first started, blokes would look me up and down and objectify me. You need a thick skin and you have to prove yourself time and time again. But my boss and the colleague I work with have been brilliant. I\u2019m lucky to have found colleagues like that because they are very rare. Change simply isn\u2019t going to happen without more women coming into the industry. It isn\u2019t easy, but it\u2019s worth it. <br><em>Holli Brooks, who works in maintenance</em></p> <h2>If I work in my normal clothes they whistle and stare. I\u2019ve had several of them touch my bum \u2018for a laugh\u2019</h2> <p>At my current company, I\u2019m the only female joiner in a workshop of 40 men. It\u2019s a funny dynamic. When I first started they were just impressed that I did my job and didn\u2019t complain. They expected me to whinge and be incompetent so I think there was a certain amount of respect when I didn\u2019t and I wasn\u2019t. They tell me they think it\u2019s great, that there should be more women [in the industry], but at the same time there\u2019s little consideration for what it\u2019s like to be the only woman. If I come to work in my normal clothes they whistle and stare. I\u2019ve had several of them touch my bum \u201cfor a laugh\u201d. It\u2019s hard to react in a way that\u2019s firm and prevents that kind of thing happening again, but also not seem like you can\u2019t take a joke. They definitely see it as a man\u2019s world, where if you want to be a part of it that\u2019s fine, but don\u2019t expect them to change. But actually just by being there does make an impact. Most of them are lovely.

Or when I walk into the building merchants, I get told that the perfume shop is down the road. But on site I work alone most of the time so I don\u2019t have to deal with comments. When clients call they assume I\u2019m the secretary or the builder\u2019s wife, so when I turn up to take measurements and discuss the project I get shocked reactions. But many people say that being a women is a plus. People seem to trust a woman more than a group of young men, especially as you\u2019re left alone in someone\u2019s house. It is a man\u2019s world, with workwear and tools made for men\u2019s hands and bodies.

Some of the guys I\u2019ve worked with have been curious as to why I chose to become a joiner, and have asked if some of the windows or doors I make are too heavy to handle for me. But I just answer them back straight \u2013 my reasons for becoming a joiner are not different from their motivations and, yes, sometimes things are too heavy but that\u2019s because everyone has different levels of strength. There is something I really appreciate about working with men. There\u2019s usually a lot of banter and joking, and that\u2019s something I really enjoy.

And when starting on a new site you do feel as if you need to prove yourself as a woman \u2013 it seems like people are waiting for you to mess up. I personally felt I had to be as good as, if not better than, the guys I worked with. That said, it\u2019s by far the best environment I have worked in. I feel like I\u2019m contributing to a team and having a part in building something important. My dad was a bricklayer and whenever we visit London he points out the buildings he helped create.

  "<p>Construction of the polar research ship Sir David Attenborough, which will explore the deepest waters of the Antarctic, is due to start on Monday with the laying of the vessel\u2019s keel in Merseyside.</p> <p>A competition to name the ship caused controversy earlier this year when voters overwhelmingly backed Boaty McBoatface, only for officials to override the outcome of the poll.</p> <p>Boaty McBoatface received 124,109 votes, four times more than second-placed Poppy-Mai, the name of a 16-month-old girl with incurable cancer.<br></p> <p>But the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) announced that the ship\u2019s name would honour the British broadcaster and naturalist in his 90th birthday year, christening it RRS (royal research ship) Sir David Attenborough.</p> <p>Boaty McBoatface will be used instead as the name of a high-tech sub on board the \u00a3200m RRS Sir David Attenborough, the world\u2019s most advanced seaborne laboratory. NERC said the autonomous underwater vehicle would explore ice sheets to depths of 6,000m and was able to remain at sea for many months at a time.<br></p> <p>Construction of the ship will officially start on Monday at a ceremony attended by Attenborough himself at the Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead.<br></p> <p>Attenborough will begin the keel-laying process by lifting the first 100-tonne hull unit by crane to the construction berth. This unit includes part of the ship\u2019s keel and bottom shell plating and is the first of 97 units that will form the hull of the research ship.<br></p> <p>The keel-laying ceremony is a tradition that formally marks the start of a ship\u2019s construction and is said to bring luck.<br></p> <p>Ministers hope that from 2019 the RRS Sir David Attenborough will provide a research base to help scientists tackle climate change, rising sea levels and the impact of environmental change on marine life.<br></p> <p>The universities and science minister, Jo Johnson, said: \u201cThe RRS Sir David Attenborough, with Boaty McBoatface operated from her as a robotic underwater vehicle, will be one of the most advanced research ships in the world. It will help inspire the next generation of scientists in the UK and build on our status as one of the world\u2019s leading nations in polar science, engineering and technology.\u201d<br></p> <p>The construction work will create more than 460 jobs and apprenticeships in Merseyside, ministers say.<br></p> <p>Attenborough said: \u201cI have had several opportunities to experience the power of these places first hand. This new ship will ensure that scientists have access to these enigmatic regions to uncover secrets that we can only imagine at this point. Scientists working on this new ship will inform everyone about our changing world for generations to come.\u201d<br></p> <p>The \u00a3200m cost is the largest government investment in Antarctic and Arctic science infrastructure since the 1980s and will enable the UK research community to conduct world-leading polar research for the next 25 years. The funding also covers the development of projects to support the ship\u2019s work, including construction of a new wharf at Rothera, the largest British Antarctic research station.<br></p> <p> </p>",
  "<p>From my study window I watch jackdaws making their chattering sorties above the rooftops and over Kendal Fell. Across the road a footpath leads up the fell, less well known now as Helsfell, and on through two small areas of woodland. What I can\u2019t see, and hadn\u2019t known until recently, though I walk the area most days, is that deep in the far wood is a cave of significant archaeological importance.</p> <p>In the 1880s an amateur archaeologist, John Beecham, spent five summers excavating it. He discovered the bones of bear, wild cat, polecat, wild boar and iron age oxen \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.aps.uoguelph.ca/~swatland/HTML10234/LEC2/LEC2.html\"><em>Bos longifrons</em>, the first domesticated cattle</a> \u2013 and the complete skeleton of a wolf.

Her Victorian predecessors had reconstructed the skeleton incorrectly, so that it seemed small and had assumed a submissive posture \u2013 more greyhound than lupine. Genetic testing is likely to prove that the wolf was a juvenile, and carbon-14 dating will place it accurately in history; it is reported to date from the 16th century. For once, though, the hope is for a more recent date that might<em> </em>determine the Helsfell Wolf as positively the last in England.</p> <p>So, wolves roamed here in the once extensive woodlands of the hills and valley of the river Kent. There would have been a rich variety of fauna then for them to feed on, though there are plenty of sheep around these days; too many, some say.

It is not illegal to buy or sell the drugs, but it is to use them to bring about an abortion.</p> <p>In April, a woman in Northern Ireland who took the pills and was reported to the police by her two flatmates was given a three-month suspended sentence by Belfast crown court. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/08/northern-ireland-abortion-women-culture-suspicion-fear-prosecution-belfast\">The case sparked protests and demonstrations of solidarity from other women </a>who announced they too had resorted to the abortion pills and challenged police to arrest them.</p> <p>Women with an unwanted pregnancy in Ireland previously had to travel to the UK if they wanted to have an abortion. Between 1970 and 2015, 180,797 women from Ireland and 61,311 women from Northern Ireland made the journey. Many still do rather than break the law by bringing about an abortion at home.</p> <p>But the study, carried out by Abigail Aiken and her colleagues at the University of Texas at Austin, found that many of the women who went online for help could not afford to travel or to take time off work or the costs of childcare.</p> <p>\u201cThese barriers create a stark health inequity: women with financial and social resources can access offshore termination of pregnancy, while women who lack such resources cannot,\u201d says the paper.</p> <p>The study found that 5,650 women sought help from the site between 2010 and 2015. Most (85%) were between 20 and 30 years old and were mothers (63%).</p> <p>The most common reason for choosing to terminate pregnancy (reported by 62% of women) was not being able to cope with a child at that point in their lives. Nearly half \u2013 44% \u2013 cited having no money to provide for a child, and 23% felt their family was already complete. Nearly a third \u2013 30% \u2013 felt they were too young to have a child or wanted to finish their education. </p> <p>Almost all \u2013 97% \u2013 said they felt accessing and using the medication at home was the right thing for them and 98% said they would recommend it to other women in a similar situation. The most common feeling they reported after completing the procedure was relief (70%), followed by satisfaction (36%). Over a quarter \u2013 26.8% \u2013 said they were happy and 22% said they were pleased. The vast majority \u2013 94% \u2013 expressed gratitude that they could go online and obtain the pills.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a very negative perception of a home abortion,\u201d said Aiken, an Irish-born assistant professor at the US university. \u201cPeople regard it as desperate and a last resort. But women say it is very helpful for their health, wellbeing and autonomy. The only negative thing is that they have to do it outside of the law.\u201d</p> <p>The website asks women to make a donation to its costs, suggesting \u20ac70 to \u20ac90. Over a third \u2013 35% \u2013 said they found it difficult to find the money. Nearly a quarter (24%) said they did not get enough emotional support from family and friends.</p> <p>One of the women surveyed told the researchers: \u201cThere is no way I could have afforded to travel to England, pay for the procedure, stay in a hotel, and have someone there to support me. Thanks to this service, I was able to have a safe abortion in an environment where I felt comfortable and with my partner there to support me. Thank you for enabling women to have control over their own bodies.\u201d </p> <p>Others said that without access to home abortion, they would have considered suicide. \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough \u2013 you have saved my life,\u201d said one. \u201cI would have had to resort to desperate measures.

Star would fall about 3% before tax and about 5% after. </p> <p>\u201cHowever, the risk is this action impacts the willingness of VIP players and junkets to visit Australia,\u201d Krien said. </p> <p>He said Melco Crown, partly owned by Packer and which has operations in Macau, would likely take a hit also, \u201cin which case the earnings impact for Crown in particular, and all operators, could be greater\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>From meeting Barack Obama to barracking for Port Adelaide as their first female board director, there isn\u2019t much that 26-year-old Holly Ransom can\u2019t tick off her career bucket list. </p> <p>Ransom is the CEO of<em> Emergent</em>, a company that specialises in the development of high performing intergenerational workforces, leadership and social outcomes, and an advocate for engaging youth in a rapidly changing workplace. </p> <p>She\u2019s also delivered a Peace Charter to the Dalai Lama, helped to get world leaders to take notice of youth issues at the G20 summit for the first time ever in their declaration, and was named one of Australia\u2019s \u2018100 Most Influential Women\u2019 at age 22.</p> <p>And somehow, she also managed to squeeze in time to compete in an Ironman marathon.</p> <p>The stereotype that Gen Y are lazy, unmotivated and self-entitled might be a common one, but Ransom says that across her extensive work with young people around both Australia and the world, this stereotype just doesn\u2019t stack up.</p> <p>\u201cI see a very different side of things. The stereotype is nowhere near accurate,\u201d Holly says. \u201cI\u2019ve worked all around the country and world, and I\u2019m astounded by [Gen Y\u2019s] passions and the aspirations they have.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a real belief to get involved in the system and make a change in that system, and that we can make it better. It\u2019s their attitudes that are really encouraging.\u201d</p> <p>She says as technology and the workplace rapidly changes, businesses need to restrategise how they entice the next generation into the workplace.</p> <p>\u201c50 per cent of the population are under 30,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cGen Y have wants and needs that are different, and how they want to work and be led, and be leaders...We need to be thinking differently about how we engage this age group.\u201d</p> <p>According to Ransom, once upon a time top university graduates were drawn to roles in big corporations like banks. But we\u2019re now seeing a shift as graduates opt instead to work at smaller startups; especially ones with a social impact. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve worked all around the country and world, and I\u2019m astounded by [Gen Y\u2019s] passions and the aspirations they have</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>More and more people are coming into the workplace wanting to make a positive impact, with less interested in traditional roles. \u201cWe\u2019ve been told to do what we love,\u201d Ransom says. And those entering the workforce are listening. </p> <p>\u201cCEO\u2019s remark how Gen Y are the first generation to quiz HR about volunteer policy and diversity. There\u2019s a huge hunger for purpose ingrained in this younger generation, and \u2018I want to make a difference and I\u2019m looking for somewhere where I can make a difference through making a living\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s the sweet spot.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"147352efd4bdbb5a6e69a4c33bd8abe58b125e68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/147352efd4bdbb5a6e69a4c33bd8abe58b125e68/0_496_3304_4130/800.jpg\" alt=\"Headshot In The Black\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For the first time Gen Y are the largest generation in the workplace, and we now have five generations working side by side. Ransom says businesses need to adapt and create an environment where all generations can bring ideas to the table \u2013 not just one or two dominant age groups, which is often the case.</p> <p>\u201cI think there\u2019s an enormous amount to be said for diversity. Most diversity discussion is about gender, and then culture, but another aspect is age, and it\u2019s critical because of the different lenses people have for an opportunity or solution.</p> <p>\u201cBusinesses need to create conditions where everyone can contribute their best; some businesses are doing it well, but some are skewed towards one or two, and generations are missing out.\u201d</p> <p>She said the flipside of intergenerational workplaces is the \u201cgenerational tension\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a lot of frustration that is happening, because there are such different expectations and quite substantially different viewpoints about the way things should be.</p> <p>\u201cChange is scary,\u201d but businesses need to take advantage of the skills that each generation presents, she says.</p> <p>And as older staff, often in senior management roles, are starting to think about retirement, it\u2019s crucial for businesses to have people ready to step into those roles.</p> <p>\u201cClients have said to me that 60 percent of their managers are going to retire in the next five years \u2013 and they need to make sure their pipeline is well-stocked so the businesses don\u2019t miss a beat.\u201d</p> <p>Ransom\u2019s own career has been filled with many \u2018wow\u2019 moments, but for her, the most unbelievable was in 2014 when she was appointed to chair the G20 Youth Summit and was able to put youth unemployment forward as an issue on the declaration.</p> <p>\u201cListening to the G20 leaders declaration being read out and seeing that we\u2019d been able to influence it and get a youth issue brought up \u2013 I went \u2018wow I can\u2019t believe we pulled this off,\u2019\u201d she says. </p> <p>Her other career-defining moment was her diagnosis of depression.</p> <p>\u201cI think honestly, it\u2019s the best thing that ever happened to me, because it forced a reset and it was incredibly clarifying. You have to go \u2018why did this happen, what do I need to do, what do I need to change in my environment?\u2019 </p> <p>\u201cSo I set the foundations to sustainably go about making the contributions I want to make.\u201d</p> <p>It forced Ransom to think about where she was funnelling her energy. \u201cI came to understand it\u2019s not about time management, it\u2019s about energy management. I wasn\u2019t giving energy to the people and projects I should have been. I was constantly dipping into a fuel tank that wasn\u2019t replenishing.\u201d</p> <p>For her, it was important to talk openly about these issues and reach out to others.</p> <p>\u201c1 in 4 young Australians are going through a mental health challenge \u2013 I talk about it, because I want people to know they\u2019re not alone.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest thing for me is getting help, and saying \u2018I need help\u2019 are sometimes the three hardest words we can say.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/optus-business-intergenerate/ng-interactive/2016/nov/03/optus-business-intergenerate-2016\">Optus Business Intergenerate 2016</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Exercise and practising gratitude were also important coping tools in her recovery. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about exercise enough \u2013 and focusing on things you are grateful for, even if it\u2019s simply \u2018I am grateful for today.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Moving forward in her already accomplished career, Ransom is excited to see technology, such a 3D printing, being repurposed in different industries, as well as the new forms of leadership emerging from this new period of inter-generational business. </p> <p>But the thing she\u2019s really looking forward to?<br></p> <p>\u201cI want to see Port Adelaide win a premiership!\u201d</p> <p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/optus-business-intergenerate/ng-interactive/2016/nov/03/optus-business-intergenerate-2016\">Watch highlights from the Melbourne Intergenerate event</a> - \u2018Leadership of the future\u2019 with panelists Holly Ransom of Emergent, Daniel Flynn of Thank you, James Chin Moody of Sendle and other established and emerging business leaders.</strong></em></p>",
