  "<p>By declining to put up an official candidate to fight the Richmond Park byelection, the Conservative party has shown itself to be cynical, cowardly and rational. It took the decision knowing that it is not a great look for the governing party to absent itself from the contest. It calculated that it would be an even more dreadful look to field someone in the colours of Mrs May and see them slaughtered. Which is what would have happened. The chances of an official Tory candidate winning in this leafy patch of southwest London would have been somewhat lower than a flying saucer piloted by Elvis and Lord Lucan landing on the head of the Loch Ness monster.</p> <p>There is no constituency in the country with a more intense concentration of rage about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/heathrow-airport-expansion-gets-government-approval-gatwick\" title=\"\">Heathrow expansion</a> and the government has just declared that it wants to multiply the number of planes flying over its rooftops. The constituency voted heavily to remain within the European Union and the government is embarked on a trajectory towards one of the harder versions of Brexit. A candidate in the name of the Tory party would have split the Conservative vote, enhancing the chances of the Lib Dems taking the seat. So cowardice and cynicism combined with logic.</p> <p>Yet this does not mean that the absence of an official competitor for the Tory party is an unalloyed blessing for Zac Goldsmith, the former Conservative MP who is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/25/zac-goldsmith-quits-as-mp-over-doomed-heathrow-expansion-decision\" title=\"\">recontesting the seat </a>in the guise of an \u201cindependent\u201d. Once upon a time, when he had a reputation as someone who was not enslaved to his party\u2019s line, he might have been convincing in that role. Not now. Only a few months ago, he was the Conservative candidate for mayor of London. Moreover, he made the disastrous decision not to run on his own terms, but to be the frontman for a racially charged campaign designed by the Tory machine. Both nasty and ineffective, even his sister, Jemima Khan, was moved <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/06/even-jemima-khan-criticises-her-brother-zacs-failed-campaign-for/\" title=\"\">to publicly deplore </a>that campaign.</p> <p>Only very occasionally in British politics have we seen genuine independents in parliament. One such was Martin Bell, the former BBC correspondent famed for his white suit, who ran and won as the anti-sleaze candidate against Neil Hamilton in Tatton at the 1997 election. Zac Goldsmith is no Martin Bell. To see how truly independent he is, we only have to visit the <a href=\"http://www.rpnk.co.uk\" title=\"\">website of the local Tory party</a>. When I checked there on Saturday, the banner at the top of the home page still featured his mugshot alongside the Tory logo. The strapline read: \u201cSupporting Zac Goldsmith in the Richmond Park constituency.\u201d The video content is a stream of images of the man who is supposedly no longer a member of their party. A statement by the chairman says that \u201cthe association and its resources will not play a part in this byelection\u201d, before declaring that \u201cindividuals who are members of the association may well wish to support Zac\u2019s campaign and they are at liberty to do so\u201d. It then provides an email address for joining his campaign.</p> <p>Statements from the Tory party nationally have conveyed their warmest wishes for his re-election. Should he be returned as an MP, it is widely suspected, and he has not denied it, that he will only sit as an independent for a while before, after an interval he judges to be decent, rejoining the Tory party. If words in politics retain any meaning, Zac Goldsmith is no independent. If he is re-elected, it will be a message to Mrs May to carry on as you are.</p> <p>It is a big challenge to run as a genuine \u201cindependent\u201d because they can\u2019t usually compete with the money, logistical capacity and activist base at the disposal of organised parties. I guess the money is no obstacle in this case. The trustafarian Mr Goldsmith has exceedingly deep pockets. There is an issue over how much support \u2013 overt or clandestine \u2013 he is going to get from the Conservative party. Will the Tory machine feed him with voter data? This is a highly valuable commodity, especially at a byelection when turnout is often pivotal to the outcome. It seems to be a legal grey area whether the Tory party can gift him resources without it counting against the byelection spending limit or whether he should be expected to pay a commercial rate and count that as a campaign expense.</p> <p>He starts with some significant advantages. He has a well-known name, enjoys the benefits of incumbency and won a chunky majority of more than 20,000 in 2015. The first opinion poll \u2013 for what it\u2019s worth \u2013 has him comfortably ahead. In an age that expects politicians to betray their pledges when they become inconvenient, he may earn credit with some voters for keeping his promise to resign and recontest the seat if his party went ahead with Heathrow expansion.</p> <p>Here, though, is a paradox. This byelection may have been triggered by the runway decision, but it is essentially irrelevant to the contest. His Lib Dem rivals are just as opposed to the expansion of Heathrow and, unlike Mr Goldsmith\u2019s party, they have always been united in their conviction that it is a terrible idea.</p> <p>The Lib Dems, who came second in the seat in 2015 and held it until 2010, ache for the boost in media attention and party morale that they would receive from a victory. Vince Cable suggested that he might be up for attempting a comeback there, but in the end he did not apply to be the candidate. It concerns some Lib Dems that their flagbearer, Sarah Olney, lacks the name recognition and the experience of her opponent, but that has not prevented them from pulling off byelection sensations before. Tim Farron\u2019s party seeks to cast the contest as a referendum on the Tory government and particularly its trajectory towards a hard Brexit. This makes sense. If they are to see a national revival from their near-death experience at the last general election, a good hunting ground for the Lib Dems is among Remain voters alienated from both a Brexiteering Tory government and Corbyn Labour.</p> <p>On Europe, Labour is split and scared about how to deal with the division between its London stronghold, which voted heavily for In, and its Midland, northern and Welsh heartlands, where there was hefty support for Out. That prevents Labour from being a clear voice for \u201cthe 48%\u201d. The Lib Dems don\u2019t have that difficulty. They can be unequivocal opponents of hard Brexit. They believe that helped them to do well at the recent Witney byelection <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/witney-byelection-lib-dems-tories-slashed-majority\" title=\"\">where they leapfrogged</a> from fourth place to second, with a swing of 19%. The swing to them from the Tories would only have to be a smidge higher for the Lib Dems to take Richmond Park. Mr Goldsmith is at odds with most of his constituents, who voted by more than two to one to remain within the European Union. It is probably not to his advantage that he is so to the liking of Nigel Farage that Ukip has stood aside from the contest and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/27/ukip-backs-zac-goldsmith-in-richmond-park-byelection\" title=\"\">endorsed him</a>. In such an anti-Brexit constituency, it is of dubious benefit to be the lightly camouflaged candidate of the Tory party and the explicit candidate of Ukip.</p> <p>Some hoped that Richmond Park might be a testing ground for the idea of a \u201cprogressive alliance\u201d between parties on the other side of the spectrum. Three relatively senior Labour figures, Clive Lewis, Lisa Nandy and Jonathan Reynolds, last week jointly suggested that their party should stand aside to maximise the chances of a Lib-Dem victory, on the grounds that \u201cin this parliament <a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2016/10/lewis-nandy-and-reynolds-lets-make-this-a-referendum-on-goldsmith-not-heathrow/\" title=\"\">progressives will need every vote</a> that they can get\u201d.</p> <p>This was an interesting intervention and the more so because the trio hail from different wings of the party. Their initiative might even deserve to be called quite brave, for committing the heresy against tribal gods of suggesting that sometimes people should support a party other than their first choice. The idea has got nowhere because it received a predictably icy response from the party leadership. Jeremy Corbyn and his deputy, Tom Watson, don\u2019t agree on much. On opposing this idea they are as one. Caroline Lucas, the Greens\u2019 only MP, is one of the more eloquent advocates of deeper co-operation between non-Tory parties. She visited the Richmond Greens to see if they might be persuaded to stand aside and found them unwilling. <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/10/lets-seize-our-chance-progressive-alliance-richmond-or-well-all-be-losers\" title=\"\">She concluded:</a> \u201cThe old politics dies hard.\u201d Sure does. This episode is a lesson to the advocates of a progressive alliance about just how hard it will be to turn the concept into something meaningful.</p> <p>So there will be Labour and Green candidates contesting Richmond Park, even though they don\u2019t stand a hope of winning. This may not ultimately matter. If the Lib Dems can get one of their bandwagons rolling, they will put a hard squeeze on support for the also-rans. The British electorate has a lot of experience of byelections. They understand the dynamics and act accordingly. Richmond Park has the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2009/oct/19/educated-degree-qualification-constituency-data\" title=\"\">highest proportion of university graduates</a> in the country. They shouldn\u2019t have much problem grasping the concept of tactical voting. Nor should they have much difficulty spotting the difference between a genuine independent and a fake.</p>",
  "<p>Take back control, cried the Brexit campaigners, from the dark forces of the EU and open Britain up to a glorious future in which it can embrace the world. It was a seductive cry, but was a lie from top to bottom. The EU did not stop Britain\u2019s embrace of the world; instead, it was and is a crucial bridge to it. While Brexit campaigners\u2019 rhetoric may be of global openness, their actions betoken retreat. It is not from the left that we have to fear an Orwellian dystopia in which words are manipulated, never to mean what they purport to mean, but from rightwing Leavers.</p> <p>This is nowhere clearer than in the intense threat now facing British universities, one of the UK\u2019s great national and international assets. Universities, dedicated to learning, teaching and research, are indispensable building blocks of any civilisation. But they are also increasingly important economic institutions. A university in a 21st-century British city plays a similar role to a cathedral in a medieval city \u2013 as a magnet of economic and cultural activity. Universities are a source of employment, collaborators with companies and public agencies, and, by attracting so many young people, a mainspring of vitality and rich urban life. (Full declaration: I am principal of Hertford College, Oxford University.)</p> <p>For Brexiters and Ukippers, however, universities have a dark side. They involve themselves with \u2013 dread word \u2013 foreigners. Universities, in the right\u2019s universe, are anti-British fifth columnists. They will insist on welcoming students and researchers from the EU and the rest of the world, in part because they believe in the intellectual vitality that comes with having diverse student and research communities and in part because they need the cash. University tuition fees in 2013-14 totalled \u00a313.7bn. Because foreign students pay fees two or three times higher than the \u00a39,000 maximum set for English students, overseas students contribute more than a third of that total. On top, they spend on accommodation, leisure and sustenance. In every university town in Britain, they are a brilliant economic, social and cultural asset, indispensable to the viability and vitality of the university, while boosting local economies.</p> <p>Britain has been good at attracting international students because we have two priceless advantages. We have great universities and we teach courses and award degrees in our native tongue \u2013 English \u2013 which is now the lingua franca. Tens of thousands of Chinese students come to Britain every year not to settle here and steal British jobs, but because they want to learn to speak English and obtain the vital credential of a degree won in England \u2013 and then go home.</p> <p>However, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/20/students-could-be-left-out-of-immigration-figures-ministers-hint\" title=\"\">Home Office insists on counting foreign students as immigrants</a>. Part of the wide perception that immigration is out of control, from which Nigel Farage built his anti-EU case, is because of this statistical quirk. Thus, last year net migration totalled 336,000. But 169,000 of those were students (netting out incoming students from British students leaving to study abroad). Exclude them and suddenly the net migration total looks back in control \u2013 167,000. Toughen up the permit regime for non-EU migrants and David Cameron could have hit his target of net migration in the tens of thousands and Farage and co would have lost a crucial platform in their anti EU hyperbole.</p> <p>Home Office resistance to this statistical redefinition, led by Theresa May as home secretary and continuing now as prime minister, is because some students do stay in Britain after winning their degrees; on this view, higher education has become a backdoor means of avoiding immigration controls. Too few incoming students seem to be leaving, although nobody can know for certain whether this is true. EU students have the right to stay but they only constitute a quarter of all foreign students. Because Britain invests scant resources in policing its student visa regime, the only evidence on students\u2019 leaving is the hit-and-miss system of sampling travellers at British ports and airports. Of course there has been cheating and some bogus degree courses, but not an industrial scale and now largely closed down. I find it hard to believe that there is an army of up to half-a-million Asian ex-students in their mid to late 20s whose student visas have expired now working in Britain\u2019s black economy. But on that supposition the prime minister and Home Office refuse to budge. Students must count as immigrants and vital ammunition is given to xenophobes and Eurosceptics.</p> <p>The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is concerned that for these dubious reasons universities are going to be required to cut their international student numbers dramatically with severe consequences for their viability, foreign exchange earnings and Britain\u2019s reputation for openness. He observed mildly 10 days ago that it would be good to test public opinion to see if public objections to foreign students were so ferocious as to justify the policy of counting them as immigrants. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/20/students-could-be-left-out-of-immigration-figures-ministers-hint\" title=\"\">Number 10 slapped him down</a>. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who, as London mayor, spoke out strongly in favour of international students, has gone mute as foreign secretary. He proclaims openness to the globe rather than Europe, but it is a conviction that does not involve risking his career and new reputation as Europhobe in chief. What he does is to enable closure.</p> <p>Britain cannot escape its history, its language or the opportunities and challenges afforded by globalisation. In our globalising times, <a href=\"http://institutions.ukcisa.org.uk//info-for-universities-colleges--schools/policy-research--statistics/research--statistics/international-students-in-uk-he/\" title=\"\">China sends approximately 90,000 students a year to Britain, India 18,500, Malaysia 17,000, Hong Kong 16,000 and Singapore, Thailand and Pakistan some 7,000 each.</a> We should be proud that such numbers of students from these seven countries alone want to study here. Australia, Canada and the US will jump at the chance to host them as we turn them away, terrified they are all wannabe immigrants. Really? It is a savage indictment of our new public culture. I have lost count of the number of international students worried if they are wanted, whether they should apply for graduate studies and scared of the way the atmosphere around them is becoming more hostile.</p> <p>Not one single Leave minister in the government speaks out for them, their cause or the international role of our universities despite their protestations of embracing the globe \u2013 that falls to Remainers such as Hammond or the universities minister, Jo Johnson. The Leavers are charlatans. I, for one, want my country back.</p>",
  "<p>Hurricane Sandy, one of the most destructive storms in US history, struck New Jersey four years ago this weekend. It left hundreds dead, thousands homeless and millions without power. Around $75bn of damage was inflicted on homes, roads and offices.</p> <p>The devastation and death toll were grim reminders of human vulnerability in the face of the elements. However, Hurricane Sandy\u2019s impact could have been much worse, forecasters in the UK revealed last week. Scientists at the <a href=\"http://www.ecmwf.int/\" title=\"\">European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts </a>in Reading were the first to warn there was a significant chance of Sandy making a sudden \u201cleft-hook\u201d as it swept up the east coast of the US in late October 2012, striking Manhattan and New Jersey. Other centres were suggesting that the storm would peter out at sea.</p> <p>The forecast \u2013 which was made five days before Hurricane Sandy hit the US mainland \u2013 was unexpected and confirmed only much later by other forecasters. Forewarned, New Jersey was able to protect itself from the worst effects of the 169km/h (105mph) hurricane.</p> <p>It was a key success and now this forecasting prowess is to be further exploited by the Reading centre \u2013 rated one of the world\u2019s top forecasting organisations \u2013 in order to make further improvements in its medium-range forecasting, which typically covers weather events over three to 10 days. \u201cThe crucial point about our approach to forecasting how Hurricane Sandy would behave once it had formed was a technique called ensemble forecasting,\u201d said Florence Rabier, the centre\u2019s director general.</p> <p>\u201cInstead of running just a single forecast, our computers ran a number of forecasts \u2013 around 50 \u2013 using slightly different starting conditions. This gave us a much better idea of what might occur at a particular time.\u201d</p> <p>Thanks to ensemble computing \u2013which has been pioneered at meteorological centres around the world \u2013 it is now possible to make weather predictions for, on average, the coming seven days. By honing the technique, however, scientists at the Reading centre hope to extend that to two weeks. \u201cWe are going to concentrate on major improvement to our software to try to push ensemble forecasts so they are more exact and reach further into the future,\u201d said Rabier.</p> <p>Another example of ensemble forecasting was provided by this September\u2019s storms around Kalamata in southern Greece. Several people died when torrential rain caused flash flooding that washed cars down narrow streets and left them piled on the sea shore. Again, the use of multiple forecasts from slightly altered starting points was able to provide early warnings.</p> <p>At the centre\u2019s headquarters,which has 34 member nations, two massive Cray super-computers digest data streamed from a global array of measuring devices: robot buoys floating in oceans; balloon-born sensors; instrument packages on civil and military aircraft; automatic land-based weather centres; and satellites.</p> <p>\u201cThese are some of the most powerful computers in the world and we have two, to make sure there is no break in their highly complex analyses,\u201d said the centre\u2019s Umberto Modigliani. \u201cThe forecasts we make are passed to individual countries\u2019 meteorological offices.\u201d</p> <p>The wide array of data available to the centre is crucial. However, the most important is that from weather satellites \u2013 distant geostationary probes that hover over the same spot on Earth at a height of 35,786km \u2013 and polar orbiting satellites, which sweep over the poles at about 850km, taking several days to cover the surface of the Earth. The former provide constant but limited data because of their distance from the Earth, and cannot properly study weather patterns at latitudes above 60 degrees. By contrast polar satellites provide masses of information, but pass over the same location only once or twice a day.</p> <p>It was data from these satellites, combined with the use of ensemble computing, that provided the key insight into Hurricane Sandy\u2019s sudden left-hook. Tony McNally, of the centre\u2019s satellite data section, said: \u201cWe ran a post-mortem of the storm by re-running our computer models using data stored in our computers. However, we removed all the satellite data and used only data from buoys, aircraft and other non-orbiting sources. The computer then predicted that the hurricane would not make landfall. In other words, without data from satellites, we\u2019d have got it wrong. With it, and with ensemble computing, we got it spot-on. \u201d</p>",

If Mr Browne\u2019s merchant bank colleagues backed a prospectus to sell shares on such a basis, they and the company directors involved would be debarred from office, fined or possibly sent to jail. Many of those who led the Leave campaign are, however, now in positions of authority in government.</p> <p>The politicians seeking to remain in whole or in part within the EU, notably the SNP in Scotland and the Liberal Democrats, deserve vocal and real support.<br><strong>SG Kay</strong><br>Edinburgh<br></p> <h2><strong>Saving our precious forests</strong></h2> <p>Well done for raising the profile of tree health and the growing number ofthreats from pathogens often brought in by accident through international trade.

This is absolutely right. However, we should consider all options, including making our forests more resilient.</p> <p>We need to acknowledge that tree species and forests are naturally dynamic and change in response to their environment. Natural selection acting on genetically diverse populations may allow tree species to cope with pathogens; species diversity in a landscape helps to minimise the impact of losses in any one of those species. To encourage people to explore these ideas, seven research institutes have recently launched a computer game, informed by the science, which lets players manage their own forest landscape.

Worse still, other authorities bear down simultaneously on vulnerable single households. After jobcentres impose benefit sanctions, local authorities enforce rent and council tax arrears.

Magistrates also impose fines for poverty-related offences such as TV licence and fare evasion that cannot be paid during a sanction but pile up, leading to a call from the bailiffs.

  "<p>The president of Colombia \u2013 and this year\u2019s Nobel peace laureate \u2013 Juan Manuel Santos has pledged to deliver a peace accord by Christmas to end the world\u2019s longest-running war.</p> <p>President Santos was unexpectedly awarded the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/07/juan-manuel-santos-wins-nobel-peace-prize-for-work-with-farc\">Nobel prize</a> this month just days after a peace deal that his government forged with the Marxist guerrilla movement, the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (Farc), had been narrowly defeated in a plebiscite. The rejected peace accord would have seen the Farc lay down its arms and become a political party, in addition to introducing land reforms and compensation for victims of the 50-year war.</p> <p>However, critics attacked one of the central tenets of the deal \u2013 the so-called system of \u201ctransitional justice\u201d, which meant Farc leaders could have avoided lengthy jail terms in return for confessing their crimes and working to build peace \u2013saying it was too lenient.</p> <p>In an interview with the <em>Observer</em> on the eve of the first state visit by a Colombian president to the UK, Santos makes his most robust commitment yet to finding a new peace accord since losing the plebiscite. He said he hoped an amended accord would not only be agreed with the Farc but also ratified \u2013 either by congress, another plebiscite or through other means \u2013 by Christmas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/25/preparing-for-peace-inside-farc-colombian-jungle-base\">Preparing for peace: inside Farc\u2019s Colombian jungle base</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He added that he was willing to proceed, if necessary, without input from the leader of the No vote, his political nemesis, the influential former president, \u00c1lvaro Uribe. \u201cI hope that Uribe will also come on board because we want as large a consensus as possible,\u201d said the president. But he continued: \u201cIf [Uribe] decides not to join the bandwagon, then he will simply be isolated and we will continue with the other people [who previously opposed the accord] because we cannot simply stop the process \u2013 because it will come to an end if we do not continue it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0413e9e4a5bdc6f18dc5baf4d05a1de996371b4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0413e9e4a5bdc6f18dc5baf4d05a1de996371b4a/0_203_3803_2281/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alvaro Uribe, who led the No campaign, with his supporters after voters rejected the peace deal earlier this month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alvaro Uribe, who led the No campaign, with his supporters after voters rejected the peace deal earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STR/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Colombians had been expected to vote Yes to the peace accord and its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/02/colombia-referendum-rejects-peace-deal-with-farc\">rejection</a> was a huge setback for the president whose team have been negotiating the peace accord over the past four years in Havana, Cuba. Santos says now that since the result \u201cwe started a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/14/colombia-president-juan-manuel-santos-extends-farc-ceasefire\">national dialogue</a> with all the promoters of the No vote to see what changes they would like in the agreement, because they all said that they wanted peace\u201d.</p> <p>He said that \u201call the negotiators and I have met almost every organisation and we are now digesting more than 500 proposals \u2013 and talking with the Farc \u2013 to have a new agreement, agreed and approved, by Christmas. That is my goal.\u201d</p> <p>He warned that further delay could imperil the process. \u201cThis uncertainty is very risky, because anything could happen that could really make the process explode. So I am working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with my team to get another agreement.\u201d</p> <p>Asked what mechanism would be used to legitimise the new agreement, Santos said he had a range of options under consideration, but that the priority now \u201cwas to get a new deal as soon as possible\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWhatever mechanism I use to implement it, whether through congress, or through municipal councils or through another plebiscite or a combination, I will decide as soon as we have a new agreement and see what would give it the best legitimacy, both politically and legally.\u201d</p> <p>Colombia\u2019s war began in 1964, with the foundation of the Farc by communist peasants defending the autonomous communities they had declared in protest against unequal land ownership. The war \u2013 which became entwined with those waged by drug cartels and rightwing paramilitaries \u2013 has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/25/colombia-conflict-death-toll-commission\">cost more than 200,000 lives</a>, according to most estimates, and displaced almost six million people.</p> <p>Santos and his peace accord have come under sustained criticism from Uribe, who said in Miami last week that the deal would lead to \u201c<a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/doral/article110018597.html\">a second Venezuela</a>\u201d in Latin America \u2013 suggesting that the Farc\u2019s entry into politics would reduce the country to the status of their flagging socialist neighbour.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are pushing very hard to have meetings with Uribe's team. Some meetings have taken place</p> <footer> <cite>President Santos</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the interview, Santos responded to suggestions that he had not reached out sufficiently to Uribe since the plebiscite: \u201cWe are pushing very hard to have meetings with [Uribe\u2019s team]. Some meetings have taken place, today, just an hour ago \u2026 through the radio Uribe had asked for a meeting with me, I said \u2018of course I would meet him\u2019 \u2026 I would meet him any time. He then said \u2018no\u2019 and that it is better that the teams get together. And I said \u2018of course, my teams are ready\u2019, not just now but have been ready for the last three weeks and he has been stalling, not allowing the teams to get into real negotiations. I am ready, I am eager, because I know that if we sit down we can agree on many of the things that concern him.\u201d</p> <p>Having lost the plebiscite by only 0.4% of the vote, Santos aims to incorporate changes suggested by the No camp in an effort to get the deal through.</p> <p>And yet, he insisted that there were some proposals from the No campaign that would not be considered in any new peace accord. \u201cSome of the proposals are viable and we think the Farc should accept them, but others are simply not viable: for example the ones that say there is no armed conflict in Colombia, and that there is no war in Colombia and that there are no victims in Colombia and therefore the transitional justice cannot apply.</p> <p>\u201cThat type of proposal is simply not viable, and so we are discarding those radical positions and concentrating on what is practical, what is really an improvement on the current peace accord, taking into account the No vote, not only Uribe, but also many of the other No promoters.\u201d</p> <p>President Santos singled out the religious constituency which supported the No campaign as one he may have won round to a new accord. \u201cProbably the largest number of people who voted against the agreement did not do so because of the peace agreement but because the churches \u2013 the Catholic church and the [evangelical] Christian church \u2013 said that the agreement was defending what they called a \u2018gender ideology\u2019 which is absolutely not true. We have changed the wording and I think they now are absolutely for the agreement.

I just look forward to each game and try to enjoy it.\u201d</p> <p>After last year\u2019s World Cup the Wales head coach, Warren Gatland, said he was working out a retirement plan for Jenkins on the assumption that he would not be around for the 2019 World Cup in Japan but the prop is playing like someone in his mid-20s. He has never been the most avid of scrummagers but his work in the loose remains that of a back-row rather than a prop and time has yet to take his stamina hostage. He has no thoughts of retirement and has signed a contract extension with Cardiff Blues.</p> <p>\u201cA number of ex-players have told me to keep going for as long as I can,\u201d said Jenkins. \u201cMy whole life has been rugby, to the detriment of everything else; that is not going to change and being back in the Wales environment, it goes up another level again. Even with the region rugby is on your mind pretty much all the time and the challenge is to switch off for a little bit. The game is so intense these days with every game a crunch one. Everything is directed to winning.</p> <p>\u201cI would not swap the lifestyle and will never complain about it. You are doing what you love and what you started playing for when it was not your job. It does get hard and sometimes you have a moan about the scheduling and stuff but then you realise why you are doing it, running out on to the field at the weekend. Games are the big motivation for me and I get the same feeling before one now as I did when I started; that is what I will miss. At this stage of my career, you appreciate every game you have left and some people get only one opportunity to play for their country.\u201d</p> <p>Jenkins\u2019s longevity is notable not only because he plays in the front row, where the strain on the back and neck is formidable, but for his impact at the breakdown, clearing out rucks and winning turnovers, and the tackles he makes. He is approaching 400 matches in his senior career, a figure few professionals hit.</p> <p>\u201cI am not sure why I have been able to go on so long,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to get looked after at the Blues in my younger days when Dai Young was in charge. He would rest me for a few away games when there was not too much on them and since turning 30 I have looked after myself a lot better than I did in my early years.</p> <p>\u201cYou pick up things over time that you can use to keep yourself going and make sure that, when you get on to the field, you are in the best state physically and mentally that you can be.\u201d</p> <p>Gatland has taken a sabbatical with Wales as he plots the way for the Lions to defeat New Zealand in next year\u2019s series. Jenkins has been picked on the last three tours, although injury meant he did not play a match in 2013. Dare he dream of a rare fourth trip? \u201cI am just looking at the autumn series,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to impress to play in the Six Nations next year and it has always been the case that every [home union] player in the championship has a chance to impress the Lions.\u201d</p> <p>Before then is the little matter of Australia, Argentina, Japan and South Africa for Wales, a schedule that does not appear quite as daunting as in past years with the Wallabies and the Springboks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/21/new-zealand-rugby-all-blacks-australia-bledisloe-cup\" title=\"\">falling further behind New Zealand </a>and the Pumas playing entertaining but not winning rugby.

  "<p>In the back room of a pub in Kentish Town, a group of middle-class Londoners are perched on velvet-covered stools, eating hummus and talking about property. On the wall, above a pile of empty beer kegs, a slide presentation is in progress. A video of Airbnb\u2019s recent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQN9Uflzp9I\">advert</a> shows smiling hosts opening their front doors and declaring their support for Sadiq Khan\u2019s post-Brexit \u201cLondon is open\u201d campaign.</p> <p>The audience of Airbnb hosts are there after receiving individual invitations from the company to a \u201chome sharers\u201d meet-up \u2013 a concept largely unfamiliar to the slightly bemused crowd. Jonathan, an enthusiastic Californian Airbnb employee, who was recently seconded to London to set up the clubs, is happy to explain: \u201cHomesharing clubs are simply a way of organising this into something \u2026 that has a unified voice \u2026 then actually takes actions as a collective,\u201d he says, in a less than clear answer.</p> <p>More simply, homesharing clubs are advocacy groups made up of Airbnb hosts \u2013 loose, informal lobbying groups that push the company\u2019s agenda to politicians. The clubs are part of a what is fast becoming a concerted fightback by Airbnb, the website founded in 2008 when three college friends rented out air mattresses in their San Francisco flat as a way of making money, to become one of the biggest online travel brands in the world.</p> <p>But its phenomenal growth is proving to be its greatest liability. Authorities in cities around the world fear the impact it is having on their communities and are now seeking to arrest Airbnb\u2019s near unfettered expansion.</p> <p>The latest in a series of attempts around the world to curb its growth came earlier this month when <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-21/n-y-governor-cuomo-signs-bill-to-fine-illegal-airbnb-hosts\">New York governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill</a> that will fine tenants or landlords who let out unoccupied flatsfor less than 30 days.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Dublin, the owners of one flat have recently been prohibited from using it as an Airbnb let without planning permission, raising the prospect of copycat actions elsewhere.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/17/airbnb-rent-unaffordable-elizabeth-warren-neighborhoods\">Airbnb is driving up the rent in your urban neighborhood | Alexander Zaitchik</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/01/berlin-authorities-taking-stand-against-airbnb-rental-boom\">In Berlin,</a> people who let more than half of their flat short-term without obtaining permission from the city council now risk a fine of \u20ac100,000. And in London, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/feb/10/airbnb-to-be-legalised-in-london\">a 90-day rule was introduced last year</a> under which no property can be rented out on Airbnb, or any similar service, for more than three months a year without planning permission.</p> <p>So how is Airbnb responding? In New York the company has filed a lawsuit in the US federal court. But at a wider level the company is now supporting efforts to prevent these types of actions from taking place in the first place. And the best way to do this, Airbnb thinks, is to get its millions of hosts to rise up on its behalf.</p> <p>Last year the company announced plans for 2016 to create homesharing clubs in 100 cities around the world. The aim, it said, was to form \u201ca powerful people-to-people based political advocacy bloc\u201d.</p> <p>The bulk of the clubs are in North America, with a couple in Australia, South America and Asia, and an increasing number in Europe. In Britain, however, the number of clubs is negligible, even though there are more than 40,000 listings on Airbnb. The company is concentrating its efforts on building this UK base. Meetings, such as the one at the Abbey Tavern in Kentish Town, have been happening all over London as Airbnb seeks to build a grassroots campaign to fight the threat of greater regulation and more restrictive policies.</p> <p>The hosts at the Kentish Town meeting are told that, earlier this year in Berlin, Airbnb \u201cdropped the ball\u201d after the city\u2019s ruling on short-term lets \u2013 the suggestion being that it did not want this to happen again elsewhere. As a result of that ruling, the <a href=\"https://www.airbnbaction.com/berlin/\">Berlin Home Sharers Club</a> was created and started lobbying to try to change what it saw to be an unfair policy. In London, the 90-day rule may itself not be onerous compared to other cities, but there are growing calls for further regulations .</p> <p>Airbnb\u2019s Jonathan steers clear of telling the group that they should lobby for change. \u201cOn the one hand, would Airbnb like to see homesharing groups set up all over Europe? Absolutely,\u201d he says. \u201cWould it share in their interests? Absolutely. But whether those sharing clubs decide that their only interest is to share electricians and plumbers or to take political action is completely up to them,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The next slide focuses on Barcelona, a city where, in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/07/airbnb-fined-illegal-tourist-lets-barcelona-catalonia\">Airbnb was fined \u20ac30,000</a> for breaching tourism laws. Later, another slide listing \u201cwrite to your MP\u201d as a suggested activity is shown. \u201cWriting letters to local newspapers and selected officials is obviously something that we would want to see concerned hosts do, but only if it applies to them and if they\u2019re motivated to do so,\u201d Jonathan says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/13/airbnb-cities-urge-government-crackdown-elizabeth-warren\">Lawmakers join Elizabeth Warren's call for US to 'step in' on illegal Airbnb hotels</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chris Lehane, Airbnb\u2019s head of global policy and communications, said the clubs act as \u201ca voice against the powerful\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThese folks absolutely should have the capacity to go out there and represent themselves, and we\u2019ve been clear that we want to provide that support and provide some of the infrastructure,\u201d he said. \u201cThis can be an incredibly effective advocacy tool. I think we\u2019ve been pretty transparent and open about that.\u201d</p> <p>The networks of host groups, which in effect lobby on behalf of the company, are an illustration of how far Airbnb has grown since its inception in 2007. Back then, founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia could not afford the rent on their San Francisco flat and so put three airbeds on the floor and charged $80 a piece for their first guests.<br></p> <p>Even by the rapid standards of growth in the tech industry, the company has expanded very quickly. It is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/22/airbnb-valuation-500-million-funding-round\">valued at $30bn</a>, and claims two million property listings in 191 countries. That valuation puts the worth of the Californian firm at more than Hilton Hotels.</p> <p>Wouter Geerts, an analyst for Euromonitor International, says this rapid growth has led to the \u201ccorporatisation\u201d of Airbnb, with more listings from other hospitality companies and people with multiple properties. \u201cThat might be hotels or estate agents, serviced apartment providers. They all look at Airbnb and think \u2018actually what is stopping us putting these properties on Airbnb as well and making extra money?\u2019. And of course there are more and more stories about landlords that push out long-term tenants because they can make more money through Airbnb,\u201d he said.</p> <p>One of the most frequent criticisms of Airbnb has come from the hospitality industry, which has complained of the differences in regulation that hoteliers have to operate under, compared to Airbnb. But the organisation that acts as the voice of this industry in the UK says it is not just about them. \u201cMany councils in London have expressed their concerns recently,\u201d says Ufi Ibrahim, chief executive of the British Hospitality Association. \u201cMuch of that is because the sharing economy \u2013 and in particular we are talking about the unlawful professional landlords, the pseudo-landlords operating illegally \u2013 has put a huge strain on rental prices.\u201d</p> <p>Increasing levels of hostility to Airbnb have also started to come from the neighbours of those who let their homes through the website. Last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/09/beware-pitfalls-airbnb-rental-plansbreaching-leases-mortgages\">a property court in London ruled</a> that homeowners whose leases say that their homes can be used only as a private residence cannot rent out their properties as short-term lets. The case came after the neighbours of Slovakian interior designer Iveta Nemcova informed the freeholder of the building that she was listing her flat in north London on Airbnb. As a result, Airbnb hosts have been warned that they could be in breach of the terms of their mortgages and building insurance policies.</p> <p>One homeowner who spoke to the <em>Observer</em> said that the ground-floor flat in her building had been rented out on Airbnb by a tenant without the knowledge of the owner. As a result, the house insurance of the whole building was potentially invalidated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/06/the-airbnb-effect-amsterdam-fairbnb-property-prices-communities\">The 'Airbnb effect': is it real, and what is it doing to a city like Amsterdam?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In London, Westminster City Council is investigating 1,200 properties alleged to be let in excess of the 90-night limit. Enforcement notices have so far only been issued against two. \u201cIn practical terms it is a real challenge for us to gather evidence to prove that individuals are letting properties for over 90 nights,\u201d a council spokesman said.</p> <p>The scrutiny that Airbnb faces from both users and policymakers around the world comes after the site\u2019s runaway growth. John O\u2019Neill, director of the Centre for Hospitality Real Estate Strategy at Pennsylvania State University, estimates that the number of hosts has doubled in the last year with revenue up 60%. With that growth has come an ecosystem of support companies, typically property management firms that submit the advert for the property onto the website and then may manage guests arriving and leaving, dropping off and collecting keys, for example.</p> <p>The exact effects of this growth on the hotel industry are unclear. The British Hospitality Association said it would be \u201cunfair\u201d to say there had been an impact on the demand for its members\u2019 services as a result of Airbnb \u2013 and instead the association focuses its criticism on the effect on housing. Airbnb says that its growth has been a reflection of how people live, and describes the attacks from the hotel industry as \u201cdisappointing but not surprising\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/29/airbnb-europe-managing-director-olivier-gremillon-london-house-prices\">rejecting claims that it has a negative effect on the housing market</a>.</p> <p>\u201cHomesharing puts money into the pockets of regular people and spreads guests and benefits to more communities and businesses,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cCountless cities around the world have introduced clear home-sharing rules, and we will continue to be good partners to policymakers and work together on progressive measures to promote responsible homesharing.\u201d The vast majority of hosts follow the rules, it said.</p> <p>Where the Airbnb debate goes next, after such a period of rapid growth, is unclear. Some hotel companies, instead of continuing to fight Airbnb, have chosen to join it. \u201cThe larger hotel chains are moving away from trying to combat Airbnb. Initially there were some kneejerk reactions of \u2018we have to lobby against this, we don\u2019t exactly know what\u2019s happening, they are not regulated well\u2019. Most of the companies have moved on from that now and they have started to realise certain potentials that it brings,\u201d said Geerts. \u201cThere is this movement of looking at short-term rentals not as a negative, but more as a positive, and seeing the changing demands of consumers.\u201d</p> <p>This was illustrated in April when French hotels group Accor, said to be Europe\u2019s largest hotelier by room numbers, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-onefinestay-m-a-accorhotels-idUSKCN0X20BG\">paid \u00a3118m to acquire Onefinestay</a>, which offers short-term lets on expensive homes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/22/airbnb-valuation-500-million-funding-round\">Airbnb raises at least $500m in new funding at $30bn valuation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>O\u2019Neill estimates that there are 70 lobbyists working for Airbnb in the US, trying to get favourable legislation passed to benefit the company. \u201cMost hoteliers I speak with have accepted Airbnb\u2019s existence and growth. Their concerns have more to do with levelling the playing field between hotels and Airbnb operators, because Airbnb has so many unfair competitive advantages relative to hotels,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Others have said that regulators need to be fair in how they set out the rules that Airbnb and other similar companies must adhere to. Robert Vaughan, an economist with accountancy firm PwC, said there was a huge variation in those affected \u2013 from someone renting out their sofa, to landlords with multiple properties \u2013 and there is a difficulty in applying the same rules to all of them.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill says that while Airbnb may continue to grow, it will not have the free rein it had previously. \u201cI don\u2019t think there will be a free-for-all of unregulated growth as there has been in the past,\u201d he said.</p> <p><strong>Back at the meeting </strong>in Kentish Town, the night ends with a positive response to the homesharing clubs idea. \u201cWe need to write a letter,\u201d suggests one host. \u201cWe should meet every three months,\u201d suggests another. As the meeting draws to a close, nearly everyone agrees on the need for a club. Jonathan jumps in again: \u201cI do want to stress that there are other sorts of flavours to home-sharing clubs,\u201d he says, launching into a description of a collective bedsheet-washing initiative, but few are listening. As the meeting ends, the group are asked to put their hands up if they want a local club. Nearly every hand goes up.<br></p> <p><em>The Observer reporter who attended the Kentish Town meeting is an Airbnb host</em><br></p> <p><strong>Growing concern around the world</strong><br></p> <h2>BARCELONA</h2> <p>Authorities in the Catalan capital recently stepped up their campaign against homes illegally rented out to tourists using homesharing websites. Hundreds of listings were ordered to be removed, and Airbnb and another online rental firm, Homeaway, faced fines of \u20ac60,000 each.<br></p> <p>Homeowners who want to rent out properties to tourists must apply for a licence, and a team of 20 inspectors has been set up to find those who do not adhere to the rules. The city\u2019s mayor, Ada Colau, who took office in 2015, stopped the granting of new tourist licences for homes and hotels. She has blamed the rise in Airbnb popularity for growing tensions between residents and rowdy tourists.</p> <p>The number of people using Airbnb in Barcelona tripled to 900,000 in the three years to 2015.</p> <h2>REYKJAVIK</h2> <p>The 1,600 short-term property lets in Iceland\u2019s capital have to operate under strict rules introduced in June. The legislation allows residents to let their property for 90 days a year before they must pay business tax. The move comes as Iceland\u2019s population of 332,000 is set to welcome 1.6 million visitors this year \u2013 a 29% increase on last year \u2013 drawn by the glaciers, fjords, lava fields, hot springs, hiking trails and midnight sun.<br></p> <p>The move is one of a series aimed at controlling the rapid rise in visitor numbers, including <em>Game of Thrones</em> fans travelling to the filming locations of the television drama. One report estimated there was a 124% increase in Airbnb rentals in one year as residents cashed in on the popularity of the country, with more than 100 flats available on the capital\u2019s main street alone.</p> <h2>MOSCOW</h2> <p>Airbnb said last year that the Russian capital was one of its fastest-growing markets, fuelled by high inflation and low incomes. Activity doubled in one year, driven by an increase of single rooms in apartments, which were being listed for short-terms lets in an attempt by many homeowners to make ends meet, given the country\u2019s economic problems.<br></p> <p>The growing interest in Moscow on Airbnb brought it into the top 10 most popular cities by bookings on the website at a time when there was no sign of legislative regulation to restrict use of the service. The sharp increase came at the same time as falling wages, which were down 8.8% in the first half of last year. The average price of a private room for a night in the city is \u00a327, and \u00a345 for an entire home, according to the site.</p> <h2>LISBON</h2> <p>The city has bucked the trend of some of its European neighbours, and instead worked to make it easier for short-term rentals to operate. Hosts are required to register their properties as short-term rentals but there is no limit on the number of nights per year that they can operate.<br></p> <p>Mayor Fernando Medina has said people should not be scared of the new tourism dynamic and wants the city to be able to take in more tourists, in turn reducing the number of empty buildings in Lisbon. Tourism is seen as an important part of Portugal\u2019s economic recovery. Airbnb listings in the greater Lisbon area have almost tripled in the past three years.</p> <h2>SAN FRANCISCO</h2> <p>Although the city is home to Airbnb\u2019s HQ, it also operates strict rules for hosts, who have to register with authorities. If Airbnb advertises an unregistered property it can be fined $1,000 a day for each listing. One action group has posted \u201cwanted\u201d flyers. The crime? \u201cAirbnbing our community\u201d and \u201cdestroying affordable housing for immigrant, minority, and low-income families\u201d. Resident groups have campaigned against Airbnb and there have been reports of tenants being evicted so landlords can list on the site. Last year Airbnb successfully campaigned against Proposition F, or the \u201cAirbnb initiative\u201d, planned legislation that would have reduced the number of days owners can rent their properties. Airbnb\u2019s victory was helped by its grassroots homesharing club, which voted in large numbers against the law.<br></p>",
  "<p>Denis Su\u00e1rez has an answer to that question: the one about Lionel Messi and a wet Wednesday night in Stoke. \u201cOf course he could,\u201d he says quietly, hardly heard over the rain against the roof. \u201cHe\u2019d pick up the ball, dribble past three players and hit it into the top corner.\u201d</p> <p>Su\u00e1rez knows better than most; he has been there, seen that. He nods in the direction of the Sant Joan Desp\u00ed training pitch where Barcelona have just finished the morning session on a sodden pitch, while eight kilometres beyond lies the Camp Nou \u2013 and the last time he was there, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/19/barcelona-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report-messi\">Messi scored a hat-trick against Manchester City</a>. On a wet Wednesday night.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen him seen him do it here in the rain, I\u2019ve seen him do in the midday sun,\u201d Su\u00e1rez says. \u201cHe does it where he wants, when he wants. Messi\u2019s unique. Put him in any team in the world and he\u2019d be the best, just the same. And against English teams it usually goes OK for him.\u201d OK is one word for it: Messi\u2019s third against City a fortnight ago was his 16th in 15 games against English sides. That makes it sound easy, but Su\u00e1rez knows that it is not. Football is different in England, it does require adaptation. He knows that too as he has experienced it for himself.</p> <p>Su\u00e1rez will be reunited with familiar faces at the Etihad on Tuesday, from Pablo Zabaleta, Sergio Ag\u00fcero and David Silva to Xabi, Greg and Steve; friends who remain. His sister, Zulay, will be there, too: she still lives there with her boyfriend, a City fan who he hopes will change sides for one night.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/29/sergio-aguero-to-start-against-barcelona-in-champions-league-says-guardiola\">Sergio Ag\u00fcero to start against Barcelona in Champions League, says Guardiola</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is three years since Su\u00e1rez left the club he joined at 17, but so much as happened that it feels longer. Still only 22, he has been from City to Barcelona to Sevilla to Villarreal and back to Barcelona. A lot has happened at the Etihad too. From<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/roberto-mancini\"> Roberto Mancini </a>to Manuel Pellegrini and Pep Guardiola, it is a different club now, one that might have suited Su\u00e1rez.</p> <p>City\u2019s aspirations were forming when he was there, but the change had barely begun. Ferr\u00e1n Soriano and Txiki Begiristain had been there a couple of months when he left in 2013 and the coach they pursued was almost three years away. Yet the midfielder does not regret going and nor does he regret departing, just as he does not regret moving on every summer for four years, always wanting more, the ambition and bravery striking at each step. Tuesday\u2019s team-sheets should vindicate his decisions. Had things been different he might have been in the City team; with the injury to Andr\u00e9s Iniesta there is a reasonable chance he will be in the Barcelona side instead.</p> <p>He might have been there sooner, or not at all. The point, he believes, is that he is there now. Barcelona wanted Su\u00e1rez when he left Celta in 2011 but City offered the money his club desperately needed. Some in Vigo say he saved them by heading to Manchester. For him, the opportunity was huge and there is affection for City, even if ultimately he probably turned up too early. In their development, that is, if not his.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I arrived City was a more English club; now it\u2019s a more globalised club,\u201d he says. He has spoken before about the limited opportunities for young players and the way the youth league structure does not benefit development, while the style did not favour him either.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/29/west-bromwich-albion-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Sergio Ag\u00fcero hits two as Manchester City thrash West Bromwich Albion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen I arrived I went to the US with the first team, played there, and Mancini was very happy with me in training,\u201d he says. \u201cHe told me: \u2018This year you\u2019re going to make your Premier League debut, you can be a very good player for us.\u2019 But then pre-season ends, we go home, I go to the <em>filial</em> [City\u2019s Under-21 side], the coach [Andy Welsh] doesn\u2019t know me and I hardly play.\u201d</p> <p>It did not take long before Su\u00e1rez spoke up. Animated now, he speeds through what happened, step by step. As he remembers it, there is no bitterness or anger, just an unusually straight honesty and a rare clarity. Determination too. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand it. There\u2019s a guy two metres tall playing in my position because he\u2019s stronger.</p> <p>\u201cI went to talk to David, City\u2019s scout in Spain, Gary [Cook] and Brian Marwood. I told them that if it didn\u2019t change I didn\u2019t want to stay. I\u2019d left home, left everything behind, and this wasn\u2019t the way it had been sold to me.\u201d</p> <p>It might have been easy to react badly, to ask who this kid thought he was, but City listened. \u201cAfter that, things changed dramatically,\u201d he says. \u201cI kept training with the first team but played for the <em>filial</em> and that first season was good. I made my debut with Mancini in the League Cup and was included in the league squad [sometimes]. At the start of the second season I thought there\u2019d be chances but I got injured, so it wasn\u2019t great. Pellegrini arrived and I decided to leave.\u201d</p> <p>Barcelona wanted him and with a year left on his contract, City could hardly stop him. Su\u00e1rez was 19 and, again, the matter-of-fact way he describes it is striking. Just as it is when he talks about joining, and leaving, Barcelona, Sevilla and Villarreal. At times, he had to push but he did not hesitate. This summer, Barcelona exercised a \u20ac3.5m buy-back option, a fee he says \u201cclearly isn\u2019t my market value\u201d. It must have been hard to keep moving, keep risking? \u201cLook,\u201d he says, \u201cthe difficult thing was to leave home. It was relatively easy after that. And since leaving Barcelona it\u2019s always felt like a path back again. Now I\u2019m here, I want a place in the first team, to be here for years and win things.\u201d</p> <p>First step, win against City, the club partly built in Barcelona\u2019s image. \u201cBar\u00e7a is a role model for every club: everyone wants to play like them,\u201d he says. The question is can they really? \u201cWell, they can try,\u201d he replies. \u201cBar\u00e7a hasn\u2019t come about in two years. It\u2019s years of building an identity, staying faithful to a philosophy, the kids in the academy playing like the first team. City will try to do that. I know, I was there: they showed me the project, everything they wanted to do. They have the structure and the ability. Now they\u2019ve signed a coach who\u2019ll help them do that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/28/foreign-ownership-english-football-clubs-leicester-city\">Foreign ownership of English football clubs may chip away at game\u2019s core | Richard Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou can see that Pep\u2019s giving young players a chance. When I was there it was a bit different, it was the more physical players who went up to the first team. It was about strength. The <em>filial</em> played more direct style: almost long ball forward, look for the second ball. When Attilio [Lombardo] took over we tried to play a little differently but things didn\u2019t change much. The way the first team play now is magnificent; Pep\u2019s changed the philosophy. They already played attacking football but now it\u2019s more about possession, emphasising the importance of having the ball.\u201d</p> <p>At Barcelona that is ingrained. There is much talk of philosophy. Su\u00e1rez tries to explain what that is. \u201cBarcelona\u2019s play is positional. Everyone respects their position and when any player has the ball he has two others making a triangle for him, offering passes. He always has an exit,\u201d he says, marking positions on the table. \u201cOne here, another here, another here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s our football and you have to respect that to play here; if you respect those positions, you have options. We usually play a 4-3-3 which facilitates that. I remember when I arrived at Bar\u00e7a B I was an interior [to the side of a narrow midfield three] and I was all over the pitch. Eusebio [the coach] got hold of me, divided the pitch into different squares and said: \u2018these are your action zones: relax, stay there, the ball\u2019s going to arrive. You don\u2019t need to go wandering to find it; it will come. And from there, you play\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt Bar\u00e7a the players are all so good. The centre-back can come to here,\u201d Su\u00e1rez says, finger tracing a line up the \u2018pitch\u2019. \u201cAnd from there he can pass; you don\u2019t need the deep midfielder to drop to get it off him. If you wait \u2013 each man in his position \u2013 then in the end, if you\u2019re well positioned, the ball will come. Football\u2019s easier that way. Watch the <em>rondos</em> [piggy-in-the-middle exercises] here and the ball travels very fast. The ball, eh. That\u2019s what has to move quickest. The drills speed you up; you learn to move before the pass.\u201d</p> <p>That said, it helps to have the best players. Like Iniesta, who Su\u00e1rez admires most. \u201cIt seems at times that he is floating just above the grass,\u201d he says. Or his namesake, Luis, the least Bar\u00e7a of the Bar\u00e7a players. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a tight spot, under pressure, you can hit it long and he\u2019ll fight with anyone to win it and keep it,\u201d Su\u00e1rez says.</p> <p>\u201cBar\u00e7a have had different strikers: Ibra[himovic], Leo as a false nine, F\u00e0bregas too. Now Su\u00e1rez. Above all, he\u2019s a goalscorer but he gives you other options and he can play in a possession team too. He\u2019s the best striker in the world. There aren\u2019t many players who\u2019ll score 50 goals a season.\u201d</p> <p>There is one, though. Denis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s team-mate, the man he says would could pick the ball up on a wet Wednesday night in Stoke, or better still a wet Tuesday night in Manchester, dribble round three men and stick the ball in the top corner.</p>",
  "<p>Theresa May abandoned her opposition to a third runway at Heathrow only because she was \u201cterrified\u201d of being seen as anti-business after the Brexit vote, the Liberal Democrats claim.</p> <p>Ahead of a byelection caused by the resignation of Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, the Lib Dems are preparing to unleash their biggest ever campaign on the Richmond Park and North Kingston seat, in the hope of winning over Tory voters who are against Heathrow expansion and concerned about the UK\u2019s exit from the EU.</p> <p>The party\u2019s prospective candidate for the contest on 1 December, Sarah Olney, told the <em>Observer</em> it was clear that last week\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/heathrow-airport-expansion-gets-government-approval-gatwick\"> move to approve a third runway </a>\u2013 something the prime minister had told her own constituents in nearby Maidenhead that she opposed \u2013 was not taken on the basis of economic or environmental evidence.</p> <p>\u201cThe decision on Heathrow was clearly driven not by concern for the arguments, still less for local people whose lives will be blighted, but by worries about Brexit,\u201d Olney said. <br></p> <p>\u201cTheresa May dared not block Heathrow because she was terrified of being seen as anti-business.</p> <p>\u201cIn reality the economic case for a third runway is at best flaky, but this decision was all about public relations. People in Richmond could get an airport expansion they didn\u2019t want because of a Brexit they didn\u2019t want, from a prime minister who didn\u2019t want them either.\u201d</p> <p>The Tories have since decided they will not put up their own candidate against Goldsmith. The contest was triggered last week when Goldsmith, a long-term opponent of Heathrow expansion but a hardline Brexit supporter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/oct/25/heathrow-gatwick-airport-expansion-decision-day-politics-live\">honoured a pledge to stand down </a>if the go-ahead for a third runway was given, and announced he would stand as an independent.</p> <p>The Lib Dems now believe they have a chance of overturning the huge 23,010 majority Goldsmith won at last year\u2019s general election by appealing to a local electorate of which 72% voted for Remain on 23 June, and most of which is fiercely against the airport\u2019s expansion.</p> <p>Goldsmith starts out as the bookies\u2019 favourite, but the Lib Dems are determined to point to his pro-Brexit views and also to question how independent he is. On Saturday the local Conservative Association\u2019s website was still covered with pictures of Goldsmith and carried a message saying \u201csupport Zac Goldsmith in the Richmond Park constituency\u201d. <br></p> <p>At rush hour on Friday evening, Goldsmith was joined by a team of canvassers outside Richmond station \u2013 several of whom were seasoned Tory activists.</p> <p>The Lib Dems see the byelection as part of a fightback that began earlier this month when they<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/witney-byelection-lib-dems-tories-slashed-majority\"> leapfrogged Labour and Ukip to come second in the Witney byelection in Oxfordshire</a>, caused by David Cameron\u2019s resignation.</p> <p>\u201cThe Conservatives may be enjoying a huge poll lead but my sense is the public yearns for a credible, progressive opposition,\u201d Olney, an accountant, said. \u201cThat clearly cannot be provided by Labour now, which has no economic credibility and is unfit for government.\u201d</p> <p>In each general election between 1997 and 2010, the Lib Dems won more than 40% of the vote in the Richmond seat, only to see their support slump to 19.3% at the last election.</p> <p>On party leader Tim Farron\u2019s call for a second referendum on Brexit, Olney said it would take place only when May and her government had decided what Brexit meant. <br></p> <p>\u201cOnce we have explored all the options, we may find Brexit is not what we want. But given that that is what people have voted for, parliament can\u2019t take it upon itself to reverse a decision to leave. It needs there to be a second referendum in which the real consequences are spelt out.\u201d</p> <p>Within 48 hours of Goldsmith\u2019s standing down on Tuesday, the Lib Dems had leafleted the entire constituency and were trying to find a bigger office from which to mastermind their campaign.</p> <p>Nassar Kessell, a party activist who was out on the streets on Friday, admitted that Goldsmith, who fought an unsuccessful campaign to become mayor of London earlier this year, was popular locally. But he was still beatable. <br></p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that people like him. He\u2019s been the MP for a very long time. But there is certainly a part of the constituency that is upset about the issues he\u2019s championed \u2013 Brexit, for example. We can absolutely provide the alternative.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Four men wearing black-and-white stripes take their seats at a table.

For $20 a ticket, thousands flood into the 18,000-acre prison each Sunday in October and one weekend in April to watch inmates battle bucking horses and angry bulls.</p> <p>Most are tossed to the ground immediately. Some break bones or worse. Those who manage to hang on are awarded varying amounts of cash depending on the riskiness of the event.</p> <p>There\u2019s \u201cconvict poker\u201d, in which a bull is released on four inmates at a poker table. Whoever manages to stay in their chair the longest wins $250. The most dangerous event is \u201cguts and glory\u201d, where inmates try to pluck a poker chip from between the horns of a charging bull for a chance at the grand prize: $500.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4eb0700a6e8aca2b1dc0cd7499413a54c460d24a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4eb0700a6e8aca2b1dc0cd7499413a54c460d24a/0_19_5402_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"angola prison rodeo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Most inmate riders are thrown to the ground immediately.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerrit de Heus/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When asked why he was participating in the rodeo, Aldrie Lathan had a blunt answer: \u201cMoney.\u201d</p> <p>Lathan, who is serving a 65-year sentence for armed robbery, has competed in the rodeo for nine years. He\u2019s broken ribs, weathered concussions, and dislocated a shoulder. Still, he said, it\u2019s \u201cmost definitely\u201d worth it for the money.</p> <p>\u201cAfter you get hit by a bull one time, you know what it feels like and you don\u2019t have that fear any more,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Inmates receive no training before they go out to perform. Reports of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/b/bergner-rodeo.html\">serious injuries</a> have resulted in helmets, mouthguards and vests for participants. These precautions are about the only way the tradition has evolved since it began in the 1960s. Since then, the audience has grown along with keen media attention \u2013 the prison requires vigilant escorts for any press that comes through the gates, including the Guardian. These officials stress that professional cowboys and rodeo clowns are present at all times.</p> <p>Despite the danger, there\u2019s always a waiting list of inmates who want to risk their bodies for a shot at a couple of hundred dollars.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t really have that much outside help, so instead of calling and asking family members for money, I come out and participate in the rodeo and try to do everything on my own,\u201d Lathan explained. He\u2019s made more than $400 in just three Sundays.</p> <p>That\u2019s a windfall compared with what he can earn the rest of the year, when inmates are required to work for wages of between 2 cents and 75 cents an hour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9154f365b78d1a4904b5795569c5c28412999e42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9154f365b78d1a4904b5795569c5c28412999e42/0_33_5318_3191/1000.jpg\" alt=\"angola prison rodeo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018After you get hit by a bull one time, you know what it feels like and you don\u2019t have that fear any more.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerrit de Heus/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This pay scale \u2013 coupled with the fact that more than <a href=\"http://www.lajudicialcollege.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/A-1.-LSP-Angola-Demographics-4-2012.pdf\">75</a>% of its 6,300 inmates are black \u2013 is why Angola is frequently <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/prison-labor-in-america/406177/\">called</a> a <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/angola-prison-louisiana-photos\">modern-day</a> <a href=\"https://mic.com/articles/88461/a-modern-day-slave-plantation-exists-and-it-s-thriving-in-the-heart-of-america#.S95jhirV3\">slave plantation</a>. In fact, the prison inherited the name Angola from the working slave plantation it was before the civil war.</p> <p>Prison officials are adamant that no one is forced to participate in the rodeo. But the economics of the prison system challenge the definition of choice.</p> <p>The rodeo is the only chance most Angola inmates get to make a livable income \u2013 and not just inside the arena. The inmates who have been in prison the longest without incident, called trustees, are allowed to sell their work, from snakeskin wallets to rocking chairs, at the craft fair outside the rodeo and mingle with attendees. Others who have not yet earned trustee status sell from behind a chain-link fence. These men can make thousands of dollars in one day. <br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s a behavioral tool for us,\u201d said Gary Young, assistant warden for programming and communications director. \u201cWe extract an awful lot of good behavior\u201d in exchange for a booth.</p> <p>Rodeo revenue props up virtually all of the programs that shape inmates\u2019 lives, including trade schools, activity clubs, an award-winning magazine, and the prison hospice. Many clubs set up rodeo concession stands, where they raise an estimated $80,000 a day.</p> <p>Rodeo money even subsidizes the crown jewel of the department: the state\u2019s six-year-old <a href=\"http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2014/11/at_angola_prison_short_timers.html\">re-entry program</a>,<a href=\"http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2014/11/at_angola_prison_short_timers.html\"> which puts eligible inmates in a GED program, and trains them for certification in</a> a trade such as auto repair or air conditioner installation.</p> <p>Severe budget cuts have created even more intense need. A <a href=\"http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/11/c_paul_phelps_prison_shuts_dow.html\">prison closure</a> in 2012 sent 1,000 additional inmates to Angola with no increased budget or staff, according to Francis Abbott, a corrections supervisor with the re-entry program.</p> <p>Then, the state\u2019s technical and community college system was hit with budget cuts, forcing it to pull educational staff out of the prison, Abbott said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4d6e9f43efaceebcc11cb6a5bf95d5f23a27a413\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d6e9f43efaceebcc11cb6a5bf95d5f23a27a413/242_564_1991_2489/800.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Singleton at the Angola rodeo.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Justin Singleton at the Angola rodeo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aviva Shen/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat we had to do was look inward at our resources here,\u201d he said.</p> <p>To reduce costs, prison officials <a href=\"http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/politics/article_ed828ce3-e165-51a6-9d61-dd4e5f109e8c.html\">replaced</a> some of these community college instructors with inmates serving life sentences who had completed educational programs. Their pay \u2013 75 cents an hour \u2013 is also subsidized by the rodeo.</p> <p>These mentors are also the most likely to be allowed out on the rodeo grounds to mingle with outsiders. Justin Singleton, a 37-year-old lifer who teaches small engine repair skills, has a booth at the fair. He hopes to sell enough to send his 15-year-old daughter $400.</p> <p>\u201cNot for school supplies,\u201d he said. \u201cJust because I love her and because I\u2019m her father.\u201d </p> <p>Singleton said the rodeo also offered inmates something worth far more than money: a moment of humanity.</p> <p>\u201cHere in Angola, you have very limited contact with the outside world and sometimes it can be \u2026 a little depressing,\u201d Singleton said. \u201cSo it\u2019s encouraging when you come to the rodeo and see so many faces of people who are just happy to be here, treating you as if you\u2019re just a regular person.

In the meantime, here\u2019s Jos\u00e9 on why Henrikh Mkhitaryan needs a little more time:</em></p> <p>The United manager explained: \u201cHe\u2019s not injured. Sometimes I confuse the meaning \u2018fit\u2019 in the English language. Sometimes you have the view that fit means you are not injured, sometimes fit is great condition and ready to compete. That is a different thing for me. In Portugal we use different words for different situations. Micky is not injured. He is training with the team 100% with no limitation in terms of his fitness related injuries.</p> <p>\u201cI think it takes time. Some players, their profile is adapted to come and play, some others they need more time to feel the intensity and the aggression, the game without the ball, the competitiveness. Many times players come from different countries. The style of football is different and the reality is different in terms of competitiveness. There\u2019s no other country where it doesn\u2019t matter the team you play against, you have to play at the highest level or if you don\u2019t you have no chance. Micky needs time to become the top player he can be.\u201d</p> <p>Mkhitaryan was named player of the year in the Bundesliga last season and Mourinho cited Willian and \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda as examples of attacking midfielders who have flourished in his teams following difficult starts, at Chelsea and Real Madrid respectively.</p> <p>\u201cI think it will work out for sure,\u201d he added of the Armenian. \u201cI don\u2019t like to speak about players from other clubs but I don\u2019t think they will be upset with me \u2013 Willian, when he arrived at Chelsea, had problems to play. He went through a process, a difficult few months and then after he became a top player. The next season he became absolutely phenomenal and still is.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Di Mar\u00eda arrived at Real Madrid he also had to learn a lot about his game and a new reality. Sometimes it happens \u2013 sometimes with defenders but it\u2019s easier for defenders. For attacking players sometimes they arrive and go straight to success. Other times it takes a little more time. In Mikhi\u2019s case the process was interrupted by an injury that kept him out for about a month. To be out for a month in this process and then be fit but not fit to play you have to go through a process of getting match fitness and then you need competitive level to do it. Of course we believe in him and of course we believe that sooner or later there will be no problem.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/28/jose-mourinho-henrikh-mkhitaryan-manchester-united-prove-himself\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: Mkhitaryan needs time to prove himself at Manchester United</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>",

The transport, storage and communications sectors increased 2.2% in the third quarter, versus just 0.6% in the second quarter; and within this film and TV programme production grew by 16.4% in the three months to the end of September, outstripping other industries within the sectors. Overall UK GDP growth was 0.5% in the quarter.</p> <p>The production boom is being driven by projects such as <em>The Collection</em>, Amazon\u2019s fashion drama, which was partly shot in Wales, with backing from the Welsh government, and <em>Outlander</em> set in Scotland; HBO\u2019s mega-hit <em>Game of Thrones</em> put Northern Ireland on the tourist map.</p> <p>British Film Institute figures show that \u00a3728m was spent on high-end TV productions in the UK in the year to the end of June. In 2015 the UK independent production sector\u2019s revenues hit an all-time high of \u00a32.8bn, boosted by \u00a3851m of foreign investment, including money from Netflix, Amazon, HBO and other broadcasters.</p> <p>Jay Marine, European chief of Amazon\u2019s Prime video service, says that although <em>The Grand Tour</em> was filmed all over the world it was produced from the former <em>Top Gear</em> team\u2019s London office; there is \u201cno way this show would have been made anywhere else\u201d. Amazon has reportedly shelled out \u00a3160m for three series of the show, which <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Grand-Tour-Clips-in-Amazon-Video/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=10257739031\" title=\"\">launches online</a> on 18 November. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to invest more in British productions like this as we develop our collection of original and exclusive shows,\u201d Marine adds. \u201cNo one will be surprised to hear that many of the best creatives are to be found right here in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>The UK film production industry is in equally fine fettle, says the BFI, worth almost \u00a31.5bn last year, the second highest amount since it started keeping records in 1994.

The $225m film was shot at Warner Bros UK\u2019s Leavesden studio.</p> <p>The <em>Star Wars</em> prequel, <em>Rogue One</em>, was shot at Pinewood Studios. \u201cIt is really pleasing to see strong growth but we want to do more and share that ambition with the rest of the sector,\u201d said Ivan Dunleavy, chief executive of Pinewood, which also invested in <em>The Collection</em>.</p> <p>The boom has in part been fuelled by the introduction of tax credits for high-end drama TV, shows that cost more than \u00a31m per episode such as <em>Game of Thrones</em> and <em>The Crown</em>, and longer-standing breaks for films that pass a \u201ccultural test\u201d or are a qualifying co-production. These carrots have helped stop big-budget film and TV productions going to cheaper locations, such as eastern Europe, bringing in increased investment and attracting new players like Netflix and Amazon.</p> <p>HMRC figures show that \u00a3340m was paid to 530 claims for film tax relief in the year to the end of June, and \u00a396m for 115 claims relating to high-end TV. Another \u00a345m was paid out relating to video games developed in the UK.</p> <p>The Creative Industries Federation says the sector has been the fastest growing part of the economy since the crash of 2008, but warns that there is cause for concern over the impact of Brexit.</p> <p>John Kampfner, its chief executive, points to potential issues such as a skills shortage and the loss of \u201ctalented Europeans\u201d, and \u201ckeeping a seat at the table\u201d to make sure the UK can protect intellectual property rights for UK creators.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a golden era for British TV and film production,\u201d said Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s shadow culture secretary. \u201cUK shows are finding huge audiences overseas, our talent is being exported around the world and Britain has a global reputation for excellence that means producers, directors and studio executives want to work here.</p> <p>\u201cThat is an economic dividend we can\u2019t afford to put at risk. The strength of our creative industries gives us a cultural clout few other countries can match. It\u2019s vital that the creative industries, which account for one in 11 jobs in the UK, are at the heart of Theresa May\u2019s post-Brexit industrial strategy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc041392934b045eca957c3f79b5c9c3c29c3c55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc041392934b045eca957c3f79b5c9c3c29c3c55/395_224_3109_1865/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Jones in the Star Wars prequel, Rogue One, shot at Pinewood Studios.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity Jones in the Star Wars prequel, Rogue One, shot at Pinewood Studios.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Lucasfilm</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Made in Britain</h2> <p><strong>HBO\u2019s Game of Thrones</strong> The show has a reported $6m per episode for a 10-part series.

  "<p>A collection of MPs and leading figures from British industry gathered at a business park in Coventry last Thursday to discuss the future of manufacturing and the government\u2019s industrial strategy.</p> <p>Little did they know that 200 miles up the road in Sunderland, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/new-nissan-super-plant-hopes-for-tariff-free-eu-access\">Nissan was about to make a major announcement</a> with significant implications for the British economy that showed Theresa May\u2019s new government had already activated its industrial strategy.</p> <p>The guests in Coventry included senior executives from Rolls-Royce and Aston Martin, trade union leaders and council bosses. They were giving evidence to MPs on the business, energy and industrial strategy committee, which is going on a roadshow around the country to study what the government\u2019s industrial strategy should be.</p> <p>Hamid Mughal, the director of global manufacturing at Rolls-Royce, the FTSE 100 engineering group, told the MPs that industry was facing a \u201cradical shift\u201d because of dramatic advancements in technology. As well as 3D printing, robots and driverless cars, Mughal referred to Google Earth-like technology that would allow company bosses to monitor the inside of their factories around the world from the comfort of their desk. \u201cWhen people talk about an industrial revolution, there really is [one],\u201d Mughal said. \u201cThere is breathtaking technology that is coming together.\u201d</p> <p>This fourth industrial revolution would revolve around innovation and knowledge, he added, meaning that the UK, with its world-leading universities and advanced manufacturing companies such as Rolls, was well placed. \u201cFor once it plays to the UK\u2019s strength,\u201d Mughal said. \u201cI am absolutely convinced it will play to our strengths, but we need to get organised.\u201d</p> <p>The Rolls executive warned that countries around the world were \u201cinvesting huge amounts of political and economic resources\u201d into trying to attract manufacturers to open new facilities and turn their region into a global base for new technologies. \u201cManufacturing has become as popular as football,\u201d Mughal added.</p> <p>The comments provide a fascinating context to the prime minister\u2019s courting of Nissan, the Japanese carmaker. But they also show how ill-timed Brexit is for manufacturers and why it threatens to derail a revival in British manufacturing.</p> <p>Nissan announced last Thursday that it would build its new Qashqai and X-Trail models in Sunderland and also intended to turn the site into one of the biggest car plants in the world.</p> <p>The future of the Sunderland factory had been in doubt since the EU referendum. Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of Nissan, warned that the company could decide to build its next-generation models outside Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/30/nissan-hard-brexit-compensation-new-uk-investment-tariffs\">due to Brexit</a>. However, Ghosn said last week that Nissan was committing to the site after receiving \u201csupport and assurances\u201d from the government.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/27/theresa-may-hails-nissans-decision-to-build-new-car-in-uk-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59gpn\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2846714\"            data-video-name=\"Theresa May hails Nissan's decision to build new car in UK \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5812224ee4b0219a00d394f7\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/27/161027mayonnissan_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/27/161027mayonnissan.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/27/161027mayonnissan_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/27/theresa-may-hails-nissans-decision-to-build-new-car-in-uk-video\">Theresa May hails Nissan\u2019s decision to build new car in UK \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The news sparked a bitter political row, with Labour criticising the government for not revealing what it had offered Nissan, and for its apparently chaotic approach to leaving the European Union. May, however, hailed Nissan\u2019s decision as \u201cfantastic news\u201d. She had met Ghosn at Downing Street earlier in the month while business secretary Greg Clark travelled to Japan to meet Nissan representatives.</p> <p>One in three British-made cars are manufactured in Sunderland and it is the biggest plant in the country. More than 7,000 people are employed at the site, with a further 28,000 supply-chain jobs reliant on the factory, mostly in the north-east. Nissan opened the factory in 1986 after being wooed by Margaret Thatcher. It has invested more than \u00a33.7bn in the site since then.</p> <p>The growth of the Sunderland factory \u2013 which is now regarded as one of the most efficient in the world \u2013 has coincided with a spectacular revival in the British car industry.</p> <p>In the 1980s the automotive sector was in the doldrums. More than 25 years on, Britain is close to overtaking its all-time production record for cars. In the first half of 2016 Britain built 897,157, up 13% on 2015 and the best performance since 2000. The all-time annual record was set in 1972, when the country made 1.92m cars. Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) alone intends to build 1m cars a year by 2020.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89e11d7026a621d13cac73fea5d5a089c622b2fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89e11d7026a621d13cac73fea5d5a089c622b2fa/0_552_2628_1577/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nissan technicians prepare doors for the Qashqai at the company\u2019s plant in Sunderland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nissan technicians prepare doors for the Qashqai at the company\u2019s plant in Sunderland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel Roddis/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>British-based companies are also piling money into researching and developing new technologies, particularly smaller and more powerful batteries for electric vehicles and driverless cars. Dyson, the vacuum-cleaner maker, is understood to be working on an automated City car in a top-secret project at its Wiltshire headquarters, while JLR is working with Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG) on a battery.</p> <p>Lord Bhattacharyya, the founder of WMG, based at the University of Warwick, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/23/coventry-britain-motor-city-wheels-turning-again\">wants to turn Coventry into Britain\u2019s \u201cmotor city\u201d and make it a global hub for the development of electric cars</a>. Coventry will take a significant step towards becoming Britain\u2019s \u201cmotor city\u201d next September with the opening of the <a href=\"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/research/naic\">National Automotive Innovation Centre</a>. The \u00a3150m project, backed by JLR, WMG and the government, will become a base for advanced research, with academics and engineers working together.</p> <p>The ambition and the potential behind these projects explains the importance that May and her government attached to protecting the Sunderland plant. The automotive industry accounts for less than 1% of Britain\u2019s GDP, but it employs more than 800,000 people, accounts for 12% of Britain\u2019s exports, and invests billions in cutting-edge research. As well as being the home to JLR, Nissan, Toyota, Honda, Mini and others, Britain is home to eight of the 11 Formula One teams.</p> <p>However, the government faces more severe challenges than saving the Sunderland plant if it wants to stop Brexit destroying the potential of the automotive industry. One senior industry source said dealing with JLR and Nissan was \u201cchalk and cheese\u201d. JLR is the biggest carmaker in the country. It not only employs more than 35,000 people in Britain \u2013 five times the Nissan staff in Sunderland \u2013 but is investing \u00a33.5bn a year in research and development. JLR also has some major investment decisions coming up \u2013 such as where to build a new electric car plant.</p> <p>Sources say JLR is relaxed at present about the impact of Brexit. It is understood that the government has privately told some executives in the car industry that it is confident the sector can retain tariff-free access to the single market. The UK automotive industry is in a strong position when it comes to negotiations about leaving the EU, because Britain imports more cars from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> than it exports. Key European carmakers, such as Volkswagen and BMW in Germany, hold significant political clout nationally and locally.</p> <p>The introduction of tariffs on sales in Europe, tariffs on importing parts, and restrictions on hiring staff from abroad would have a damaging effect on the automotive industry. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, 77% of cars built in Britain in 2015 were exported, with 57.5% of those heading to the EU. Andy Palmer, chief executive of Aston Martin and a former executive at Nissan, said: \u201cWe would like to be tariff-free not just into the EU but tariff-free around the world from our perspective. We are 80% export, so a competitive or weak pound multiplied by tariff-free is good news for us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c1f0b422d7cbe1742b1488de207536c43730e24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c1f0b422d7cbe1742b1488de207536c43730e24/107_44_3739_2243/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aston Martin chief executive Andy Palmer with the new DB11 at the Geneva Motor Show in March this year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aston Martin chief executive Andy Palmer with the new DB11 at the Geneva Motor Show in March this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Aston Martin boss was speaking in Coventry after telling MPs that the government\u2019s industrial strategy needs to focus on bringing car parts makers back to Britain. \u201cWe rely on a supply chain that is offshore,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to try to bring it back. Alot of the intellectual property is in the supply chain.\u201d</p> <p>Despite Brexit, Palmer has confirmed that Aston Martin will press ahead with construction of a new factory in Wales. But just across the English-Welsh border in Merseyside, another problem is brewing for May in the shape of Vauxhall.</p> <p>Chuck Stevens, chief financial officer of Vauxhall\u2019s US owner General Motors, warned last week it was \u201cprepared to take whatever action is necessary\u201d to get its loss-making European business back on track. It described the situation in the UK as a \u201cspeed bump on our path to where we want to take the business\u201d and warned that it would write down the value of GM Europe by $400m (\u00a3329m) because of the referendum result and the subsequent fall in the value of the pound.</p> <p>Vauxhall employs around 4,500 staff at factories at Ellesmere Port in Merseyside and Luton. The Ellesmere Port plant came perilously close to closing in 2012 until Vince Cable, then business secretary, travelled to Detroit to agree a deal and reassure GM about the government\u2019s commitment to the industry. May and her business secretary may have to do the same. A report by consultancy firm LMC Automotive warned in July that GM was the carmaker most likely to shift operations from Britain to mainland Europe because of Brexit.</p> <p>The announcement from Nissan gave May a Brexit boost, but that was just the start of a long and rocky road for the government and the automotive industry.</p>",

The portion of Gibb\u2019s answer that related to police requests was clearer on the point: data on 21 pupils had been shared with forces after 31 access requests, he said.</p> <p>A DfE spokesperson later said: \u201dWithout evidence and data, we cannot have a clear picture of how the school system is working. We take privacy extremely seriously and access to sensitive data is strictly controlled.\u201d </p> <p>Officials have been at pains to stress that the nationality and country of birth data would not be shared with the Home Office, insisting that an interdepartmental agreement explicitly forbade it. However, the DfE has so far refused to reveal details of the agreement.</p> <p>In a bid to address privacy concerns, the school system minister, John Nash, said in a letter to peers, seen by <a href=\"http://schoolsweek.co.uk/nationality-data-wont-be-included-in-national-pupil-database-says-minister/\">Schools Week</a>, the new data would be held separately from the national pupil database, and claimed this would prevent other departments from accessing it. </p> <p>But Jen Persson, of <a href=\"http://defenddigitalme.com/\">defenddigitalme</a>, who has campaigned strongly for an end to the collection, said the move did not constitute a victory for campaigners. \u201cLord Nash only rightly confirms the fact that the database is not safe for the intensely sensitive data they already hold on 20 million people,\u201d she said. \u201cThe DfE have already given and continue to give out children\u2019s home address collected in school census data. The Home Office has asked for nearly 2,500 people\u2019s data since July 2015 alone.</p> <p>\u201cWhat else is it used for that we don\u2019t yet know?

  "<p>Mezcal, tequila\u2019s stronger and smokier relative, has become a staple spirit in trendy bars across Mexico and the United States in recent years, and the agave-based drink has inevitably attracted the interest of global alcohol giants. In the process local growers are worried a unique spirit is under threat.<br></p> <p>Traditionally produced in small batches by farmers who use artisanal methods, including earth-covered oven pits and horse-driven mills, mezcal has struck a chord with the growing sector of consumers passionate about slow food, farmers\u2019 markets and craft drinks.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Yet small distillers and industry insiders warn that mezcal\u2019s sudden popularity is fueling mass production that threatens to damage its reputation. Worse still the humble rural communities that produce the drink are left to deal with the resultant ecological damage while the newcomers leave with a greater share of the profits.<br></p> <p>Global investment has gathered pace as mezcal has established itself as North America\u2019s hippest new spirit. The Scotch whisky producer William Grant &amp; Sons launched the <a href=\"http://montelobos.com/\">Montelobos</a> brand in 2012 and the following year Bacardi bought the distribution rights for <a href=\"http://zignummezcal.com/eng/home.php\">Zignum</a>, an industrially produced mezcal owned by a subsidiary of the Mexican Coca-Cola bottler Femsa.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96d496b8ebbddeddddc88d0ef979471fd19edb40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96d496b8ebbddeddddc88d0ef979471fd19edb40/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crushing baked agave with a horse and a multi-ton stone wheel to make mezcal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crushing baked agave with a horse and a multi-ton stone wheel to make mezcal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mezcal Educational Tours</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The British multinational Diageo sealed a deal to distribute <a href=\"http://mezcalunion.com/\">Union</a>, another large brand, in February, and this summer the tequila giant Jos\u00e9 Cuervo launched <a href=\"http://mezcalcreyente.com/\">Creyente</a>, the second mezcal brand in its portfolio. Then the French conglomerate Pernod Ricard announced plans last month to launch a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-26/tequila-s-smoky-cousin-gets-push-from-world-s-biggest-distillers\">small-village brand</a>\u201d, promising that \u201csome of the value will be shared with the local community\u201d.</p> <p>These developments have raised concern among traditional distillers who want the industry to stay true to its rustic roots. Unlike tequila, which can only be made from blue agave and is typically produced using industrial techniques to enhance efficiency, mezcal is a more diverse spirit made from more than 40 species of the spiky plant using artisanal methods that differ across the country.<br></p> <p>Julian Saenger, who has partnered with artisan distillers in the south-western states of Oaxaca, Guerrero and Michoac\u00e1n for his <a href=\"http://www.domingomezcal.com/\">Legendario Domingo</a> brand, said the modern industrial methods favoured by tequila companies and a few mezcal producers kill off the earthy flavours and delicate aromas of roasted agave that vary enormously depending on when, where, how and with what the mezcal was made.<br></p> <p>\u201cEvery batch of mezcal should taste different, even if it\u2019s made by the same brand,\u201d Saenger said. \u201cI would have serious doubts about any mezcal that always tastes the same, because they must be using some kind of chemical to give it a specific taste.\u201d<br></p> <p>As well as taking off abroad, mezcal is enjoying a revival in Mexico\u2019s big cities, where it was once dismissed as cheap hooch for the working classes. However, Pedro Jim\u00e9nez, the owner of Guadalajara\u2019s hip mezcal bar <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Pare-de-Sufrir-Tome-Mezcal-175385519212027/\">Pare de Sufrir</a>, warned that the spirit\u2019s popularity is fueling a production boom that threatens the very characteristics that have made it so trendy.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Mezcal isn\u2019t a commodity, it\u2019s a cultural product. There\u2019s no way that you can mass produce mezcal and do it well</p> <footer> <cite>Pedro Jim\u00e9nez, bar owner</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cEveryone began to see a goldmine in this great new product,\u201d Jim\u00e9nez said. \u201cBut mezcal isn\u2019t a commodity, it\u2019s a cultural product. There\u2019s no way that you can mass produce mezcal and do it well.\u201d<br></p> <p>Increased production has led to agave shortages and inflated prices, encouraging farmers to sell entire fields of crops before they are fully matured, Jim\u00e9nez said.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis results in a drink of inferior quality. More and more mezcal producers are lowering their standards so they can produce in greater volume,\u201d he added. \u201cThey sell at low prices in order to sell more, but they\u2019re damaging the drink\u2019s reputation. This is very dangerous.\u201d<br></p> <p>Jim\u00e9nez also runs <a href=\"http://mezonte.com/\">Mezonte</a>, a civic organisation that helps artisanal distillers to promote their products and defend traditional mezcal culture. Although mezcal \u2013 like tequila, cognac and champagne \u2013 is protected by a denomination of origin (DO) that limits its production to certain parts of Mexico, Jim\u00e9nez described industry regulations as \u201ca slap in the face to people who make traditional mezcal\u201d.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ded52d21d4ab93878bd57ab3d213ec2764c7058b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ded52d21d4ab93878bd57ab3d213ec2764c7058b/0_605_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pedro Jim\u00e9nez at his Mezonte office.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pedro Jim\u00e9nez at his Mezonte office.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Duncan Tucker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mezcal has been made for centuries in 26 of Mexico\u2019s 32 states, but the DO limits production to just nine states. Distillers from other areas have expressed outrage over <a href=\"http://dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5428197&amp;fecha=29/02/2016\">NOM-199</a>, a new regulation proposed by the government and industry giants including Diageo and Pernod Ricard, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/10/mezcal-producers-mexico-komil-liquor\">would have forced them</a> to label their products as \u201c<em>komil</em>\u201d \u2014 an obscure indigenous word meaning \u201cintoxicating drink\u201d understood by almost nobody in Mexico.<br></p> <p>A revised proposal would have them use \u201c<em>aguardiente de agave</em>\u201d \u2013 meaning agave firewater \u2013 instead of \u201c<em>destilado de agave</em>\u201d, the more literal name currently in use. Agave spirits expert Clayton Szczech said that while preferable to \u201c<em>komil</em>\u201d, the word \u201c<em>aguardiente</em>\u201d still has \u201ca pejorative connotation that makes people think of cheap rum and seems designed to taint these products in the marketplace.\u201d<br></p> <p>Another regulation awaiting final approval, <a href=\"http://dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5428710&amp;fecha=04/03/2016\">NOM-070</a>, would affect distillers within the DO by dividing mezcal into standard, artisanal and ancestral categories, depending on the methods of production. Szczech said having these labels on every bottle would help small-scale distillers from the latter two categories to justify their higher prices to consumers by distinguishing their products from the cheaper, mass-produced brands in the standard category.</p> <p>Small distillers are still not happy with the proposed regulation. Graciela \u00c1ngeles, the general manager of <a href=\"http://www.realminero.com.mx/index.html\">Real Minero</a>, noted that large corporations could bend the rules and mass-produce mezcal that meets the artisanal or ancestral standards by hiring vast numbers of distillers who use traditional techniques.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe multinationals don\u2019t come here to open up factories,\u201d explained \u00c1ngeles, whose family has produced mezcal in Oaxaca for over 100 years. \u201cThey\u2019re smarter than that. They sign agreements with people who can produce artisanal mezcals, which have a higher market value.\u201d</p> <p>Most distillers have seen no improvement in their standard of living and continue to work without health insurance or benefits, \u00c1ngeles said, while savvy businessmen from outside their communities enjoy the lion\u2019s share of profits from the mezcal boom.</p> <p>Warning that mass production is already causing shortages of wild agave, deforestation, a loss of biodiversity and the discharge of liquid waste on a damaging scale, \u00c1ngeles implored regulators to set annual production limits.</p> <p>\u201cThis is neocolonialism,\u201d she said. \u201cThey come here to extract a resource and once that resource runs out they leave. They don\u2019t have any social responsibility.\u201d<br></p>",

  "<p>At 9.48am on Thursday 21 July this year, Dean Evans sent his stepfather, Steve Howell, a text message. \u201cAlright?\u201d it read. \u201cJust letting you know I\u2019m OK.\u201d It was the first time Howell had heard from the 22-year-old in nearly a month. But then, he was in Syria, on the frontline in the war against Isis, and his mobile signal was patchy at best. \u201cI was just relieved to hear he was well,\u201d Howell says. But that night, Evans became the second British citizen killed in Syria while fighting Isis.</p> <p>Evans\u2019s final hours weren\u2019t spent in a military-grade tank with RAF air cover or advanced medical support; he was fighting with a multinational group of ill-equipped militiamen loyal to the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) of Syrian Kurdistan, a guerrilla group in which officers are elected by troops, and men and women fight side by side. A dairy farmer from Warminster, Wiltshire, Evans had smuggled himself into Syria on his own, having been recruited by Kurdish activists on Facebook. He had no proper body armour, and fought with a black-market rocket launcher that could jam at any moment. </p> <p>Evans was one of an estimated 40 Britons who have travelled to Iraq and Syria to fight Isis since August 2014. To date, none has been prosecuted for doing so, although the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/33-34/90/contents\">Foreign Enlistment Act 1870</a> makes it illegal for any Briton to join a foreign army at war with a state at peace with the UK. More young British men continue to travel there, offering their lives to what might be considered someone else\u2019s war.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Howell is comforted by a single image: that Evans fell in a uniform. It didn\u2019t matter which one. \u201cAll Dean ever wanted was to be a soldier,\u201d he says. \u201cHis country wouldn\u2019t let him, so he sought a way to get a uniform\u2026\u201d He pauses. \u201cEven if it killed him.\u201d</p> <p>Howell is sitting on the sofa with his wife, Tracey, in the living room of their home in a picturesque market town near Warminster. A tough but affable man, he spent 20 years as a firefighter, and is heavily tattooed and stocky. It\u2019s a week since he learned of Evans\u2019s death, and already the room looks like an improvised shrine. Framed photographs of Dean cover almost every surface \u2013 buried in sand on a beach aged eight; in his army cadet gear aged 12; posing with the local football team aged 14. Most, though, show him cuddling his mum, Joanne. He looks slight and sweet and happy in all the pictures. All except one: at his mother\u2019s funeral, aged 17 and a half. \u201cHe was never the same after her death,\u201d Howell says.</p> <p>Evans was born on 7 October 1993, into a military family, in a military town. He was a small, skinny child who suffered with asthma and eczema. His mother split from his father, a British army soldier, when he was six, and met Howell two years later.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"523bda61367f2c2f8407fb072f819115c32ec50c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/523bda61367f2c2f8407fb072f819115c32ec50c/0_0_636_1176/541.jpg\" alt=\"Dean Evans, aged about 12.\" width=\"541\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dean Evans, aged about 12.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Steve and Tracey Howell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was at around the age of six that Evans began playing soldiers in the garden, and a boyish fascination soon grew into full-blown obsession. \u201cWe\u2019d put on uniforms and make dens every day,\u201d says his best friend, Jake, 23. \u201cDean loved everything about the military and outdoor survival. He collected warfare books, kept a second world war medal collection under his bed and owned all the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/03/ray-mears-q-and-a\">Ray Mears</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/sep/30/bear-grylls-acrobatic-show-endeavour-tour\">Bear Grylls</a> DVDs. He was the only kid I knew who watched war documentaries for fun.\u201d</p> <p>The moment he turned 12, Steve and Joanne enrolled Evans in Warminster cadets. Wilderness training, weapon skills, tactics, tracking: he couldn\u2019t learn quickly enough. \u201cHe was so proud to put on that uniform,\u201d Howell says, holding Evans\u2019s cherished cadet epaulets. \u201cIt made him feel invincible. He\u2019d spend whole weekends in the garden, always in uniform, practising survival skills.\u201d He remembers once when, aged 13, Evans tried to camp the night outside. \u201cHe lasted until 2am, when he got hungry,\u201d Howell chuckles. \u201cWe only know because he set off the smoke alarm trying to cook toast. Joanne got up and made him a cheese sandwich.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He'd spend weekends practising survival skills</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Everything changed in June 2011, after his mother\u2019s death. \u201cIt was an undiagnosed heart condition,\u201d Howell says. \u201cShe died in my arms in seven seconds.\u201d Evans had to be pulled off a cadets training weekend on Salisbury Plain so Howell could break the news. \u201cThe worst part was that he never got to say cheerio. It was the only time I ever saw him cry. It was as if his guiding light had gone out. She always told him, \u2018Deanie, you were born to wear a uniform. If your heart says be a soldier, follow it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Three months later, before his 18th birthday, Evans travelled to Salisbury Army Careers Centre to sign up. It did not go well. \u201cThe recruiter was obnoxious,\u201d Howell says. \u201cHe said, \u2018They won\u2019t take you, boy \u2013 you\u2019ve got asthma.\u2019\u201d Evans said it was only mild and that he\u2019d been a cadet, to which the recruiter sniffed, \u201cNah, that\u2019s boys\u2019 games.\u201d</p> <p>The knockback was devastating, made worse when three of his closest friends from the cadets were accepted. In July 2012, Evans thought he\u2019d found a solution: the <a href=\"http://en.legion-etrangere.com/\">French Foreign Legion</a>. He flew to France for a three-week trial. Steve and Tracey drove to Gatwick to pick him up afterwards. \u201cHe was heartbroken,\u201d Tracey says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to talk about it. All he\u2019d say was that he\u2019d failed the medical because of his asthma.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c120368cface617873afc3a1ad5b34bd3870f679\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c120368cface617873afc3a1ad5b34bd3870f679/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Howell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The army recruiter was obnoxious.

He enrolled on a farming course at Warminster College, got his driving licence and bought a secondhand Ford Focus. Then, in early 2015, three years after his Foreign Legion disappointment, Evans told Howell he was thinking of travelling around Germany and Poland to see the war graves, the Berlin Wall and Auschwitz. Howell thought it a good idea: \u201cI knew he was into all that, and he wasn\u2019t a troublesome lad. Why would I be suspicious?\u201d</p> <p>He left on the morning of 8 March. Despite having made Evans promise to text when he landed, Howell heard nothing for four days. He was worried. Then his phone bleeped. He can still recite the message verbatim. \u201cHi Steve, it\u2019s Dean,\u201d it read. \u201cJust to let you know I\u2019m in Syria. I joined YPG. I was always going to do this all along. Sorry.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Evans arrived in Syria on 14 March 2015. Police analysis of his laptop would later reveal he had contacted the YPG through its Facebook page, where they pledge to \u201cwage war against all forms of fascism and capitalist hegemony that try to enslave people and destroy nature\u201d.</p> <p>He flew from London to D\u00fcsseldorf, then to Berlin and on to Sulaymaniyah in northern Iraq. There, he was picked up by Kurdish rebels and smuggled through the desert into Syria. YPG commanders placed him in the Lions of Rojava brigade, a unit comprising mostly foreign volunteers, and gave him a nom de guerre: G\u00eevara Rojava, inspired by Che Guevara.</p> <p>The moment he arrived, Evans knew he\u2019d found his war. Burned-out cars, buildings colandered by bullets: it was like a film set. He\u2019d never been to war, let alone shot at someone in anger. But the men around him were his age and united by common purpose, much like the boys he\u2019d trained with in the cadets. \u201cBack home you have a lot of worries, about cars, money, social things, but here it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/13/dean-carl-evans-interview-isis-syria\">a reporter in Syria that April</a>. \u201cHere you just have one goal that\u2019s shared through everyone: defeating Daesh.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa9a3bd29711642dcdc3e71d33f80921c417ebda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa9a3bd29711642dcdc3e71d33f80921c417ebda/0_257_1917_1150/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Photographer Uygar \u00d6nder \u015eim\u015fek spent 12 days in Syria with Evans, on the right, and other YPG fighters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photographer Uygar \u00d6nder \u015eim\u015fek spent 12 days in Syria with Evans, on the right, and other YPG fighters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uygar Onder Simsek</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paid only in food, Evans spent the next three months fighting alongside Kurds, eastern Europeans, Americans and other nationalities in the besieged city of Tal Tamr, near the Turkish border. That April, a Turkish photographer, Uygar \u00d6nder \u015eim\u015fek, spent 12 days with Evans\u2019s unit, working on a story about the YPG. \u201cWhen I arrived, both the YPG and Isis had dug in, their lines about 300m apart,\u201d he says. \u201cMost days were calm, so they\u2019d eat, talk, have tea, play chess, read, cook, listen to music, clean their guns and do regular guard duties. But at night a lot was happening \u2013 unexpected attacks, shooting mortars. Snipers on both sides worked around the clock. They hardly ever slept. There was no electricity or running water. Sometimes they\u2019d risk enemy snipers and run into a house in no man\u2019s land just to take a warm shower.\u201d</p> <p>Like the others, \u015eim\u015fek describes Evans as a quiet soldier who observed more than he spoke. \u201cHe seemed like a calm, nice person \u2013 with a Kalashnikov,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Evans would later tell Tracey about his life in Syria (Howell couldn\u2019t bear to ask): scavenging for edible food in deserted shops, seeing comrades blown up, dysentery, decomposing bodies, desert heat, flies, long days, sleepless nights, fear. He also talked of all the new friends he\u2019d made. He never talked about the killing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Snipers on both sides worked all night and hardly slept. Dean seemed a calm, nice person \u2013 with a Kalashnikov</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was an especially bloody phase of the war, and Evans had distinguished himself amid the violence, rising from infantryman to sniper to rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) gunner. \u201cEven when fighters with an actual military background cowered under fire, he\u2019d put his head above the trench to shoot,\u201d Arges Artiaga, a Spanish former soldier in both his national army and the French Foreign Legion, tells me over Skype from Spain. \u201cHe was there to destroy Isis, that was his passion, and he never deviated from that.\u201d Artiaga remembers one night when Evans had a particularly crippling bout of dysentery. \u201cYet when I ordered him to go to hospital, he refused and stayed on post until his shift ended.\u201d</p> <p>Heval Serdar, a Dutch fighter who asked to be known only by his nom de guerre, was Evans\u2019s best friend during that time in Syria. Now back home, he talks fondly of Evans, recalling his love of energy drinks in battle, his \u201cdry British humour\u201d, how he could quote entire chunks of his favourite TV show, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/may/18/iprefertheamericanversion\">the US Office</a>. He was always telling people to \u201cchill\u201d. \u201cWe were like brothers,\u201d he says on the phone from Holland, \u201cbut we never talked about home. After all this time together, you know what we mostly talked about? Computer games. Though I always got a feeling Dean was looking for answers. Then again, wasn\u2019t everybody out there?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fd7464c5d82bc55f4b95bbb1d145c26fd859ef1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fd7464c5d82bc55f4b95bbb1d145c26fd859ef1/0_46_383_469/383.jpg\" alt=\"Dean Evans with his stepfather, Steve, and mother, Joanne, in 2008\" width=\"383\" height=\"469\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dean Evans with his stepfather, Steve, and mother, Joanne, in 2008.

He and Tracey were assigned a case worker from special branch, but they say he seemed to know less than they did. \u201cHe had more questions for us than we did for him,\u201d Howell remembers. A team from Wiltshire police searched Evans\u2019s bedroom and seized his laptop and bank details. \u201cThey wanted to know who Dean had gone to join,\u201d Howell says. \u201cThey wanted to know if he\u2019d been radicalised.\u201d</p> <p>Then, in May 2015, Howell received a text: \u201cCan I come home?\u201d Evans arrived back in Wiltshire on 26 June. Howell says he was detained by police at the airport for about nine hours. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t very happy about that,\u201d Howell says, \u201cbut said he had nothing to hide and told them what they wanted to know.\u201d</p> <p>Their lives together resumed. \u201cHe told us all that he wasn\u2019t going back after what he\u2019d seen,\u201d Howell says. \u201cHe got his job back on the farm and was talking about buying land in Australia. We thought he\u2019d got it out of his system.\u201d Looking back, though, there were signs that Evans would return. \u201cWhenever Isis was mentioned on TV, his face would change colour, like it turned his blood,\u201d Tracey says. \u201cIt was like he became a different person whenever Isis came up.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019d practise his Kurdish, too,\u201d Jake says. \u201cIt was when he started saving his money again that I realised he wouldn\u2019t be home long.\u201d </p> <p>They noticed that Evans now wore a pendant, green with a red star. \u201cHe said they were the colours of the Kurdish Women\u2019s Protection Unit [YPJ],\u201d says his friend Elly, 23, who was at primary school with him. \u201cHe said a female soldier he knew in Syria had given it to him, and that he wanted to go back to see if she was OK. He never had a girlfriend at home, so to get emotionally attached to a woman would have been a big deal for him.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the war in Syria was entering a bloody new phase. The Kurds, backed by US airstrikes, were gaining ground and confidence. They had flushed Isis from large swaths of Syria\u2019s north and were heading for the city of Manbij, a strategic outpost key to severing Isis\u2019s last supply line from Turkey. Evans never lost touch with his friends in the YPG, and he kept finding out that more were dying. \u201cHe said he couldn\u2019t just stand by while his friends were being killed,\u201d Jake says. \u201cTo him, they\u2019d become like family.\u201d</p> <p>When Evans went back to Syria on 28 January this year, he told the police he was planning to go. The police tell me that they gave Evans \u201cstrong advice\u201d not to, and told him that the Foreign Office cannot offer consular service to UK nationals who travel to Syria. Still, he wanted to leave.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75695db87fa33ed507667b9a1012c71b58bf3464\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75695db87fa33ed507667b9a1012c71b58bf3464/0_228_1917_1150/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tal Tamr, in Syria, where Evans spent three months.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018He was there to destroy Isis, and he never deviated from that\u2019: Tal Tamr, in Syria, where Evans spent three months.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uygar Onder Simsek</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This time, Howell gave him a lift to the airport. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him going without us clearing the air,\u201d he says. \u201cI just had a terrible feeling it would be the last time I\u2019d see him.\u201d They hugged, which Howell says they\u2019d never done before \u2013 \u201cHe thought hugs were a sign of weakness\u201d \u2013 and Evans handed him a letter. It was a will. It said: \u201cI, Dean Evans, leave this letter with my stepdad, Steve Howell, as I get ready to leave for Syria. I am going back to Syria to rejoin my brothers and sisters of the YPG\u2026 After watching Steve break after my mum died, I have decided to write down my thoughts and wishes. If I am killed in Syria, it is my wish that I stay in Syria with my brothers and sisters of the YPG who are my friends. I want my name added to my mum\u2019s headstone. Steve has been my dad for 13 years and I know he will do what I have asked him to do. I leave everything to him.\u201d As he handed his stepfather the envelope, Howell asked if he was afraid of dying. \u201cNo,\u201d Evans replied. \u201cI\u2019d much rather live a short, exciting life than a long, boring one.\u201d Then he added: \u201cI know that when I die, I will walk straight into the arms of my mum.\u201d Six months later, he was dead.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Their mission on the night Evans died was the same as it had been for 38 days: to drive Isis from Manbij. Freeman Stevenson, a 22-year-old American fighter in Dean\u2019s battalion, tells me that spirits were high at the pre-battle briefing. \u201cAll the guys were going through the usual banter \u2013 \u2018See you in hell\u2019, \u2018You\u2019re gonna get shot tonight\u2019, \u2018You\u2019re gonna get blown up\u2019 \u2013 you know, soldier stuff, like when actors tell each other to break legs.\u201d</p> <p>Evans was typically quiet. \u201cI\u2019ll admit it, I was scared,\u201d Stevenson says, speaking on the phone from the frontline near Manbij in August. \u201cBut then Dean, with his hands in his pockets, piped up, \u2018Guys, stop saying that. Everyone\u2019s going to be fine.\u2019 It was the last I saw of him. A few hours later, he was killed.\u201d</p> <p>Stevenson didn\u2019t see Dean fall, but heard what happened from those who did. \u201cDean\u2019s unit was pinned behind a wall on a city street. Bullets were flying, men were screaming; it was chaos. They had to keep moving.\u201d</p> <p>A Kurdish soldier ran to a building and kicked open the door. \u201cIt was booby-trapped,\u201d Stevenson says. \u201cHe got a blast of shrapnel in the face and went down.\u201d Dean dropped his rocket launcher and grenade bag, and ran into no man\u2019s land with a Kurdish female fighter named Er\u00een.</p> <p>It was a 30m dash across open ground. When they reached the man, he was glued to the ground by fear. There was an argument, confusion. But the man wouldn\u2019t budge. That\u2019s when an Isis rocket streaked out of a window above. \u201cIt exploded right between Dean and Er\u00een, engulfing them in smoke,\u201d Stevenson says. \u201cWhen it cleared, both were dead. Incredibly, the guy they ran out to get made it back alive. They\u2019d stayed out there a moment too long.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He wanted to see if a female soldier he knew in Syria was OK. He didn't have a girlfriend at home so it was a big deal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the Kurdish forces, Evans had found a purpose that the British army denied him and that farming couldn\u2019t give him: the war in Syria offered him a chance to do something meaningful with his life. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about killing people,\u201d Howell says. \u201cIt was about putting himself between innocent people and terror.\u201d</p> <p>More than that, Howell thinks, it filled a void. \u201cAfter losing his mum, Dean felt so lost and alone, but when he put on a uniform, he felt whole. He felt people would look at him and respect the fact that he was doing something he believed in. Why not?\u201d Then he adds: \u201cWe\u2019ve heard people say, \u2018What a waste of a life.\u2019 It\u2019s not a waste of a life. He died fighting for a cause he wholeheartedly believed in. Without people like Dean, people wouldn\u2019t be able to live like they do today. They are fighting for humanity.\u201d</p> <p>Twenty-five days after Dean\u2019s death, Manbij was finally liberated. It was one of the costliest battles of the war so far: up to 400 YPG fighters, including six foreign volunteers, were killed and many more wounded. \u201cThey locked 4,000 Isis fighters inside the city and offered them an ultimatum: surrender or die,\u201d Macer Gifford, a 29-year-old British volunteer who was there, told me in a London bar last month. \u201cTheir commanders wouldn\u2019t allow civilians to leave or their fighters to surrender, so they fought to the death.\u201d</p> <p>Evans, he says, was one of the first casualties of a shift in the power balance. \u201cThe fight has stepped up a gear since Manbij,\u201d he says. \u201cThe violence there was a test for what Aleppo already is and Raqqa will be \u2013 brutal. Each building becomes a fortress, each street a sniper\u2019s alley. Isis use human shields. Cities are very difficult to get back.\u201d</p> <p>Once it was rare for a foreign volunteer to die; now, Gifford says, an average of six are killed and 10 wounded in a single operation. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be more aggressive, more violent as Isis enters its death throes.\u201d This has not stemmed the flow of foreign volunteers offering their lives to the fight. \u201cI stopped at a YPG training camp on my way home in August, and I met a lot of Brits,\u201d Gifford says. \u201cFor people like me who grew up post-9/11, this is our Churchillian moment. We want to fight back against Islamic fascism, protect innocent people and fight for democracy. We want to come home with a sense of fulfilment.\u201d</p> <p>But fulfilment isn\u2019t always what fighters describe when they return from war. A few weeks after I spoke to Heval Serdar, Evans\u2019s Dutch friend from his first trip to Syria, he phoned me from Holland. He wanted to talk. \u201cI feel tremendous guilt,\u201d he said. \u201cI left Dean to die. I\u2019m here eating hamburgers, listening to music \u2013 the freedoms my friends are dying to protect.\u201d The line crackled. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve seen what Isis are capable of with your own eyes, it\u2019s impossible to live a normal life, knowing they\u2019re still there. I have to go back \u2013 for Dean, if not for myself.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Walk past the 110 electric guitars filed on shelves like a library archive, and the dozens of keyboards swaddled in dust, and the ancient amps that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/smiths\">the Smiths</a> used at their first gigs, and you eventually come to a toilet cubicle, slap bang in the middle of the room.

The walls are lined with a series of gold and silver discs: Mind Bomb by The The, Ignore the Ignorant by the Cribs, Talking With The Taxman About Poetry by Billy Bragg, all of them awarded to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/johnnymarr\">Johnny Marr</a>. In the corner of the loo, there is a trophy for <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/blogs/the-big-picture/johnny-marr-the-making-of-a-godlike-genius-774472\">\u201cgodlike genius\u201d</a>, presented to the guitarist in 2013 by the music magazine NME. It\u2019s a reminder that Marr\u2019s career didn\u2019t end with the Smiths.</p> <p>But 29 years since their demise, it\u2019s still the Smiths most people want to hear about. The band more or less invented indie, as Marr is quick to remind me. Their tunes (by Marr) were as delicate as their lyrics (by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/morrissey\">Morrissey</a>) were morose. They became known as pop\u2019s supreme miserabilists (not least because of songs such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjPhzgxe3L0\">Heaven Knows I\u2019m Miserable Now</a>) but it was a brand of miserabilism that was romantic and funny. (In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-cD4oLk_D0\">There Is A Light That Never Goes Out</a>, Morrissey sings: \u201cAnd if a double-decker bus/Crashes into us/To die by your side/Is such a heavenly way to die.\u201d) Between 1983 and 1987, they had 15 hits. Songs such as This Charming Man, William It Was Really Nothing and Big Mouth Strikes Again weren\u2019t just classic pop, they were perfectly formed short stories.</p> <p>Ever since the Smiths split, Marr has been reluctant to talk about the band and his relationship with Morrissey. Like Paul McCartney and the Beatles, he was blamed for being the one to walk away, and felt he was never quite forgiven. But at the age of 52, enjoying a successful solo career, Marr has just written a memoir, Set The Boy Free. He thinks it\u2019s time to put the record straight.</p> <p>We meet in his studio, a converted warehouse just outside Manchester. Marr is in skinny jeans and a polka-dot shirt, looking fit and clear-eyed. He says he loves the title of his book because it sounds like a famous song. But it isn\u2019t \u2013 it just came to him. As a little boy (and he was tiny, growing up) it was music that set him free from the mundanities of everyday life. He was brought up in a working-class family in Ardwick Green, Manchester, by Irish Catholic parents who were also mad about music. His father, \u201ca strong, brooding presence\u201d, laid gas pipes in the road; his mother, one of 14 children, cleaned at a hospital.</p> <p>There was nothing unhappy about his childhood, but there was something stultifying about suburbia. \u201cI was looking for something \u2013 transcendence.\u201d He looks embarrassed. \u201cThat sounds a bit pretentious, but common transcendence that everybody can relate to. I really like the word free. It has a sense of energy, and idealism, which I\u2019ve always felt.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ef2bee5ce4763f387d432c7a376ee7d6eb7bd51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ef2bee5ce4763f387d432c7a376ee7d6eb7bd51/138_37_1247_1021/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morrissey and Johnny Marr of the Smiths standing by the side of a van in 1984\" width=\"1000\" height=\"819\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the road with Morrissey in 1984.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Johnny Marr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was a bright boy, and went to grammar school. Like all guitarists, he says, he was good at English and art. But beyond that he didn\u2019t care much for academic work. He was obsessed with music: girl groups the Shangri-Las and the Shirelles, glam rockers T-Rex and Roxy Music, and most of all with guitarists.</p> <p>By the age of 13, he was playing in bands with people four years older. \u201cFashion, culture, rebellion, drinking, girls: I was learning so much, doing 16-year-old stuff. It felt like an apprenticeship for the only thing I was going to do \u2013 be a rock guitar player.\u201d Marr was already a star in the making, obsessed with mod haircuts and Crombie coats, spending every spare minute perfecting his guitar technique. He was a talented footballer and had a trial with Manchester City, the team he supported. But nothing could compete with his passion for music. Football fell by the wayside.</p> <p>Marr says he couldn\u2019t stand the strutting braggadocio of \u201ccock rock\u201d. His guitar heroes (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_Gallagher\">Rory Gallagher</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/keithrichards\">Keith Richards</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/nile-rodgers\">Nile Rodgers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.clashmusic.com/features/the-stooges-james-williamson-interview\">James Williamson</a> from the Stooges) didn\u2019t want to steal the show. So, rather than playing lead guitar, he devised a new way of playing for himself \u2013 using the rhythm guitar to replicate a whole band or orchestra. The technique was influenced by <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6467441.stm\">Phil Spector\u2019s \u201cwall of sound\u201d</a> and refined over the years in the studio. It often involved numerous guitar overdubs, and Marr referred to it as the Guitarchestra.</p> <p>When he got the idea for the Smiths, which he formed at 19, it was already his fifth serious band. This time he knew he didn\u2019t want to front it. \u201cThe few occasions I had to stand in front of a bunch of local kids at youth clubs, it was terrifying.\u201d As far as Marr was concerned, all the great bands were based on a partnership: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennon%E2%80%93McCartney\">Lennon and McCartney</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagger/Richards\">Jagger and Richards</a>. That\u2019s where Steven Morrissey came in.</p> <p>Marr was looking for a singer for his new band. One night he watched a South Bank Show on the great songwriting team <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Leiber_and_Mike_Stoller\">Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller</a>. Leiber said he had heard that Stoller wrote songs, liked the sound of him, found out where he lived and knocked on the stranger\u2019s door. Marr decided that that\u2019s what he would do; he had been told Morrissey was a good vocalist, so he would find out where he lived and knock on his door.</p> <p>They talked about music, and listened to Morrissey\u2019s rare Tamla 45s. Marr raved about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBRhh1wehN4\">Dusty Springfield\u2019s Little By Little</a>; Morrissey played him <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RLcw2bpOoU&amp;list=RD2RLcw2bpOoU\">Sandie Shaw\u2019s Message Understood</a>. When Marr left, Morrissey gave him some of his typed lyrics. After that, they were inseparable. \u201cEverything that was obsessive, excessive and poetic, all the big visions I carried around inside me, were also in him. The love of pop culture, and the pure dedication, was mirrored in my partner. I\u2019ve never seen it in anyone else before, and never in exactly the same way since. And the desperation. He was looking for someone like me and I was looking for someone like him. And we liked each other straight away. We really liked each other.\u201d</p> <p>What was the desperation? \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t going to happen for us, all that unfulfilled ambition was a hell of a lot to carry around. We weren\u2019t the sort of people who at 28 were going to be able to say, \u2018I was in a band; it didn\u2019t work out. That\u2019s why I\u2019m working in an estate agent.\u2019 The two of us knew that we were too into it to survive that.\u201d</p> <p>Were they as intense as each other? \u201cIn different ways, yeah. Mine comes out in physicality, exuberance. My mother used to say I\u2019m a cross between really intense and really laid-back.\u201d</p> <p>Marr says his relationship with Morrissey was as close as is possible without being lovers. Was he in love with Morrissey? \u201cNo, because I was in love with Angie [his then girlfriend, now wife], but we definitely loved each other. I think we all did.\u201d His old school friend <a href=\"http://www.andyrourke.com/\">Andy Rourke</a> (who had played in his first band, the Paris Valentinos) joined on bass, and <a href=\"http://www.mikejoyce.com/\">Mike Joyce</a> became their drummer. The four became good friends, but Marr says it was always clear that he and Morrissey were the leaders.</p> <p>The second Morrissey lyric Marr put to music was the ghoulish <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9DH0_b3F1c\">Suffer Little Children</a>, about the victims of Myra Hindley and Ian Brady (\u201cLesley Ann, with your pretty white beads/Oh John, you\u2019ll never be a man/And you\u2019ll never see your home again/Oh Manchester, so much to answer for\u201d). Didn\u2019t the words spook him? Well, at the time, he says, they were so besotted with each other, the lyrics were secondary. \u201cIt was, \u2018We like each other. You look good, I look good. I write music, you write lyrics. We\u2019re gonna do this.\u2019\u201d He smiles. \u201cWhen I saw, in the first songwriting session, my new group had a song about the Moors murderers, it was very much, <em>\u2018Fucking hell!</em>\u2019 But I went on instinct.\u201d</p> <p>Did he always think of the Smiths as his? \u201cIn a way that is protective, I did, yes. I wasn\u2019t old enough to be paternal, but it was kind of paternal.\u201d Marr looked like a young Keith Richards \u2013 and had the swagger. Morrissey was famously introverted, so Marr was marketed as the arrogant one. While he says he was 90% true to that image, there was always 10% that was terrified.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abe6cce46732369d82b07579cfa7576483db7653\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abe6cce46732369d82b07579cfa7576483db7653/302_0_4138_5820/711.jpg\" alt=\"Johnny Marr playing his guitar\" width=\"711\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The only thing I was going to do was be a rock guitar player\u2019: Marr in his studio.

Growing up in working-class Manchester, Marr says, being political was instinctive. \u201cIt was just part of your mindset, because you felt you were up against it, and the right wing was the minority but controlling everything. Somebody gave me <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/the-canon-arguments-for-socialism-by-tony-benn/414356.article\">Arguments For Socialism</a> by Tony Benn, and I discovered that what I just thought was decency was a political position. You look after people who are less fortunate, and anyone who does otherwise is just fucking ghastly. By definition, being an alternative musician back then, you were political.\u201d</p> <p>Did he and Morrissey have similar politics? \u201cYeah, we did back then.\u201d And now? \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect so. Probably not.\u201d In recent years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/sep/03/morrissey-china-subspecies-racism\">Morrissey has made headlines</a> for suggesting that immigration is compromising British identity; he sued the NME (successfully) for defamation, releasing a statement that \u201cracism has no place in our society\u201d. In a 2010 interview with this magazine, he described the Chinese as a \u201csubspecies\u201d when it came to their treatment of animals. Marr prefers to talk about the days when Morrissey <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsq3H_6XuFA\">reserved his bile for Margaret Thatcher</a>.</p> <p>Success soon began to take its toll on the Smiths. Rourke had a heroin habit; Marr survived on a diet of cocaine and booze. His weight dropped to seven stone, but he didn\u2019t worry because all his heroes had been slight. \u201cGeorge Best was small, Marc Bolan was small, Bruce Lee was small. And they were cocky and hyper, so I related to that, and played up to it. When it got really unhealthy it was just part and parcel of being in the Smiths in 1986. I wasn\u2019t thinking, \u2018This is great.\u2019 I just never ate.\u201d</p> <p>Today, Marr looks fantastically healthy \u2013 slim but not skeletal. He is vegan, teetotal and has been drug-free for many years. Now he gets his high from long-distance running. We meet at lunch, and he\u2019s already been out for eight miles. The only thing that gives away his age is the mandatory jet-black rock star dyed hair. His eternal boyishness is reflected not only in the book\u2019s title, but also in his passion (for new guitars, new bands, new experiences), his nomadic sense of adventure (he recently spent five years living in Portland with Angie, while playing with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/modestmouse\">Modest Mouse</a>), his curiosity (about everything).</p> <p>That optimism did briefly desert Marr when the Smiths split in 1987. In Set The Boy Free, he writes that the official version of him walking out on the band isn\u2019t quite right. Morrissey\u2019s behaviour was becoming more and more unreliable. Things came to a head, he says, when Morrissey refused to show up for the video shoot of the single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJRN76hxFz0\">Shoplifters Of The World Unite</a>, and ordered him to sack their latest manager, Ken Friedman (who had been introduced to the band by the singer and who Marr considered to be doing a good job). Marr says Morrissey assumed the guitarist would take on the role of unofficial manager, as he had for most of the band\u2019s existence. Even when the Smiths became successful, Marr acted as manager, booking vans and sorting all the finer detail. At the same time, he was being dictated to in the studio. Drummer Mike Joyce, who appeared to have taken on the role of spokesman for the other three, told Marr their next single would be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETJ-kOJrRow\">a cover</a> of Cilla Black\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJQWxFv_8_g\">Work Is A Four-Letter Word</a>. Marr wasn\u2019t pleased \u2013 but still, he insists, he didn\u2019t walk out. He stayed at home, making instrumental tracks in his recording studio.</p> <p>In July 1987 a story appeared in the press that Marr had left, accompanied by a new photo of the band taken by their press officer in which Marr was scowling while the other three Smiths smiled away. At that point, he felt he had no option but to walk.</p> <p>It sounds horribly stressful, I say. Yes, he says \u2013 not least the presumption that he would be the one to step in and manage the Smiths. \u201cIt\u2019s what split the band up. To this day I haven\u2019t met anyone who thinks a major rock group should be managed by the 23-year-old guitar player.\u201d So why did he agree to manage them in the first place? \u201cWell, because we were deemed unmanageable. When we fired managers, I always had to deal with it. When we got to the end of the band\u2019s life, it was put to me by my partner that he wouldn\u2019t work with the current manager and we had to go back to how it was. I wasn\u2019t prepared to do it, and so it became untenable. There was no way forward.\u201d For a moment, those tensions sound as raw as they did three decades ago. \u201cI was waiting for someone to fix it, and make it so it didn\u2019t have to happen.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"100ac098727a6e8d9b171871dfb8210c5cd3ef91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/100ac098727a6e8d9b171871dfb8210c5cd3ef91/0_9_845_1114/759.jpg\" alt=\"Johnny Marr with Angie, his wife, soon after they met in the late 70s\" width=\"759\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marr with his wife Angie in the late 70s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Johnny Marr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Why were they so resistant to having a manager? \u201cA lot of it was to do with control.\u201d Does he feel he was\u2026? Marr finishes the sentence for me. \u201cForced out? Yes, that was the tangible public manifestation of all that.\u201d He stops, embarrassed by his words. \u201cWow! Check me out! It was the feeling of being tested, and my role in the band being untenable.\u201d He stops again. \u201cJust like any break-up, bad shit goes on.\u201d</p> <p>The day that he confirmed he was leaving, the other band members issued a statement wishing him luck and saying: \u201cOther guitarists are being considered to replace him.\u201d How did that make him feel? \u201cI literally thought it was a joke. It was the final nail in the coffin and it took me a long time to forgive them. It was pretty callous. But I don\u2019t hold it against anybody now. I absolutely don\u2019t.\u201d Within a week, the Smiths were in the studio with a new guitarist. They never completed any new material, though: by the time their final album, Strangeways Here We Come, was released in September 1987, they had announced their split.</p> <p>Angie was the constant throughout this time. They started going out at the age of 15, and <a href=\"http://www.johnnymarrplaysguitar.com/a-long-list-2/angie-marr/\">are still together</a>, with two grownup children. Did she ever fear she would lose him to Morrissey? \u201cNo, it was me and Angie first. We all had these very unusual, intense relationships that worked and brought great things.\u201d I say that Angie seems to be the glue in his story. \u201cWell, she\u2019s the person who\u2019s enabled me to be who I am and vice versa. She\u2019s completed me, and I\u2019ve completed her.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>What struck Marr most when writing his book is how young he was when the Smiths split. He wasn\u2019t yet 24, and his career with one of Britain\u2019s biggest bands was over. Looking back now, he says, there was an inevitability about it all. Even without the tensions, and even though he didn\u2019t want to leave, he was never going to be a lifer in a single band. For a while he became the most illustrious hired hand in the business, playing with Paul McCartney, the Pretenders and U2. He went on to have long-term relationships with a number of bands, including Matt Johnson\u2019s eternally innovative <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-the-mn0000566918\">The The</a> (the critically acclaimed album Dusk reached number two in the UK charts), alternative dance band <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_(band)\">Electronic</a> with Bernard Sumner (a handful of hit singles, including Getting Away With It and Get The Message), American rockers Modest Mouse (whose album We Were Dead Before The Ship Even Sank went into the US charts at number one), and English indie punks <a href=\"https://www.thecribs.com/\">the Cribs</a>. Marr says these collaborations all led to great friendships.</p> <p>Which band did he enjoy playing with most? \u201cModest Mouse,\u201d he says without a beat. More than the Smiths? \u201cYeah. People don\u2019t believe it when I say that. I love Modest Mouse so much because the chemistry of those guys was a real brotherhood. They were a great American band, and I really wanted to be in a great American band.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t see the rest of the Smiths for years after the split. In March 1989, Joyce and Rourke started legal proceedings against Marr and Morrissey, arguing they were equal partners in the band and each entitled to 25% of recording and performance royalties rather than the 10% they were getting (Marr and Morrissey each took 40%). Rourke settled out of court, but Joyce continued and in 1996 his case was heard. Joyce\u2019s barrister argued that Marr and Morrissey treated the drummer and bassist as \u201cmere session musicians, as readily replaceable as the parts in a lawnmower\u201d. After a bruising seven days in court, Judge Weeks found in Joyce\u2019s favour, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/devious-truculent-and-unreliable-1314122.html\">describing Morrissey as \u201cdevious, truculent and unreliable\u201d</a> and Marr as \u201cwilling to embroider his evidence to a point where he became less credible\u201d. He also described Marr as \u201cprobably the more intelligent of the four\u201d, while Rourke and Joyce were \u201cunintellectual\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If the Smiths wanted to re-form it would make a hell of a lot of people very happy. We might even be better than before</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Was Joyce justified in bringing the court case? \u201cMike had a right to do it. I don\u2019t think he should have done because we had an agreement. Looking back, I would have done things differently. I\u2019d make sure you don\u2019t move a muscle without a contract \u2013 for everybody\u2019s benefit. Young people aren\u2019t good at doing that kind of thing, and we had to pay the price for it.\u201d Would he still regard the 10% Joyce and Rourke were paid as a fair deal? \u201cI would be more generous,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t a band of equals. Thirty-odd years later I think anyone can see that.\u201d What would be a fair percentage? He laughs. \u201cYou know what? I\u2019d wind up in court if I answered that.\u201d The question he most dislikes being asked is whether the Smiths will re-form. But it emerges that he and Morrissey were asking themselves the same question decades after the split, and that it almost did come to pass. In 2008, they met for the first time since the court case in a pub in south Manchester. \u201cThe conversation about re-forming came out of the blue. I didn\u2019t go there with that in mind. But there had been quite a few rumours about it, so naturally we discussed it. \u2018It could happen\u2026\u2019 \u2018How d\u2019you feel about it?\u2019 \u2018What if?\u2019 And off we went.\u201d Who was more keen? \u201cI think we were both as keen as each other.\u201d</p> <p>Had Morrissey changed \u2013 lost it, as people have suggested? Marr bursts out laughing. \u201cHahaha! Well, he hadn\u2019t <em>changed</em>. Joke! I felt I\u2019d changed when we met. I was teetotal, vegan and I\u2019d just run 10 miles \u2013 that\u2019s quite different from the person I was when I was last in the Smiths.\u201d Did Morrissey see a difference? \u201cI would think so, because I was in the pub not drinking. And he was knocking back the pints. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any secret that he likes a drink; he\u2019s very pro-drinking. But I\u2019d changed quite a lot. I\u2019ve got about nine tattooos for a start.\u201d</p> <p>He shows me his favourite \u2013 a tattoo that says 45rpm. Why 45rpm rather than 33rpm? \u201cFaster, mate. Faster, shorter, better energy. I had my T-shirt on, so I think Morrissey noticed them, and he likes tattoos. So I was different, and I was fitter.\u201d</p> <p>Was Morrissey different? \u201cHe was more outgoing, more sure of himself. I\u2019m pleased for him. It was great \u2013 a really nice meeting.\u201d</p> <p>They left the pub, contemplating a Smiths reunion, spoke a few more times, then Marr went on tour with the Cribs, and didn\u2019t hear from Morrissey again.</p> <p>Does he thinks their friendship could be rekindled? \u201cI don\u2019t. I think it\u2019s run its course. I don\u2019t feel unfriendly in any way towards Morrissey \u2013 there\u2019s just no need for it. One of the things we had in common was that we lived for work, and we\u2019re too busy doing what we\u2019re doing now.\u201d</p> <p>So many people publish memoirs when they are on their uppers or want to settle scores, Marr says. But he has never been more content. He has made two solo albums in the past three years, and is enjoying learning the skills of being a frontman. His son Nile, 24, is a singer-songwriter who has performed with him; his 22-year-old daughter Sonny, who works in publishing, has sung backing vocals with him. Hearing them sing, he says, is the only thing that makes him \u201cblub like an idiot\u201d.</p> <p>He hopes the book will be cathartic, but he\u2019s not sure how exactly. Just talking to him, though, he already seems liberated. He recently remastered the Smiths back catalogue \u2013 the first time he\u2019d listened to it as a body of work. (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tk0BOK0EDFE\">Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me</a> is his favourite song.) He had always known it was good, but now he became fully aware of what they had achieved. Alongside his new solo work, he has started performing old Smiths songs for the first time since the band split up \u2013 occasionally joined on stage by bassist Rourke. He had always resisted the idea that he did his best work so young, but now accepts the Smiths will be his legacy.</p> <p>And it is a legacy he has become increasingly determined to defend. In 2010, then prime minister David Cameron chose <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRP3LRcUFg\">This Charming Man</a> on Desert Island Discs, proclaiming himself a fan of the Smiths. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnny_marr/status/10237162679177216?lang=en-gb\">Marr responded on Twitter</a>: \u201cStop saying that you like the Smiths. No you don\u2019t. I forbid you to like it.\u201d Was he genuinely offended? \u201cYeah, I was pissed off by it, by the gall of thinking that me and my band were up for grabs. So I responded on behalf of all of us.\u201d Were the others offended as well? \u201cI think they just probably looked at it and went, \u2018Johnny\u2019s taken care of that.\u2019\u201d He pauses and grins. \u201cSo nothing changes very much.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"881fada264dda953bf9aec248d7315ef44e231be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/881fada264dda953bf9aec248d7315ef44e231be/78_55_2811_2239/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johnny Marr and Morrissey of the Smiths in a bathroom before going onstage in Belgium in 1984\" width=\"1000\" height=\"797\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marr and Morrissey about to go onstage in Belgium in 1984.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Johnny Marr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2> \u2018For four days re-forming the Smiths was a very real prospect\u2019: <br></h2> <h2>an exclusive extract from Johnny Marr\u2019s new memoir</h2> <p>Unfortunately for the Smiths, I wasn\u2019t consulted when our catalogue was remastered for CDs in the 1990s. The albums sounded wrong, and I was determined to put things right. After a lot of struggle, I reached an agreement with Morrissey and Warners. I would master all the records again with a top engineer so our catalogue would be as it should be, once and for all. <br>When I analysed the records, I was struck by how good the band were, and how young. I recalled the exact intention and emotion that went into every note and word, and I texted Morrissey and Andy Rourke and said, \u201cYou can really hear the love in it.\u201d I got a nice reply from both of them.</p> <p>The negotiations with Warners meant that Morrissey and I were in a rare period of communication. One day in September 2008 we were only a couple of miles apart in south Manchester and arranged to meet up in a pub nearby. I was happy to see him \u2013 it was 10 years or more since we\u2019d last met. We caught up with personal news and family and reminisced a bit.</p> <p>Then our conversation turned to deeper things. Morrissey started to talk about how our relationship had become owned by the outside world, usually in a negative way. We had been defined by each other in most areas of our professional life. I appreciated him mentioning it, because it was true. <br></p> <p>The drinks kept coming and we sat talking for hours. We chatted, as we always did, about the records we loved, and eventually we moved on to \u201cthat subject\u201d. There had been rumours for years that the Smiths were about to re-form, and they were always untrue. I had never pursued any offer. <br></p> <p>Suddenly we were talking about the possibility of the band re-forming, and in that moment it seemed that with the right intention it could actually be done and might even be great. I would still work with the Cribs on our album, and Morrissey also had an album due out. We hung out for a while longer, and after even more orange juice (for me) and even more beer (for him) we hugged and said our goodbyes.</p> <p>I was genuinely pleased to be back in touch with Morrissey, and the Cribs and I talked about the possibility of me playing some shows with the Smiths. For four days it was a very real prospect. We would have to get someone new on drums, but if the Smiths wanted to re-form it would make a hell of a lot of people very happy, and with all our experience we might even be better than before. <br></p> <p>Morrissey and I continued our dialogue and planned to meet up again. I went to Mexico with the Cribs, and then suddenly there was radio silence. Our communication ended, and things went back to how they were and how I expect they always will be.</p> <p>I started working in the studio at unusual hours, around five or six in the morning. One day in 2010, on the way back from driving my daughter Sonny to school, I was thinking about how David Cameron had been saying that he was a fan of the Smiths. Anyone who was a fan would know we were against everything he and the Conservative party stood for. But if he wanted to say that he liked the Smiths, what could I do about it?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"376fb2384d553d23e698643a5ae38c76917d2892\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/376fb2384d553d23e698643a5ae38c76917d2892/68_0_1266_2000/633.jpg\" alt=\"A student in a Smiths T-shirt, protesting against tuition fee rises, in Parliament Square, London, in 2010\" width=\"633\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A student protester in a Smiths T-shirt in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Without thinking too much about it, I picked up my phone and tweeted, \u201cDavid Cameron, stop saying that you like the Smiths. No you don\u2019t. I forbid you to like it.\u201d Satisfied that I\u2019d made my protest, I went to take a nap.</p> <p>A couple of hours later, I was woken up by a call from Joe, my manager. \u201cThe Cameron thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Twitter business. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d While I\u2019d been asleep my tweet had been retweeted by thousands of people and picked up by the press all over the world. Cameron himself was called on to comment during prime minister\u2019s questions. With the government planning to increase university tuition fees, Labour MP Kerry McCarthy <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/news/the-smiths-appear-at-prime-ministers-questions\">stood up and said</a>: \u201cThe Smiths are, of course, the archetypal student band. If he wins tomorrow night\u2019s vote, what songs does he think the students will be listening to? Miserable Lie, I Don\u2019t Owe You Anything or Heaven Knows I\u2019m Miserable Now?\u201d</p> <p>Cameron took the opportunity to show his true indie cred: \u201cI expect that if I turned up, I probably wouldn\u2019t get This Charming Man.\u201d</p> <p>Good one. It was all very jolly and totally bizarre.</p> <p>When 50,000 demonstrators marched through London, I was proud to see the students call the politicians to account for their broken promises. Things came to a head in Parliament Square on the day the new laws were passed. The next day I was sent a photograph of a protester called Ellen Wood who was confronting the police in a Smiths T-shirt (pictured page 23). I stared at the photograph, her stance, the Houses of Parliament. The significance of her wearing the Smiths shirt made quite an impact on me. It occurred to me that, aside from the music we made, that picture could be the most powerful testament to the Smiths\u2019 legacy. <br></p> <p>The only other person I knew who might comprehend it the same way was Morrissey, and so I emailed him the picture. There\u2019d been no contact between us for a long time, but I got a reply within minutes. He hadn\u2019t seen the picture, and he was equally surprised and impressed. Our communication continued for a day or so, but although I felt I\u2019d created a moment of friendship, an air of disaffection and distrust remained between us.

Global damage to cities from flooding could amount to<a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/08/19/coastal-cities-at-highest-risk-floods\" rel=\"nofollow\"> $1tn a year by 2050</a> if no action is taken, according to a World Bank report.</p> <p>Floating architecture is nothing new. Traditional floating villages are common in deltas and along the Mekong river in south-east Asia. But integrating age-old designs into a modern city is a different matter entirely.<br></p> <p>Some cities are further ahead than others. <a href=\"http://www.iamsterdam.com/en/local/about-amsterdam/neighbourhoods/ijburg\" rel=\"nofollow\">IJBurg</a> is a collection of floating houses built on six artificial islands on IJ Lake in Amsterdam, designed by <a href=\"http://www.rohmer.nl/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marlies Rohmer</a>. It was conceived to deal with the city\u2019s critical housing shortage problem as well as its vulnerability to flooding \u2013 more than half of the Netherlands is at or below sea level.<br></p> <p>The housing is a mix of expensive waterside condos and social housing, with about 30% of the community\u2019s 18,000 houses allocated to low-income residents. When complete, the development will provide homes for 45,000 residents on 10 islands.</p> <p>In Copenhagen, architecture firm Urban Rigger has unveiled floating student housing made from end of life shipping containers. Each Urban Rigger has 12 studio apartments which share a courtyard complete with a BBQ area, bike racks and a kayak landing, and is powered in part by solar energy. <br></p> <p>Tethered to docks in the city, the first students are due to move at the end of the year and will pay around \u00a3500-\u00a3600 a month. Over the next decade, the company plans to build 1,000-1,500 containers in \u201charbour, canal and river intensive cities\u201d across Europe, says founder Kim Loudrup. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d4fd0d0aba0af285f1c24a52670299a934bd625d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4fd0d0aba0af285f1c24a52670299a934bd625d/0_0_2048_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Urban Rigger floating housing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Urban Rigger floating housing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Urban Rigger</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s about \u201cusing infrastructure that\u2019s not being used for anything apart from looking nice\u201d, says Loudrop, who admits floating housing is \u201conly part of the puzzle\u201d when it comes to solving city housing crises. The beauty is, he says, that this kind of housing \u201ccan be initialised and utilised immediately; it comes in, stays for a period of time and then can move away again.\u201d</p> <p>Building on water isn\u2019t straightforward, however. The recent collapse of the Makoko Floating School in Lagos, one of the most famous examples of floating architecture, shows some of the complexities.</p> <p>The award-winning lagoon structure designed by Nigerian architect Kunl\u00e9 Adeyemi of Dutch studio <a href=\"http://www.nleworks.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NL\u00c9 Works</a> was built to provide a school and community centre to a floating slum in the city but collapsed in June after heavy rainfall. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41a25ab5d913a8410b5835d47e295c0d753b5756\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41a25ab5d913a8410b5835d47e295c0d753b5756/0_0_2592_1555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Local residents work to dismantle the Makoko floating school after it collapsed\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Local residents work to dismantle the Makoko Floating School after it collapsed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Adeyemi says that the building had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jun/10/makoko-floating-school-collapse-lagos-nigeria-slum-water\">decommissioned for months</a> and was only intended as a prototype. But it led to a row as a local headmaster, Noah Shemede, raised concerns about the viability of the structure. </p> <p>There are also environmental concerns. The need for foundations of many floating buildings to go deep into the river bed, for example, will have an impact on the environment, says Phillip Mills, director of the <a href=\"http://www.policyconsulting.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Policy Consulting Network</a>, and a specialist in water construction.<br></p> <p>\u201cFoundations or structures within the river could also alter the river bed with silt erosion and deposition elsewhere in the river. The same thing already happens around bridge piers,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Building floating structures can also severely alter the flow of a river such as the Thames and disrupt transport, a spokesperson from the Port of London Authority explains. \u201cWhat might suit property owners or private developers best is not always best for the city. Londoners have said they want to see the Thames used predominantly for transport or leisure. Any structures in the Thames could impact the flow of the river and create obstacles for watercraft.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/04/do-cows-get-seasick-rotterdam-floating-dairy-farm-netherlands\">Do cows get seasick?

He says floating structures such as those at Noorderhaven in the Netherlands have recently been subject to <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280572471_MONITORING_THE_IMPACTS_OF_FLOATING_STRUCTURES_ON_THE_WATER_QUALITY_AND_ECOLOGY_USING_AN_UNDERWATER_DRONE\" rel=\"nofollow\">underwater drone surveys</a> to observe whether their construction has negatively affected the ecosystem.</p> <p>According to the research project, the underwater footage \u201crevealed the existence of a dynamic and diverse aquatic habitat in the vicinity of these structures, showing that floating structures can have a positive effect on the aquatic environment\u201d.</p> <p> For London architect Carl Turner, who has designed a pre-fabricated, open-source amphibious house specifically designed to float on floodwater, called the Floating House, climate change means needing to work with water.</p> <p>\u201cYou either protect the house or protect the land,\u201d he says. \u201cCreating large-scale flood protection zones is expensive and in itself potentially harmful to the environment. Once breached, homes are left defenceless, as opposed to floating homes that can simply rise with flood waters.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In 19 years, Ramu Gaviti\u2019s six acres of land have gone from barren, dry and sparsely vegetated to fertile, moist and thick with biomass. Peacocks, wild pigs and rabbits have reappeared and in rejuvenated rivers, boys trap fish in baskets. </p> <p>Gaviti once scratched $29 (\u00a323) worth of millet and grass per acre per year. In bad years he left his smallholding in Jawhar, in the hills to the north-east of Mumbai, and went to mine sand at the coast for construction. \u201cSometimes you feel as if you can go in the river and drown,\u201d said the farmer, who has heard of 50 men who never returned. Now he has more than 1,000 fruit, nut and forest trees, paddy rice, a tractor, a brick house, and an income the equivalent of $1,200 (\u00a3975) a year. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04746000d4b343d17cf1c2d9f1d5c711ba413a21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04746000d4b343d17cf1c2d9f1d5c711ba413a21/0_67_1921_1153/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Farmer Ramu Gaviti.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farmer Ramu Gaviti.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: World Agroforestry Centre</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gaviti\u2019s life has been transformed by a model of agroforestry pioneered by an Indian NGO. \u201cIf the organisation had not come, we would have had no guiding person,\u201d he says. The NGO <a href=\"http://www.baif.org.in/\">BAIF</a>, who specialise in supporting climate-resilient agriculture, arrived in 1997 and worked closely with local people until 2004. \u201cIt was a wasteland virtually,\u201d says agriculturalist Sudhir Wagle, who led the effort. \u201cWe began by suggesting 40-60 mango and cashew trees per acre and a boundary of indigenous trees. Including costs such as development of common water sources, we calculate that each acre cost us $130 [\u00a3105] a year to improve and that it took us and the farmers five years. But we saw families getting $225 [\u00a3180] per acre a year after five years and $670 [\u00a3545] per acre a year after ten.\u201d</p> <p> Gaviti and his fellow farmers are more than an economic success, however. They are a climate success too. Agriculture is the world\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.wri.org/blog/2014/05/everything-you-need-know-about-agricultural-emissions\">second largest emitter</a> of gases such as CO2 that cause climate change. But the villagers\u2019 trees have been drawing carbon from the atmosphere for years. This represents one of the greatest hopes for India, which has committed to capture 2.5 to 3bn tonnes of carbon through new tree and forest cover by 2030, to deliver on the Paris accord.</p> <p>\u201cThe vast majority of India is agricultural land,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.worldagroforestry.org/\">World Agroforestry Centre</a>\u2019s Dr Ravi Prabhu. \u201cWe can deliver from this landscape and help people at the same time. Agriculture finds no mention in the accord. The focus is forests. But agriculture accounts for 10-12% of <a href=\"http://www.wri.org/blog/2014/05/everything-you-need-know-about-agricultural-emissions\">emissions</a> and 70% of <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/gbo/gbo4/publication/gbo4-en.pdf\">biodiversity loss</a> and <a href=\"http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/54/10/909.full\">fresh water use</a>. We cannot afford to segregate or we will be left with islands of biodiversity surrounded by deserts.\u201d <br></p> <p>Turning agriculture into a carbon sink is not a dream. <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/articles/srep29987\">Scientists</a> from the World Agroforestry Centre, Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, and elsewhere found that agricultural land can hold four times as much carbon as previously estimated by the <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>. The US Environmental Protection Agency states that, while fossil fuel use is the primary source of CO2: \u201cThe way in which people use land is also an important source, especially when it involves deforestation.\u201d Likewise, land can remove CO2 from the atmosphere through reforestation and improvement of soils. <br></p> <p>Scaling up what Gaviti and the other villagers are doing could be one of India\u2019s greatest hopes for delivering on its commitments to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/05/obama-paris-climate-deal-ratification\">the Paris agreement on climate change</a>. </p> <p>India\u2019s government recognised the value of trees on farms in 2014 with the world\u2019s first <a href=\"http://www.nrcaf.res.in/NAF_Policy.pdf\">national agroforestry policy</a> (pdf), which aims to help increase forest or tree cover to 33% from the present <a href=\"http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/forest-report/1/540270.html\">21%</a>. A key impetus was timber; farm trees meet 65% of India\u2019s demand. The policy could put India leagues ahead on climate change and save land from ruination: 50% of India\u2019s land is degraded and 86% of the degraded land is agricultural, says World Resources Institute\u2019s Dr Nitin Pandit. </p> <p>Rakesh Sinha, joint secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture, is in charge of rolling out the plan. \u201cTrees have always been part and parcel of Indian agriculture but now we are considering paying farmers for ecological services from agroforestry.\u201d</p> <p>Back in Jawhar, Gaviti tends his trees, among the many fruits of which have also been a change in social status. \u201cWhen I go to town, they don\u2019t disrespect me for being a labourer\u201c.

  "<p>At school I joined in with as many sports as possible \u2013 netball, athletics, whatever was on. Just after my GCSEs, some people from a talent identification initiative came and tested the sporty people in my year. I got a letter saying I\u2019d been selected for flat-water kayaking. I\u2019d done a bit of kayaking on holiday, but I\u2019d never heard of it as a competitive sport. I went along, picked it up fairly quickly and was soon entering races. It was really exciting.</p> <p>There are quite a few strands to kayaking. From leisure paddling, where people go out on a plastic kayak for a picnic, to slalom, white-water racing and canoe polo. Flat-water kayaking, in which I compete at national level, takes place anywhere with a long stretch of water, much like the Olympic rowing events. In a sprint, you line up in one of nine lanes, then go as fast as you can in a straight line for either 200, 500 or 1,000 metres.</p> <p>I race with the Burton Phoenix canoe club. The racing kayaks are long, sleek and about the width of your hips. They\u2019re also unstable \u2013 it takes good core strength to stop them capsizing. Paddling is demanding on the whole body, not only your arms and shoulders. Most of the power is actually generated through your legs, by pushing against a footrest on the inside of the boat and twisting your hips. Your arms are just a lever for the paddles.</p> <p>Apart from wanting to win, the main draw is the social side. You see the same faces at regattas, and I\u2019ve made friends with people from all over the country. Being on the water allows you to see a different side of a place. When you\u2019re walking around a city, everything feels so cramped. But as soon as you get on the water, you\u2019re surrounded by greenery, the banks of the river disappear into the distance and suddenly the place feels more natural, fresher. Training early on a winter\u2019s morning with the fog rising off the water is a very special place to be.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/15/my-workout-crossfit-is-addictive-ameet-palahe\">My workout: Ameet Palahe, 28, CrossFit devotee \u2013 \u2018It\u2019s addictive\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>My weekend workout</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>Years kayaking?</strong> Seven.<br></p> <p><strong>How often do you train?</strong> Once or even twice a day, for 60-90 minutes.</p> <p><strong>Favourite place to kayak?</strong> Loch Awe in Scotland.</p> <h2><strong>Five ways to get started</strong></h2> <p>1 The first thing to master is getting in and out.

  "<p>Are you happy with 5% of every penny you save going into selling cigarettes? New research reveals how small investors in Britain are pouring their money into tobacco companies and giant oil and coal companies that are wrecking the environment without realising.</p> <p>The report, released ahead of Good Money Week by ethical investment group Castlefield Advisory Partners, highlights how UK tracker funds are massively invested in tobacco and fossil fuel companies. Tracker funds have become hugely popular in recent years because they are very cheap, often charging less than 0.5% a year compared to \u201cactively managed\u201d funds charging double or triple that.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s biggest tracker fund, the \u00a35bn Vanguard FTSE UK All Share, has more than \u00a3200m worth of shares in British American Tobacco. Last year BAT sold 663bn cigarettes in more than 200 markets around the world, under brands such as Dunhill, Kent, Lucky Strike, Pall Mall and Rothmans.</p> <p>According to Castlefield, the six biggest tracker funds aimed at small investors have a combined \u00a3504m invested in BAT. Such is its size \u2013 it is now Britain\u2019s fourth biggest company (and larger than BT, Vodafone and Lloyds). That means anyone investing in a FTSE All Share tracker will have 4% of their money in BAT, or 5% via a FTSE 100 index tracker.</p> <p>Campaigners argue that with few restrictions on how companies advertise in places like Indonesia, cigarette manufacturers are making huge profits from damaging the health of young people in the developing world. Tobacco kills six million people every year and nearly 80% of the world\u2019s billion smokers live in low- and middle-income countries, according to the World Health Organisation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trackers might appear a cheap investment solution, but people may not be aware they are financing damaging activities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some savers in cheap tracker or \u201cpassive\u201d funds \u2013 British investors have ploughed nearly \u00a317bn into them in recent years \u2013 may also be unaware just how much of their cash goes to support fossil fuel extraction. The Vanguard fund has 11% of its \u00a35bn of investments in oil and gas companies, largely through holdings in Shell and BP.</p> <p>John Ditchfield, partner at Castlefield, said: \u201cTrackers might appear to be a cheap investment solution, but we are concerned that people may not be fully aware that they are financing damaging social and environmental activities and putting investors\u2019 money at risk.</p> <p>\u201cAutomated \u2018robo-investors\u2019 are pumping hundreds of millions in pension savings and other investments into businesses which individuals would not choose to support, and may actively want to avoid, for example tobacco and heavily polluting fossil fuel companies.</p> <p>\u201cMore than 70 countries have ratified the Paris Climate Agreement and it is about to come into force, but a large chunk of tracker capital is invested in coal, oil and gas, exposing investors to serious risk.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike actively managed funds, where investment managers can use their power to implement change, tracker funds do not hold companies accountable for their business strategy or social and environmental performance. But it\u2019s not just ethically minded investors who are concerned about the huge investments in fossil fuels. Even the least environmentally conscious are concerned that the assets of oil and gas companies will be \u201cstranded\u201d underground, forbidden from being removed as climate change worsens. That would render these investments worthless.</p> <p>Ditchfield warns that while undeniably cheap, tracker funds also come with other problems. Investors were left with large losses during the \u201cdot.com boom\u201d of 1999/2000, as tracker funds automatically bought company shares at the point where they entered the index, irrespective of the company\u2019s underlying business model or level of profitability.</p> <p>He argues that returns on actively managed socially responsible investment funds have outperformed most UK tracker funds over the last five years. For example, the WHEB Sustainability fund is up 31% over the past year, compared to the 16.7% gain in the Vanguard FTSE All Share tracker. Ditchfield also likes the Alliance Trust Sustainable Future fund, which, although only up 13% this year, has given investors a return of 30% over three years compared to 20% from the major index funds.</p> <p>For every \u00a310,000 invested with Vanguard, \u00a31,440 would be in Shell, BP and BAT, \u201cfinancing a range of damaging social and environmental activities,\u201d says Ditchfield. \u201c\u00a310,000 in WHEB would be managed by a team of experts who publish detailed information of the case for making investments and track the social and environmental impact.\u201d</p> <p>Many pension schemes use trackers as their default investment, although some allow employees to choose an actively managed ethical fund\u2019 instead.

The problem is that my teaching style is quite dramatic and, well, flouncy at times, unlike that of most maths teachers.<br></p> <p>I told my new head of department that I was thinking about revealing my sexuality at school.

I waited for the booing or the pretending-to-be-sick noises, but none came. A group of girls wanted to know if I was single (I\u2019d recently broken up with someone) and whether I\u2019d have a civil ceremony (yes, if I met the right guy) but otherwise it was a non-event. I do think my honesty served to make them trust me quickly \u2013 vital in a pastoral role \u2013 but my sexuality was ultimately quite boring.<br></p> <p>My transparency has become an advantage.

  "<p>A few years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/mar/31/mothers-stop-moaning-about-motherhood\" title=\"\">I wrote a piece about not being a mum</a>. About the pain of not being a mum. At the time I was stunned by the reaction to it. Some saw it as an attack on mothers, whereas I saw it as a raw, bruised plea to appreciate what you\u2019ve got. I\u2019ve been surprised since, too. Not at any still-angry comments or my continued grief (I\u2019ve always known time has been mis-sold on the healing front) but that my no-baby agony could almost be equalled. But it has been \u2013 by the realisation of what not having children really means. Not having kids means I mean nothing in our society. And I really never saw that devastating PS coming.</p> <p>This is what I and other unhappy non-parents (a clumsy word but I can\u2019t go with \u201cchildfree\u201d. The forced \u201cyay!\u201d there is kidding no one) deal with. Every. Single. Day. The dismissive, demeaning language and sentiments thrown at the childless are relentless.</p> <p>A conversation I had at a funeral recently:</p> <p>A woman I\u2019d apparently met years ago (breezily): \u201cDid you ever marry?\u201d</p> <p>Me: \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Her: \u201cDid you ever have kids?\u201d</p> <p>Me: \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Her (less breezy now): \u201cOh well. Well done anyway. It\u2019s not for everyone.\u201d</p> <p>A conversation I had with an Oxbridge-educated comedian who you\u2019d hope would have a broader take on life.</p> <p>Him: \u201cHow are you? It\u2019s been years. How have you been? You got kids?\u201d</p> <p>Me: \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Him (looking at the floor): \u201cOh.\u201d</p> <p>And then he left. Come back, funny guy. The insignificance ain\u2019t catching.</p> <p>A moment with an old friend, talking about his niece who had struggled to conceive.</p> <p>Him: \u201cOh, we thought she would never have a baby. Thought she\u2019d end up with nothing. She\u2019d already bought two cats.\u201d</p> <p>Another moment with another friend \u2013 about her midwife.</p> <p>Her: \u201cShe was OK. She\u2019s one of those women, though. A midwife who doesn\u2019t even have her own kids.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9743e23998b2e0475226fd0bee398072c0fb77cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9743e23998b2e0475226fd0bee398072c0fb77cb/0_136_2688_1613/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrea Leadsom, now environment secretary, said being a mother gave her more of a stake in the future.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrea Leadsom, now environment secretary, said being a mother gave her more of a stake in the future.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Gourley/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m sometimes shocked into silence but usually I come back with some prickly reply. And my response is inevitably met with the \u201cJesus, could you let this go?\u201d eye-roll.</p> <p>Well, no, I can\u2019t let this go. I feel rage about this. I hear this talk every day and it shouldn\u2019t go unchallenged. I don\u2019t want to be infuriated every day. I don\u2019t want to experience this feeling every day. I don\u2019t want to be reminded of my \u201csituation\u201d every day. But seeing as I am, every day, I\u2019m now going to say something. Every time. Isn\u2019t this bigotry? Why is it wholly accepted? Why isn\u2019t everyone furious about this?</p> <p>Let\u2019s talk about the \u201chardworking families\u201d rhetoric that excludes me and non-parents everywhere. Yes I work, yes I pay tax, yes I contribute to that big old child-benefit pot, no I don\u2019t benefit from family tax breaks. But your under-voting-age child is more important than me. And, of course, according to secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/10/andrea-leadsom-apologises-for-motherhood-remarks\" title=\"\"> Andrea Leadsom, no-forward-lineage me doesn\u2019t have a \u201ctangible stake\u201d in our country\u2019s future</a>. Should we all club together and buy me a gun now? Or just take the money from the maternity leave I never needed.</p> <p>I wonder if you can imagine what this feels like. To find the energy needed not only to soothe oneself and live with infinite grief but also to fight such extraordinary ignorance and cruelty. It\u2019s exhausting and crushing. I wrote a feature \u2013 years ago \u2013 about being scared I wouldn\u2019t have a baby (as a friend says, \u201cWell done on having a life so shit you made money out of it\u201d) and someone at the magazine added the words \u201cI feel like such a failure\u201d to my copy. I was livid. I hadn\u2019t written that; I didn\u2019t feel that. Except now, in my weakest moments, I do. But fuck that. You, copy-fiddler, wouldn\u2019t last a minute in my shoes. I\u2019m no failure. I\u2019m a fucking great survivor. All unhappily childless people are.</p> <p>But so many don\u2019t think that. So many like Leadsom don\u2019t think that. Yes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/11/conservative-leadership-andrea-leadsom-pulls-out-of-race\" title=\"\">she got hers</a> \u2013 good \u2013 but the world isn\u2019t (sometimes) clever Twitter and (some bits) clever media. We still live among people like the Daily Mail reader who commented, \u201cIf you haven\u2019t had a child, you can\u2019t put \u2018woman\u2019 on your passport.\u201d</p> <p>Even amazingly supportive people on Twitter didn\u2019t really understand how awful Leadsom\u2019s #asamother comments were. One lovely friend summed up Leadsom\u2019s words with \u201cinsult\u201d. No. An insult is telling someone their jeans look like they come from M&amp;S. This was \u201cI have to go to bed for two days\u201d distressing. It felt like a punch in the womb.</p> <p>But why would people with children get it? White me would never fully understand how racism feels. I can think it\u2019s disgusting but I won\u2019t feel it. So those with children can be angry on my behalf \u2013 but they won\u2019t be stopped short with surging, burning sadness and fury.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/mar/31/mothers-stop-moaning-about-motherhood\">Mothers, stop moaning!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maybe I can help here, though. Let me tell you about the woman who hysterically told me to give up my reserved seat on a train \u2013 four seats around a table \u2013 so she could sit there with her family. \u201cI have children!\u201d, she yelled. So loud, it was as if she was giving birth to them all over again. Well&#xa0;if you care about your family so much, love, why not reserve your own seats? I offered her the three empty spaces but that wasn\u2019t enough. (Did I give up my seat? No. But I did tweet Mumsnet to tell them one of their members needed a stick removing from her arse.)</p> <p>Oh, and I should also tell you about the mind-boggling introduction to an item on the Victoria Derbyshire show on BBC2. Introducing an interview with the aunt of Alan Kurdi, the Syrian toddler who drowned&#xa0;in the&#xa0;Mediterranean, Victoria Derbyshire&#xa0;said, \u201cIf you\u2019re a parent you might find this upsetting.\u201d Because, yes, as a non-parent that poor child\u2019s tragic death was the highlight of my week. Even toyed with bunting. You&#xa0;don\u2019t have kids so you don\u2019t care?&#xa0;Really?</p> <p>So why are the childless at best ignored and, at worst, maligned? Is it simply fear of the \u201cother\u201d? Do we, inadvertently, offer an alternative life that makes you question yours and your happiness within? I don\u2019t know. But I do know the mum PR machine is out of this world. This quote from Doctor Who:</p> <p>Some bloke: \u201cYou\u2019re a mother, aren\u2019t&#xa0;you?\u201d</p> <p>Amy: \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p> <p>Some bloke: \u201cThere\u2019s kindness in your eyes.\u201d</p> <p>Jesus Christ.</p> <p>Do I really have to prove my validity? Seriously? OK. I\u2019m kind, I\u2019m funny, I don\u2019t lie, I look after people, I\u2019m stupidly unselfish, I\u2019m generous, I\u2019m caring, I\u2019m a supportive sister, aunt and friend.</p> <p>I just didn\u2019t give birth.</p> <p>And those who did? That\u2019s all they did. They didn\u2019t have personality transplants. They didn\u2019t become deities. It\u2019s the same them but with a mini-them that they have to love and look after. Some do it beautifully and brilliantly, and some unhappily. (And some non-mothers \u2013 in fact, many non-mothers \u2013 mother others, too, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/sep/14/kim-cattrall-bbc-womans-hour-takeover-childless-motherhood\" title=\"\">Kim Cattrall.)</a></p> <p>Being a mum doesn\u2019t naturally mean anything. You\u2019re not suddenly this; you\u2019re not now that. Leadsom came across as dim, giddy and disingenuous (let\u2019s not touch on the CV&#xa0;or opportunism). Just because she has children, she\u2019s worth more than me? The Tory MP Nadine Dorries believes Leadsom and mothers are \u201cholistic\u201d. Rose West \u2026 Nyomi Fee \u2026 Do I have to finish this crass point? A man ejaculating in you does not make you&#xa0;kinder or wiser or more valid than&#xa0;me. It simply makes you the owner of no condoms.</p>",
  "<p>I was up at first light the other day, listening for the ritual morning call of birds flying low across the field from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Nairn\">river Nairn</a>.

The varying colours blend to create an image of golden plumage dramatically offset by the two copper-coloured sail feathers that extend vertically 5cm or more forward of the tail; over the years I have made a collection of them when they have moulted in the garden. </p> <p>Feeding was frantic, the mandarins jostling each other as they scooped up the grain, pausing only to dart over to the bird bath for a quick drink before running back into the melee.

After the Cubs dropped Game 1, there was a palpable sense of dread among fans that it just wouldn\u2019t be their year again (just like it hasn\u2019t been their year in over a century). After the hang wringing, the Cubs have done exactly what they were supposed to do: split the series on the road to come back home with a chance to finish the series at home.</p> <p>To do so, of course, they\u2019re going to have to start with winning Game 3. Cleveland are putting the surprisingly effective Josh Tomlin (13-9, 4.40) on the mound and their best relievers are rested after the day off and Wednesday\u2019s unwanted day off. Plus, the Cubs are going to be victimized by their own league\u2019s rules, not usually the case when the World Series moves to the National League, <a href=\"https://theringer.com/kyle-schwarber-chicago-cubs-2016-world-series-hype-c24882a2f19#.t25txixil\">as key hitter/feel good story</a> Kyle Schwarber is now limited to pinch-hitting duties. <br></p> <p>Here\u2019s the problem for Cleveland: The Indians are starting Kyle Hendricks (16-8, 2.13) who is just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/22/cubs-dodgers-nlcs-world-series-71-years\">coming off</a> maybe the best start of any pitcher in this postseason. The Indians saw how he froze the Dodgers\u2019 bats in the clinching game of the NLCS and know that if he\u2019s pitching on that level again there\u2019s not a lot you can do against him. And, with Aroldis Chapman in the bullpen and able to go multiple innings, it\u2019s a chance they might see very few hittable pitches tonight.</p> <p>So it could be a long night for the Indians, and not just because these postseason games have been growing into lengthy affairs.

Like [this] whole thing is fucking insane.\u201d</p> <p>Fortunately for Clinton, in July the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi\">FBI</a> eventually decided to let this potentially illegal evasion of security protocol pass with a sharp wrap on the knuckles.</p> <p>There was an audible intake of breath among campaign followers in the summer, when Comey criticised her for being \u201cextremely careless\u201d in her handling of classified information, but his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">decision not to recommend criminal charges</a>brought to an end the one threat deemed capable of preventing her from becoming president.</p> <p>That was, at least, until Comey dropped a fresh bombshell. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/juddzeez/status/792051041399439360\">three-paragraph letter</a> he released to Congress on Friday revealing the existence of potentially significant new evidence may or not have any legal bearing on whether charges are again possible. It certainly had a political impact.</p> <p>Clinton was in the air when the letter leaked. An onboard Wi-Fi outage meant she may not have discovered its existence at all until her plane landed in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, for a campaign stop just down the road from her very first event as a candidate on 14 April 2015.<br></p> <p>There was a long delay in her leaving the plane as aides urgently gathered onboard to discuss the issue. A planned photoshoot with Annie Leibowitz had to be cut short. Her opponent wasted no time pointing out that it is never a good look for a presidential candidate to be under criminal investigation by the FBI.</p> <p>\u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before,\u201d was Donald Trump\u2019s predictable hyperbole at a rally minutes later in New Hampshire. \u201cWe must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.\u201d</p> <p>Democrats rushed to downplay its significance on Friday, as campaign chairman John Podesta suggested Comey may have been \u201cbrowbeaten\u201d by aggressive Republicans into announcing a relatively minor wrinkle for the sake of transparency.</p> <p>The investigation had still not officially been closed, so it is also oversimplifying to say, as many initially did, that it has been \u201creopened\u201d. The fact that the evidence in question reportedly comes from separate investigation into a sex scandal engulfing Anthony Weiner, the estranged of husband of Huma Abedin, one of Clinton\u2019s key aides, should make it less relevant to her security case, not more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/hillary-clinton-emails-fbi-election-voters\">Hillary Clinton's email woes refuse to go away \u2013 what does this latest twist mean?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5813bd27e4b08d944ba4bbfc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-28T21:04:40.151Z\">10.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Speaking in Lisbon, Maine, nearly an hour after he was scheduled to appear - there was an issue with the stairs on his plane - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told a room full of supporters that Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of private email servers when she served as secretary of state is \u201cthe biggest political scandal since Watergate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe FBI, after discovering new emails, is reopening their investigation into Hillary Clinton,\u201d Trump said, inaccurately. \u201cI have great respect for the FBI for righting this wrong.

  "<p>A hotel that lays a claim to be England\u2019s oldest has been destroyed in a huge fire in Exeter, firefighters have said. More than 100 emergency workers battled unsuccessfully to save the timber-framed Royal Clarence after a blaze started in a nearby building.</p> <p>The flames also claimed other buildings in the centre of the city, despite firefighters working all day to contain them.</p> <p>\u201cCrews will be at the scene overnight and into tomorrow [Saturday] trying to stop the fire spreading to other historic buildings. The Clarence has been completely destroyed,\u201d a spokesman for Devon and Somerset fire service said late on Friday night.</p> <p>About 120 firefighters were called to the scene to try to stop the blaze, which started early on Friday morning. Reserve firefighters were among those mobilised to operate the 27 regular pumps and a high-volume pump, with four aerial ladder platforms also deployed.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/29/uks-oldest-hotel-in-flames-in-exeter-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59z92\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2852093\"            data-video-name=\"UK's oldest hotel in flames in Exeter \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Exeter City Council/ AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58146be4e4b08d944ba4be7a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/29/161029ExeterFire_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/29/161029ExeterFire.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/29/161029ExeterFire_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/29/uks-oldest-hotel-in-flames-in-exeter-video\">\u2018England\u2019s oldest hotel\u2019 in flames in Exeter</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Earlier on Friday a fire brigade spokesman said the fire had started in the art gallery Exeter Gallery, opposite the cathedral. \u201cThat has [also] been completely destroyed,\u201dhe said, adding that it spread to the Clarence from there.</p> <p>The local historian Dr Todd Gray said the hotel was \u201cin the heart of what was not just the medieval city, but within the precincts of Roman Exeter\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cFor 2,000 years this area has been the focus of the city\u2019s religious and commercial life.\u201d<br></p> <p>The ground and first floors of the hotel were medieval and the upper floors were added in the late 1700s when the building was renamed a hotel. Gray told the BBC that the Clarence was \u201cthe building where they first declared themselves as a hotel. Before that happened [in the 1770s] we had inns, but they took the new French word and applied it to their building \u2026 this was the place to stay\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cWhat is so particularly heartbreaking about this loss is that these buildings escaped the blitz of 1942 when so much of Exeter was destroyed.\u201d</p> <p>The hotel was built in 1769 as the Assembly Rooms and renamed the Royal Clarence in 1827 after a visit by Adelaide, Duchess of Clarence. The duchess was queen consort of King William IV \u2013 the monarch succeeded on the British throne by Queen Victoria in 1837.<br></p> <p>Earlier in the day firefighters said: \u201cBecause of the complex structure of the old buildings here we haven\u2019t been able to put firefighters on the inside, so we\u2019re fighting it from the outside.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got the aerial ladder platforms so we are pouring water on top of it. We are trying to contain it but there are signs now of damage to the bedroom floors of the hotel.\u201d</p> <p>Efforts to fight the fire were consuming much of Exeter\u2019s water supply. South West Water told customers in the city centre it had been forced to make alterations to its mains network to support the fire service.</p> <p>\u201cAs a result some customers in the city centre, and potentially in the Wonford area, may experience low pressure or discolouration of their water supply,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThe Royal Devon and Exeter and Nuffield hospitals will not be affected.\u201d</p> <p>The fire began just after 5am. By Friday afternoon large crowds had gathered at police cordons surrounding Cathedral Green, the fire service spokesman said. </p> <p>\u201cThere is a large amount of smoke coming off the building,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s right in the centre of Exeter so it\u2019s getting a lot of attention from people watching what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p> <p>Concealed voids and passageways within burning buildings, as well as their timber construction made the fire difficult to deal with, he said. </p> <p>There were thought to be no injuries and everyone believed to have been in the buildings had been accounted for, according to Devon and Cornwall police. </p> <p>The cause of the fire was not believed to be suspicious.</p>"
