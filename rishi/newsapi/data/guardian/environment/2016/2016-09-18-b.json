  "<p>If there was a high point in the reputation and significance of fact checkers, wonks and poll crunchers it came during the 2012 US presidential campaign. It was the election where former president Bill Clinton held court at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Miami for just under an hour. </p> <p>Such was the avalanche of statistics that night that fact check site Politifact called it \u201c<a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2012/09/our-clinton-nightmare/\">Our Clinton Nightmare</a>\u201d, bemoaning the \u201ceffort required to run down his many statistics and factual claims, producing little for us to write about\u201d.<br></p> <p>The numbers just rolled off Clinton\u2019s tongue \u2013 4.5 million private sector jobs, 500,000 manufacturing jobs, 250,000 more people working in the auto industry, 3 million young people between 19 and 25 insured for the first time, health care costs rising at under 4%. \u201cLook,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/us/politics/transcript-of-bill-clintons-speech-to-the-democratic-national-convention.html?_r=0\">he said to the faithful</a>, \u201chere\u2019s what really happened.

It was the election in which Barack Obama cited fact checkers in the <a href=\"http://debates.org/index.php?page=october-22-2012-the-third-obama-romney-presidential-debate\">third presidential debate</a> to counter Mitt Romney\u2019s assertion that Obama had gone on an \u201capology tour\u201d.</p> <p>It was also the election in which the poll aggregators such as Nate Silver had put down their glasses by the time of that third debate, and called the race for Obama. It was the election where insiders such as the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Peggy Noonan came to grief, believing their finger on the pulse was <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/peggynoonan/2012/11/05/monday-morning/\">more accurate than the polls</a>.</p> <p>It was a total victory for the wonks, the fact checkers, the poll crunchers.</p> <p>Four years later we have Donald Trump winning the Republican Party nomination with a record number of fact-checked lies, the British voting to leave the EU despite all advice to the contrary, the local ABC\u2019s own fact-checking unit being axed and Nate Silver\u2019s <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/hey-at-least-the-cavs-might-not-get-swept/\">538 statistical site</a> even getting the result of the NBA final series wrong.</p> <p>What the hell? With this seeming failure has come no small amount of glee from progressives. While poll analysts and fact checkers are not the same, they do work on the same side of the street, and are the cause of much angst among progressives, which would seem odd given progressives as a rule generally perform better on fact checks.</p> <p>After the recent Australian federal election, Fairfax\u2019s Matthew Knott reviewed the media\u2019s coverage, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016-opinion/election-2016-the-uncomfortable-truth-is-the-media-got-it-wrong-how-did-we-do-it-20160705-gpzatm\">in which he admitted</a>, \u201cThose political reporters not too hubristic to engage in self doubt are asking: did we get it wrong? Did we, as a collective, miss the story?\u201d</p> <p>The story that was seemingly missed was not a policy or a hidden funding cut, but the margin of victory by the LNP. But really, who gives a damn? If you think the prime role of your job as a journalist covering an election is to predict the results, then there is a lot more wrong than just whether or not your prediction was faulty.</p> <p>But the devotion to polling and prediction is also a concern for progressives because inherently polls \u2013 and thus their analysis \u2013 reinforce the status quo. As US political scientist Benjamin Ginsberg has noted, the growth of public polling has been \u201cmost damaging to the political fortunes of the groups that represented the interest and aspirations of the working classes\u201d.</p> <p>Without polling, politicians can only gauge voters\u2019 moods on certain issues either through meetings with constituents, letters or through observing political actions such as protests, strikes or rallies. Polls can give equal weight to the attitudes of the uninterested and the politically active.</p> <p>For the progressive wonks the worry is not so much about advocating policies or programs that are detrimental to society, but whether the need for data and evidence means your arguments are being ignored by those who matter (itself an issue for debate) and that secondly you are pushing the debate towards the centre \u2013 and also being part of the movement that then pushes that centre ever more to the right.</p> <p>Among the most common strawman arguments is that the Brexit vote and Trump\u2019s ascendancy prove that relying on fact-checking and wonks is doomed to failure. And there may be truth in that, but I\u2019ve yet to hear anyone suggest that facts should be the only weapon used in a debate. No election \u2013 not even the fact-checking triumph of 2012 \u2013 has ever been won on the basis of who told the fewest lies. Similarly no policy debate has ever been won just because a group of experts did a review and someone tweeted a graph.</p> <p>If you are arguing that there needs to be action on climate change, yes you\u2019re going to need more than a graph to do it. But you\u2019re also going to struggle without one. A concept as divorced from most people\u2019s lives as is climate change needs at the very least to be fought with data \u2013 especially when the opposing side is doing its best to suggest their data shows there is no need to worry. Among the most influential examples was the ultra-wonky documentary An Inconvenient Truth. Did the film win the debate? Did its numerous graphs on climate change lead to global action that saw a price on carbon? Well no, but that\u2019s not to say nothing was gained \u2013 more perhaps that progressives have a tendency to discredit their victories. Australia did implement a price on carbon.</p> <p>Now perhaps the reason the ALP subsequently lost the 2013 election was because there was too much of an emphasis on data and economic neoliberalism and not enough talk of values. Or perhaps the main reason we no longer have a price on carbon is because the ALP lost the election after three years fanning a dumpster-fire of internal division.</p> <p>Who can say. But the wonk critics do also have a point. Despite what the authors of books such as Freakonomics might attest, economics neither explains everything in life nor persuades. Fact-checking is particularly useless at countering prejudice. A graph on the improvement of GDP from immigration is unlikely to switch the votes of people from Trump or One Nation hostile to the very idea of foreigners.</p> <p>While there may be some objective centrists, I would argue in Australia the progressive wonks \u2013 and I put myself in this camp \u2013 write as much with passion for a cause as they do with passion for facts. When I write an article to dismiss the claims regarding the numbers of welfare recipients, I don\u2019t do it from some neutral point of view. I do it because people are lying in order to hurt the most disadvantaged in society. I\u2019m not going to ignore the lie\u2014and using facts to counter it is not I would argue some anodyne approach.</p> <p>The adherence to data can easily lead the wonks to prefer the safety of the status quo. This was something I was conscious of when arguing against the Abbott plan for extending paid parental leave to full replacement-wage level for 26 weeks. I argued that such a plan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/mar/10/abbotts-paid-parental-leave-will-do-little-to-bring-women-to-the-workforce\">would do little to increase women\u2019s workforce participation</a> (the aim of the policy), and that the money would be better spent on child care. I could see the moral argument that paid parental leave should be paid regardless of the parents\u2019 income, but I could also see the moral argument that governments should aim to improve the standard of living for women with children. For me the better policy response was in broader childcare policy rather than an expanded PPL. </p> <p>But the risk \u2013 as soon as you suggest factors such as the size of a budget deficit should be considered \u2013 is that such an approach will always see you favouring a more centrist position. Consider for example the common argument about government spending and the size of the budget. During the last election campaign Anthony Albanese argued that \u201cspending is higher as a proportion of GDP today than it was under the global financial crisis\u201d. The ABC\u2019s fact-checking unit <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-31/fact-check-is-government-spending-today-higher-than-gfc/7459392\">found that statement to be incorrect</a> because in one year during the GFC government spending was marginally higher.</p> <p>This set off quite a debate \u2013 especially online involving economist Stephen Koukoulas, who argued the ABC fact checkers had taken far too narrow a view of what constituted the GFC period. And yet to what end was the fight? Do progressives really care that the ALP spent less than an LNP government? Doesn\u2019t that merely reinforce the conservative position that smaller government is better?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/08/close-call-how-the-pollsters-got-the-election-result-right\">Close call: how the pollsters got the election result right | Peter Lewis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Progressives love to blame themselves. Rare is an election defeat by the ALP that does not result in great internal angst, gnashing of teeth and writing of books charting what went right and what needs to be done. Such self-reflection certainly is preferable to the view that it is always the other side or the media which that is at fault \u2013 or even worse, that voters are to blame. But the anti-wonk fight is a futile one. Progressives should not give up on the facts, if only because doing so cedes the space to the conservative forces.<br></p> <p>The wonks themselves need, however, to watch whether their work is merely perpetuating a status quo due to a fear of the bold, or a disinclination to countenance an upset, or because the lines within which they fight have been laid out by the conservative side. </p> <p>But mostly they need to be wary that their adherence to the data can see them lose sight of the greater truth: that despite what some might have thought in 2012, facts \u2013 whether they be on GDP, climate temperatures or any other data \u2013 are not the only truth in life, or politics.</p> <p><strong>This is an edited extract of an essay that appears in the <a href=\"https://www.mup.com.au/items/190003\">spring issue of Meanjin</a>, out 15 September.

  "<p>The charity <a href=\"http://www.samaritans.org/\">Samaritans</a> has called for government action to tackle sharp rises in the rates of self-harm and suicide in jails in England and Wales in the past year as prison staff numbers continue to fall.</p> <p>Self-inflicted death rates in prisons rose by 20% in the past year to the highest level in eight years, the charity said. Self-harm is up by 27% in the year to June 2016; meanwhile, the number of prison staff has fallen by 25% over the last six years, it said. <br></p> <p>On the 25th anniversary of the launch of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/sep/24/samaritans-prison-scheme-under-threat\">prison listener scheme</a> \u2013 which trains prisoners to provide emotional support to peers who are struggling to cope \u2013 Samaritans said its volunteers regularly witnessed the effects of a reduced number of prison staff.<br></p> <p>The suicide rate in prison is estimated to be between seven and 12 times that of the general population, and prison suicide costs the taxpayer potentially \u00a3160m-\u00a3300m a year, it said.<br></p> <p>In the 12 months to June this year, 105 prisoners took their own lives. The charity said it believed the impact of low staffing levels in prisons had contributed to the rising suicide rates.<br></p> <p>Ruth Sutherland, chief executive of the Samaritans, said: \u201cWe are concerned about the impact of the problem of low staffing levels in prisons. We believe that this problem has contributed to the rising suicide rates among prisoners and needs to be addressed.<br></p> <p>\u201cA shortage of prison staff leads to prisoners spending longer locked in their cells, reduces access to work or education, which helps with rehabilitation, living conditions are poorer, and it is more difficult to access healthcare. Prisoners also struggle to contact friends and family under these circumstances.\u201d<br></p> <p>The listener scheme, which is delivered by Samaritans and the National Offender Management Service, began in Swansea prison in 1991 and now runs in 117 jails, with training and support provided by 95 Samaritans branches. Last year prisoners trained as listeners had 90,000 confidential contacts with their fellow inmates.</p> <p>The early days in custody are a time of heightened suicide rick, and the Samaritans says it is crucial that awareness of the scheme and access to it is embedded into all reception and induction processes for new prisoners.<br></p> <p>Research shows the scheme helps to create an \u201cenabling culture\u201d whereby prisoners feel that they can talk, and by talking there is a reduction in frustration and anger and a building up of trust between prisoners, which helps to create a calmer and safer environment. Prisoners most commonly used listeners during the night or when locked up.<br></p> <p>Through the scheme, Samaritans said its volunteers were in a unique position to see the impact of reduced staffing levels.<br></p> <p>Sutherland said: \u201cStaff-prisoner relationships are vital for ensuring prisoner safety and preventing prison suicides and these relationships cannot be built when staff are so badly under resourced.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe rapidly rising rates of suicide, which is at its highest in eight years since 2007, show that conditions in our prisons needs improving.\u201c<br></p> <p>The House of Commons justice select committee has also suggested that low staffing levels contribute to overall declining prison safety including an increase of self-inflicted deaths, self-harm and assault incidents.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

  "<p>The spotlight was on Gareth Barry on his 600th Premier League appearance, the expectation on Idrissa Gueye after an exceptional start to his Everton career and the pressure all on Ross Barkley following a very public dressing down before Middlesbrough arrived at Goodison Park. It demonstrated the latter\u2019s refusal to hide, and lack of ego, that the entire heart of Everton\u2019s midfield functioned as Ronald Koeman demanded.</p> <p>If a half-time substitution at Sunderland last Monday and repeated calls for improvement were Koeman\u2019s way of testing Barkley\u2019s mentality as well as ability, then his satisfaction with the 22-year-old\u2019s reaction was justified. In the closeted, precious world of the Premier League it can be dangerous for any manager to issue public warnings and criticism of their biggest talents. Koeman, like Everton managers before him, had no such concerns with Barkley. \u201cWhat is testing?\u201d he asked following the 3-1 victory that left his team second in the table. \u201cYes, maybe Ross was under pressure but if you don\u2019t handle the pressure you can\u2019t play in the Premier League.\u201d</p> <p>Koeman added: \u201cIt was an important game for Ross and he responded. You can\u2019t always say what you think about players but I try to be honest with them. He was very good, he played like I like to see. Offensively very strong, and defensively he was very important for the team. Maybe in 90 minutes he lost less balls than he did in the first ten minutes of the last game.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/17/everton-middlesbrough-premier-league-match-report\">Everton see off Middlesbrough as Barry scores on 600th Premier League game</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAfter Monday, first of all you speak to the player and you need to support the player. You expect a reaction from the player too. Players are not so stupid that they don\u2019t know when they play well or not so well. We watched all the clips, we had a good talk and we had a good solution. It was good for the boy to continue. He\u2019s four or five years in the first team now and that means more responsibility in the midfield. He showed how good he can be.\u201d</p> <p>The England international had accepted the Dutch coach\u2019s unflattering analysis of his 45-minute display at the Stadium of Light during their conversation last week. As usual, he put in extra training at Finch Farm and, despite the scrutiny on his every pass and being frequently outnumbered, he drove his team forwards at every opportunity against Middlesbrough.</p> <p>Not everything Barkley attempted paid dividends but not every player would attempt what the midfielder produced at Goodison, certainly not in such pressurised circumstances. A stunning turn outside the visiting area fooled Daniel Ayala and prompted a vital covering challenge from Ben Gibson. When V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s thwarted Barkley\u2019s third determined run and shot of the game, the Gwladys Street broke into song about the player they call a diamond. Appreciation is genuine for one of their own, although Koeman is not alone in wanting greater consistency from the midfielder. The manager repeated: \u201cThis is his fourth or fifth season in the Premier League. He is not a young player any more.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/15/ross-barkley-must-raise-game-everton-ronald-koeman\">Ross Barkley must raise his game, warns Everton manager Ronald Koeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Phil Jagielka, the captain, who has been alongside Barkley throughout, offered a revealing insight into the boyhood Evertonian\u2019s mindset after his individual setback at Sunderland. \u201cRoss was one of the happiest players on Monday night even though he may not have been particularly delighted with his own performance,\u201d the defender said. \u201cHe knows it is a team game.</p> <p>\u201cIt was great the manager gave him another opportunity to perform and it may not have been Ross\u2019s most dazzling of games but he got around the pitch, put tackles in and his shirt was absolutely drenched afterwards.</p> <p>\u201cThat is what we want from him and what everyone wants from him. We know his qualities and if he puts those performances in week in, week out, the goals and assists will come. First and foremost it is about playing for the team. He struggled with that a little bit on Monday but he is not going to go and crawl into a hole or hide. He has had such a lot of expectation from a young age but he has learned to deal with it. I am delighted for him that he has played a big part in this win.\u201d</p> <p>Once again, Barkley operated in front of an outstanding midfield axis on Saturday as man of the match Gueye and Barry broke Boro\u2019s attempted forays time and again. The veteran struck a timely equaliser, his second goal in five games under Koeman having gone 102 games without a goal before this season, while Gueye\u2019s only error was spraying a pass out to Tom Cleverley. Cleverley was warming up in the technical area, ready to replace Barry, at the time.</p> <p>\u201cHe was outstanding, he was perfect in every aspect of football,\u201d Koeman said of Gueye, a \u00a37m signing from Aston Villa. \u201cYes, he wins a lot of the second balls and tackles but he also showed great composure on the ball \u2013 left, right and always trying to play forwards. He is a fantastic signing for the club and I hope we keep him a long time \u2013 but I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Some birds pop up when you least expect it. On August bank holiday I went for a walk to my coastal patch, along with assorted relatives and a very boisterous dog. Bird-wise, apart from a high-tide roost of a thousand <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/redshank\">redshanks</a> along the river Brue, things were relatively uneventful.</p> <p>But as we were strolling back to the car, a small bird flew up onto a protruding twig along a hedgerow, and posed in a way that made its identity virtually certain.</p> <p>A glance through my binoculars confirmed that it was indeed a <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/whinchat\">whinchat</a>.

Late August and early September see a steady trickle of whinchats passing through southern Britain, on their way down to west Africa from their breeding grounds further north. They return in April, when they look a lot smarter: a male that stopped off here last spring was absolutely immaculate, especially compared with the dowdy juveniles we see in autumn. </p> <p>My very first Somerset whinchats appeared a year or so after we moved down here. My neighbour, Mick, had photographed a mystery bird that he\u2019d asked me to identify. Not a whinchat, as it turned out, but a female wheatear \u2013 one of several he\u2019d seen on nearby Blackford Moor. A swift bike ride led me straight to a couple of <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/wheatear\">wheatears</a>, flashing their snow-white rumps as they pranced around a newly cut field.</p> <p>But the real bonus was no fewer than ten whinchats; five perched on bales of hay, and the others on the reeds along the rhynes \u2013 the narrow water-filled ditches that form field boundaries on the Somerset Levels. Why they were all concentrated in this one place was obvious: the surrounding fields had been cut for silage several months\u2019 earlier, leaving just short grass.</p> <p>Short grass means far fewer insects, the vital energy supply for all migrants as they prepare to leave our shores for the long flight to Africa. Haymaking \u2013 partly because it occurs later in the season, and partly because the bales are left on the land rather than being wrapped up in black plastic like giant rabbit droppings \u2013 is better for insects, and so far better for the wheatears and whinchats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/02/fitting-last-stronghold-whinchat-country-diary\">A fitting last stronghold for the whinchat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was only later that I discovered that whinchats used to nest in good numbers on the Somerset Levels \u2013 until as recently as the 1980s there were as many as 150 breeding pairs here. Yet now there are none. It\u2019s a stark reminder that, while we seem to be able to create the right habitat for wetland birds, we still struggle with those species that need wildlife-friendly farming to thrive.</p> <p>Today, we think of whinchats as birds of the uplands: denizens of the wild and windy moors, where they nest on gorse (\u201cwhin\u201d being an old name for that plant). But as my friend <a href=\"http://www.ben-macdonald.co.uk\">Ben Macdonald</a> has pointed out, this is yet another example of the way our view of a particular bird shifts as it declines. It also shows that we need to reverse the loss of whinchats from our lowland farmed landscape, if we are ever to reclaim our land from the so called \u201ccustodians of the countryside\u201d. </p> <p><em>\u2022Stephen\u2019s latest book, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/wild-kingdom.html\">Wild Kingdom: Bringing Back Britain\u2019s Wildlife</a>, is out now (Square Peg, \u00a316.99)</em></p>",

  "<p>The internet has never only been a technology. It has had cultural, social and economic meanings which have interacted with its technological achievements in unpredictable ways. When it first appeared it was entirely the creature of the American government, which funded much of the research that led to it, and provided a regulatory environment in which it could thrive and spread. The ideology of the early pioneers oscillated between a kind of pragmatic anarchism and a belief in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Postel\" title=\"\">the benevolent despotism of engineers</a>, where the final judgments would be made by those who best understood the technology.</p> <p>The web is now an essential conduit for both money and ideas. Politicians in many countries think it is far too important to be left to the engineers. The latest to get in on the act is Senator Ted Cruz, the defeated Republican presidential candidate. He has been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/09/15/ted-cruz-has-made-an-obscure-internet-agency-his-first-post-presidential-crusade/\" title=\"\">campaigning</a> energetically to maintain the US government\u2019s job of managing a group that oversees domain names on the Internet. Washington is supposed to transfer its control over the <a href=\"https://www.icann.org/\" title=\"\">Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</a> (Icann) to the international community in two weeks. Icann&#xa0;does many things, but it\u2019s often described as a kind of web phone directory \u2013 matching a string of numbers to their domain names. This ensures that when you type \u201cwww.theguardian.com\u201d into a web browser, you end up at the Guardian\u2019s homepage.</p> <p>The openness and reliability of the internet as it presently exists depends on such mechanisms, known as the domain name system (DNS). Simplistically, one could knock a site off the internet by erasing its place in the DNS. There are ways round this, but it is undeniable that the power to block political dissidents or to stymie attempts for opponents to organise would be handy for authoritarian governments. China\u2019s great firewall already hijacks DNS requests in order to bar websites that it deems subversive. The existence of that firewall shows that Icann cannot protect all the freedoms the system makes possible, but it can make sure the formalities are observed even by those who are subverting their intent.</p> <p>What <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/16/us/politics/ted-cruz-internet-domain-names-funding.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">Senator Cruz</a> and other Republicans claim is that if the US gives up oversight of the DNS function, it could lead to dictatorships taking control of the internet and eventually censoring content throughout the world. They are sceptical that an international organisation would safeguard the open nature of today\u2019s web. However, the truth is that if the US blocks the transfer of Icann then that would be an excuse for authoritarian regimes to attempt to exert more control over the internet.</p> <p>Despite tech titans such as Google and Amazon pleading with Washington to ensure that Icann becomes a global body rather than a US one, the Republicans seemed to suggest they could bring government to a halt over the issue. They sensed a chance to wound a departing President Obama, whose administration started the shift in 2014. We have been here before: Senator Cruz was instrumental in shutting down Washington in 2013. Another shutdown would be disastrous.</p> <p>Icann is not a particularly admirable organisation in itself. But it represents a vision of global, open cooperation that is preferable to the ruthless and shortsighted jockeying for advantage represented in their different ways&#xa0;by both the Chinese government and Senator Cruz.</p>",

Despite Le Pen\u2019s sidelining of her father and party co-founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, and her long quest to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/10/le-pen-feud-family-drama-in-battle-for-the-soul-of-front-national-and-france\">\u201cdetoxify\u201d</a> her party of the racist, jack-booted, antisemitic imagery of the past, a majority of French voters still question whether the party is capable of governing France. </p> <p>Outside Le Pen\u2019s heartlands there is a widespread fear of the party, which many continue to associate with the old tags of demagoguery, xenophobia or racism. The party still faces a barrage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/11/le-pen-french-tactical-voting-to-fight-rise-of-far-right\">tactical voting </a>by the right and left to stop it winning final-round votes \u2013 described by one Lille party worker as \u201cthe onslaught of an armada\u201d. This clubbing together of right and left parties against the FN prevented it from winning any constituencies in last year\u2019s regional elections despite taking a historic 6.8m votes. </p> <p>Smiling, Le Pen chatted to journalists backstage at her party conference, saying she was confident she could expand her electorate far enough to win. Her aim in this pre-campaign period is to present herself as credible, to move away from divisive positions and to re-position herself as a kind of calm, unifying authority. She said she would run a \u201cjoyous\u201d campaign. Her aides said she felt her chances were better than ever. \u201cWith the designation of Trump in the US, and Brexit, analysts should be a bit more modest, there\u2019s a global awakening,\u201d Le Pen said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/demagogues-and-cheats-un-human-rights-chief-condemns-trump-and-wilders\">'Demagogues and cheats': UN rights chief condemns Trump and Wilders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Above all, if Le Pen makes it through to the second round, she wants to avoid the fate that befell her father when he shocked France by reaching the final round in 2002.More than a million angry demonstrators took to the streets in protest against Le Pen senior who was subsequently squarely beaten when 82% of voters from all parties opted for Jacques Chirac, in order to keep the FN at bay.</p> <p>This time, if Marine Le Pen makes the second round, she is likely to seriously narrow the gap.

This serves to legitimise FN ideas, party members argue. </p> <p>While Sarkozy has controversially called for the locking up of anyone suspected of radicalisation even if they have committed no crime, Le Pen has sat back and argued for protecting the rule of law, aiming to show she is less divisive than him. </p> <p>David Rachline, the young FN mayor of Fr\u00e9jus who will serve as Le Pen\u2019s campaign director, said her ideas were now \u201cmajority-held views in France\u201d.</p> <p>Gilbert Collard, one of Le Pen\u2019s MPs, said: \u201cWho in France can say that everything\u2019s going well, that the economy\u2019s good, that there\u2019s security, that terrorism has been controlled, the nation preserved?

He taught me how to look at a building, and how looking round a cathedral can be a detective exercise. I remember we spent about three lessons watching Bondarchuk\u2019s Waterloo and that he brought in Jaws for our last lesson before Christmas \u2013 but just fast-forwarded it to all the shark attacks. <br></p> <p>He had an odd obsession with woolly mammoths and always advised us to draw them on our papers if we ended up with leftover time in a class test.

John Hynam took us for this two-hour lesson. He would play a recording of things such as Martin Luther King\u2019s speeches, and we would then discuss the issues raised. Until these lessons we had been treated as schoolchildren, and learned everything by rote. Suddenly, we were asked for our opinions, na\u00efve though they may have been, and grown-up discussions followed. While I must admit school bored me and I disliked just about everything about it, I relished these sessions and my interest in both politics and modern history has endured. </p> <p>It has taken me 50 years to acknowledge the debt I owe this teacher and my main regret is that I was never able to go back and thank him for this first step in me being treated like a thinking human being.</p> <h2>\u2018\u201cHuh, and they call this education,\u201d he said\u2019</h2> <p><em>Patrick Neylan, 52, on Mike Hart</em></p> <p>Back when the 11-plus could get you a free place at a public school, I ended up at Dulwich College (a year below Nigel Farage, who was as bumptious, amusing and politically suspect as he is now).

However, she opened our eyes to a love affair (in my case a lasting one) with history, and with education for education\u2019s sake. Her Americanisms amused us, and her vocabulary flummoxed us \u2013 realising that at age 12 none of us knew the word oligarchy, she insisted that we all had notebooks that she called \u201cglossaries\u201d. One of my classmates admitted it took her two years to understand the actual meaning of the word \u201cglossary\u201d.</p> <p>I remember her tweedy jackets and elegant hair, but most of all I remember her voice \u2013 a vehicle for her neverending enthusiasm.

Although by the time he taught me in the 1970s he had already taught two other notable boys \u2013 Tony Blair and Rowan Atkinson \u2013 he would have been better suited to the 1800s, belonging to the sort of travelling theatre company created by Dickens for Nicholas Nickleby. All of his lessons were high-speed dramatic performances in which, armed with a few basic props \u2013 a rolled-up gown, a window pole, a pile of dusty books \u2013 he assumed the role of prelate or pikeman, unscrupulous courtier or threadbare peasant. Each week, the performances were summarised in a sheet of notes that were distilled from an Encyclopaedia Britannica and hammered out on an old Remington typewriter. These we learned for a test. Very old-fashioned, very effective. </p> <h2><strong>\u2018We were all a bit crushed when we found out he\u2019d got married\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Nora Dillon, 52, on Mr Behan</em></p> <p>We all adored Mr Behan, our history teacher at the west of Ireland convent where I and all my female forebears had attended. Among the stern nuns in musty black academic gowns he cut a swagger with his conquistador beard and love of history and debating. We really had no idea how old he was or what his backstory was \u2013 but were all a bit crushed when we found out he had got married one summer. He said he wanted us to think like adults, and what music to the ears of a micromanaged country girl that was. His classes were magic. No one in my family had even considered law as an option, and I had plenty of frank feedback about it being out of my league. Mr Behan was very supportive.</p> <p>Mr Behan continued to inspire generations of girls from that school, a very modest but academically successful convent school in Kerry. When he was appointed headteacher I wrote to him about my career as a lawyer and told him he had set me on that path with confidence and without fear. I am very grateful for his counsel and teaching and I am sure he will continue to positively influence the next generation. <br></p> <h2>\u2018She gave me a mix-tape.

Before she came along, me and drama didn\u2019t mix. I wasn\u2019t the kid with the big gob and a bucket load of confidence \u2013 the thought of having to answer a question in class sent my palms into sweat overload.<br></p> <p>She taught me that I didn\u2019t have to fit into the expected norm, it was OK to be the outsider and to still enjoy drama. <br></p> <p>Over the course of the next few years at St George\u2019s, in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, my confidence grew.

She made us look at things in a different way. </p> <p>She had a voice that boomed across the classroom and some feared the woman, but not us in the know. In my head, she was always dressed in smart, no-nonsense blouses and tartan skirts with bright red lipstick. I have taken much of what she taught me through my adult life, and now as a teacher myself I find myself \u201cdoing a Mrs Kiloh\u201d. A few years ago, she and I crossed paths and I had the pleasure of meeting her son Bruce. I told Bruce how his mum made me want to teach and how special she made us all feel. A few days later, Bruce called and sent me a photo of a recipe I\u2019d written and given to Mrs Kiloh about 39 years before \u2013 he told me that every family birthday she would get out the Dutch crunch recipe and have a plate freshly baked on the table.</p> <h2>\u2018There was a rumour she was an Iranian princess\u2019</h2> <p><em>Rebecca, 35, on Dr Habib</em></p> <p>Dr Habib was a passionate teacher. She told us we must care about maths like we did our favourite pop group \u2013 at the time I thought that was ridiculous. She set us twice as much homework as the top sets for GCSE and told us that she had predicted us all A*s. Every weekend we would do extra algebra tests from a book that must have been 50 years old. They would take hours and I resented it. </p> <p>But she also baked cakes for us and cried once (I think when I didn\u2019t do my homework and was being a petulant teen). Back then, I thought it was crazy. Now I wish I had told her what an amazing teacher she was and how her commitment and passion enabled me to get that A* in a subject I found hard. </p> <p>There was also a rumour that went round the school that she was an Iranian princess. I wish I knew what happened to Dr Habib \u2013 I think of her often when teaching my own students.</p> <h2>\u2018In our last year, he taught us university economics\u2019</h2> <p><em>Neve Hristova, 35, on Robert Bateman</em></p> <p>My favourite teacher was Mr Robert Bateman, who taught me economics and business studies while at Worksop College between 1998 and 2000. He was an extraordinary teacher who came at his students with a firm belief in their intelligence and ability to learn. I was a scholarship student who had just travelled from Bulgaria for sixth form college. He was the first teacher who made me believe I could really excel in a strange new environment, and that I had things to bring to the table, despite my acute case of being poor and foreign. <br></p> <p>I remember the way he would conduct his lessons. In our last year, he basically took us through economics theory taught at first-year university, lecture-style, and we were encouraged to ask questions. He didn\u2019t stint on his praise when we got things right, nor his ire if we were playing stupid. He made economics relatable and fun. <br></p> <p>He also wrote the best, most encouraging report card I ever received at college. I still have it, tucked away in an old economics textbook that I couldn\u2019t bring myself to get rid of.</p> <h2>\u2018I actually joined the Labour party because of him\u2019</h2> <p><em>Richard Williams, 36, on Mr Foley </em></p> <p>I had some great teachers at Haydon Comprehensive, Northwood, but none so tolerant of my arrogance and constant baiting of his left wing views. He taught me economics at A-level and I got an A. I would love for him to know that his views, always offered in a lighthearted non-condescending manner, had an impact on me later in life. I have actually joined the Labour party and switched from my rightwing economic views. He always had wise words, which I pass on. I miss and remember the Friday-afternoon \u201cgraveyard slot\u201d lessons.

She taught me think critically and to observe my own landscape and culture at a time when colonial education was still predominant in Jamaica. I now live in the UK and have tried for 30 years to find Ms Peacock and to say thanks. </p> <h2>\u2018He introduced me to the beauty of literature\u2019</h2> <p><em>Joan Opie, 60, on Mr Coleman</em></p> <p>My English teacher, Mr Coleman, was amazing. I was a shy child with a passion for reading, literature and poetry, who had just failed the 11-plus and was sent to the local secondary modern school in Redcar. For some years I secretly read poetry in my bedroom, hiding it behind a comic. As a working-class child there would have been nothing but torment and ridicule from my six siblings if they\u2019d known.<br></p> <p>Mr Coleman was the first person I met who had a similar passion. He introduced me to classic literature, which I absorbed and came to love. During the first term at Coatham County Modern School he read The Lady of Shalott to the class. I was mesmerised by the language and the way he expressed it. It is still my favourite poem today and I continually read and listen to it. Mr Coleman introduced me to the beauty of literature; something I have now passed to my daughter, who has just published her first book. </p> <h2>\u2018Twenty years later, the sparkle in his eye was contagious as ever\u2019</h2> <p><em>Richard Borek, 62, on Frank McQuay</em></p> <p>Frank McQuay was the first teacher at MJ Hobbs School in Hampton, Ontario, to even notice me as an individual, and to teach me that being distinct from the herd just made me an individual rather than an outcast. <br></p> <p>As a small and socially awkward grade eight student, prone to ridicule and occasionally bullying, he paired me with \u201cbig Pete\u201d, a large lumbering teen who had already been held back twice. Impressive as was his size, he also drove his own car to school, and was somewhat of an adult to us. Big Pete, (who became an electrician) needed a bit of help with \u201cbook learning\u201d and quite easily accepted my informal tutoring. I in turn enjoyed his unvoiced protection from any teasing. I only realised that this ploy was purposefully established by Mr McQuay a decade later. I met him some 20 years later and the sparkle in his eyes was as contagious as ever. A few years later, I found out he had passed and vowed that I would pay forward whatever intangible lessons he had taught me.</p> <h2>\u2018He let me ignite flash powder during the school play\u2019</h2> <p><em>Clive, 68, on Mr Griffiths</em></p> <p>Mr Griffiths, headteacher of my primary school in Waterloo, Merseyside, around 1957, was my inspiration. I asked him what the term \u201cimpedance\u201d meant (on a pair of old headphones). He gave me a book called The Foundations of Wireless and suggested it would provide the answer.</p> <p>It more than answered my question; it set in motion a fascination for radio engineering that would take me to more than 30 countries, installing radio stations. What I remember most about him was his humanity. In an era of the cane, he was an enlightened head and no corporal punishment happened in his school. He also permitted me to demonstrate my early knowledge of chemistry: I ignited flash powder during the school play and filled the hall with smoke. As a result of being inspired by him to follow a career that I loved, when I became a teacher myself I tried to do the same for my students. It paid off \u2013 the father of one of my ex-pupils phoned me to thank me for teaching his son how to code in Basic: he ended up with Google, in California. </p> <h2>\u2018We wore what we liked and went barefoot everywhere\u2019</h2> <p><em>Richard Tagart, 60, on Tony (Gerald Anthony) Lowther</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0c6f75adc7d622ea3c20fa8ba7c7a35551250f5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c6f75adc7d622ea3c20fa8ba7c7a35551250f5b/0_0_1032_1456/709.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Tagart\u2019s teacher Tony Lowther \u201cThe school was just outside the village of Jarvis Brook, near Crowborough in East Sussex &amp; operated from 1971 until well into the 1990s (moving to new premises in Mayfield in 1981). \u201c\" width=\"709\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Tagart\u2019s teacher Tony Lowther \u201cThe school was just outside the village of Jarvis Brook, near Crowborough in East Sussex.\u201d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy Richard Tagart</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The son of a brigadier in the British Indian army and graduate of Trinity College Cambridge, Mr Lowther taught me for English and RE at Earnley School and was headmaster of Rotherfield Hall school, both of which I attended between 1969 and 1974. <br></p> <p>He had a wonderfully irreverent way of bringing literature and Bible stories to life. Rotherfield Hall was modelled on AS Neill\u2019s Summerhill and gave us the freedom to find out who we were, rather than trying to stuff us into predetermined moulds. We were on first-name terms with all adults, wore what we liked, did what we liked (except for having to go to class) and went barefoot everywhere all the year round. A truly unique education. <br></p> <p>I remember his sense of humour. We had a home farm and he was delighted that our new pigs were mating, announcing \u201cWe\u2019ve got sex in the pig sties!\u201d \u2013 without seeing my mother standing just out of sight. </p> <p>After university, I worked at my old school for several years before going to work overseas and stayed in touch with him until his death in 2008. His birthday would have been 12 September and I, together with many \u201cold Rotherfeldians\u201d raised a glass to his (teetotal) memory. </p>",

His father was an executive at Cathay Pacific \u2013 \u201cI think I have a deep guilt at having taken so many flights,\u201d he says \u2013 and his experience of other cultures encourages him to think that if people can be persuaded there are different ways of living without our overweening dependence on fossil fuels, we can switch rapidly to those other modes. \u201cYoung people see this,\u201d he says, as their exposure to the internet gives them a broader viewpoint of other cultures. \u201cMy grandfather doesn\u2019t believe in it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/18/deliciously-stella-clean-eating-instagram-comedian-bella-younger-interview\">Deliciously Stella: the Instagram sensation serving up raw Kinder eggs on avo-toast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His sense of urgency has deeply personal roots as well.

Al Gore\u2019s 2006 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/sep/17/documentary.algore\">An Inconvenient Truth</a> won an Oscar, but was a documentary, beautifully paced and shot, but essentially the filming of an hour-long standup lecture. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/mar/20/the-age-of-stupid-review\">The Age of Stupid</a> looked and sounded different, but underneath was much the same format, with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/pete-postlethwaite\">Pete Postlethwaite</a> narrating an impassioned polemic against rampant consumerism.

  "<p>This interview was meant to happen months ago, but was cancelled at the last minute, rescheduled and then cancelled again, and this carried on all summer. When at last we meet, Malia Bouattia&#xa0;apologises with consummate elegance, blaming pressures on a diary over which she has \u201cno control at all\u201d. I have a strong suspicion that this is not true. She offers it without a trace of unease, and I&#xa0;can\u2019t decide whether the grace of what I\u2019m sure is a&#xa0;deceit is really quite impressive, or offputting. In fact I can\u2019t recall ever feeling so&#xa0;many powerful but contradictory emotions about someone I&#xa0;have only just met.</p> <p>Bouattia\u2019s manner can be almost glassily cool, but I think that\u2019s to hide how nervous she is, and the vulnerability is very touching. But the next minute she can become formidably impressive, and fill me with admiration, and seconds later become maddening. By the end I\u2019m so angry, I\u2019m ranting at her like a lunatic. \u201cFor the record,\u201d I yell, \u201cthis has never happened before! I am not in the habit of shouting in interviews!\u201d I am dying of embarrassment when I leave, and at a loss to explain why this&#xa0;happened.</p> <p>Bouattia, 28, has had to deal with so much anger by now that you might think she would be immune to it, but I don\u2019t think she is. Before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/22/malia-bouattia-election-nus-president-deeply-divisive-jewish-student-groups\" title=\"\">she became president of the National Union of Students (NUS) in April</a> she served two years as the union\u2019s black students\u2019 officer, during which she rejected a motion condemning Isis. She was promptly branded a terrorist sympathiser by the press, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/24/new-nus-president-not-antisemitic-isis-sympathiser\" title=\"\">who chose not to report that her only objection to the motion was its poor wording</a>, which she wanted to correct. The deluge of death threats necessitated police protection, but still were nothing compared with the uproar her presidential election provoked. That Bouattia is the first black woman and first Muslim to be elected NUS president was lost in Fleet&#xa0;Street\u2019s frenzy to dig up old comments she had made that \u201cproved\u201d she was antisemitic.</p> <p>She had described the University of Birmingham as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/21/nus-president-malia-bouattia-must-redress-concerns-over-antisemitism-say-jewish-students\" title=\"\">\u201csomething of a Zionist outpost\u201d and on another occasion referred to \u201cmainstream Zionist-led media outlets\u201d.</a> More than 300 Jewish leaders complained. \u201cThis was a few years ago and I was talking about quite a particular context where there were a lot of activists that were very vocally supportive of the state of Israel and its actions. I was part of the Palestine society that, for most of the years that I was involved in it, was just trying to exist as a society let alone actually build solidarity, so it was because of that opposition, the constant tension and having disruptions for events that were taking place \u2026 you know, holding solidarity demonstrations and having opposing ones with Israeli flags flying, speakers being heckled. I wasn\u2019t being critical of the number of Jewish students or the size of the Jewish society at Birmingham. It was very much in relation to the opposition to any kind of Palestine solidarity efforts that were taking place.\u201d</p> <p>She clarifies that she simply meant that Birmingham\u2019s student union had the biggest and most vociferously Zionist Jewish society, and that she was referring to media outlets that promote a heavily pro-Israeli line, not evoking the old conspiracy theory about Jewish control of the media.</p> <p>Bouattia thinks the real reason for all the animosity is not antisemitism, but the radicalism of her leftwing politics. Though not a Labour member, she is a big fan of Jeremy Corbyn, and believes it was her promise of a bolder political agenda that won her the election. \u201cWe need action, and we need it now, and we need it differently to what we\u2019ve had before. We can\u2019t come to the table trying to compromise any more. That hasn\u2019t worked.\u201d</p> <p>But Bouattia\u2019s political ambitions go way beyond campaigning against education cuts or fee hikes. \u201cWe want a sense of international solidarity. We don\u2019t sit in a bubble. We have international students, migrant communities, and we can\u2019t sit by and be silent when spaces for education are for us to be critical of the systems, and of this country\u2019s role in escalating international crises, and escalating oppression of other groups. Liberation campaigns relate their work back to global movements for justice and solidarity, and we\u2019re much stronger when we\u2019re united.\u201d</p> <p>Personally, I find this both quite touching and perfectly appropriate from a student politician. But judging from an average turnout in student union elections of just 18%, the majority of undergraduates don\u2019t. I was a bit of a student political hack, and within that small world Bouattia is perfectly recognisable. To the overwhelming majority of seven million NUS members, however, her views and values, even the language she uses, are incomprehensible. If they don\u2019t share her commitment to fighting global injustice, but care about how to pay their rent instead, shouldn\u2019t their union leader confine herself to representing their interests?</p> <p>But the NUS is fighting on all fronts, Bouattia says, and it campaigns just as hard on education issues as, say, Palestinian rights. I wonder how much time she has ever spent in the company of apolitical students who came to university for the football, beer and toga parties, and are bewildered and alienated by NUS motions calling for the abolition of all prisons. Why does she think, I ask, that student voter turnout is so low?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a6bb8a594b1bdfa90531c9bd2ee9de3621b0af9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a6bb8a594b1bdfa90531c9bd2ee9de3621b0af9/0_23_4248_2549/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malia Bouattia, speaking at an NHS demonstration.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malia Bouattia, speaking at an NHS demonstration.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johnny Armstead/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s necessarily low if we compare it with voter turnout more generally.\u201d After I run through the average turnout for general, mayoral and devolved parliaments, she takes a new tack.</p> <p>\u201cOK, I think that when we think about the context in which we\u2019re in, where there\u2019s active demonisation of being politically active, you\u2019ve got the Prevent agenda [the government counter-terrorism programme to combat radicalisation], which is, like, actually hunting down students that choose to be politicised, particularly those who are racialised. We\u2019re at a time where things like the Prevent agenda quite explicitly target black and Muslim activists. I\u2019m seeing the realities of that, which is a turn away from taking political action. There is a total fear that they\u2019re going to be deported, and this is what they go home to. Their&#xa0;parents will tell them, \u2018You\u2019re going to end up in Guant\u00e1namo. You could end up deported to a homeland you\u2019re linked to, but have never even visited. You could end up having all your doors shut. You could end up being thrown out of university.\u2019 These are very real questions that people have to think about.\u201d</p> <p>Whether or not this is true, it still fails to explain why more than 80% of NUS members don\u2019t even turn out to vote. But I am struck by the scale of influence Bouattia accords to&#xa0;Prevent. Even if it frightened every single Muslim student away from politics, that would still only account for about 5% of NUS&#xa0;members.</p> <p>\u201cOh, but you see the Prevent agenda is not just simply targeting Muslims \u2013 as though an incredibly racist policy could even distinguish between the Muslims and non-Muslims. One black man with a beard and another, they all become Muslims, so, by extension, any racialised person becomes a target. And actually the agenda is targeting far more than that. It\u2019s a wider-reaching attack on politicised people and groups, anti-austerity activists, anti\u2011fracking activists, there\u2019s a whole host of people that this extends to now.\u201d Does she think Prevent\u2019s intention was always to target&#xa0;all forms of activism, and to use radicalisation as a convenient excuse to conceal grander ambitions?</p> <p>\u201cYes, I do believe that. I do believe that is has incredibly racist intentions, and intentions to crack down on people\u2019s civil liberties. I do believe&#xa0;that.\u201d</p> <p>If she could abolish Prevent today, what would she do to combat radicalisation? \u201cI would propose looking at the state of our foreign policy. And we\u2019ve cut every space of constructive engagement, like youth centres. Cost of living\u2019s increased, employment prospects are low, access to university is becoming ever harder. Even if people have accessed higher education, they\u2019ve accumulated vast amounts of debt. And have they had a positive experience, being forced to engage with content that doesn\u2019t relate to them, and perhaps is psychologically destructive? When we look at the incredibly Eurocentric curriculum, where people don\u2019t see themselves in what they\u2019re studying, and can\u2019t relate to it, and feel that their European counterparts hit the ground running, they can\u2019t see themselves advancing in the subjects.\u201d</p> <p>Bouattia says she has no ambitions for a political career, and sees her future in academia instead, which may be for the best, as I\u2019m not sure how her anti-radicalisation strategy would go down on the doorstep. But if her politics would strike most British voters as extreme, they make more sense from the perspective of her own life experience.</p> <p>Until the age of seven, she had a blissfully happy childhood in Algeria, but in the civil war academics became targets for abduction and murder, and the family fled to Birmingham. Taken in by Christian ministries, they found themselves in an alien world of brussels sprouts and a language Bouattia could not speak. She was fluent within two months, but remained desperately homesick, and consoled herself by drawing the Algerian map all over everything at school.</p> <p>After studying a degree in culture studies she read an MA in postcolonial theory at the University of Birmingham, before becoming the NUS black students\u2019 officer and then president. \u201cBut I think the sense of displacement is still with me. When Daily Mail articles are written, and quite racist, Islamophobic trolls come after you over social media, you\u2019re very much reminded that people don\u2019t feel you belong here. My parents took us out to access a better space of education, to be better equipped to go back to Algeria and give back.\u201d Her election was widely celebrated in Algeria, and she goes on: \u201cThat made me more at ease with all that I do here, and how it feeds into the bigger picture, because at times when you\u2019re so intricately involved in something locally, you start to wonder how does this fit into the bigger picture? How does this fit into the wider struggle?\u201d</p> <p>I ask if she worries that the antisemitism row has diminished her power as president. \u201cNot necessarily. Not so far,\u201d is a surprising answer, but she says that she thinks the controversy raised the profile of the NUS, and provided new platforms for her \u201cto put out our vision of the future\u201d.</p> <p>Does she think she has ever said anything antisemitic? \u201cI don\u2019t. I don\u2019t, and if my words were misinterpreted, then in future I\u2019ll take the time to make sure I break them down and explain them.\u201d Are there any comments she has made in the past that she would not now say?\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not about not saying it again, it\u2019s about just breaking them down to explain what I meant.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"244e604b1cdb07808f41aa137e918fe268f270f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/244e604b1cdb07808f41aa137e918fe268f270f5/0_300_6144_3686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Students at Cardiff university prote against a planned lecture by Germaine Greer in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Students at Cardiff university prote against a planned lecture by Germaine Greer in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Phillips/Gareth Phillips for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some Jewish critics still maintain that she is antisemitic. Others argue that anti-Zionism is antisemitic. Bouattia maintains that they have misunderstood and misinterpreted her, and are wrong. I think this would be a perfectly defensible position for her to take if only she applied the same principle when student unions invoke the NUS\u2019s no-platform policy. I want to talk to her about Germaine Greer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/18/transgender-activists-protest-germaine-greer-lecture-cardiff-university\" title=\"\">who Cardiff University students\u2019 union demanded be no platformed last year</a>, owing to her views on transsexuals. This is when the argument begins.</p> <p>Most graduates of my age, I say, are appalled by a campus culture that no-platforms a speaker for holding opinions some students might find offensive. If someone cannot bear to be exposed to challenging views at university, what are they doing there? \u201cIt\u2019s a case of seeing those ideas as spreading forms of hatred.\u201d Does she think that Greer spreads hatred? \u201cI support the union\u2019s right to no-platform her. To hold transphobic views spreads hate.\u201d</p> <p>But Greer has repeatedly stated that she does not hate transsexuals, is not critical of their choices, and couldn\u2019t care less if anyone wants to reassign their gender. She simply does not share the belief that a man who decides to live as a woman was female all along, or that surgical procedures can wholly reassign gender.</p> <p>Now a woman sitting at what is known as the liberation desk in the office, who works on campaigns for LGBT, black, female and disabled students, gets involved. What Greer thinks she means is not the point, she says; the trans community consider her a \u201cfascist\u201d, the NUS respects their view, ergo Greer is a fascist.</p> <p>But Bouattia doesn\u2019t accept that just because some Jewish people consider her antisemitic, that means she is. Why, then, does she not accord this principle to anyone else? \u201cThis is the NUS policy,\u201d she repeats. It\u2019s like talking to a speaking clock. I suggest that when a policy ends up branding Greer a fascist, it\u2019s time for an urgent policy review. Universities exist as places where people engage with ideas, and learn; they are not meant to be sealed panic rooms, are they? \u201cThis is the NUS policy.\u201d</p> <p>While I get more and more worked up, Bouattia just smiles placidly. I ask her to call her parents the next day and ask them if they, as senior academics, agree that Greer is too dangerous to be allowed to talk to students. When I email Bouattia later in the week, she doesn\u2019t respond, and the press officer tells me she is out of the country and uncontactable.</p> <p>I get the impression that Bouattia is more fragile than the persona she presents. But perhaps, if one\u2019s own academic parents have been targets for&#xa0;assassination, the concept of safety on campus holds something different to mine.</p>",
  "<p>Greek presidents are not given to speaking off the cuff.

  "<p>Edward Albee, who has died aged 88, has been described as both the first modern American playwright and the last great American playwright after Eugene O\u2019Neill, Tennessee Williams and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/feb/12/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\">Arthur Miller</a>. In reality he was probably neither, although he was undoubtedly a substantial talent, who burst on to a stagnant American theatrical scene with The Zoo Story in 1959 and followed it up three years later with that major masterpiece of marital disharmony, Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</p> <p>Although Albee was to continue writing all his life, and had minor success with plays such as the Pinteresque A Delicate Balance (1966) and All Over (1971), it was not until 1991 that he had a late creative blooming and another theatrical hit with Three Tall Women. Like much of Albee\u2019s best work, Three Tall Women was strongly autobiographical, drawing on his privileged but loveless childhood and memories of his mother, Frances, a domineering, Junoesque beauty who preferred horses to people, and almost anyone to her adopted son.</p> <p>He was born in Washington, to Louise Harvey, and immediately given up for adoption. Aged 18 days, he was handed into the care of Reed and Frances Albee, of Larchmont, New York. Reed was the wealthy, womanising son of the vaudeville theatre-owner and manager Edward Franklin Albee, and Frances (nee Cotter), better known as Frankie, was his third wife. It was rumoured that she had married Reed for his money. A childhood friend of Albee\u2019s was subsequently to remark: \u201cIt\u2019s lucky he was adopted. He would not get much talent from those two.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/sep/16/edward-albee-dies-playwright-whos-afraid-virginia-woolf\">Edward Albee, Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? playwright, dies aged 88</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A dreamy child with a penchant for drawing and music, the young Edward may not have wanted for material wealth, but grew up an observant outsider in his own home, ignored by his monosyllabic father and reviled by his mother. \u201cMy mother and I disliked and mistrusted each other,\u201d said Albee in an interview many years later, recalling that she would frequently tell him: \u201cJust you wait until you are 18, and I\u2019ll have you out of here so fast that it\u2019ll make your head spin.\u201d</p> <p>In fact Albee was 20 before he left home, after an argument. Apart from a chance encounter, he never saw his father again, and he had no further contact with his mother for 20 years, although she was regularly to appear in different guises in his plays: as Mommy in The American Dream (1961), Martha in Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Agnes in A Delicate Balance and, most famously, as Three Tall Women, written shortly after her death in a creative act that Albee likened to an \u201cexorcism\u201d. Mother and son may never have reached rapprochement, let alone anything approaching love, but Frankie was as much a muse for Albee as she was a monster.</p> <p>Albee spent the next 10 years living in and around Greenwich Village, bolstered by the $25 a week interest payments from a trust fund he had inherited from his grandmother, and occasional work as a telegram boy for Western Union. The ordinary people he met while tramping the city, their desperation and loneliness, became the inspiration for The Zoo Story. But he was also moving in artistic circles. By 1952 he was living with, and in the shadow of, the talented young composer William Flanagan.</p> <p>After the success of The Zoo Story, the myth grew up that it was Albee\u2019s very first play, apart from a three-act sex farce written when he was 12 and destroyed by his mother. In reality, between 1949 and 1959, he served an intense apprenticeship, writing at least nine plays as well as short stories and poems. The Zoo Story, about two men sitting on a bench in Central Park, was started a month before his 30th birthday as, Albee was later to claim, a birthday present to himself. He was immediately aware that, for the first time, he had written something \u201cworthwhile\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee64b4f6d953c339c46a2d64c2493d49351c8fc9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee64b4f6d953c339c46a2d64c2493d49351c8fc9/0_234_2622_1574/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in the film of Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, directed by Mike Nichols in 1966\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in the film of Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, directed by Mike Nichols in 1966</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>New York theatre producers took longer to persuade, and The Zoo Story received its world premiere in a German translation at the Schiller theatre in Berlin on 28 September 1959. It was part of a double bill that included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1989/dec/27/poetry.beckettat100\">Samuel Beckett</a>\u2019s Krapp\u2019s Last Tape. It was not until January 1960 that the play had its US premiere, at the Provincetown Playhouse in Greenwich Village. As was to be the case with almost all of Albee\u2019s subsequent work, the reviews were mixed, but the positive ones were enthusiastic enough to turn him from an unknown into a hot young playwright who was being mentioned in the same breath as Beckett and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/ionesco\">Ionesco</a>. America had its first avant-garde playwright in the European mode.</p> <p>The playwright <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/jan/05/john-guare-interview\">John Guare</a> was to subsequently write of \u201cthe debt that every American playwright writing after 1960 owes to Edward Albee\u201d. The British playwright <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/stoppard\">Tom Stoppard</a>, whose early work was strongly absurdist, has said that it was seeing The Zoo Story that made him determined to become a playwright. But the Beckettian undertones of The Zoo Story, the Ionesco-influenced The American Dream, and A Delicate Balance, with its Pinter-like dialogue and sense of menace, left many wondering whether Albee was anything more than a clever imitator hitching a ride on the coattails of the latest theatrical fashion.</p> <p>The tendency to imitate was apparent even in his later work. Reviewing The Play About the Baby, which premiered at the Almeida in 1998, Michael Billington in the Guardian suggested that Albee was self-referring and cannibalising his own work. \u201cThe play is more a treasure trove for Albee scholars and biographers than something of universal concern.\u201d</p> <p>In his 20s, Albee had taken up again and then dropped his childhood hobby of drawing and painting. He was later to remark: \u201cI realised I felt nothing beyond a certain curiosity, and I was making imitations that looked, to my eye, every bit as good as the originals.\u201d This question of authenticity was always to raise itself in critical assessments of Albee\u2019s plays. Although his defenders hailed him as a distinctive theatrical voice and great experimenter who refused to be pigeonholed, his detractors claimed that he remained derivative in form and content. Yet if there was any play that countered that latter view, it was Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? It also provided Albee with his only major commercial success, and gave the lie to the notion that he was incapable of writing a full-length play.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2a526019813e04270643c1bf85f78acbabe44854\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a526019813e04270643c1bf85f78acbabe44854/0_230_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The playwright in 1961.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The playwright in 1961.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The title came from a piece of graffiti that Albee had spotted in a Greenwich Village bar some years previously. Set on the campus of a small American college, it has middle-aged Martha, the daughter of the dean, who is married to George, the assistant professor of history, arriving back home after a party. In tow are the new young biology teacher, Nick, and his wife, Honey. What follows is a bilious and drunken few hours in which Martha and George indulge in game playing and fantasy, wounding both their guests and each other. Martha reveals a son that the pair have invented, a revelation that George tops by \u201ckilling\u201d the imagined boy off. This imaginary or absent son was to become a recurring figure in Albee\u2019s work.</p> <p>His friend <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/arts/mel-gussow-critic-dies-at-71-a-champion-of-playwrights.html\">Mel Gussow</a>, the critic, said that, although Albee was to write many more plays, \u201cVirginia Woolf was the cornerstone of his career: one play feeds all. In it, we can see strands reaching back to The Zoo Story (the act of confession, death as the final relief) and The American Dream (the household as microcosm) and forward to A Delicate Balance (the meaning of friendship and loyalty) and Three Tall Women (the price of parenting, the tricks of memory).\u201d</p> <p>Although it was a commercial success and in 1966 made into a film directed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/nov/20/mike-nichols\">Mike Nichols</a> and starring <a href=\"http://www.richardburton.com/\">Richard Burton</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/23/elizabeth-taylor-obituary\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as George and Martha, Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? had by no means wholly ecstatic reviews. A lack of critical appreciation of his work was something that Albee learned to accept. \u201cI have been both over-praised and under-praised. I assume by the time I finish writing \u2013 and I plan to go on writing until I\u2019m 90 or gaga \u2013 it will equal itself out.\u201d He almost managed it: Me, Myself and I, another play drawing on mother and son relationships, was produced in 2008, when he was 80.</p> <p>But at one point it seemed unlikely that Albee would be writing plays in his later years. After Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, his career went into serious decline and for the next 20 years his ability to write was affected by his love affair with alcohol, which had begun while he was still a child and would be asked to mix cocktails for his parents.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"acbb1a27920f57d2bd89efa55f2f30f698e859ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acbb1a27920f57d2bd89efa55f2f30f698e859ee/8_86_571_342/500.jpg\" alt=\"Deborah Kerr in Seascape, 1975\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deborah Kerr in Seascape, 1975</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tiny Alice, premiered on Broadway in 1964 with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/may/22/news.obituaries\">John Gielgud</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/mar/12/guardianobituaries\">Irene Worth</a>, was greeted with such incomprehension that Albee found himself forced to hold a press conference to explain its meaning. Even the author could not satisfactorily explain the bizarre story of a lay brother who is sent by a superior to the house of a wealthy woman and is enmeshed in a scenario of sexual hysteria, religious ecstasy and martyrdom.</p> <p>A Delicate Balance, described by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,567652,00.html\">Kenneth Tynan</a> as \u201can exquisite fandango of despair\u201d, saw Albee return to the familiar territory of his adoptive parents\u2019 life style. A beautiful play about \u201cwhat happens when we turn our backs upon ourselves\u201d, it was a success and won Albee the Pulitzer prize he had been unjustly denied for Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</p> <p>Although Albee continued to write plays and have them produced, most notably the death-watch drama All Over and his second Pulitzer-winner, Seascape (1975), a play in which two lizards intrude upon a marriage, his reputation was in free fall. Seascape ran for just two months. The disaster of The Man Who Had No Arms, about a man who sprouts a limb and achieves celebrity, only to see it wither as his arm atrophies, which closed on Broadway after just 16 performances in 1983, suggested that it was all over for Albee too.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His strength as a playwright was that he continued to experiment with form and content all his life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He did not need to write plays. Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? had made him a wealthy man, and he was renowned as a discerning collector of 20th-century art. For the next 10 years, the focus of his life shifted from writing plays to teaching and encouraging younger playwrights. He was a committed and generous teacher.</p> <p>After his father\u2019s death in 1961, Albee had resumed some contact with his mother, but the relationship remained difficult, not least because of Frankie\u2019s refusal to acknowledge her son\u2019s homosexuality or his long-term partner, the painter and sculptor <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/06/arts/design/jonathan-thomas-artist-dies-at-59.html\">Jonathan Thomas</a>, who did much to help Albee overcome his dependency on alcohol, and who predeceased him. Her death in 1989 spawned Three Tall Women, a poignant and entirely fictionalised arm\u2019s-length look at Frankie as a 92-year-old, by now bed-ridden and incontinent, who is also glimpsed aged 52 and 26. In 1994 it was awarded a Pulitzer prize.</p> <p>There was another unexpected and late career gift in The Goat, or Who is Sylvia?, seen in New York in 2002 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/feb/04/theatre3\">at the Almeida in London</a> and in the West End in 2004, about a successful architect in an apparently happy marriage who falls in love with a goat and has passionate sex with it. The London production boasted a brilliant central performance from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/jonathan-pryce\">Jonathan Pryce</a> and an early stage appearance from a young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/eddie-redmayne\">Eddie Redmayne</a> as his gay teenage son, in a savagely funny and dark examination of the limits of tolerance and the monsters that lurk beneath the exterior of modern middle-class everyday life. It was every bit as powerful and harrowing as Albee\u2019s masterpiece.</p> <p>If his upbringing ensured that intimacy remained a problem for Albee all his life, with even some of his closest friends referring to him as \u201cmysterious\u201d or \u201cunknowable\u201d, in his best work he was always present and always painfully revealing of his lost childhood and the barren, unhappy lives of his parents and their friends, and the best and worst that lurks in all of us.</p> <p>His strength as a playwright was that he continued to experiment with form and content all his life. A lazier, less passionate playwright might have contented himself with rewriting Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? in different ways, or just quit when the critical reception got rough. Albee may never have been able to summon the emotional openness to match Williams\u2019s honesty, grotesque comedy and lyricism, nor the political commitment to match Miller\u2019s state-of-the-nation acuteness, but he was no also-ran. Rather he was one of the triumvirate who changed and shaped postwar American playwriting. The Zoo Story, A Delicate Balance and Who\u2019s Afraid Of Virginia Woolf? will never want for production; they dissect our desire to hide behind illusion with a devastating and unflinching accuracy.</p> <p>\u2022 Edward Albee, playwright, born 12 March 1928; died 16 September 2016</p>",
  "<p>A US Food and Drug Administration ruling this month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/02/antibacterial-soaps-banned-us-fda\">bans</a> the use of triclosan, triclocarban and 17 other antiseptics from household soaps because they have not been shown to be safe or even have any benefit.</p> <p>About <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/03/science/fda-bans-sale-of-many-antibacterial-soaps-saying-risks-outweigh-benefits.html?_r=0\">40% of soaps</a> use at least one of these chemicals, and the chemicals are also found in toothpaste, baby pacifiers, laundry detergents and clothing. It is in some lip glosses, deodorants and pet shampoos.</p> <p>The current FDA action bans antiseptics like triclosan in <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm517478.htm\">household soaps</a> only. It does not apply to other products like <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm517478.htm\">antiseptic gels</a> designed to be used without water, antibacterial toothpaste or the many fabrics and household utensils in which antibacterials are embedded. Data suggest that the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/01/140109175500.htm\">toothpastes are very effective</a> for people suffering from gum disease, although it is not clear if they provide substantial benefits for those who don\u2019t have gingivitis.</p> <p>The FDA is<a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm517478.htm\"> currently evaluating</a> the use of antibacterials in gels and will rule on how those products should be handled once the data are in.</p> <p>Although antibacterials are still in products all around us, the current ban is a significant step forward in limiting their use.</p> <p>As microbiologists who study a range of chemicals and microbes, we will explain why we don\u2019t we need to kill all the bacteria. We also will explain how antibiotic soaps may even be bad by contributing to antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria that can be dangerous.</p> <p>Bacteria are everywhere in the environment and almost everywhere in our bodies, and that is mostly good.</p> <p>We rely on bacteria in our guts to provide nutrients and to signal to our brains, and some bacteria on our skin help protect us from harmful pathogens.</p> <p>Some bacteria present in soil and animal waste can cause infections if they are ingested, however, and washing is important to prevent bacteria from spreading to places where they can cause harm.</p> <p>Washing properly with soap and water removes these potential pathogens.</p> <p>If soap and water are sufficient, why were antibacterials like triclosan and triclocarban added in the first place?</p> <p>Triclosan was introduced in 1972. These chemicals were originally used for cleaning solutions, such as before and during surgeries, where removing bacteria is critical and exposure for most people is short. Triclosan and triclocarban may be beneficial in these settings, and the FDA ruling does not affect healthcare or first aid uses of the chemicals.</p> <p>In the 1990s, manufacturers started to incorporate triclosan and triclocarban in products for the average consumer, and many people were attracted by claims that these products killed more bacteria.</p> <p>Now antibacterial chemicals can be found in many household products, from baby toys to fabrics to soaps. Laboratory tests show the addition of these <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4295542/\">chemicals can reduce </a>the number of bacteria in some situations. However, studies in a range of environments, including urban areas in the United States and squatter settlements in Pakistan, have shown that the inclusion of antibacterials in soap <a href=\"http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/45/Supplement_2/S137.long\">does not reduce the spread of infectious disease</a>. Because the goal of washing is human health, these data indicate that antibacterials in consumer soaps do not provide any benefit.</p> <p>What\u2019s the downside to having antibacterials in soap? It is potentially huge, both for those using it and for society as a whole. One concern is whether the antibacterials can directly harm humans.</p> <p>Triclosan had become so prevalent in household products that in 2003 a nationwide survey of healthy individuals found it in the urine of <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2265044/\">75% </a>of the 2,517 people tested. Triclosan has also been found in <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17007908\">human plasma and breast milk</a>.</p> <p>Most studies have not shown <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20562219\">any direct toxicity</a> from triclosan, but some animal studies indicate that <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20562219\">triclosan can disrupt</a> hormone systems. We do not know yet whether triclosan affects hormones in humans.</p> <p>Another serious concern is the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16922622\">effect of triclosan on antibiotic resistance</a> in bacteria. Bacteria evolve resistance to nearly every threat they face, and triclosan is no exception.</p> <p>Triclosan isn\u2019t used to treat disease, so why does it matter if some bacteria become resistant? Some of the common mechanisms that bacteria use to evade triclosan also let them evade antibiotics that are needed to treat disease. When triclosan is present in the environment, bacteria that have these resistance mechanisms grow better than bacteria that are still susceptible, so the number of resistant bacteria increases.</p> <p>Not only are bacteria adaptable, they are also promiscuous. Genes that let them survive antibiotic treatment are often found on pieces of DNA that can be passed from one bacterium to another, spreading resistance.</p> <p>These mobile pieces of DNA frequently have several different resistance genes, making the bacteria that contain them resistant to many different drugs. Bacteria that are resistant to triclosan are more likely to also be resistant to unrelated antibiotics, suggesting that the prevalence of<a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/antibiotic_resistance.htm\"> triclosan can spread multi-drug</a> resistance. As resistance spreads, we will not be able to kill as many pathogens with existing drugs.</p> <p>Antibiotics were introduced in the 1940s and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2013-09-18/life-without-antibiotics-would-be-nasty-brutish-and-short-er-\">revolutionized</a> the way we lead our lives. Common infections and minor scrapes that could be fatal became easily treatable. Surgeries that were once unthinkable due to the risk of infection are now routine.</p> <p>However, bacteria are <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/antibiotic-resistance-doesnt-just-make-bacteria-harder-to-kill-it-can-actually-make-them-stronger-45074\">becoming stronger</a> due to decades of antibiotic use and misuse. New drugs will help, but if we do not protect the antibiotics we have now more people will die from infections that used to be easily treated. Removing triclosan from consumer products will help protect antibiotics and limit the threat of toxicity from extended exposure, without any adverse effect on human health.</p> <p>The FDA ruling is a welcome first step to cleansing the environment of chemicals that provide little health value to most people but pose significant risk to individuals and to public health. To a large extent, this ruling is a victory of science over advertising.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Counter\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/65297/count.gif&quot; alt=&quot;The Conversation&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><em>This article originally appeared on <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us\">The Conversation</a></em></p>",

  "<p>Pauline Cafferkey, the Scottish nurse who nearly died twice from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola\">Ebola</a>, has said government health watchdogs were entirely responsible for the \u201ccatalogue of errors\u201d that led to her being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/18/pauline-cafferkey-ebola-nurse-accused-concealing-high-temperature\">accused of putting the public at risk</a>.</p> <p>Just days after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/ebola-nurse-pauline-cafferkey-not-guilty-of-misconduct\">she was cleared of bringing the nursing profession into disrepute</a>, she said the screening for potential Ebola infection at Heathrow airport was chaotic. Officials manning the special screening room could not cope with the numbers of NHS volunteers returning from lifesaving work in Sierra Leone and ran out of kits.</p> <p>Public Health England breached its own rules when it allowed returning medics to take each other\u2019s temperature, she said. When she alerted them to her elevated temperature, Cafferkey was unable to contact the infectious disease expert on call because it had the wrong number.</p> <p>\u201cI went out there to help save lives but I came back to a system that failed. I was made a scapegoat for a catalogue of errors. PHE were entirely responsible,\u201d she told <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3794514/Ebola-nurse-s-fury-blasts-health-watchdog-accused-hiding-deadly-infection-claims-ones-UK-risk.html\">the Mail on Sunday</a>. \u201cThey \u2013 not me \u2013 put public lives at risk by allowing me to fly [back to Scotland] before they had an opinion from an infectious diseases official,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Cafferkey contracted Ebola while working as an NHS volunteer in a Save the Children hospital built by the British government at the height of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jul/28/ebola-outbreak-africa-key-questions\">Ebola epidemic</a> that swept through three west African countries in 2014. She was accused of covering up her early symptoms by concealing her elevated temperature by taking paracetamol when she landed at Heathrow.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/18/ebola-escalation-could-have-been-avoided-world-bank-president-jim-young-kim-pandemic-financing-facility\">Escalation of Ebola crisis could have been avoided, says World Bank president</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking freely for the first time since the investigation and professional conduct hearing concluded, Cafferkey hit back at her accusers and said she had been \u201chung out to dry\u201d as part of an attempt to conceal their mistakes. \u201cIt\u2019s been awful being thought of as dishonest. It\u2019s like my reputation has been destroyed even though I knew I had done nothing wrong,\u201d the nurse said.</p> <p>She said she was feeling fine at Heathrow but the screening system could not cope with the arrival of 50 medics returning home from Sierra Leone. \u201cI would like to say something positive about the screening unit, but I can\u2019t. They were not prepared. There weren\u2019t enough screening kits. It was hot, busy and disorganised.\u201d</p> <p>Cafferkey and a group of others were told they could take each other\u2019s temperatures in a side room, in a breach of PHE rules. A doctor in her group found her temperature to be above the normal 37C (98.6F) \u2013 at 38.2C and then 38.3C.</p> <p>She said she was shocked because she was feeling fine and then took the paracetamol from her bag without thinking. \u201cI told everyone when I returned to the screening unit that I\u2019d taken paracetamol, which is why I was stunned to find later I was accused of trying to conceal the fact. I was also aware there were attempts to reach infectious disease specialists but it turned out the staff had the wrong number, so didn\u2019t get through,\u201d Cafferkey said.</p> <p>She was told she was free to take her connecting flight to Glasgow but the following day she was admitted to hospital with suspected Ebola.</p> <p>The virus takes up to 21 days to incubate and can kill within five days, but it is not infectious until a patient becomes symptomatic. Early symptoms include high temperature and a fever.</p> <p>Last week Cafferkey was cleared of all wrongdoing by the <a href=\"https://www.nmc.org.uk/news/news-and-updates/nmc-statement-on-the-outcome-of-nurse-pauline-cafferkeys-fitness-to-practise-hearing/\">Nursing and Midwifery Council</a>, but critics have questioned why she was ever brought before the panel when it transpired there was no case to answer.</p> <p>\u201cI should have been sent to the infectious diseases unit from Heathrow \u2013 not allowed to get in a plane to Glasgow. The minute they let me fly they put the health of the public at risk,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She spent a month fighting for her life in a special unit in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/23/ebola-nurse-pauline-cafferkey-returns-to-hospital\">Royal Free hospital</a> in London before being discharged, apparently free of Ebola. Nine months later she relapsed as the virus had not cleared from her nervous system and she was back at the Royal Free with meningitis triggered by the virus.</p> <p>Prof Paul Cosford, director of health protection and medical director at PHE, said: \u201cThere is an agreed version of facts between the NMC and Pauline Cafferkey and her representatives and this description goes beyond these. PHE screened thousands of returners from countries most at risk of Ebola and did so with efficiency and courtesy throughout. We have nothing further to add.\u201d</p>",

Activists claim that Obama has been too slow to respond to the gathering storm, even after recently achieving his target of accepting 10,000 refugees from Syria in the last fiscal year.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that is enough because the Syrian people are suffering the crisis,\u201d Acuoth said. \u201cI think they should take more because I was a former refugee and I know how that felt. The Syrian people who don\u2019t have a country to go to deserve our support as an international community to give them refuge.\u201d</p> <p>Most of the 3,000 refugees who came from Sudan to the US as \u201clost boys\u201d have made successful lives in government, business and academia, he added. \u201cWhen I was a refugee, what it meant was that I didn\u2019t know that I had any other life. I thought I would just live in a camp forever. But then, when I had the opportunity to come here, I saw I value in my life and what it means to be somebody.\u201d</p> <p>But some of them never made it, because the 9/11 terrorist attacks led to US borders being virtually closed to refugees. </p> <p>The door has slowly edged open again in recent years. In the 12 months ending 30 September, the goal was 85,000, and in each of the three years prior, the target was 70,000. </p> <p>Campaigners say much more is necessary to come to grips with the 20 million refugees worldwide. But fears of terrorism bring political risk, notably after the attack in San Bernardino, California, and incidents in Europe connected to people who had spent time in Syria. Republican governors have sought to keep refugees out of their states while the party\u2019s presidential nominee, Donald Trump, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-syria-refugees-us-immigration-security-terrorism\">threatened to slam the door shut again</a>.</p> <p>Ibrahim al-Assil, president and cofounder of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SyrainNonviolence\">Syrian Nonviolence Movement</a>, argued that the US had a special responsibility after its failure to intervene in Syria, notably when Obama did not follow through on warning that the regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons would cross a \u201cred line\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9495b76ee690f6013439d6660e311022f35f591\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9495b76ee690f6013439d6660e311022f35f591/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama addresses the UN general assembly last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama addresses the UN general assembly last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/stateless-not-silenced-conversation-refugees-refugees\">Speaking at the Wilson Center thinktank</a> in Washington, Assil said: \u201cOf course, the number that is being admitted to the US is very, very low, extremely low. The US on the political level committed some mistakes at least when they put the red line and then they didn\u2019t enforce that red line. So I think they should share that responsibility and they should admit more Syrians as refugees to the United States.\u201d</p> <p>Even when refugees get on American soil, they face a lengthy wait to be cleared for asylum. Assil said he himself has cofounded a civil society group, cofounded a business and gained a job at a thinktank but is still in legal limbo, waiting on an asylum application filed in 2014. \u201cSo imagine how difficult it is for other people as well.\u201d</p> <p>Officials have said potential refugees are subject to a rigorous screening process that typically lasts two years and involves both in-person interviews and further vetting by the state department, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, the defense department and US Citizenship and Immigration Services and an examination of biographical and biometric data.</p> <p>Rouba Mhaissen, founder and director of the refugee initiative <a href=\"http://www.sdaid.org/about-us\">Sawa for Development and Aid</a>, said: \u201cWhen you hear \u2018110,000 to be admitted\u2019, this is amazing news, but between the moment this decision is taken and the moment these people arrive in the US, it can take up to two years.\u201d</p> <p>The US is the world\u2019s biggest donor to refugee programmes and provides a third of the budget for the UN high commissioner for refugees. But politicians in Europe, where some 1 million people arrived last year, have expressed concern that Washington does not appreciate the scale of the crisis.</p> <p>Of the 110,000 that the US will admit in the coming year, 40,000 will come from the Middle East and South Asia. An additional 35,000 will come from Africa, 12,000 from east Asia, 4,000 from Europe and 5,000 from Latin America and the Caribbean. Some 14,000 slots do not have a refugee\u2019s place of origin specified.</p> <p>Mark Hetfield, president of <a href=\"http://www.hias.org/\">Hias</a>, which was created in New York in 1881 and is the oldest refugee agency in the world, said: \u201cWe were pleasantly surprised at the number increase but it\u2019s not nearly enough given what we should be doing or what we have done in the past. We have ceded leadership on this issue to other countries.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/15/fear-forces-refugees-dadaab-kenya-worlds-largest-camp-return-conflict-zones-human-rights-watch-warns\">Fear forces refugees in world\u2019s largest camp to return to conflict zones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The system has become dominated by security apparatus and agencies, crippling the process and crying out for leadership from the White House, he added. </p> <p>In Canada, by contrast, prime minister Justin Trudeau <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/12/world/americas/syria-refugees-arrive-in-canada.html\">has welcomed new arrivals at the airport</a> with the words, \u201cYou\u2019re safe at home now.\u201d If the US matched Canada\u2019s intake of refugeees in proportion to its population, the annual figure would be 250,000.</p> <p>Hetfield said: \u201cI think the president has been very reactive and not paid attention to refugee policy until this year. If Obama had done four years ago what he is doing now, I think we would be in a much better place to respond to refugees. But now he\u2019s very limited in what he can do.\u201d</p> <p>Washington also has been condemned for its passive approach to people fleeing a surge in violence in Central America. It announced last month that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/26/central-american-refugees-costa-rica-obama-administration\">Costa Rica would offer temporary protection</a> to Central American refugees, as American efforts had been overwhelmed since 2012 by a fivefold growth of people leaving Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.</p> <p>The White House has defended its actions. Josh Earnest, its press secretary, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/08/29/press-briefing-press-secretary-josh-earnest-deputy-nsa-strategic\">told a recent briefing</a>: \u201cThe United States has already stepped up to the plate and played an important leading role in the response, both in terms of providing more humanitarian assistance than any other country in the world, and we certainly are playing an important role here in accepting refugees from that conflict. The United States is obviously in a different place, literally, than countries in Europe. The United States is separated by a large ocean when it comes to these refugees.</p> <p>\u201cSo the situation that we face is different when it comes to this set of refugees. And the president does believe it\u2019s important for the United States to do our part. That\u2019s why we increased our ambition and admitted 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year. But I think the president certainly would like to see the United States continue to ramp up our commitment.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Leading Conservative Eurosceptics have formed a new lobby group to push for a hard Brexit, including leaving the European single market and ending free movement.</p> <p>The campaign, Leave Means Leave, could provoke fresh unrest on the Tory backbenches for Theresa May, pushing her government to take a no compromise approach to negotiations with the EU.</p> <p>Leading Tory MPs form the political advisory board, including those pushed out of government by the prime minister such as the former justice minister Dominic Raab. Others include the former environment secretary Owen Paterson, Sir Gerald Howarth, the former defence minister, and the outspoken Eurosceptic Peter Bone.</p> <p>The property tycoon Richard Tice will chair the group, which has set up headquarters in Westminster. In a report published on Sunday it says Britain must \u201cleave the world\u2019s least successful economic zone \u2013 the single market\u201d.</p> <p>The group recommends that if no deal can be done the UK should leave the EU without a trade deal and rely on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules while free trade deals are negotiated with other countries.</p> <p>The Labour donor John Mills, who spearheaded the Labour Leave campaign, is listed as a supporter of the group.<br></p> <p>Tice said: \u201cOn 23 June  the British people made it clear that they wanted to leave the EU. There should be no compromise on this. The sooner we leave the more certainty and confidence for everyone. It should be a maximum of two years post serving article 50.</p> <p> \u201cNon-EU countries will know when we can sign trade deals and the EU will know we are serious. Also consumers and businesses can draw confidence that we are a globally focused strong economy. Let\u2019s be clear: no deal is better than a bad deal.\u201d </p> <p>In its launch report, the group says remaining in the single market is the \u201c\u2018no say, low growth, regulatory burden, sovereignty illusion\u2019 option locking in perpetual trade deficits\u201d.</p> <p>The report warns that remaining in the single market \u201cwill continue to pull our political and economic focus towards the world\u2019s least successful economic zone while tying us down with needless and expensive regulation for all businesses, even if they do not export\u201d.</p> <p> May has so far refused to reveal the government\u2019s position on remaining in the single market, though the Brexit secretary, David Davis, told the House of Commons last week it was a \u201csimple truth is that if a requirement of membership is giving up control of our borders, I think that makes it very improbable\u201d.</p> <p>A senior Downing Street official sought to distance May from the statement, saying: \u201cHe is setting out his view that [single market membership] is improbable.\u201d</p> <p>WTO rules would mean high tariffs on key British exports, including a 10% tariff on car exports, 12% on clothing and 40% on lamb.</p> <p>The former education secretary Nicky Morgan said the rise of campaign groups such as Leave Means Leave was a result of a lack of information provided by ministers on the particulars of a Brexit deal.<br><br>Appearing on ITV\u2019s Peston on Sunday show, Morgan criticised the \u201ctightly controlled\u201d messaging coming out of Downing Street.<br><br>\u201cIt is time to flesh out some of the issues, especially Brexit,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cIf you leave a vacuum, other people will fill it. The time is now to say this is what we want to get out of Brexit.\u201d<br></p> <p>The Tory MP Anna Soubry, speaking on behalf of Open Britain, the successor to Stronger In, said the leave campaigners who wanted to exit the EU without a trade deal were \u201cthe biggest threat our economy faces\u201d.</p> <p> \u201cThis would mean new tariffs on nine out of 10 goods we sell to the EU, including 10% on cars,\u201d she said. \u201cThis would decimate our national industries and cost jobs. Working people will hope No 10 rejects this approach and instead seeks membership of the single market, which is vital for jobs and growth.\u201d</p> <p>The Ukip donor Arron Banks is expected to launch a grassroots pressure group to push for a hard Brexit, inspired by Momentum, the Labour-supporting movement that backs Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. </p> <p>Nigel Farage, the former leader of Ukip, said Momentum was a key inspiration. \u201cI think that is exactly what Arron Banks is going to do,\u201d he told BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr show. \u201cHe built this movement, Leave.EU, which has a million online supporters. That\u2019s exactly what he intends to do. </p> <p>\u201cThere are some big examples of this \u2013 the Five Star movement in Italy is a completely online political party and it\u2019s now at 30% in the polls. There is a new kind of politics out there that could be very effective.\u201d</p> <p>Farage hinted he saw his future in grassroots organising and in his remaining tenure as an MEP rather than \u201cmeddling\u201d with the party\u2019s new leadership. \u201cI am going to go on as an MEP, I lead a group at the European parliament so I am going to go on with my helpful contributions there,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cBut we have a new leader, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/ukip-elects-diane-james-as-new-party-leader\">Diane James</a>, and I\u2019m going to let her get on with it.

  "<p>Adam Smith is blunt and to the point when I call him to suggest an interview. I want to talk to him about the Real Junk Food Project, which he founded, and suggest doing it at the cafe he set up in Leeds which uses waste food and operates on a pay-as-you-feel basis. \u201cWhich cafe? There are 30 of them. And that\u2019s just in Leeds.\u201d</p> <p>Bluntness may well be Smith\u2019s defining characteristic. A chef by training, who had, by his own admission, a troubled childhood, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcwCt_8pXb4&amp;index=7&amp;list=PLsRNoUx8w3rOiW1BA3J6zAeo9JhOO6E_s\">he set up the project only three years ago</a>, and it\u2019s been a roller-coaster ride since then. He reels off some statistics. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a 6,000-square-foot warehouse just here in Leeds and we\u2019re intercepting between two and 10 tons of food a day. It\u2019s just gone crazy. There are 125 Real Junk Food cafes worldwide now, not just in Britain, but in Israel and Australia and we\u2019re about to launch 16 of them in America.\u201d</p> <p>And, no, he doesn\u2019t have time to do an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s really not about me,\u201d he says. \u201cI haven\u2019t even met half the people who\u2019ve set up the cafes. It\u2019s much bigger than me now.\u201d It is pretty big, it\u2019s true, but I go up to Leeds anyway and, in the warehouse, it becomes more obvious why the project has taken off so dramatically. There\u2019s a mountain of food. Marks &amp; Spencer cakes and Ferrero Rocher chocolates and punnets of grapes and tomatoes and posh crisps and jars of olives and out-of-date bottles of that well-known easily perishable food substance \u2013 water \u2013 and down one aisle, dozens of clear plastic bin liners all filled with bread.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the bane of our lives, bread,\u201d says Keith Annal, the operations manager. \u201cThe supermarkets make so much of it. And then they chuck out so much of it.\u201d</p> <p>There are rolls and baguettes and bagels and croissants. There\u2019s poppy seed bread and granary bread and ciabatta and sliced white. They try to give away as much of it as they can but it\u2019s a challenge. Annal points to the van outside. \u201cI\u2019ve filled that twice already today. I got 22 boxes of fruit and veg from Morrisons \u2013 that\u2019s just three days\u2019 waste from one supermarket.\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019s all perfectly good food, which if they hadn\u2019t rescued it would now be rotting at the bottom of the bin. \u201cLook at those bananas,\u201d says Annal. \u201cNothing wrong with them.\u201d But then there doesn\u2019t seem to be much wrong with any of it, apart from the fact that it\u2019s packaged, and everything in a package has either a \u201cuse by\u201d or a \u201cbest before\u201d date.</p> <p>It\u2019s certainly eye-opening seeing how much is coming out of a handful of supermarkets in one mid-sized British city. Leeds is just the start. The beginning, Smith hopes, of a global movement: to end food waste. Because, at the moment, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/22/uk-tops-chart-of-eu-food-waste\">we throw away 15 million tonnes of food a year</a>, more than any other country in the EU, even those, like Germany, which have a bigger population than us.</p> <p>Smith\u2019s response has been to invent the concept of a Real Junk Food cafe. Send off for a welcome pack, sign an agreement and then feed people waste food. The only rules are that you must feed everyone, not just poor people, and customers should only pay what they feel the meal is worth. If they have no money, they can volunteer labour and skills instead. Because the project has done deals with certain supermarket chains \u2013 Sainsbury, Morrisons, Ocado \u2013 at a national level, the food is there, ready for the taking.</p> <p>At the back of the warehouse scanning the shelves for produce is Duncan Milwain. He\u2019s the partner in a law firm but got involved when he received an email from Smith asking for legal help setting up the company. He did that but then found himself being drawn in. \u201cWhen I began to see the volume of waste coming in, I just thought it was obvious that something had to be done.\u201d</p> <p>Two years ago, Milwain gave up a day a week at his job and opened the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/apr/18/cafe-pay-what-you-want-intercepted-ingredients\">Saltaire Canteen</a>, a Real Junk Food cafe in the upmarket town of Saltaire, a world heritage site and home to one of the largest collections of David Hockneys in the world. \u201cSome people were convinced we should be feeding the poor, not serving cake in the posh part of town, but it\u2019s about food waste, not poverty per se.\u201d</p> <p>Though there is poverty too. I hop in the van with Annal and boxes of cakes and bags of potatoes and loaves of bread and head off to Parklands Primary School in Seacroft. It\u2019s one of the most deprived parts of Leeds and it\u2019s been one of the first schools to sign up to a new initiative the Real Junk Food Project is pioneering called Fuel for School.</p> <p>First, there\u2019s what the headteacher, Chris Dyson, calls \u201cFunday Friday!\u201d, or a lively assembly involving karaoke-ing along to Take That and a fiendishly difficult times table competition. There are stars and certificates for the children and then, at the end, they and their families file out and there are five tables laden with food, free for anyone to take, in exchange for a small donation if they have it and nothing if they don\u2019t. It has the rather grand title of a \u201cfood boutique\u201d but it\u2019s making use of food that would otherwise go in the bin.</p> <p>\u201cWe love it,\u201d says Dyson. \u201cSome parents were a bit proud at first but now they\u2019re piling in. We never shut. We come in, in the holidays, to do this. There are families for whom it\u2019s a continuous struggle. They get access to food banks but that\u2019s only three times a year. It\u2019s brilliant to be able to provide a bit extra.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"354d250b661c9feed7c40016fc19e4388c0f541e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/354d250b661c9feed7c40016fc19e4388c0f541e/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pupils from Richmond Hill Primary School, Leeds, with their headmaster Nathan Atkinson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pupils from Richmond Hill Primary School, Leeds, with their headmaster Nathan Atkinson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Floyd/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Richmond Hill Primary, in another deprived bit of Leeds, is just a few miles away. Its head, Nathan Atkinson, took over in 2014 and, while he says it\u2019s \u201can amazing place\u201d with pupils speaking 48 languages, nothing he tried seemed to be working. I\u2019ve followed him from Seacroft, where he took part in the assembly, to Wigan, where he\u2019s speaking to a room full of headteachers. \u201cI\u2019d been in vulnerable schools, schools in special measures,\u201d he tells them, \u201cbut when we tried the same things here, they didn\u2019t work. We had good teachers, a good curriculum, but we realised the children weren\u2019t in a place where they were ready to learn.</p> <p>\u201cIt came to a head after one half-term, their behaviour was just atrocious, and we realised some of them hadn\u2019t had a hot meal in a week.\u201d The first thing he did was to buy toasters for every classroom, \u201cbut then I needed food. I\u2019d met Adam by chance and I said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you open a junk food cafe in the school?\u2019 He was like, \u2018No thanks. But you can do it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Richmond Hill, he explains, is a \u201cfood desert\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s impossible to buy fresh fruit and veg in the postcode. But half a mile away, it turned out was one of Leeds biggest wholesalers. \u201cWe jumped in the school minibus and straightaway they gave us 27 boxes of bananas and ten boxes of cucumbers.\u201d</p> <p>The school now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/15/hungry-pupils-breakfast-teachers-survey\">provides breakfast</a> every day to 650 pupils, has its own cafe and a weekly \u201cfood boutique\u201d. It has improved punctuality and attendance and helped build bonds between the parents and the school, he says. To showcase what was possible, he and the Real Junk Food Project fed 10,000 children across Leeds on one day last autumn, entirely with waste food. \u201cWe want to make food available to children,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s so simple. Yet it\u2019s tragic that we have to do this.\u201d</p> <p>The teachers in the room nod their heads thoughtfully. They\u2019ve been invited by Ann Fairhurst and Shirley Southworth, who\u2019d heard of Smith\u2019s success and decided to set up their own Real Junk Food cafe in Wigan. It\u2019s called Fur Clemt \u2013 Wigan-ish for \u201cI\u2019m starving\u201d \u2013 and when a friend of theirs told them about children going into school hungry, they decided to set up a Fuel for School too.</p> <p>They\u2019re another incredibly dynamic duo. They both have full-time jobs but set up the cafe in a community centre owned by the Wigan Warriors rugby league team and have become expert at sourcing fresh food from suppliers in the local area. The Real Junk Food Project has been supportive, but they\u2019ve largely done it themselves. As have Save the Date in Dalston, east London, Curb Kitchen in Southampton, the Trash Cafe Network in Gosport \u2026 the list goes on.</p> <p>In one afternoon, I\u2019ve met half a dozen inspiring people who have taken Smith\u2019s idea and run with it. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to know what drives people but for some reason a mountain of perfectly good food that\u2019s destined to end up rotting seems to have done the trick.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47e69f5761879b50cbec426a158a9269707b79e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47e69f5761879b50cbec426a158a9269707b79e4/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Customers at the Saltaire Canteen, Saltaire, Yorkshire, one of the many Real Junk Food cafes nationwide.

It\u2019s a handsome Victorian model village and the cafe has big plate glass windows, discreet branding in shades of grey, scrubbed pine tables and a small notice explaining the pay-as-you-feel concept. I\u2019ve just missed lunch but I chat to Katie and Michael Tonks from Sheffield who are polishing off their croque monsieur, salad and what they describe as \u201cposh chips\u201d.</p> <p>How was it? \u201cDelicious. I\u2019m impressed. I\u2019m always getting confused by the difference between \u2018use by\u2019 dates and \u2018best before\u2019 and I sometimes worry if I\u2019ve got something in the fridge that\u2019s a few days out of date.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m here because, after a month or so of phone calls, texts and emails, I\u2019ve finally pinned down Smith. He turns up with his young son, Joshua, and the words that no interviewer who\u2019s travelled 200 miles wants to hear, \u201cI\u2019ve only got 15 minutes.\u201d He softens up when we actually start talking but it\u2019s calling a spade a spade that has probably got him as far as he has. There\u2019s no doubting his anger for what he considers \u201ccriminal levels of waste\u201d and, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2014/mar/27/cafe-food-past-sell-by-date-video\">though it was a video on the <em>Guardian</em> website</a> that gave the Real Junk Food Project its first proper blast of publicity, he\u2019s reluctant to do anything that might be construed as courting the press. He declined to be photographed for this piece.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s just so much going on. I\u2019m totally overwhelmed. I said right from the beginning that I wanted to feed the world and I haven\u2019t even started yet. We\u2019ve fed nearly half a million people in 30 months but there\u2019s so much more we can do.\u201d But the pace of growth has been exhausting. \u201cI\u2019ve just got off the phone with people in the South Korean government, because we\u2019re launching there. I get emails all the time from all over the world. Yesterday, in the space of about three minutes, we had emails from Indonesia, Spain, Canada, and Loughborough. It\u2019s non-stop.\u201d</p> <p>Why has it captured people\u2019s imaginations?</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing complex about it. It makes sense. It\u2019s sustainable. And it\u2019s the right thing to do. I think that\u2019s why people get inspired. It\u2019s something they can do. If some kid from Leeds can do it, they can. I\u2019ve been in prison, I was in care, I\u2019ve been in mental health homes. I was on drugs and alcohol. I was found nearly dead in a car from a suicide attempt.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about empowering people to change their own lives and when you do that, that\u2019s when a movement happens, and in the space of two years we\u2019ve had thousands of people around the world standing up and doing stuff.\u201d</p> <p>The idea came to him while he was working as a chef in Australia. He\u2019d worked his way up to head chef, on a big salary, in Melbourne, working all hours. And then, to extend his visa, he\u2019d gone to work for a few months on a farm. \u201cIt was February 27, 2013 and I\u2019d just seen the farmer get a delivery of a tonne of courgettes, freshly picked, that he was feeding to his pigs. I said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you just give this to charity?\u2019 And he said, \u2018I just don\u2019t have the cost and logistics to get it where it needs to go.\u2019 That\u2019s when it came to me.\u201d</p> <p>He returned to the UK, set up the first cafe in Armley, Leeds, often going skip-diving outside supermarkets to get ingredients, and for the first two and a half years, during which time his son was born, he didn\u2019t even take a wage. He was living off \u00a392-a-week tax credits. And, though he\u2019s persuaded many of the supermarkets to work with him, he\u2019s still angry about what he sees them doing: the waste that seems to be built into the system.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sick to death of the media and supermarkets who say it\u2019s all to do with consumers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/18/tesco-supermarket-food-waste\">It\u2019s nothing to do with them</a>. We didn\u2019t want this saturation of supermarkets on our high street selling food 24 hours day, manipulating us into purchasing more.\u201d</p> <p>France has recently introduced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/04/french-law-forbids-food-waste-by-supermarkets\">a law that bans supermarkets</a> from destroying unsold food. They have to give it to charity, or face a fine. It\u2019s a prime example of the kind of thing Smith believes ought to be introduced here but is bound up in exasperating bureaucracy.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fed up being invited to Westminster and wasting my time with people who are creating targets for 20 years\u2019 time. It needs to happen now, on a local level. I think a lot of it is about grassroots education. There\u2019s a huge demographic of people who are completely uneducated about food.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Joshua has picked up an old-looking satsuma from the window display and put it in his mouth. There\u2019s no \u2018Joshua! Joshua! Put it down,\u2019 from Smith though. \u201cAre you going to eat the skin as well?\u201d he asks him. Joshua starts eating the skin. \u201cOK, well, your choice. Let\u2019s see how you get on with that. You won\u2019t do it again if you don\u2019t like it, will you?\u201d People are so fearful of food, he says. \u201cEighty people died from food poisoning last year, whereas 75 were hit by lightning. We\u2019ve probably got the safest food ever. It\u2019s about getting people to understand food.\u201d</p> <p>Then, to Joshua, \u201cHave you finished that?\u201d He has, skin and all. He\u2019s gnawing on a rock-hard stale loaf instead.

For the raped, tortured and starved women lucky enough to get out of Habr\u00e9\u2019s secret jails alive, the guards had a very effective way of ensuring their silence: they threatened to bring them back.</p> <p>Zidane hid what Habr\u00e9 had done to her from her family, her friends, even her lawyers as they prepared for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/30/chad-hissene-habre-guilty-crimes-against-humanity-senegal\">trial of the former president for crimes against humanity</a> in Senegal.</p> <p>She was terrified of Habr\u00e9\u2019s long arm, even 25 years after he had fled the country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/31/the-guardian-view-on-the-conviction-of-hissene-habre-africa-points-the-way\">The Guardian view on the conviction of Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9: Africa points the way | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cNobody could guarantee my security,\u201d she says, wrapped in a red shawl, sitting on a mat in the best room of her home in Chad\u2019s capital, N\u2019Djamena. \u201cFrom the very beginning, I said I\u2019d only tell my story when I was face to face with Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9. Then I\u2019ll have a story to tell, I said.\u201d</p> <p>The story Zidane held back for so long was crucial. Because of her testimony, Habr\u00e9 became the first head of state to be personally convicted of rape.</p> <p>The dictator was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/30/chad-hissene-habre-guilty-crimes-against-humanity-senegal\">convicted in May of crimes against humanity</a> and other crimes at a special court set up by the African Union and the government of Senegal, where he had been living for 22 years in exile. <a href=\"http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/Chad-Report.pdf\">A Chadian commission of inquiry</a> showed that 40,000 people were killed and 54,000 imprisoned during his eight-year rule.</p> <p>Habr\u00e9 almost got away with rape and sexual slavery, though. The charges were not even listed on the original charge sheet. Until they were sure the much-delayed trial was really happening, victims of sexual crimes kept quiet.</p> <p>\u201cHiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 jailed me, jailed my mother, jailed my brother, killed my mother and brother, and tortured me \u2013 and the scars are all over my body. And then, on top of that, he raped me four times. Four times,\u201d says Zidane.</p> <p>She still lives in the compound where she was arrested, along with her extended family.</p> <p>\u201cAs soon as I saw Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 and our eyes met, everything he did to me came back. I just started telling it. Allah is my witness, even now when I think about it, my heart breaks. Even as I talk to you, the images of what he did to me come back.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018They pushed me to the floor\u2019</h2> <p>Zidane\u2019s family are Chadians of Libyan origin. When she was arrested, she was told her brother had joined the Libyan air force and attacked Chad. Habr\u00e9\u2019s secret police took her to a room in the presidency with a hole in the ceiling, and said her brother had been imprisoned there and had escaped. They wanted to know how he\u2019d done it.</p> <p>When she said she had heard nothing from her brother for a long time, they didn\u2019t believe her.</p> <p>\u201cThey pushed me on to the floor and forced a pipe into my mouth. They started pumping water into me. They put a tyre on my stomach and pressed down. That was the first time. As I told them in Dakar, Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 did unspeakable things to me. He would torture me before he raped me.\u201d</p> <p>This water torture was one of many techniques used by the Directorate of Documentation and Security (DDS), Habr\u00e9\u2019s notorious secret police. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97be4ba3fa8d679bdb6c8f1be1a966a8cf803f27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97be4ba3fa8d679bdb6c8f1be1a966a8cf803f27/0_196_4608_2765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Khadidja Zidane\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Khadidja Zidane: Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 oversaw her torture, and raped her four times.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ruth Maclean/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>\u201cMy whole body is marked \u2013 look,\u201d she says, showing where she had been electrocuted under her arms. \u201cLook,\u201d taking off her headscarf and exposing her neck, \u201cthey strangled me with a rope.

Someone who disrespects you like that.\u201d</p> <p>On his website, Habr\u00e9 called Zidane a \u201cnymphomaniac prostitute\u201d after hearing her testimony.</p> <p>However, the <a href=\"http://www.chambresafricaines.org/\">extraordinary African chambers</a> \u2013 the tribunal set up to try Habr\u00e9 \u2013 changed the charges at the last minute and convicted Habr\u00e9 of rape, based on her account. </p> <p>The verdict sets a precedent. It represents \u201ca huge brick in the wall that establishes sexual violence as international crimes\u201d, says Kim Thuy Seelinger, director of the sexual violence programme at Berkeley Law\u2019s Human Rights Centre in the US. It builds on the tribunals in <a href=\"http://unictr.unmict.org/\">Rwanda</a> and <a href=\"http://www.icty.org/\">Yugoslavia</a>, and will make a huge contribution to the jurisprudence that any future tribunal dealing with sexual violence as a crime against humanity will be able to draw on, she says.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing, honestly, that this small court with so few resources and such limited time was able to pound out this type of very progressive and clear jurisprudence on sexual violence. It\u2019s a huge testament to the victims who were willing to come forward after so much time, the lawyers for those victims, and the African community that helped make the court happen.\u201d</p> <h2>A weapon to inspire terror </h2> <p>Zidane was the only person to testify that she was raped by Habr\u00e9. Rape, however, was widely used as a weapon by the military and police, to sow terror in women, children as young as seven and, in some cases, men.<br></p> <p>Ginette Ngarbaye was doing the laundry at home with her cousin when an acquaintance came by the house on his motorbike. He said her aunt had asked him to come and pick her up.</p> <p>\u201cSince I was innocent, I didn\u2019t have anything to fear,\u201d says Ngarbaye, now secretary of the victims\u2019 association, sitting in the organisation\u2019s tumbledown headquarters, a few faded printouts of victims taped to the wall behind her. \u201cMy cousin said: \u2018Today, it\u2019s your turn\u2019. I said: \u2018My turn for what?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The 19-year-old, who was pregnant, was led through a compound full of soldiers. She was at the DDS headquarters.</p> <p>\u201cIn the office I met a huge, burly man dressed in a white, short-sleeved shirt. It had blood all over it. I immediately knew he was a torturer, and it was then that I remembered what my cousin had said.\u201d</p> <p>On the files all over his desk, she saw names she knew \u2013 names of girls who had disappeared. She and these girls were accused of going to a restaurant frequented by Habr\u00e9\u2019s opponents.</p> <p>\u201cHe called two agents in uniform and they took me into a torture chamber, full of contraptions.\u201d</p> <p>Ngarbaye begins to cry, wiping her face with her yellow wrap. \u201cThey arrest you and tell you not to talk, so it feels good to say it. It\u2019s healing.\u201d</p> <p>The uniformed men took her to a women\u2019s cell, where a fellow prisoner told her not to confess anything. </p> <p>Two days later, they came back for her, and took her to the man in the bloodied shirt. \u201cThat day and every evening for a week he tortured me and raped me. I asked: \u2018When will you let me go?\u2019 He said: \u2018When I am satisfied.\u2019 It\u2019s their way of breaking you. And even as they\u2019re raping you, they\u2019re insulting you, and beating you, kicking you.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bef990ce487e429ba37bb40ff4875bfea361e700\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bef990ce487e429ba37bb40ff4875bfea361e700/0_113_4608_2765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ginette Ngarbeye\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ginette Ngarbeye: \u2018And even as they\u2019re raping you, they\u2019re insulting you, and beating you, kicking you.\u2019 For a week she was raped and tortured by a man in a shirt covered in blood, in the headquarters of the victims\u2019 association in N\u2019Djamena.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ruth Maclean/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After a week her torturer and rapist, who she later learned was Issa Arawa\u00ef, moved on to other girls. But she stayed in jail, in terrible conditions, for two years \u2013 fed millet mixed with dirt, rust and occasionally rotten fish, unable to wash, surrounded by dying women. She delivered her daughter in the prison.</p> <p>After she got out, Ngarbaye often saw Arawa\u00ef, speeding around N\u2019Djamena in his car. Later, under president Idriss D\u00e9by, he was jailed and tortured himself, and eventually died. But she did not see Habr\u00e9 until the day she testified.</p> <p>\u201cHe was sitting there, jogging his foot up and down,\u201d she says. \u201cHe pretended to adjust his turban, and looked at me out of the corner of his eye. When I saw him, I was looking at a monster. It was like looking at a man who has massacred all his children. I tried hard to talk, but I really wanted to jump on him and bite him, tear him apart. We lost a lot of good people in this country because of Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9.\u201d</p> <p>Officials of the regime kept meticulous records, and thousands of documents were strewn across the DDS headquarters after Habr\u00e9 was deposed. Gathered by Human Rights Watch, they show that the DDS answered directly to Habr\u00e9. He personally gave orders and signed death warrants.</p> <p>At his trial, Habr\u00e9\u2019s tactic was not to defend himself, but rather, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/chadian-dictators-tactics-mimic-script-of-former-rulers-facing-criminal-charges-45395\">following a path well-trodden by dictators, to refuse to recognise the authority of the court</a>. He was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/20/chad-hissene-habre-war-crimes-trial-senegal-removed-from-court-as-scuffle-breaks-out\">dragged in</a> on the first day, and thereafter sat in white robes, a turban and dark glasses, the only visible part of his face wearing an expression of contempt. His lawyers say they will appeal against the verdict, although it is not clear whether he has approved this, as it would entail recognising the court.</p> <h2>Taking the stand</h2> <p>It was only when they were sure that Habr\u00e9 would be tried that the women were persuaded to speak about the rapes by <a href=\"http://www.forumchambresafricaines.org/V1_ficae/entretien-avec-me-jacqueline-moudeina-avocat-conseil-de-lassociation-des-victimes-des-crimes-du-regime-hissein-habre-avcrhh-base-au-tchad/?lang=en\">Jacqueline Moude\u00efna</a>, a Chadian lawyer who has worked since 2000 to bring Habr\u00e9 to justice.</p> <p>\u201cIt was long and patient work,\u201d Moude\u00efna says. \u201cIt was only in 2013 that one of the women drew a picture for me so I\u2019d understand that she\u2019d been raped and that all of the women in the DDS prisons had been raped.</p> <p>\u201cIt was really only a few days before their depositions before the court that I was really able to convince them to speak \u2013 open their hearts and say what happened to them. There was a problem of trust, of course, and particularly the taboo that surrounds rape in Chad. Because I\u2019d been working with them for a long time, I was able to explain it to them. That is what enabled them to break the taboo, to break the silence.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d9c6077945379844c8b92f37b19f3c71e15498f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d9c6077945379844c8b92f37b19f3c71e15498f/132_291_3254_1952/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An exhibition depicting the years Chad was ruled by Habr\u00e9, at the Douta Secke Cultural Centre in Dakar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An exhibition depicting the years Chad was ruled by Habr\u00e9, at the Douta Secke Cultural Centre in Dakar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seyllou/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those who heard the women\u2019s testimonies said they were impossible for the Burkinabe judge, Gberdao Kam, to ignore. But the fact that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/dec/22/chad-hissene-habre-lawyers-sexual-slavery-rape-charges-trial\">changed the charges</a> was also thanks to a brief that Seelinger and colleagues submitted to the court, signed by experts on sexual violence as an international crime. This gave Kam a blueprint for how he could charge Habr\u00e9 for rape as a crime against humanity, both in terms of customary international law and under the statute the court was using.</p> <p>\u201cIt went from a case where there was zero sexual violence in the charging recommended by the investigating judges to a verdict that was really heavy with sexual violence,\u201d Seelinger says. \u201cIt\u2019s great, it\u2019s astounding, and it\u2019s quite dramatic in terms of international jurisprudence.\u201d</p> <p>Moude\u00efna says the verdict could protect other women, and she has been contacted by groups across Africa inspired to bring perpetrators to justice. Her focus, though, remains Chad where, even with Habr\u00e9 long gone, the number of rapes has risen sharply in recent years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jun/03/hissene-habre-crimes-against-humanity-chad-justice\">Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9's conviction the first step on a longer road to justice for Chad | Kolbassia Haoussou</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cNow, perhaps, rape survivors will have the courage to speak so that their rapists will be prosecuted.

Though this mixed London crowd may roll its eyes at such a claim, the city being one of the <a href=\"http://now-here-this.timeout.com/2013/11/06/london-is-the-fourth-biggest-jamaican-city-and-other-fun-facts-about-where-londoners-are-really-from/\" title=\"\">biggest Jamaican enclaves outside Jamaica</a>; dancehall never really goes away when you host Carnival.</p> <p>Even the heatwave has got the memo: the Electric Ballroom\u2019s ventilation makes little headway on the tropical humidity.

A 2015 survey found more than 30% of doctors surveyed said they were sending patient related information over services such as WhatsApp.</p> <p>Vascular surgeon Hans Flu, co-founder of MDLinking, came up with the idea for the secure healthcare network when he realised just how much his colleagues were using WhatsApp. He had <a href=\"http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2016/02/whatsapp-is-not-secure-enough-for-patient-info-privacy-watchdog/\">privacy concerns</a> over the app and worried about its plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/25/whatsapp-to-give-users-phone-number-facebook-for-targeted-ads\">share account information</a> with parent company Facebook.</p> <p>Ultimately, however, Flu wants to find a solution to what he sees as the big problem in the medical world: communication. \u201cIf you communicate badly, the patient\u2019s going to suffer, and this is a key element that everyone can improve. This is a tool developed by medical doctors, for medical doctors, that is free.\u201d</p> <p>As well as being a directory and secure instant messaging tool (it only accepts vetted medical professionals), the start-up is using virtual reality technology to record operations from multiple viewpoints, to form an interactive teaching tool \u2013 especially for countries where operating theatres are scarce.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"57f35d8edec6c7b2b9b1a68d266f5f92ac6c58ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57f35d8edec6c7b2b9b1a68d266f5f92ac6c58ee/0_0_492_609/404.png\" alt=\"Dr Hans Flu, co-founder of MDLinking\" width=\"404\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Hans Flu, co-founder of MDLinking</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WeMakeVr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gijs Walraven, director for health at AKDN \u2013 which operates a non-profit, private healthcare system in developing world communities \u2013 is interested in collaborating with the MDLinking tool.</p> <p>\u201cAKDN\u2019s work in health is mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, central and south Asia,\u201d he says. \u201cIn these countries, there are fewer medical doctors and they have much more limited opportunities to consult with colleagues on difficult cases as well as to [access] education. New ways to interact at a distance and in a secure manner could play a very important role to improve this.</p> <p>\u201cLearning new operating techniques and how to better diagnose using the innovative video techniques that MDLinking is developing could be a real breakthrough.\u201d And it works both ways, he says: \u201cHealthcare providers in rural settings in Afghanistan have knowledge and skills that could be beneficial to health practitioners in London.\u201d</p> <h2>Teaching by virtual reality </h2> <p>Dr Gijs van Acker, a surgeon at Medisch Centrum Haaglanden hospital in the Netherlands, first created teaching videos for his vascular surgery website a decade ago. \u201cOne of my residents was Hans Flu, and when he started MDLinking I said, \u2018You need something that\u2019s educational\u2019. We wanted to make something more intuitive than 2D films,\u201d he says. </p> <p>They came up with virtual reality combined with the view-selection interface, allowing users to flick to different sections of the operation. Traditional teaching methods can\u2019t compete, according to van Acker, who says that dead body tissue loses its colour, so isn\u2019t the same teaching experience, while students observing actual operations are often distracted by nerves. </p> <p>He has recorded four 3D operations for MDLinking so far and \u2013 thanks to a <a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/nl/discover/dscvr/app-vr-operatie/\">partnership</a> providing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KrH88OiJyE\">Samsung</a> equipment \u2013 these are viewable via mobiles and virtual reality headsets.</p> <p>As the app is free, the business plans to raise revenue by broadcasting sponsored medical conference content and acting as a recruitment site for international medical placements. It wants to establish video centres in different places around the world using tools and facilities available there \u2013 for example, treating appendicitis in remote Africa.</p> <p>Kiran Jobanputra, deputy head of the Manson Unit at M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res in London, says the organisation is looking into MDLinking as it develops a medical IT strategy. \u201cUntil something is piloted and evaluated, it is hard to say, but I do see potential in this app,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving been a field doctor, I came up against huge difficulty getting access to information, particularly relevant technical advice.\u201d</p> <p>He says MSF medical experts at the London HQ and its <a href=\"https://telemed.msf.org/msf/index.php\">telemedicine</a> platform have time, context and connectivity limitations. \u201cMSF clinicians are using WhatsApp groups of colleagues to get rapid, relevant advice \u2013 although it\u2019s not an official MSF tool, and some people in the organisation might not agree with it,\u201d he says. \u201cThat MDLinking \u2018LinkedIn\u2019 function to join or create a new group of people happy to give their opinion, with regional experience, has huge potential.</p> <p>\u201cI suspect the educational content will still require connectivity of too high bandwidth. We\u2019re not testing MDLinking at the moment but if it comes on to Android, which is the main smartphone operating system in the contexts we work in, we probably will.</p> <p>\u201cThe sharing economy isn\u2019t new \u2013 in our medical studies we are taught \u2018see one, do one, teach one\u2019 \u2013 but barriers to sharing information are getting lower.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A healthy diet is not about Instagrammed asparagus, glowing skin or a feeling of wellbeing \u2013 it\u2019s about eating foods that help you to avoid disease. That simple message has been muddied by pseudoscience nutritionists and celebrity health gurus, clambering over each other to persuade you to buy their products.</p> <p>With a healthy diet you can avoid risk factors such as being overweight, having high blood pressure and developing diabetes, which lead to serious cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and strokes. It\u2019s concerning, then, with the burden of obesity and disease falling on the poor, that health is being packaged and sold through a soft-focus lens as an aspirational product beyond many people\u2019s means.</p> <p>Nothing could be further from the truth. The much-vaunted Mediterranean diet, for instance, is one of peasants. Born of a needs-must school of eating, it emphasises varied, seasonal, humble and largely plant-based ingredients: fruit and veg, fibrous carbs, legumes, nuts, a bit of meat, and healthy fats such as olive oil. Doesn\u2019t sound too expensive, does it?</p> <p>Most nutritionists and health gurus agree with doctors and scientists on the fundamentals of a healthy diet \u2013 the idea is to eat more protective foods and fewer damaging ones. Anything else is a selling point people use to stand out in the marketplace.</p> <p>Here we look at the basic pillars of a healthy diet with ingredients and recipes that follow three guiding principles: they are accessible, inexpensive and simple to cook.</p> <h2>Fruit and veg</h2> <p>Fruit and veg are good for you, but even this message has been spun to make money.</p> <p>They\u2019re not good for you because of magical detoxifying properties. Whether it\u2019s goji or acai berries or concentrated vegetable gloop, these things often come with scientific-sounding words, such as flavonoids and antioxidants, attached, usually just to sell you something.</p> <p>Catherine Collins, dietitian at St George\u2019s hospital, London, says that pseudoscientists latch onto the fact that there are chemicals in all fruit and veg which affect our health. \u201cBut they cherrypick scientific concepts and make simplistic, unproven associations with human health and specific outcomes to justify their viewpoint,\u201d she says.</p> <p>What we do know is that by eating fruit and veg you can lower the risk of disease. Because they contain artery-relaxing nitrates, familiar vegetables such as spinach, lettuce and radishes, can lower blood pressure. The potassium in green leafy veg, squash and mushrooms does the same. These vegetables might not be glamorous, but given that high blood pressure has overtaken smoking as the leading risk for disease and death you\u2019d be foolish to push them to the side of your plate.</p> <h2>Fats</h2> <p>That saturated fats aren\u2019t as bad as once thought has led to PR spin that has only confused matters. A prime example is coconut oil. With no good evidence that eating coconut oil regularly will keep you healthy, inaccurate marketing has used interesting theoretical health properties to make it more desirable.</p> <p>Saturated fats such as butter, if enjoyed sensibly, are neutral to your health: they are not protective like olive oil but are not damaging like trans fats or excess sugars. It\u2019s unsaturated ones from whole food sources such as oily fish, nuts, seeds and olive oil that should be your fats of choice.</p> <p>Where evidence is strongest is with boring olive oil. There\u2019s no need to fork out for the expensive stuff, the economical extra-virgin type will do fine. Watch out for processed spreads and fats branded as omega-3 fortified and mayonnaise with 5% added olive oil. If you\u2019re eating it in a bid to be extra healthy, you\u2019re wasting your time.</p> <p>Oily fish can be a little trickier \u2013 its shelf life can make it difficult to squeeze into a busy family\u2019s schedule Its expense, too, can be prohibitive. Unless you\u2019re Richard Branson or a grizzly bear with a fishing rod, you\u2019re unlikely to be able to eat as much salmon as you\u2019d like, but there are options that aren\u2019t so hard on the wallet.</p> <p>Grilled mackerel in the summer is always a winner. Cornish sardines are increasingly popular since their rebranding (they were <a href=\"http://www.cornishsardines.org.uk/historical-background.html\">once the more drab-sounding pilchards</a>). Canned fish such as traditional sardines can be store-cupboard superstars but tuna, although classified as oily when fresh, <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/fish-shellfish.aspx\">loses much of its omega-3 when canned</a>.</p> <p>Avocados, nuts and seeds are another good supplementary source to top up your intake. Know where to buy them and they don\u2019t have to be expensive. Ignore them altogether and they can cost you a healthy heart.</p> <h2>Carbs</h2> <p>It seems we have a limited capacity for understanding what bad foods are. As fats have benefited from a PR makeover, carbs have been put in the stocks. Restricting your carb intake is an effective way to lose weight, but to vilify a whole food group by banishing them forever would be to make the same mistakes all over again.</p> <p>Good carbohydrate sources are unrefined, fibre-rich ones such as oats, wholegrains, quinoa, sweet potatoes, squash and legumes, all of which release their sugars slowly. Bad carbs are refined ones such as the white flour used to make white bread and pasta: the refining process takes out all the fibre and leaves you with easily digestible sugar.</p> <p>There\u2019s only one problem: refined carbohydrates are delicious. We\u2019ve evolved to crave energy-dense foods so don\u2019t deny yourself \u2013 just manage how much refined carbohydrate you eat. You can do this by eating a cauliflower crust pizza but, if you\u2019re anything like us, you\u2019ll end up wanting to throw that pizza in the bin after a few bites. If you want pizza eat a proper one, just don\u2019t make it a habit.</p> <p>Brown pasta, too, is about as fun as eating cardboard. Italians don\u2019t eat it so why should you? You can have regular pasta, but limit it to about a quarter of your plate and balance it with other fibre-rich elements such as vegetables that will slow down your digestion and limit the spikes in sugar your liver turns into harmful fats.</p> <p>An obvious way to avoid sugar spikes is to avoid sugar. But there\u2019s no point splashing out on apparently healthy alternatives such as agave nectar, honey or date molasses. These alternatives, says Nita Forouhi, a diabetes clinician-scientist at the MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge, are marketed as \u201chaving antioxidants or a lower GI [glycemic index] value, but there\u2019s no convincing evidence to support swapping table sugar for any of them for health benefits \u2013 they are all \u2018free sugars\u2019 which as a rule we should limit\u201d.</p> <h2>Protein</h2> <p>The apparent health benefits of protein have been thrust into our faces one Instagrammed workout at a time. This link between protein and health, though, is the embodiment of the misunderstanding of what health is: it\u2019s not about six packs and bubble butts, it\u2019s about the avoidance of disease and premature death, admittedly unsexy but undeniably important factors that eating more protein will not improve.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say proteins aren\u2019t important. They\u2019re the building blocks of what makes you (muscles and bones), what holds you together (skin and cartilage) and what keeps everything ticking along (enzymes and hormones).</p> <p>Eating meat is an easy way to get your protein \u2013 the animal does all the hard work and concentrates the nutrients for you \u2013 but it can be expensive, you can\u2019t eat it if you\u2019re a vegetarian, and if you eat too much of it you won\u2019t have space left for more protective foods.</p> <p>Although meat is not essential for health, for many it\u2019s a key part of any meal. The good news is that we can get those satisfying umami flavours we crave as often as we want without breaking the bank or eating too much. As with many peasant dishes of the Mediterranean diet, cooking techniques such as stewing and braising stretch the flavour to other ingredients, such as fibre-rich vegetables. You can also use cheaper cuts such as shin and skirt steak: just go for quality over quantity.</p> <p>Vegetarians, fear not: fibre-rich beans and pulses (legumes), while being a great source of protein, are associated with long-term health protection and so should also be a go-to food for meat eaters. Nuts and seeds, too, can bulk out a salad and their protective fats will leave you fuller for longer.</p> <p>Other than low-quality processed meats there are no bad proteins. Try to trade up excess meat for more protective foods whenever you can \u2013 a healthy diet will protect you from disease more than a six-pack ever will.</p> <h2>Green mango salad (som tum mamuang)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8222f03d6a94a8b04bbf6d472dd304ac2a010b23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8222f03d6a94a8b04bbf6d472dd304ac2a010b23/0_119_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Green mango salad (som tum mamuang)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green mango salad (som tum mamuang).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tara Fisher/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>South-east Asian cooking transforms a salad from a side dish to the main event, giving a perfect opportunity to eat more fruit, veg, healthy proteins and nuts. These textures together with the taste explosion of sweet, savoury, spicy and sour dressing mean you won\u2019t miss unrefined, fibreless carbs.<br></p> <p>Mangoes are also rich in a protective, soluble fibre that will slow down the digestion of the entire meal.

The simple, fresh flavours and textures complement each other perfectly: hot peppery notes (raw garlic and olive oil), mellow comforting richness (pasta, parmesan and pine nuts) and clean perfumed bite (basil, spinach and courgette). A mixture of pasta and courgette \u201ctagliatelle\u201d keeps the comfort and satisfaction of pasta but packs in more veg alongside other protective ingredients such as garlic, nuts, extra-virgin olive oil and dark green leafy spinach. With the fat from the cheese giving additional satiety, you won\u2019t miss that extra pasta, especially if you pair with a simple sliced tomato and onion salad dressed with a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar.</p> <p>Serves 2<br><strong>courgettes</strong> 2, medium<br><strong>linguine pasta</strong> 100g (50g per person)<br><strong>baby spinach</strong> 2 large handfuls<br><strong>garlic</strong> 1 large clove<br><strong>basil leaves</strong> a big bunch<br><strong>pine nuts</strong> 2 small handfuls (dry toasted)<br><strong>fresh parmesan</strong> a handful, grated<br><strong>extra-virgin olive oil<br></strong><strong>salt and black pepper</strong></p> <p>Make the courgette tagliatelle by taking long length slices of the courgette with a mandoline (largest tooth setting) or a potato peeler until you get to the soft water centre. Keep the soft cores, you can finely chop and add them as they are with the tagliatelle.<br></p> <p>Boil the pasta in plenty of salted water. Wash the spinach, drain and place in a large bowl.</p> <p>Make the pesto while the pasta is cooking. We like to make the pesto in a mortar and pestle for that chunky, fresh-made texture but you can add all the ingredients straight into a blender or food processor.</p> <p>Bash a whole peeled garlic clove with a pinch of salt for extra abrasion until a paste. Add the basil leaves and do the same. Add the toasted pine nuts and parmesan. Drizzle in olive oil to loosen the mixture. Bash and stir away until you have a chunky mixture that\u2019s loose enough to stir into your pasta.</p> <p>The pasta should nearly be ready. Throw in the courgette tagliatelle for the final 2 minutes or just enough to soften but retain a slight bite.</p> <p>Drain and immediately add the hot pasta into the bowl with the spinach and stir. The heat of the pasta will wilt and soften the spinach. Now add your pesto and mix thoroughly. Season with black pepper and a final fresh sprinkle of parmesan. You don\u2019t need to add any additional salt as the cheese and other elements have enough.</p> <h2>Stuffed coquina squash and sweet roasted beets</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fe8f2ebf1bc84efdf778370818e7899f7e543472\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe8f2ebf1bc84efdf778370818e7899f7e543472/0_107_1225_735/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stuffed coquina squash and sweet roasted beets\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stuffed coquina squash and sweet roasted beets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tara Fisher/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The soft coquina squash with chewy, candied edges, the concentrated sweetness of roasted beetroot, and the warming, meaty filling make this dish one of our favourites. The squash and legumes, being high in fibre, are the good type of carbs that prevent spikes in blood sugar and subsequent fat storage, the slow-cooked meat stretches that umami satisfaction through the filling, allowing you to use less meat and pack in more protective veg. The roasted beets, too, are rich in artery-relaxing nitrates that can lower blood pressure (it\u2019s why athletes drink beetroot juice to improve their endurance).<br></p> <p>Serves 4 (makes enough sauce for 8-10, freeze leftovers for another meal)<br><strong>minced beef</strong> 500g<br><strong>extra-virgin olive oil<br></strong><strong>onion</strong> 1 large<br><strong>celery</strong> 2 sticks<br><strong>carrot</strong> 2 large, skin on<br><strong>courgette, sweet pepper, aubergine</strong> 1 each<br><strong>garlic</strong> 4 large cloves<br><strong>large chillies</strong> 2 (leave seeds in if you like it hot or add more)<br><strong>salt and pepper<br></strong><strong>tomato puree</strong> 2 large tbsp<br><strong>tomatoes</strong> 2 x 400g tins<br><strong>bay leaves</strong> 3<br><strong>ground cinnamon </strong>1 tsp<br><strong>green lentils </strong>100g<br><strong>chickpeas</strong> 1 tin<br><strong>beetroot</strong> 12 small, uncooked<br><strong>large coquina squash</strong> 1</p> <p>Use a large heavy cast-iron casserole dish that can be placed in the oven. Preheat the oven to 160C/gas mark 3.</p> <p>Over a moderate high heat brown the minced beef in a little splash of olive oil until the edges are crispy and golden brown. While the beef is cooking chop the onions, celery, carrot, and other vegetables along with the garlic and chilli \u2013 use a food processor if you have one.</p> <p>Remove the browned beef with a slotted spoon and add the chopped vegetables to the pan to soften in the same oil. When the veg looks softened and the onions are translucent add back the beef.</p> <p>Season the mix now with salt and black pepper. Add the tomato puree and cook out together for another 2 minutes</p> <p>Now add the tinned tomatoes and equal amount of water (by rinsing out and filling the tomato tin). Add the bay leaves and bring back to simmer.</p> <p>Transfer to the oven to slowly cook for 3 hours to develop a beautiful melting texture and deep umami flavours. Portion out around half to cool and freeze for an easy meal another day.</p> <p>Add a teaspoon of cinnamon and the green lentils (rinsed, boiled for 10 minutes, drained) and chickpeas (rinsed and crushed to a pulse) for the final 30 minutes of cooking.</p> <p>Now to the squash and beetroot. Individually wrap in foil and bake the beetroots, leaving the skin on, for an hour at 180C/gas mark 4 or until a knife passes through the flesh easily. (It\u2019s fine to turn up the heat on the base sauce for the last hour if you\u2019re cooking both at the same time.) Cut and deseed the squash, leaving skin on, season and drizzle with olive oil and roast for an hour or until the flesh is deep orange and the edges are darkened. The tip of a knife should pass easily through the thickest bit of the squash. When cooked and cooled, the skin of the beet will slide off easily; dress with a splash of balsamic if you like. Scoop some flesh out of the squash, mix with the filling, pile high and enjoy.</p> <h2>Mediterranean fisherman\u2019s stew: leek, courgette and cod with chilli and lemon seasoning</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bc38a0493d4e1677a8b3e0ff47dcc1aeed73b46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bc38a0493d4e1677a8b3e0ff47dcc1aeed73b46/0_156_1106_664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mediterranean Fisherman\u2019s stew: leek, courgette and cod with chilli and lemon seasoning\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mediterranean Fisherman\u2019s stew: leek, courgette and cod with chilli and lemon seasoning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tara Fisher/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Humble and sweet courgette and leek, a rich tomato sofrito sauce and subtle white fish highlighted with lemon, parsley and chilli.

The combination of olive oil, tomato, garlic and onion forms the base of the sofrito sauce, a mainstay of Mediterranean cooking. When combined, these ingredients might have a synergistic, protective effect but, most importantly, they give that delicious flavour that transports you to the Italian Riviera.

Bring to a simmer and scrape around the bottom of the pan to dislodge any crispy bits. Place in your preheated oven to slow cook and braise for the next 2 hours.</p> <p>After 2 hours remove, stir and check the hot pot. You should have a reduced, intensely umami-flavoured sauce. You want this to be strong because it will become diluted by the water in the additional veg. Now add your washed and sliced mushrooms and Chinese cabbage. Return to the oven for another hour.</p> <p>Towards the end, boil the quinoa separately until the seeds open. Drain and then add straight into the hot pot and stir together. Fish out the star anise and taste for final seasoning \u2013 add a final splash of soy sauce if you like.

  "<p>A fractious Europe, a failing currency, a challenged economy, populist parties on the rise, a divided left, migration from the east, an atmosphere of fear combined with social and sexual liberalism. The parallels between Britain today and Germany in the 1920s may well make this a compelling moment to revisit those postwar German thinkers who gathered in what was known as the Frankfurt school for social research \u2013 something akin to a Marxist thinktank, though one whose policy papers and brilliant books fed future generations as much or more than their own.</p> <p>Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse and Erich Fromm, together with the close, but formally unattached Walter Benjamin, and from the 1970s J\u00fcrgen Habermas, were the core constellation. With the rise to power of the Nazis, the school\u2019s Frankfurt headquarters had to be abandoned. Double persecution, as Marxists and Jews, began in 1933. Adorno, a brilliant musician as well as theorist, went to Oxford first to study with Gilbert Ryle. The school itself moved briefly to Switzerland and then the US, settling in what novelist Thomas Mann called \u201cGerman California\u201d. Despite their unchanged stance on capitalism, some of them were recruited for wartime intelligence work in the battle against the Nazi regime.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Marcuse held out some hope and stepped into the fray. During the Vietnam war, he took on the mantle of a cultural hero</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Between them they married Freud to Marx, then largely gave up hope, after the failure of the German uprising in 1918, of a revolutionary working class, and drew on Marx, Kant and Hegel to engage in a rigorous critique of capitalism and its technocratic systems. Crucially, they emphasised the ways in which consumerism and mass culture \u2013 from film to TV to pop music \u2013 lull us into a pleasant enough ideological slumber. It is thanks to the Frankfurt school that all aspects of culture are seriously studied today.</p> <p>Adorno and Horkheimer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/08/frankfurt-school-dialectic-of-enlightenment\" title=\"\"><em>The Dialectic of Enlightenment </em></a>(1944) marked an early dismantling of the myth of progress and its concomitant exaltation of reason, while Adorno\u2019s <em>The Authoritarian Personality</em> (1950), begun before the war, probed the question that taxed them all: why had the German people succumbed to Hitler\u2019s seductions and engaged in a war that took barbarism to newly horrific dimensions?</p> <p>Given the philosophical difficulty of their project, it might seem surprising that critical theory \u2013 the name given to the Frankfurt school\u2019s intellectual practice \u2013 is alive and well and reaches parts other branches of university enterprise often fail to reach. John Berger\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/ways-of-seeing.html\" title=\"\"><em>Ways of Seeing</em></a> introduced Walter Benjamin\u2019s resonant analysis of art in an age of mechanical reproduction to millions. In his latest book, <em>White Sands</em>, Geoff Dyer makes a pilgrimage to Adorno\u2019s modest LA home in Brentwood, where many of the aphorisms in <em>Minima Moralia</em> were penned. At the start of Jonathan Franzen\u2019s bestselling <em>The Corrections</em>, the impecunious hero sells his collection of Frankfurt school books to a secondhand dealer.</p> <p>Stuart Jeffries finds the title of his lively group biography in the Hungarian Marxist critic Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s ironising description of the Frankfurt school. Having taken up residence in a sumptuous grand hotel, they can indulge their pessimism from a safe distance and analyse the woes of the world rather than engage in the struggle for change. Well before Adorno\u2019s 1966 book of that name, the group was engaged in negative dialectics. Jeffries is an able though combative narrator, drawing in large swaths of material but demanding that his biographees justify their projects and behaviour at every point. He\u2019s worried about their class credentials. He doesn\u2019t quite trust intellectuals for whom thinking seems work enough. Fine journalist that he is, he wants to interrogate the fact that the Frankfurt headquarters was built with capitalist money, that research was done for governments. He also wants to question their lack of active political engagement early on and in the radical 1960s and 70s when the call from students came.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For Benjamin at the last, hope wasn\u2019t there: he committed suicide at the Spanish border while fleeing the Nazis</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Herbert Marcuse is the exception: his <em>Eros and Civilisation </em>and bestselling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/15/frankfurt-school-herbert-marcuse\" title=\"\"><em>One-Dimensional Man</em></a> influenced the 1968 generation of radicals, whether Marxist, liberationist, hippy or just young. Then Black Panther <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/dec/14/angela-davis-there-is-an-unbroken-line-of-police-violence-in-the-us-that-takes-us-all-the-way-back-to-the-days-of-slavery\" title=\"\">Angela Davis</a> was among them. Marcuse held out some hope, at least of art, and stepped into the fray, even writing on Marxism and feminism. During the anti-Vietnam war years, he took on the mantle of a cultural hero.</p> <p>Adorno, the greater philosopher, had meanwhile returned to Frankfurt. Though he supported some student action, he was also critical of what he called \u201cleft fascism\u201d. In January 1969, he called in police to dislodge an \u201coccupation\u201d. As legend has it, his death was hastened by a rowdy \u201cBusenaktion\u201d in which three women bared their breasts during a lecture. He died of a heart attack on 6 August that year.</p> <p>Jeffries has set himself a daunting task in trying to combine life stories, a rapidly changing context of time and place, as well as explication of difficult philosophical work, some of which he doesn\u2019t seem always to relish. Direct contact provides a fascinating interview with J\u00fcrgen Habermas, a rebel against the older Frankurtians as they were against their own fathers. He finds Habermas\u2019s optimism a little Pollyanna-ish, but something of a relief. His ideas about democracy and the public sphere are compelling as is his system for working out ways in which \u201cthe citizens of a political community could still exercise collective influence over their social destiny through the democratic process\u201d.</p> <p>Jeffries\u2019s favourite among his cast is palpably the great Walter Benjamin, the Kafka of critical theory. The last words of Marcuse\u2019s <em>One-Dimensional Man</em> come from Benjamin. \u201cIt is only for the sake of those without hope that hope is given to us.\u201d For Benjamin at the last, hope wasn\u2019t there: he committed suicide at the Spanish border while fleeing the Nazis.</p> <p>Little wonder, given the history of the 20th century, that the Frankfurt school gave us intellectual pessimism and negative dialectics. Jeffries\u2019s biography is proof that such a legacy can be invigorating.</p> <p><em>Lisa Appignanesi\u2019s </em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/trials-of-passion-368228.html\" title=\"\"><em>Trials of Passion</em></a><em> (Virago) is out now in paperback.

And, in lighter news, flirty newcomer Caroline bubbles along nicely with Dr Enys, stealing the limelight with the old fishbone-stuck-in-her-throat trick. <em>Hannah Verdier </em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/15/from-poldark-to-bieber-theres-a-male-body-ideal-and-its-problematic\">From Poldark to Bieber, there's a male body ideal but is it problematic?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Elton John Live at Hyde Park </h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC2<br></strong>Elton flirts with credibility \u2013 recent albums have seen him join forces with the likes of Leon Russell and he namechecks his favourite younger writers \u2013 but it\u2019s letting his hair down at events like this where you probably get the best of him. Schmaltz he saves for Vegas and indoors. Outside, he totters on, plays the Bitch Is Back and things develop nicely from there; the lack of a mandate other than to entertain proving good news for everyone. <em>John Robinson </em></p> <h2>Paralympics 2016 Closing Ceremony </h2> <p><strong>10pm, Channel 4<br></strong>Another quadrennial jamboree of multi-sporting action draws to a close, and with it another successful performance from Team GB, so much so that keeping that self-effacing national stereotype ticking along for another four years might become a tad tricky. Rio\u2019s Maracan\u00e3 is the venue for an undoubtedly grandiose send-off, with Clare Balding, Adam Hills and Jonathan Edwards joining thousands of athletes. <em>Mark Gibbings-Jones</em></p> <h2>Ozzy &amp; Jack\u2019s World Detour </h2> <p><strong> 9pm, History<br></strong>Eleven years on from MTV\u2019s landmark reality soap, the male Osbournes reunite for a fairly slapdash travelogue. With a wink at This Is Spinal Tap, things kick off in England with the pair questing to find Stonehenge with the help of a semi-reliable GPS. As father and son bicker and bond while navigating B-roads in a Range Rover, it plays like a metal cover of The Trip, especially when they stop off at Britain\u2019s oldest pub for fish and chips. <em>Graeme Virtue </em></p> <h2>Richard E Grant on Ealing Comedies </h2> <p><strong>7pm, Gold<br></strong>Amiably unfocused film nostalgia in a new series that\u2019s fun enough to forgive the suspicion that its creators thought it would make itself. Episode one begins with Passport To Pimlico, before hopping back to Gracie Fields and George Formby and then the steadying hand of producer Michael Balcon. Whisky Galore!, bombsite romp Hue And Cry and A Fish Called Wanda also feature, as Grant presents what could be a pleasant pub conversation. <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2><strong>Film choice</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3dfd84555218187f0ddf38803da5cf64f0ca32b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3dfd84555218187f0ddf38803da5cf64f0ca32b/0_185_4093_2456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passport To Pimlico\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passport to Pimlico</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Courtesy Everett Collection/REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Passport to Pimlico<br>(Henry Cornelius, 1949) 8pm, Gold</strong><br>Get your cockles warming with this Ealing comedy, in which the inhabitants of Pimlico discover an obscure 15th-century charter that makes their manor part of Burgundy. So, in austere postwar London, Stanley Holloway and his neighbours come over all bourgeois, instituting petty little rules, such as customs controls on the tube line. A vintage delight, with none more sparkly than Margaret Rutherford\u2019s excitable history professor. <em>Paul Howlett </em></p> <p><strong>Thank You For Smoking<br>(Jason Reitman, 2005), 11pm, Gold</strong><br>This satirical assault on the smoking lobby is lightweight compared to Michael Mann\u2019s weighty The Insider, but nevertheless makes for a sly comedy. Aaron Eckhart is heartless PR man Nick Naylor, who wheels and deals to get ciggies back on the cinema screen. Fags aren\u2019t as bad as <br> your parents say, he tells high-school kids, and hangs out discussing body counts with his chums in the booze and armaments industries. <em>PH</em></p> <p><strong>A Royal Affair<br>(Nikolaj Arcel, 2012), 11.55pm, BBC2</strong><br>Arcel\u2019s rather hefty but compelling chunk of Danish history is set in 1770, when German doctor Johann Struensee effectively ruled the country while treating King Christian VII\u2019s mental illness. Mads Mikkelsen smoulders as the good doctor, becoming Queen Caroline Matilda\u2019s lover and trying to introduce social reform. It makes for gripping political drama, like an 18th- century Borgen. <em>PH</em></p> <h2><strong>Today\u2019s Best Live Sport </strong></h2> <p><strong>Paralympics 2016 1pm, Channel 4</strong> Wheelchair rugby and athletics on the 11th and final day in Rio.</p> <p><strong>Premier League Football: Crystal Palace v Stoke City 1.30pm, Sky Sports 1 </strong>Alan Pardew\u2019s side takes on Mark Hughes\u2019s, before Spurs v Sunderland (Kick-off 4.30pm).</p> <p><strong>NFL: Pittsburgh Steelers v Cincinnati Bengals 7.30pm, Sky Sports 2</strong> Action from the AFC North clash at Heinz Field.</p>",

Up on stage are Nick Mason (Pink Floyd\u2019s drummer and owner of a priceless collection of racing cars), the philanthropist and entrepreneur <a href=\"http://www.torquilnorman.com/biography\">Sir Torquil Norman</a>, and the renowned automotive engineer <a href=\"http://gordonmurraydesign.com/GMD/GM.html\">Professor Gordon Murray </a>(best known as the man behind the McLaren F1). But they\u2019re not here to talk about supercars. They\u2019re here to launch the <a href=\"http://oxgvt.com/\">Ox</a>: the world\u2019s first \u201cflat-pack\u201d truck and a vehicle designed specifically to bring aid and mobility to the planet\u2019s most remote areas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8cd35f399c85c3bdb91fd8321e99816cc5f1a9cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cd35f399c85c3bdb91fd8321e99816cc5f1a9cf/0_80_4992_2995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"All aboard: the super basic interior.

He heard on the radio that less than 20% of the world\u2019s population have any access to a vehicle. He knew the transformative impact that transportation could have on the poorest parts of the planet, not only for emergency work but at an everyday village level. He decided to do something about it. He envisioned a low-cost, all-terrain vehicle that would be efficient, lightweight, easy to maintain and incredibly tough. It would also be flat-packed (his eureka moment) as that would enable cheap importation (six can fit into a container as opposed to two) and assembled locally by \u201cthree men in three days using three spanners\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s taken six years and the genius of Gordon Murray\u2019s engineering team to bring the brief to life, but at the Roundhouse we get the first glimpse of the Ox. Nick Mason says he thinks it could be as important a car as the Model T Ford. Gordon Murray says the Ox \u201ctops everything he\u2019s ever worked on, purely because it has the potential to help so many people\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"316f3dc8834c6e5c734f6e8d21741fb8725b237b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/316f3dc8834c6e5c734f6e8d21741fb8725b237b/0_1088_3150_3324/948.jpg\" alt=\"Smart thinking: the Ox is bursting with clever ideas.

But it\u2019s also brimming with clever solutions to tricky problems: it has huge ground clearance and massive individual wheel movement; the tailgate swivels round to double as a loading ramp; the three windscreens are interchangeable; there\u2019s room for 13 adults in the back or eight 44-gallon drums; the rear bench seats can be removed and used as \u201csand ladders\u201d; the engine can be decoupled and used as a mobile generator\u2026 the list goes on.</p> <p>Sir Torquil now just needs his <a href=\"http://oxgvt.com/\">Global Vehicle Trust Ox</a> to get into production, then, he says: \u201cMy dream is to one day see an Ox in every village in Africa.\u201d</p> <p><em>Email Martin at </em><a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\"><em>martin.love@observer.co.uk</em></a><em> or follow him on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MartinLove166\"><em>@MartinLove166</em></a></p>"
