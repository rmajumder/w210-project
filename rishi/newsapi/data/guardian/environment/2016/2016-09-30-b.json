  "<p>One big storm and our climate and energy debate is surging back to peak stupid.</p> <p>Now Malcolm Turnbull has encouraged the campaign to use <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/weather/live/2016/sep/28/south-australia-storms-entire-state-left-without-power-after-wild-weather-live\">the South Australian blackout </a>to slow the shift to clean energy, saying state renewable energy targets are \u201cextremely unrealistic\u201d.<br></p> <p>Except all the evidence says the state targets are exactly what Australia needs to meet the promises the prime minister made in Paris last year about reducing greenhouse gases.<br></p> <p>Of course it would be preferable to have a consistent national policy to reach those goals, but it\u2019s not exactly the states\u2019 fault that we haven\u2019t got one.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/29/south-australia-blackout-explained-renewables-not-to-blame\">South Australia's blackout explained (and no, renewables aren't to blame)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That vacuum was Tony Abbott\u2019s proud achievement, with the abolition of the carbon price and the winding back of the federal renewable energy target, after a lengthy debate about whether it should be abolished altogether, which of course dried up almost all investment in renewable energy.<br></p> <p>And consistent, credible national policy hasn\u2019t been any more evident in the year since Turnbull took over either.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/29/officials-admit-no-modelling-shows-how-australia-will-meet-paris-climate-pledge\">His own officials admitted in a Senate inquiry this week </a>they had undertaken no modelling at all about how to meet the target Turnbull pledged in Paris for reducing Australia\u2019s emissions out to 2030. That\u2019s the target he is about to ratify, the target that will be Australia\u2019s legal obligation.<br></p> <p>But plenty of others have done modelling and analysis for him, and they all conclude that he won\u2019t meet it, not with the Coalition\u2019s current policies.<br></p> <p>They all say he will have to introduce significant new policies, including to shift electricity generation away from coal and towards renewables more quickly.<br></p> <p>In fact they all conclude that the state targets he so ridicules (Victoria\u2019s 40% renewables by 2025, South Australia\u2019s 50% by 2025, Queensland\u2019s 50% by 2030) are more or less what he is going to have to try to achieve.<br></p> <p><a href=\"http://climatechangeauthority.gov.au/sites/prod.climatechangeauthority.gov.au/files/files/Special%20review%20Report%203/Special%20Review%20Report%20Three%20Summary%20and%20recs.pdf\">There was his own Climate Change Authority report</a>, which concluded electricity generation needed to produce zero emissions \u201cwell before 2050\u201d. If that\u2019s the goal and we haven\u2019t got to 40% renewables by 2025, we\u2019re in big trouble.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/30/there-are-two-issues-the-south-australian-blackout-should-make-us-think-about\">There are two issues the South Australian blackout should make us think about | Tony Wood</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.climateinstitute.org.au/verve/_resources/TCI_A-Switch-In-Time_Final.pdf\">There was the Climate Institute modelling</a>, which found he needed to phase out high-carbon generation over the next 15 to 20 years or else face a crunch so severe after 2030 that it would cause severe economic disruption.<br></p> <p>And t<a href=\"http://www.reputex.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/0916_RepuTex-White-Paper_Framing-Australias-energy-policy-mix-to-2030-1.pdf\">here was the recent Reputex report,</a> which also concluded the Coalition\u2019s current policies cannot reach its own targets, even factoring in the state-based renewable energy schemes Turnbull so criticises. It says he desperately needs a credible and consistent national policy, including measures to reduce emissions from power generation much faster. Who knew?<br></p> <p>Of course the government has to find ways to shift generation from fossil fuels to renewables while ensuring we keep the lights on, and while trying to minimise the increase in power costs.<br></p> <p>It could, for example, start the switch with an intensity-based emissions trading scheme for the electricity sector, which is Labor party policy and would therefore win bipartisan support, is <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/turnbull-wheels-out-hybrid-model-20090810-efmx.html\">very similar to the policy Turnbull proposed as opposition leader in 2009</a>, and which the energy market regulator \u2013 the Australian Energy Market Commission \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.aemc.gov.au/getattachment/5f6f00b4-709e-47c7-8daa-5bcdf31cfacd/Submission-to-Emissions-Reduction-Fund-Safeguard-M.aspx\">recommended he adopt last year</a> and said could operate \u201cwithout a significant effect on absolute price levels faced by consumers\u201d. (It is also something the government\u2019s \u201cDirect Action\u201d could be converted into, and most in the business community are assuming it will be.)<br></p> <p>It could extend the current watered-down federal renewable energy target, which ends in 2020.<br></p> <p>And Turnbull and his energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, absolutely should urgently consider how to make sure the electricity grid is better able to cope with increasingly frequent bouts of extreme weather.<br></p> <p>But whatever Turnbull does has to involve convincing the climate sceptics in his own party that change \u2013 and some impact on power prices \u2013 is inevitable.<br></p> <p>Backing in their belief that renewable energy can\u2019t keep the lights on is a bad way to start. When Malcolm Roberts, the One Nation senator and former project leader of the climate-sceptic Galileo movement, tweets how great it is that Turnbull is \u201ccoming around to One Nation\u2019s position\u201d that\u2019s not a good thing, not if the prime minister meant anything he said on this subject in the past or has any intention of keeping the promises he made in Paris.<br></p> <p>And whichever way he does it, he will still have to shift electricity generation to renewables, at least as quickly as the state targets are suggesting.<br></p> <p>The longer the delays, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/03/gaping-chasm-between-coalitions-climate-mantra-and-the-real-debate\">mired in the grand delusion that his current policy is fit for purpose</a>, and the more he entertains the view of his conservative wing that renewable energy is just some kind of leftwing plot to take the country back to the dark ages, the bigger the economic shock and disruption when Australia finally gets around to doing what it has to.<br></p> <p>In his attack on the states this week, Turnbull said \u201cYou\u2019ve got to take ideology out of it. You\u2019ve got to work out what you want to achieve and then make sure that your measures will deliver that for you.\u201d<br></p> <p>Exactly right. But what his government has done so far is the definition of putting ideology before sensible policy planning. That\u2019s irresponsible, not the states\u2019 attempts to fill a policy vacuum of the Coalition\u2019s making.<br></p>",
  "<p>Shares in Deutsche Bank have gyrated wildly before closing sharply higher amid speculation the embattled German lender was on the brink of a deal with the US authorities over a decade-old mis-selling scandal that would be less damaging to its finances.</p> <p>On a day of big swings on the market, shares in Germany\u2019s biggest bank initially slumped as much as 9% on Friday to leave the stock below the key \u20ac10 (\u00a38.65) level.

An Agence France-Presse report suggested the bank might be doing a deal with the DoJ to pay just over a third of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/16/european-banking-shares-unsettled-by-deutsche-bank-fine-fears\">$14bn (\u00a310.8bn) penalty that was originally suggested</a> by the DoJ.</p> <p>Cryan said there were \u201cforces in the market\u201d trying to destabilise the bank after its shares plunged to 30-year lows amid fears it would not be able to afford to pay $14bn. </p> <p>The AFP report said that Cryan was on the brink of agreeing a penalty of $5.4bn with the DoJ.</p> <p>Cryan \u2013 a Briton who has been at the helm of Deutsche for 15 months \u2013 fired off his <a href=\"https://www.db.com/newsroom_news/2016/medien/media-reports-on-deutsche-bank-a-message-to-employees-from-john-cryan-en-11702.htm\">memo</a> to staff after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/29/commerzbank-job-cuts-restructuring\">a Bloomberg report rattled nerves by revealing 10 hedge funds had taken some business away from the bank.</a> \u201cOur bank has become subject to speculation. Ongoing rumours are causing significant swings in our stock price. It is our task now to prevent distorted perception from further interrupting our daily business. Trust is the foundation of banking. Some forces in the markets are currently trying to damage this trust,\u201d said Cryan.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe rumors that are out there that Deutsche Bank is going to get a better deal ... I think is adding some positive effect into the market,\u201d said Jonathan Corpina, senior managing partner for Meridian Equity Partners in New York. \u201cI think people were fearful and concerned about what the outcome of this is going to be.\u201d <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/sep/30/deutsche-bank-fears-stock-markets-shares-slide-business-live\">Deutsche Bank fears rattle stock markets; UK growth revised up \u2013 business live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Deutsche\u2019s plight has prompted fears that global markets are facing turmoil of the kind triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers eight years ago this month. While Lehman\u2019s boss also blamed speculators, Cryan argued Deutsche was strong while policymakers also insisted any comparison is unfair.</p> <p> Deutsche\u2019s gyrations initially prompted a knock-on effect in the UK, with shares in Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 both of which face a similar investigation by the DoJ \u2013 falling sharply before regaining their losses. </p> <p>The FTSE 100 also clawed back lost ground. After slumping100 points it ended 20 points lower. Germany\u2019s Dax index ended 1% higher.<br></p> <p>But in an indication of the anxiety in the market the price of bonds which Deutsche can use to bolster its financial strength in times of crisis \u2013 known as CoCos \u2013 plunged to new lows. </p> <p>From the moment the $14bn penalty was demanded Cryan has insisted the bank would not pay that amount. Reports this week \u2013 strenuously denied \u2013 suggested the bank had approached the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, for help and sparked a fresh round of concern about its financial strength.</p> <p>Cryan insisted there was \u201cno basis for this speculation\u201d as he set out four factors to support Deutsche\u2019s \u201cstrong fundamentals\u201d. He said its restructuring was on track \u2013 including the sale of UK business Abbey Life this week; that the bank had reduced its exposure to risky clients; that it had made \u20ac1bn of first-half profits; and it had \u20ac215bn of easy-to-sell assets in times of crisis.</p> <p>\u201cYou will hear back from me soon. Please keep working as you have been doing so far,\u201d he told staff, 7,000 of whom work in London.</p> <p>With Deutsche\u2019s shares down 50% this year, Cryan has been under pressure from some analysts to accelerate his restructuring programme to cope with the low interest rate environment. Cryan is expected to attend the International Monetary Fund meeting next week.</p> <p>Analysts at Credit Suisse said the share price reaction was overdone as the penalty would eventually be reduced from $14bn. \u201cWe have modelled \u20ac4bn for this issue,\u201d they said, and calculated that Deutsche could afford to pay \u20ac9bn \u201cbefore breaching minimum capital requirements, a comfortable cushion in our view\u201d.</p> <p>But even once the penalty is agreed, the bank will still face investor angst. Analysts said Deutsche might still need more capital, identifying a \u20ac7bn shortfall to Cryan\u2019s capital targets for 2018.</p> <p>The bank has set aside \u20ac5.5bn for litigation but not all of this is for the current situation.</p> <p>Deutsche is one of a number of European banks facing a possible penalty for mis-selling of US residential mortgage-backed securities, including Barclays and RBS. </p> <p>The Financial Times reported on Friday that the DoJ was aiming to wrap any settlement with Deutsche into one with Barclays and Swiss bank Credit Suisse and have it completed before the US presidential election on 8 November. </p> <p>Bailed-out RBS, which could take a hit of as much as \u00a39bn, said earlier this week it was not in settlement talks.</p>",
  "<p>HBO\u2019s newest drama series, Westworld, premieres this Sunday. No, I have not seen it yet.

It's cowboy time</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I really wanted to be able to discuss the gorgeous cinematography, astounding acting, and thought-provoking thematic material with you, but I can\u2019t. I begged \u2013 literally begged \u2013 for an advance copy. Let this be a lesson to each and every one of you: shaming yourself in order to get what you want only works when you\u2019re 10.</p> <p>Fortunately for me (and my editors) Westworld is a remake of a 1973 motion picture written and directed by Jurassic Park author Michael Crichton. That\u2019s been discussed throughout the marketing of this series, but what hasn\u2019t been brought up much at all is that this isn\u2019t the first time Hollywood has tried to milk more content out of this intellectual property cash cow. It\u2019s not even the first television adaptation of Westworld. If I can\u2019t watch Westworld, the HBO show, I can pay $30 on Amazon for Beyond Westworld, the atrocious CBS series from 1980 that was canceled after airing only three episodes. What you will find as you go on this incredible journey with me is that if the HBO Westworld series is any good, based on its predecessors, it will be something of a miracle.</p> <h2>Westworld</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmbYjVy9Xcg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pmbYjVy9Xcg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The original Westworld stars Richard Benjamin and James Brolin as two unrepentant bros who just want to have a good time drinking whisky and having sex with robots, so they drop $1,000 a day to visit the Delos amusement park, where all your period-specific dreams can come true thanks to the magic of modern technology. The first difference between the HBO series and this film is that Westworld is one of three parks in the Delos complex. There\u2019s also Romanworld, which subtly promotes the fact that you can have robo-orgies \u2013 though I imagine there will be at least one orgy on the new Westworld, because it airs on HBO \u2013 and Medievalworld, where you can eat rotting meat and contract the plague. Personally, I\u2019d rather they switch out Medievalworld for Homeworld, a park where your parents love you unconditionally, everyone you went to high school with has gained weight, and your dad hasn\u2019t thrown away your Limp Bizkit poster and turned your room into a dumping ground for his old copies of Rolling Stone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/04/thandie-newton-i-wake-up-angry-theres-a-lot-to-be-angry-about\">Thandie Newton: \u2018I wake up angry \u2013 there\u2019s a lot to be angry about\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The operators of Delos believe their system is foolproof. All the firearms have a heat sensor, so they won\u2019t fire if they detect their target is a warm-blooded human being. Pretty much everything in the park is a robot, even the horses. I suppose the horses are robots so that guests can murder them too. It must be someone\u2019s fantasy.</p> <p>As fun as the killing seems to be for the guests, it\u2019s the erotic element that really gets them going. Majel Barrett, wife of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, shows up as the operator of the brothel that our protagonists enjoy before all hell breaks loose and the robots turn on their masters. At first, Benjamin\u2019s character, Peter, is hesitant to have sex with a machine. \u201dI\u2019m going to tell you something. I\u2019m not sure if it matters, but it matters to me,\u201d Peter says to one of the \u201cgirls\u201d. You never forget your first time \u2026 with a robot.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40CUuyOxUZs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/40CUuyOxUZs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>After doing an autopsy on a robo-snake that\u2019s malfunctioned and started biting guests, the scientists who run Delos realize that the machines are beginning to rebel against their programming. Worse yet, a maiden in Medievalworld refuses the sexual advances of a guest! Shocking! \u201cCastle machine refuses the guest\u2019s seduction,\u201d a park operator says. If you squint hard enough, this movie is a sly satire of gender politics. Most of the park guests are male and indulge in misogynistic, coarse and violent behavior. Once you stop squinting, you can go back to enjoying the killer androids.</p> <p>In the climax of the film, the robots finally snap, though no specific reason is given for their deviation from programming. They just start killing people. Well, the horses don\u2019t. The horses continue functioning like horses. What I wouldn\u2019t give to have a scene where a horse bites a guy\u2019s leg off added to this film. </p> <p>It should be noted that the first hour and 10 minutes of Westworld is just guys having a great time playing dress-up. There\u2019s no real action until the last 20 minutes, so hopefully you have a high tolerance for people enjoying themselves in a drama-free environment. James Brolin\u2019s character is murdered by the Gunslinger, a black hat cowboy robot played by Yul Brynner. The final 15 minutes of the film are the Gunslinger \u2013 who has been killed twice already, repaired and sent back into service \u2013 chasing Peter through the park. The whole concept of an unstoppable murderous machine hunting down human prey would be borrowed from this and used in The Terminator.</p> <p>Peter kills the Gunslinger and is left alone with the horror he\u2019s just witnessed \u2013 something of a downbeat ending, which was popular with sci-fi in the 70s. The Westworld movie is a bit dull, but conjures up a fascinating concept \u2013 pleasure robots that humans treat callously rise up against them \u2013 that will hopefully be explored to the fullest in the HBO show. At the end of the film, it\u2019s clear that Westworld was a terrible idea. Surely, no one would go back to Delos after such carnage \u2026</p> <h2>Futureworld</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTMtu4Z5T-U\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lTMtu4Z5T-U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Wrong again! Not only has Delos not closed, they\u2019ve expanded! After an undetermined period of time since the robot disaster depicted in the first film, Delos has closed Westworld and added a park called Futureworld in its place. Journalists played by Peter Fonda (who sleepwalks his way through the whole movie like he just ate an edible an hour before cameras rolled) and Blythe Danner are invited to Delos to see the new park and report back about how safe it is. Except, Fonda has been tipped off that not all is as it seems at Delos, so he spends the runtime of the film sneaking around the park, hoping to uncover some dastardly plot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/06/sci-fi-author-predict-future-notes-queries\">Which sci-fi author has come closest to predicting the future?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOnce you make it with a robot chick, you don\u2019t want nothin\u2019 else,\u201d a drunk park guest says to Danner\u2019s character on the airplane to Delos. Again, the most fascinating aspect of artificial intelligence in the 1970s apparently was whether or not we could do it with them.</p> <p>The Futureworld theme park looks incredibly lame and it has no effect on the plot whatsoever. I guess it\u2019s just a cool-sounding title, so the producers went with it. There\u2019s a simulator that imagines what it would be like to ski on Mars, holographic chess, and a life-sized game of Rock \u2019em Sock \u2019em Robots. All of this takes place in one room. It\u2019s not so much a world as it is Elon Musk\u2019s creepy bachelor pad.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkg-3emsve8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vkg-3emsve8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>There\u2019s a ton of jokes at the expense of newspapers in Futureworld. Fonda\u2019s character is a newspaper reporter, but Danner plays a TV host, so she spends quite a bit of time putting down his archaic profession. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you wise up mister? Nobody reads,\u201d she says. I guess this does take place in the future.</p> <p>In order to prevent further tragedies, Delos has replaced all of its workers with robots. So, robots in the park and robots running the park. If the initial problem was robots, is the solution really more robots? This all starts to make more sense when it is discovered that Delos has been co-opted by robots who are hoping to replace all world leaders with robo-clones because they think humanity will eventually destroy the planet. Once I hear this, I immediately side with the robots.</p> <p>This is a terribly boring film that\u2019s only worth watching if you\u2019re as high as Peter Fonda was when he made it. The best/worst scene comes around the two-thirds mark, as Blythe Danner is placed into a dream state while they clone her to ensure positive coverage for Delos. Her dream has to be seen to be believed. She has tied herself up with a red rope and is pursued by, you guessed it, Yul Brynner as the Gunslinger, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgUFwmrnLnM\">who lassoes her with the red rope and eventually has sex with her</a>. Wait, you didn\u2019t guess? You\u2019re saying this makes no sense? You\u2019re wondering how something so obviously stupid could make it into a Hollywood movie? Huh.</p> <h2>Beyond Westworld</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIco8YEWg44\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TIco8YEWg44?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>If you have seen the great British sitcom Garth Marenghi\u2019s Darkplace, you\u2019ve seen Beyond Westworld \u2013 a stupendously dull early 80s cheesefest with wooden acting, clunky dialogue and a noticeable lack of action. The show ignores Futureworld completely and takes place immediately after the original film. It recasts the Gunslinger for a throwaway action scene in the pilot. It retcons the Delos corporation into benevolent machine overlords who merely want to give humankind as much dude-on-robot sex as it can handle. In the show, the reason why the robots malfunctioned is because a scientist who supervised the creation of the Delos machines is upset that they\u2019re being used as \u201ctoys\u201d, so he made them rebel. He\u2019s also placed hundreds of androids across the world to further his aims of global domination. Only some generic hero can stop him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/sep/04/star-trek--50-year-mission-best-of-humankind\">Star Trek\u2019s 50-year mission: to shine a light on the best of humankind</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since it was on broadcast TV, there\u2019s thankfully way less obvious robo-sex talk, though the pun quotient goes up by the power of 20. \u201cI\u2019m very good, technically,\u201d female Delos employee Laura Garvey says in the pilot. \u201cI assure you, my equipment has been thoroughly checked \u2026 by naval security before we got on board,\u201d Garvey tells a submarine officer in the third act. This character is not a robot, though she might have been revealed as such later on in the series if: A) it didn\u2019t get canceled after three atrocious episodes; and B) she hadn\u2019t been recast when the show went to series.

Our best story (and almost unquestionably our only thing approaching a story) concerned Liam\u2019s decision to enliven a Westminster reception by telling a joke. \u201cWhat do you call four dogs and a blackbird?\u201d he inquired. \u201cThe Spice Girls!\u201d Apologies for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/16/johnson-davis-fox-three-brexiteers\">repetition</a> so soon, but it seems worth reminding people that a man who would tell that joke in front of journalists at Westminster in the year 2000 is now the chap whose judgment is trusted on reshaping our trade relationship with the world. If your expectations of his performance are not already commuted, do feel free to adjust them further now.</p> <p>This week found Dr Fox snapping on his rubber examination gloves again, with two <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/29/liam-fox-looks-to-wto-in-hint-at-hard-brexit-stance\">major speeches on trade</a> post-Brexit \u2013 in the course of which he was forced to defend his golf comments. \u201cWhen I was a doctor,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37504966\">he explained</a>, \u201cmy job was not to tell people what they wanted to hear. It was to tell them what they needed to hear so we could in order to put things right. If it applies to medicine, why do the same ethics not apply to politics? A question I have always wondered.\u201d Always? I do hope he hasn\u2019t lavished too much contemplation down the years on this somewhat slight philosophical point.</p> <p>Still, his analogy does prompt a reworking of the old advice: general practitioner, heal thyself. Just as his effort at the World Trade Organisation had earlier in the week, the speech offered a chance for Dr Fox to showcase the limits of his vision, but ignore anyone trying to put him right. The UK will seek bespoke trade deals, he declared, though he failed to offer a clue as to what would be done until those were achieved. His address was composed largely of telltale generalities \u2013 \u201cthe glorious joy of free trade\u201d; \u201ca <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/sep/29/capitas-stellar-reputation-has-lost-some-of-its-shine\">post-geography world</a>\u201d; \u201cholistic\u201d \u2013 and the lurches into specifics were even less well advised.

  "<p>Savour your morning juice and coffee this weekend, because the price of your favourite breakfast drinks may be on the way up.</p> <p>Unfavourable weather in Brazil \u2013 varying from droughts to heavy rainfall and frosts \u2013 has driven up the price of coffee, sugar and orange juice around the world by more than 20% in the past few months.</p> <p>The London traded November futures contract on robusta beans, the type mostly used to make instant coffee, has risen by a third since June to $2,027 (\u00a31,561) a tonne on the ICE exchange after the main growing areas of Espirito Santo and Bahia were hit by drought, leaving farmers with only half their potential crop. </p> <p>The recent rise in price was also driven by concerns about next year\u2019s crop. With reservoirs dry or nearly empty in the regions, farmers have been reliant on annual rains to provide the moisture needed to kickstart coffee plants\u2019 flowering season, and there has been precious little precipitation.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been rain but it\u2019s not enough to repair the damage,\u201d said Carlos Mera, a commodities analyst at Rabobank.</p> <p>Brazil is the world\u2019s biggest producer of high quality arabica coffee and the second largest grower of robusta beans. More than a quarter of coffee imported to the UK comes from Brazil. </p> <p>The country also produces 80% of the oranges traded on worldwide markets, more than half of which head to Europe, and exports nearly three times more sugar than any other country.</p> <p>The price of orange juice concentrate has risen 21% since June to more than $2 a lb on the New York futures market, a level described as \u201castronomically high\u201d by Andres Padilla, a senior commodities analyst at Rabobank based in Brazil. Padilla says prices have not been close to this level since 2006. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b72870252fcf15c1cd020365735aacd2992d08c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b72870252fcf15c1cd020365735aacd2992d08c7/22_2065_2460_1476/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Orange juice, with orange\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The price of orange juice concentrate has risen 21% since June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although globally we are drinking 4% to 5% less orange juice every year, production fell by a fifth in Brazil in the latest harvest year which finished in June, and by nearly a quarter in the world\u2019s second biggest producing region \u2013 Florida.</p> <p>Both areas were affected by the tree-killing Huanglongbing bug, better known as citrus greening. Brazil\u2019s harvest was already expected to be down year-on-year because of the bug, but as the crop was processed it emerged that heavy rains had left oranges with lower sugar content so that it takes more fruit to make each tonne of concentrate, the commodity exported around the world.</p> <p> \u201cAlthough demand is shrinking as the consumer is shifting to other products, there is more competition for orange juice as supply is shrinking faster than demand,\u201d said Padilla.</p> <p>Padilla added that prices were likely to stay high as several years of poor harvests meant that stocks of frozen juice built up in better years, before 2012, were now dwindling. Farmers in Brazil have also been tearing up trees and replacing them with more profitable crops such as sugar cane.</p> <p>Meanwhile, sugar is up 22% since June to about 23.5c per lb as weather problems in Brazil have combined with concerns about production in India to push up prices.</p> <p>Some sugar cane was harvested prematurely in early September after frosts in Brazil, and the harvest was also affected by extreme heat and dry weather earlier in the year. In some regions, yields were as much as 12% below expectations, according to Rabobank.</p> <p> Jara Zicha, a commodities analyst at Mintec, said sugar prices had risen amid \u201cexpectations that the global market will be in a supply deficit for the second consecutive year in 2016-17 and stocks will fall to six-year lows.\u201d </p> <p>As he reported Sainsbury\u2019s quarterly sales figures this week, the supermarket\u2019s chief executive Mike Coupe reflected industry fears about price rises, pointing to a potential rise in coffee prices while other foodstuffs may fall.</p> <p>One supermarket source said it was not clear that commodity prices would feed through directly to supermarket shelves as retailers were facing tough pricing pressures from rival chains. All the major supermarkets are trying to fight back against the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl by reducing prices on basics such as fruit, veg, tea and coffee, and so may be forced to absorb higher commodity costs.</p>",

All of this is completely unclear.\u201d</p> <p>The MEP, who sits on the European parliament\u2019s international trade committee, led Labour MEPs in voting against a motion on TTIP, because of concerns over giving too much power to foreign investors and diluting environmental and health standards.

These fears were crystallised when tobacco company Philip Morris used an international trade-dispute-resolution system, in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/18/australia-wins-international-legal-battle-with-philip-morris-over-plain-packaging\">attempt to overturn Australia\u2019s plain-packaging laws for cigarettes</a>. In response, the European commission called for a special trade court to replace the current system, which dates back to the 1960s. The commission says its proposed Investment Court System would be more transparent and efficient. But critics argue it is no better than the current system.

  "<p>South Korean women are neither especially diminutive nor remarkably lofty. With a mean height of 162.3cm, they are 12.5cm taller than their Filipina peers, and 7.5cm shorter than Latvian women.

In contrast, under-nourished Filipinas <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.ph/about-us/media-and-publications/press-releases/media-release-archive/years/2015/filipino-shortness-attributed-to-generations-of-stunted-and-malnourished-children-save-the-children-report\" title=\"\">are still associated with \u201cshortness\u201d</a>. Even within a community, cultural factors \u2013 such as an eldest son preference in South Asia \u2013 can <a href=\"http://epod.cid.harvard.edu/files/epod/files/pande_r_-_why_are_children_so_short_rwp15_016.pdf\" title=\"\">lead to marked differences in height outcomes</a>.</p> <p>This is not a question of mere vanity. What really matters is not how tall one can grow, but whether one fails to grow as expected. More than 160 million of the world\u2019s under-fives are stunted. In India 39% of children are stunted and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 70%. Though stunting is a physical measure, and is associated with the <a href=\"http://unicef.in/Whatwedo/10/Stunting#sthash.AZBwDFdJ.dpuf\" title=\"\">increased risk of some chronic diseases</a> such as diabetes in future, it is also an important indicator that mental development may have been affected. Their brains are unable to make the neural connections that they should; their cognitive ability does not blossom. Malnourished children also have little energy, further diminishing their ability to learn and escape poverty. Research suggests they are less likely to be enrolled in school, <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(07)60032-4/fulltext\" title=\"\">and learn less</a> when they are there.</p> <p>It is obvious why this bothers the World Health Organisation. But now the World Bank\u2019s president is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/30/world-bank-name-and-shame-countries-fail-stunted-children\" title=\"\">threatening to name and shame</a> countries which fail to address the problem. Jim Yong Kim, a former doctor, says that stunting is not only the outcome of the unfair distribution of resources: it drives such imbalances, too, since inequality is \u201cbaked into the brains\u201d of a quarter of children before they reach the age of five. The problem is not only humanitarian, but economic. And it is in the interest of governments to act - even if they are looking at the narrowest possible measures of national success \u2013 because they cannot compete if large portions of their workforces are stunted. Dr Kim\u2019s ambitious goal is to halve stunting in seven years and end it in 14. A World Bank-sponsored <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/30/the-country-that-cracked-its-stunting-crisis\" title=\"\">programme in Peru</a>, targeting families from pregnancy onwards, slashed stunting rates by giving conditional cash transfers to mothers, allowing them \u2013 and educating them \u2013 to give their children nutritious food and stimulate them through play. Health clinics were given incentives to support them. Swift action can bring immense benefits to a generation.

  "<p>One of Iran\u2019s most respected chess players has hit back at calls to boycott next year\u2019s women\u2019s world championship in Tehran over rules about the wearing of the hijab.</p> <p>A number of chess players, including the US women\u2019s champion, Naz\u00ed Paikidze, have called for a boycott of the February 2017 games over concerns that they will have to comply with the Islamic republic\u2019s compulsory headscarf law. </p> <p>But Mitra Hejazipour, a woman grandmaster (WGM) who won the 2015 Asian continental women\u2019s championship, told the Guardian on Friday that a boycott would be wrong and could undermine hard-fought efforts to promote female sport in Iran.</p> <p>\u201cThis is going to be the biggest sporting event women in Iran have ever seen; we haven\u2019t been able to host any world championship in other sporting fields for women in the past,\u201d Hejazipour, 23, said from Tehran. \u201cIt\u2019s not right to call for a boycott. These games are important for women in Iran; it\u2019s an opportunity for us to show our strength.\u201d</p> <p>Her comments were echoed by Ghoncheh Ghavami, a British-Iranian woman who spent five months in jail in Iran for campaigning to allow women to watch men\u2019s volleyball games in stadiums. </p> <p>Ghavami, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/02/british-iranian-goncheh-ghavami-jailed-volleyball-game-charges-dropped-iran\">whose time in jail drew international attention</a>, said from Tehran: \u201cThe world must hear the pro-reform voices of people inside Iran and not ignore these pleas by isolating the country.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/28/iranian-women-hate-hijab-tehranbureau\">Why so many Iranians have come to hate the hijab</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ghavami said millions of people in Iran believed in women\u2019s right to choose whether or not to wear the hijab and had shown their opposition to the policy. She was referring to women <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/20/influx-of-morality-police-to-patrol-the-streets-of-tehran\">risking arrest by defying the morality police</a> and lobbying to obtain social rights such as being able to play more sports. </p> <p>Calls to boycott the country would only serve to hurt women in Iran, she added. \u201cI am firmly against the international community using the compulsory hijab as a means to put pressure and isolate Iran.</p> <p>\u201cDay by day, Iranian women are becoming more empowered and are pushing aside traditional, legal and political discrimination \u2026 Those who are worried for the situation of human rights in Iran, if they are really serious, have to acknowledge these efforts and see these capacities.\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Wearing the hijab has been an integral policy of the Islamic republic since the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iranian-revolution\">1979 revolution</a>.

If Iran can host this event, it will be a big step for us; it will help our women chess players and it will boost women in other sporting fields. It will pave the way for them, too.\u201d</p> <p>Elham Yazdiha, a Turkey-based Iranian sports journalist, said she was confident Hejazipour\u2019s view reflected the voice of sportswomen in Iran. \u201cCalls for a boycott will only disappoint Iranian women and destroy their hopes,\u201d she said. </p> <p>It was a shame, Yazdiha added, that Iranian sportswomen who were already facing restrictions at home faced additional restrictions from abroad. Iranian female basketball players have been barred by international bodies from playing in world events because of wearing the hijab.</p> <p>Women can vote and drive in Iran but discriminatory laws persist. In court their testimony is worth only half that of a man and they also face inequality over inheritance rights. But they have a strong presence in civil society. Women in Iran have held senior government jobs; the country currently has a number of female vice-presidents and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/29/iran-elect-record-number-women-parliament-parvaneh-salahshori\">one female ambassador</a>. </p> <p>Despite the restrictions, many people in Iran are proud of representing their country.

  "<p>A UN negotiation is inching towards a landmark deal to curb emissions from airplanes, although environmental groups have warned that the plan will not go far enough to help slow climate change.</p> <p> The <a href=\"http://www.icao.int/Pages/default.aspx\">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> (ICAO), a UN agency, has gathered more than 2,000 government officials from around the world at its Montreal headquarters to adopt the first ever international mechanism to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from aviation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/26/epa-ruling-on-aircraft-emissions-paves-way-for-new-regulations\">EPA ruling on aircraft emissions paves way for new regulations</a> </p> </aside>  <p> A market-based scheme has been proposed at the triennial meeting whereby emissions from aviation will be measured from a baseline to be set in 2020. Emissions that exceed this level will then have to be offset by all countries, with exceptions for developing nations, unless they choose to volunteer. </p> <p> So far, <a href=\"http://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Pages/market-based-measures.aspx\">63 countries have pledged to join the scheme from its outset</a>, including the US, China, Japan and Canada. The European Union has also voiced its support. A draft text <a href=\"http://www.icao.int/Meetings/a39/Documents/WP/wp_052_en.pdf\">has been put forward</a> with a final version of the deal expected to be decided upon next week.</p> <p> Global aviation currently moves 10 million passengers around every day, pumping out enough emissions to contribute 1.3% to the overall total of greenhouse gases emitted from all sources, including power generation and agriculture. Aviation\u2019s emissions share is expected to leap to 22% by 2050, placing growing pressure on the sector to help the world avoid further global warming.</p> <p> But environmental groups have criticized the ICAO plan as \u201cincredibly weak\u201d and warned that it will do little to limit pollution unless it is significantly ramped up. They argue that more countries need to sign up in order to honor the goals set at the Paris climate agreement last year. </p> <p> \u201cIn Paris, world leaders put great faith into ICAO to deliver emissions reductions from international aviation. Global aviation needs to step up and agree to a plan that matches the demands of science,\u201d said Lou Leonard, interim deputy leader for WWF\u2019s climate and energy practice.</p> <p> \u201cBut without broad participation, the proposed deal represents a low bar for an international climate agreement. The clock is ticking; the best way to strengthen the deal at this point is the added benefit of additional countries opting in.\u201d</p> <p> There has also been criticism of the structure of the plan itself. Participating countries will have to ensure airlines offset emissions by backing carbon-reducing activities elsewhere, rather than use technology to cut the emissions from aircraft fuel. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/29/air-pollution-from-europes-planes-set-to-rise-by-nearly-half\">Air pollution from Europe's planes set to rise by nearly half</a> </p> </aside>  <p> All emissions up to the 2020 level will not have to be offset, despite probably representing the vast bulk of future emissions, and nations that volunteer to take part can opt out with six months\u2019 notice.</p> <p>Vera Pardee, a campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity, said: \u201cThis is a dangerous dodge that does little more than help airlines hide their skyrocketing threat to our climate. </p> <p>\u201cInstead of employing the host of technologies that actually reduce aircraft pollution, the aviation industry has sold us a highly dubious offset scheme that simply passes off its exploding carbon debt to someone else.\u201d</p> <p> The <a href=\"http://icsa-aviation.org/\">International Coalition on Sustainable Aviation</a>, an environmental observer of the UN talks, has warned that the deal could still allow absolute international aviation emissions to increase until at least 2035, meaning that more work needs to be done \u201cin order to ratchet the level of ambition up\u201d.</p> <p> But the <a href=\"http://www.iata.org/Pages/default.aspx\">International Air Transport Association</a>, which represents airlines, said that the offset scheme is a \u201cpragmatic compromise\u201d that will deliver carbon neutral growth from 2020. </p> <p> Alexandre de Juniac, director general of the trade association, said the deal \u201calong with measures to improve technology, operations and infrastructure, will keep aviation at the forefront of industries responsibly managing their climate change impact\u201d.</p> <p> The airline industry has a goal to improve average fuel efficiency by 1.5% to 2020. But green groups believe airlines could do much more \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theicct.org/blogs/staff/reading-the-tea-leaves-ICAO-MBM\">a recent study from the International Council on Clean Transportation</a> found that fuel consumption in new aircraft designs could be slashed by 25% in 2024 using new technologies.</p>",

That is causing unjustified concerns. We should consider this in the context of the bigger picture: Deutsche Bank overall has more than 20 million clients.<br><br>I understand if you feel concerned by the extensive coverage on this issue. <strong>Our bank has become subject to speculation. Ongoing rumours are causing significant swings in our stock price.</strong><br><br>It is our task now to prevent distorted perception from further interrupting our daily business. Trust is the foundation of banking. Some forces in the markets are currently trying to damage this trust.<br><br>Deutsche Bank has strong fundamentals. Let me mention some of the most important facts at this point:<br></p> <ol> <li><strong>We fulfil all current capital requirements and our restructuring is well on track.</strong> We completed the disposal of the British insurer Abbey Life this week and the sale of our stake in the Chinese Hua Xia Bank will be finalised soon. This will further improve our capital ratio.</li> <li><strong>We have significantly decreased our market and credit risk in recent years</strong>. At no point in the last two decades has the balance sheet of Deutsche Bank been as stable as it is today.</li> <li><strong>Despite low interest rates and a difficult environment we posted a pre-tax profit of about 1 billion euros in the first half of 2016.</strong> Before extraordinary items like restructuring costs, we earned about 1.7 billion euros. This demonstrates the operating strength of Deutsche Bank.</li> <li><strong>In a situation like this, the most important factor is our liquidity reserves</strong>. Currently they still amount to more than 215 billion euros. This is an extremely comfortable buffer. This is clear proof of how conservatively we have planned. This is acknowledged by numerous banking analysts.</li> </ol> <p>There is therefore no basis for this speculation. Nor can uncertainty about the outcome of our litigation cases in the US explain this pressure on our stock price, <strong>if we take the settlements of our peers as a benchmark.</strong><br><br>You have all done a tremendous job over the past few days.

  "<p>The northern powerhouse risks being derailed by the government\u2019s \u201cabsolute paranoia\u201d over Heathrow expansion and an \u201cover-emphasis on the south-east at the expense of everywhere else\u201d, the managing director of Manchester airport has said.<br></p> <p>In a stark message to Theresa May, who is due to decide this month on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/heathrow-third-runway\">contentious third runway at Heathrow airport</a>, Ken O\u2019Toole said ministers needed to draw up a national aviation policy to address the north-south economic divide.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe need to be careful that the north and the UK as a whole is not overshadowed again by the south-east,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019re not careful that\u2019s just going to take over.\u201d</p> <p>Ministers are set to decide later in October where to allow a new runway in the south-east of England after decades of procrastinating. Expansion at Heathrow airport is expected to be given the green light instead of a rival Gatwick airport plan, despite widespread opposition.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, O\u2019Toole said he was confident May\u2019s government was supportive of ex-chancellor George Osborne\u2019s northern powerhouse agenda \u2013 but said there was a lack of a national aviation policy behind the strategy.</p> <p>\u201cIf you really want to drive the northern powerhouse, if you really want to drive the recalibration of north and south, Heathrow ain\u2019t the answer \u2013 it\u2019s Manchester airport,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I would isolate it to Manchester being overlooked \u2013 there seems to be this absolute paranoia or over-emphasis on the south-east to the expense of everywhere else. How can you say you\u2019ve got a national economic strategy if your aviation strategy seems to be over-emphasised on the south-east?\u201d</p> <p>In the fierce PR battle over the third runway, Heathrow has said that <a href=\"https://your.heathrow.com/takingbritainfurther/jobs-and-growth/uk-benefits-by-region/\">expanding its airport would deliver \u00a312.5bn of growth</a> to the north-west compared to Gatwick\u2019s \u00a38.6bn by 2050. But Manchester airport bosses say it will deliver more than \u00a370bn for the region over the same period, nearly six times the figure put forward by Heathrow.</p> <p>Pointing out that the \u00a316.8bn Heathrow scheme could take up to 20 years before it is built, O\u2019Toole said there was \u201ca gap in terms of an aviation policy that\u2019s going to make best use of what\u2019s in the UK for those 15 to 20 years while we\u2019re waiting for something to come along\u201d.<br></p> <p>Manchester airport is the third-biggest in the UK and the only hub, other than Heathrow, with two runways. Twenty five million passengers travel through Manchester airport every year but it has the capacity to carry 55 million, meaning it could overtake Gatwick to become the UK\u2019s second-biggest airport within 15 to 20 years. <br></p> <p>The airport was at the heart of former Osborne\u2019s northern powerhouse agenda, in part because it funnels as much as 60% of the business travel into the north of England. In October last year it hosted the Chinese president Xi Jinping on his state visit to the UK, when he launched a new direct flight from Manchester to Beijing \u2013 the first outside London.</p> <p>O\u2019Toole said the vote to leave the European Union would slow the airport\u2019s growth because airlines and passengers \u201cdon\u2019t like uncertainty\u201d. \u201cAirlines are deciding where to put planes and routes 12 to 18 months in advance,\u201d he said. \u201cThe longer the uncertainty goes on the more likely that the UK misses out.\u201d</p> <p>He urged Brexit minister David Davis to urgently clarify whether Britain will seek to remain part of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/mar/22/europeanunion.theairlineindustry\">historic EU open skies deal</a>, which lets airlines fly from anywhere in the US to anywhere in the EU. Withdrawing from the deal would potentially mean airlines such as easyJet or Jet2 having to negotiate individual deals for each country they fly to.</p> <p>O\u2019Toole, who is on the board of Manchester Airports Group, which owns London Stansted, east Midlands and Bournemouth airports, described the government\u2019s aviation policy to date as \u201csome progress, but a lot more to do\u201d. </p> <p>He said: \u201cDo we have integrated road, rail and airports? No. Do we have a taxation regime that supports and encourages airlines to bring capacity into the UK? No.</p> <p>\u201cDo we have an immigration service that while protecting the border, which is critical, actually makes it easy and appealing for people to visit the UK? I contend we don\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cIs it easy, cheap, quick and convenient to gain a visa to the UK? Again, it\u2019s improved. I\u2019m not saying there isn\u2019t progress being made but there is a lot more that could be done.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>This summer I travelled 400 miles on my paddleboard, covering the length of the country in 22 days, and carrying everything I needed \u2013 20kg of kit \u2013 on my board. I\u2019d do 20 miles a day, wild camping and waking up to beautiful views of the waterways of England, the stunning canals and rivers that carried me from Surrey to Cumbria, passing kingfishers, herons, hedgehogs and swans on the way.</p> <p>I\u2019d trained hard, but paddling 11 hours a day was exhausting. I travelled north on the advice of a friend, who thought the prevailing winds would help, but I ended up with gusts against me 90% of the way. This also meant my journey along the Thames was upstream. At the start, heavy rain and high winds made this incredibly difficult. You can\u2019t stop in the middle of a river when you\u2019re going upstream. It took a week of relentless paddling just to get past the Thames section and into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/gallery/2010/jun/22/canals-narrowboats-barges-history-photography\">Oxford canal</a>.<br></p> <p>By day 15, I couldn\u2019t clench my fists. This was the start of carpal tunnel syndrome. Some days it took hours for me to grip properly: my hands were like pincers as I tried to pull my leggings on each morning. The worst point was Heartbreak Hill: a stretch of the Trent and Mersey canal with 29 locks, which I had to do in a single day \u2013 hauling my board and equipment on and off the water every time. By lock six, I was sobbing. I felt tired, hungry, alone.

I had incredible adventures: trekking in China, horseriding in Outer Mongolia. It reignited my love for the outdoors and made me feel invincible. But three months after I returned to work, I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. This blindsided me. My thyroid was removed and I had radiotherapy. I went to stay with my dad on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/scilly\">Isles of Scilly</a>, to relax and recover.

Although I fell in a bit, it was easy to pick up. That\u2019s the beauty of paddleboarding \u2013 anyone can do it. And it\u2019s very safe: if you can\u2019t see the bottom of the sea, they say, you\u2019re too far out. It\u2019s not \u201ctrendy punting\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s Britain\u2019s fastest growing watersport for a good reason. People fall in love with it because, mentally and physically, it feels so beneficial, so calming. I love going out in groups, chatting, stopping for a picnic or a drink.</p> <p>When I came back to London, I found out you can paddleboard on canals and rivers, so in the evenings and weekends I\u2019d head out. That\u2019s when I noticed the amount of discarded plastic on the water. It isn\u2019t just an eyesore: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/02/plastic-waste-thames-marine-life-report\">it affects wildlife</a>. One day, I saw a coot\u2019s nest made up of as much plastic as twigs. I was horrified.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"48541eb944a96a0e7d83f0456352dafba6e6141e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48541eb944a96a0e7d83f0456352dafba6e6141e/0_0_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lizzie with her kit on the 400-mile odyssey \u2013 and some of the rubbish she picked up.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lizzie with her kit on the 400-mile odyssey \u2013 and some of the rubbish she picked up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Irwin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I wanted to draw attention to what is happening on our doorstep \u2013 to the canals and rivers that had been such places of comfort and restoration for me. So I decided to paddleboard the length of England, along its connected waterways, photographing every piece of plastic I saw, geo-tagging the location to create an online map that showed the scale of the problem. And anyone who wants to can add to the map.</p> <p>Although rubbish increased around towns and cities, even remote areas had plastic bags lurking in trees or bottles in the water. On the May bank holiday, I saw towpath bins overflowing with rubbish that blew into the canals.</p> <p><a href=\"http://lizzieoutside.co.uk/\">I\u2019m now on my next challenge</a>. I revisited the worst four spots \u2013 Tamworth, Coventry, Stoke-on-Trent and Manchester \u2013 and collected all the rubbish I saw. I spent seven hours on the banks of the Trent, near where I live, netting 600 or so bottles into a \u201ctrash raft\u201d which I then paddled along the river. The people I pass are always shocked to find out where the trash came from. The raft\u2019s sitting in my garden right now and I plan to go out on it again soon. It took a lot of work. It\u2019s going to be a family heirloom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00854e405e67c4bfdf047527606e0ab7a1064fdf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00854e405e67c4bfdf047527606e0ab7a1064fdf/0_0_3000_1875/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plastic patrol \u2026 the map of clogged Britain\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plastic patrol \u2026 the map of clogged Britain</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lizzie Carr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I still feel quite emotional about my 400-mile journey: people would hear about me and come to cheer. Strangers brought food, sent messages, donated money. A groundskeeper gave me whisky and some canoeists invited me for a bacon sandwich and a cup of tea.</p> <p>One of the best paddleboarding tips is to keep moving forward as soon as you\u2019re standing. That way, the board\u2019s more stable, easier to control. Paddle, don\u2019t idle. It\u2019s good advice for life.</p> <p><em> \u2022 Lizzie\u2019s campaign and map: <a href=\"http://lizzieoutside.co.uk/\">lizzieoutside.co.uk</a>. </em><em>Interview by Homa Khaleeli</em>.</p> <h2>Surf, sand and cider \u2026 Lizzie\u2019s favourite paddle spots</h2> <p><strong>Bryher, Isles of Scilly<br></strong>Paddling almost anywhere on Scilly, you will enjoy picturesque coastline and clear blue waters, but the tiny island of Bryher is spectacular. One side is pounded by the Atlantic and best avoided on a paddleboard, but the other, parallel to the island of Tresco, is all calm seas and sandy beaches \u2013 nothing but the sound of the water against the paddle and birds flying overhead (<em>board hire: <a href=\"http://bennettboatyard.com/\">bennettboatyard.com</a>).</em></p> <p><strong> Isle of Arran, Scotland</strong><br> A friend of mine paddled around Arran last year and, having seen the photos, it\u2019s been on my must-visit list ever since. Whiting Bay, he says, particularly the north section, was his favourite. It\u2019s a remote, quiet area with easy access and runs for more than two miles. The water is calm if the winds are easterly, but conditions can get hairy if they are coming from the other direction. <em>(<a href=\"http://adventurecarrick.com/\">adventurecarrick.com</a>)</em></p> <p><strong>Mumbles, Wales</strong><br> Paddleboarding in the Mumbles, south of Swansea, has a unique British seaside vibe and the lighthouse at the end of the bay really adds to the charm. The area is relatively sheltered and, as you paddle underneath a centuries-old pier listening to the gulls circling above and the chatter of people out for a stroll, you get a great sense of the seaside. <em>(<a href=\"http://www.bigblueadventures.co.uk/\">bigblueadventures.co.uk</a>)</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0dbcff534b09fcc8b760cb39637c87ad14ae0fbb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dbcff534b09fcc8b760cb39637c87ad14ae0fbb/0_27_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Mumbles lighthouse.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mumbles lighthouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> <br><strong> Bigbury Bay / Burgh Island, Devon</strong><br> Bigbury Bay is quite small and can get very busy in peak summer, but don\u2019t let that put you off. Paddling along the shoreline gives great views of the South West Coast Path. Looking out to the ocean you can see the tiny island of Burgh, which you can paddle up to and then enjoy a cider in the pub overlooking the bay. On the water itself, you can often see a variety of seabirds. <em>(<a href=\"http://www.discoverysurf.com/\">discoverysurf.com</a>)</em><br> <strong> Morecambe Bay, Lancashire </strong><br> I love the contrast of vast open water on one side and the Lakeland Fells in the distance on the other. That\u2019s what makes Morecambe a genuinely special place to paddle \u2013 particularly when the winds are low and the waters are calm. As the sun begins to set in the early evening, you will be presented with a truly unforgettable view. <em>(<a href=\"http://www.supnorth.co/\">supnorth.co</a>)</em></p>",
  "<p>I was recently sent an article published by the UK\u2019s Mail Online with the eye-catching headline: \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3784171/Brutal-Central-African-dictator-rules-country-iron-fist-allegedly-skins-enemies-alive-eats-testicles.html\">Brutal Central African dictator who rules his country with an iron-fist and \u2018skins enemies alive and eats their testicles\u2019</a>\u201d.</p> <p>At first I thought it was a bad joke. But it wasn\u2019t. I was shocked that a mainstream news organisation in a developed country could use such an unbalanced, ill-informed and prejudiced headline in its reporting of an African country \u2013 in this case, Equatorial Guinea. I thought the United Kingdom, where I have many friends and enjoy visiting, had progressed beyond racism but clearly many of its institutions, including the Daily Mail website, are struggling to update their view of the world, much as the African country in the article is struggling to transition to democracy. </p> <p>During my years at the UN and as minister of foreign affairs for Somaliland, I regularly faced the challenges of transitioning African states and the constant need for better governance. It is a sad reality of my continent but understandable as it pulls itself along this new road. Africa was given democracy before the foreign ink drawing out our borders had dried. In short, the desire for democracy in its broadest forms was created in a vacuum. The institutions of state necessary to drive, foster and protect democracy were not yet formed. Democracy in African states today is still in relative infancy. The international community understands this and needs patience with it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/26/south-africa-saving-endangered-species-duty-everyone\">South Africa: 'Saving endangered species is the responsibility of everyone'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is fair for the Mail Online to call for more democracy in Equatorial Guinea. That\u2019s what the international community, the people of Equatorial Guinea and indeed all African governments, want. At no point does the Mail Online contain a response from the President\u2019s office to these allegations as it should do for balanced and non-prejudiced reporting.</p> <p>A state must progress according to its circumstances and culture if the foundations are to last and democracy is to flourish. I am not being an apologist for African leaders, or President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo in particular, but my point is that while progress needs accelerating, we must approach the issue with a sound, informed understanding and be willing to hold out our hands to help a country along the path to democracy.</p> <p>In my opinion, western media reporting of African governments is often ignorant over facts and coloured by a post-colonial view of the region, bordering on racism. </p> <p>The Mail Online report\u2019s main source is Severo Moto, who it describes as a rival. It does not tell the reader that Moto is accused of breaking international law in supporting and fomenting a failed coup in 2004, organised by British financiers and <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4169557.stm\">involving Sir Mark Thatcher</a>, the son of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher. </p> <p>President Obiang is not alone in being targeted in this way. Sooner or later most African presidents come in for this kind of treatment, often by journalists who still seem to think of Africa as a continent populated by savages. They fail to understand the challenges facing Africa\u2019s modern leaders, who have worked to leave this kind of nonsense behind in the interests of creating lasting legacies for their people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/sep/14/uk-charities-send-recycled-prosthetics-africa\">'Back on my feet': how artificial limbs can have a second life in Africa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I first visited Equatorial Guinea in the early 1990s when the UN building was little more than a temporary hut surrounded by lush rainforests and accessed by dirt roads. On my return years later, I saw dual carriageways, office buildings, sprawling public housing and something else \u2013 young couples and friends laughing and drinking in the bars around the streets of the capital, Malabo. Not the picture of a repressed, terrified and disadvantaged society the Mail Online would have us believe. </p> <p>Such progress in the evolution of Equatorial Guinea was evident, regardless of shortcomings in the democratisation of the state. On the latter the president needs to be as industrious as he was in building infrastructure. He should be open and welcome to ideas and those who come with a genuine desire to help progress. I left optimistic that at least the path to democracy could now travel on super highways rather than dirt tracks.</p> <p>What disturbs me and my fellow Africans most is the inherent prejudice with which the continent is judged. Relying on a biased source, news articles such as the Mail Online\u2019s serve to propagate old racial stereotyping.

It happened in the 1950s after the Attlee government. The left were unhappy with NHS charges, the policy on nuclear weapons and towards the Soviet Union. This led to infighting which kept the party out of power for 13 years.</p> <p>After the Wilson/Callaghan governments of the 60s and 70s we got the infamous i infighting of the 80s. Corbyn's mentor helped build a myth that the party had betrayed socialism and was just the same as the Tories. This helped keep Labour out of power for 18 years.</p> <p>So now after the Blair/Brown governments we're getting the same thing. The left are trashing the parties record and focusing on the past. They cannot see what led Labour to success in the past.

How can you win? You put white thing women in an advert, you're not representative (true). You put a diverse range of women in an advert, you're pandering. True, there was something a bit tokenistic about the campaign, and they could have maybe done it a bit more subtly than having a bunch of &quot;diverse&quot; women in one advert saying &quot;see how diverse we are???&quot; <br />Then again, you have to start somewhere. If this signals a change in H&amp;M's advertising that includes more diversity in all of their media going forward, then I'm in. Let's just see if they carry it forward.<br />Oh and on the unrelated paragraph about portraying mixed race couples - I had no idea it produced such backlash. I am a product of a mixed marriage myself, so I am frankly just bemused at furious reactions over mixed marriages and relationships. They've been a fact of life for thousands of years and have been increasingly common and will only get more common as air travel and multi-culturalism increases. I'm not even offended, I just find it highly amusing that there are still people out there who honestly believe that &quot;mixing&quot; is wrong.

I've worked at several agencies and can tell you from experience that the problem is not down to gender imbalance (though this is definitely the case at the very senior levels). Nor is it necessarily down to a lack of ethnic diversity (though this still has a long way to go). In my opinion, the problem is down to these agencies insisting that they generally hire privately educated individuals with degrees. This means that my colleagues are effectively homogenised in their views and experiences. How then, is it possible for them to create ads which resonate with society at large, when they only hire individuals who have been living in a lovely middle-class bubble their whole lives? A lot of the products we make ads for would never be bought by such people. Rather, it's those in the council estates that flock to buy them en masse. And the disconnect between what they want, and what a lot of my colleagues think they want, is marked.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <h2>\u2018This is just the voice in the doorman\u2019s earpiece saying, \u2018It\u2019s a flat night, let the people in we wouldn\u2019t last night\u2019.\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/28/hm-advert-diversity-ad-women#comment-84234753\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16541740\" title=\"View ID665310\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/16541740\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for ID665310\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16541740\" title=\"View ID665310\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">ID665310</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/84234753\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">28 September 2016 6:01pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Okay, I've watched it.

She responds to the question \u2013 why are women more affected?</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Women have always felt more comfortable coming forward and I don\u2019t think men self-harm as much. Instead, they tend to turn to other things to ease their distress, such as alcohol. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have gender specific services. We are seeing more women with post traumatic stress disorder from domestic violence, after childbirth and from sexual violence they experience in relationships. Those sort of conditions need a different approach to ones we have as standard at the moment.</p> <p>Similarly with men a different approach is also needed, and for them we need to make services and treatment accessible. We know that middle-aged men have the highest suicide rate, so what are we doing to get that group into treatment and support earlier. It\u2019s good that we have identified these new statistics as if we know about these problems then we can plan services better and think, why is this happening? </p> <p>Mental health problems are increasingly (there\u2019s lots of reasons for this). I worry, in particular, about the impact of the media and social media. People are seeing things like self-harm on social media dn it makes it more accessible and we need to be really alert and able to talk to our children. We need to have that conversation around those issues and make sure they are safe. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-30T13:41:29.230Z\">at 2.41pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ee3b0de4b035c40686bf13\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/joanna-ruck\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-30T13:29:14.557Z\">2.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pictures of the week</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Picture editor Joanna Ruck shares some of her images of the week.</em></p> <p>First, the images from Aleppo have been particularly hard to look at this week and very graphic and distressing.

But at the moment, I'd vote Tory because I'm not agreeing with labour on a lot of issues &amp; I feel harassed by the tory-bashing. I don't like voting because of a party leader but jeremy &amp; those around him don't appeal to me either. </p> <p>I think this will be one of their problems come election time if things don't change - they paint anything tory as evil (despite tories winning more votes than labour) &amp; they need tory votes to win anything. If they could just stop the tory-bashing &amp; actually get on with policy, they might get a better message across the divide. They need to start saying how they are similar, not how they are different (although this will alienate momentum et al.)</p> <p>What I really fear though is all those right-leaning labour voters, who tend to be socially right-wing, voting UKIP. UKIP are already on-course to win more votes despite the referendum &amp; any equivocation from the tories or labour (which has already happened to a greater extent) on leaving EU &amp; they'll push more &amp; more to UKIP. Lib dems are a non-starter as corbyn has sapped any hard-left votes that may have gone their way. That leaves UKIP as the 3rd largest party in the HoC (future HoL?!) &amp; they'll likely vote tory on many issues in the house. Overall, I think the future is grim-dark for labour unless they change tactics soon.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/84361823\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10104875\" title=\"View fresher\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/10104875\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for fresher\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10104875\" title=\"View fresher\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">fresher</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/84361823\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">30 September 2016 1:41pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Labour can't beat the Tories, but the Tories could conspire to lose.

I'm in a supposed Tory safe seat but the truth is that if you counted the Lib Dem and Labour vote together, we would comfortably win. That's repeated up and down the country. An electoral pact means not standing candidates against the most likely to win. It also means people can vote strategically yet maintain allegiance with the party of their conscience.<br />2.

Each year, roughly seven passengers on mainline trains are killed, according to <a href=\"http://journalistsresource.org/studies/environment/transportation/comparing-fatality-risks-united-states-transportation-across-modes-time\">recent research</a>.</p> <p>Cuomo and Christie both cautioned against jumping to conclusions about the role that the lack of positive train control played or did not play in the tragedy.</p> <p>The NTSB has been pressing for some version of the technology for at least 40 years and the industry is under government orders to install it, but regulators have repeatedly extended the deadline at railroads\u2019 request. The target date is now the end of 2018.</p> <p>Over the past 20 years, the NTSB has listed the lack of positive train control as a contributing factor in 25 crashes. Those include an Amtrak crash last year in Philadelphia in which a speeding train ran off the rails along a curve. Eight people were killed.</p> <p>In 2011, a Port Authority Trans-Hudson or Path commuter train crash in a separate section of the Hoboken station injured more than 30 people. The NTSB found the engineer failed to control the speed of the train as it entered the station and investigators also determined a contributing factor was the absence of positive train control.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ll have to answer for themselves, but at the end of the day if safety is job one \u2026 then you have to have a better record than New Jersey Transit has right now,\u201d said New Jersey senator Bob Menendez, noting that the transit agency said in a 2016 Federal Railroad Administration report that it did not have positive train control on any locomotive or segment of track.</p> <p>\u201cThat means zero across the board,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to do better than zero across the board.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>EU ministers have agreed to ratify the landmark Paris climate agreement at an extraordinary summit in Brussels on Friday, all but guaranteeing that it will pass a legal threshold to take effect next week and sparing the bloc\u2019s blushes in the process.</p> <p>The European Parliament is expected to rubber stamp the decision in Strasbourg next Tuesday, allowing the EU to sign off on it as soon as the following day.</p> <p>The EU\u2019s president, Jean-Claude Juncker said: \u201cToday, the EU\u2019s member states decided to make history together and bring closer the entry into force of the first ever universally binding climate change agreement. We must and we can hand over to future generations a world that is more stable, a healthier planet, fairer societies and more prosperous economies. </p> <p>\u201cThis is not a dream. This is a reality and it is within our reach. Today we are closer to it.\u201d</p> <p>The Paris pact to limit global warming to \u201cwell below 2C\u201d will enter into force 30 days after 55 countries, accounting for 55% of the planet\u2019s emissions hand their ratification papers to the offices of Ban Ki-Moon in New York.</p> <p>India is expected to ratify the deal over the weekend, with Canada next week also likely to join <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=55166#.V-4yaq6rQXo\">the 61 countries that have so far signed up</a>. The EU\u2019s added weight should then tip the treaty into effect. </p> <p>The EU\u2019s climate commissioner, Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, said that Europe\u2019s reputation had been \u201con the line\u201d in the run up to today\u2019s meeting. \u201cWe are reaching a critical period for decisive climate action,\u201d he said, \u201cand when the going gets tough, Europe gets going.\u201d</p> <p>With global CO2 concentrations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/28/the-world-passes-400ppm-carbon-dioxide-threshold-permanently\">permanently passing the 400ppm barrier</a> this week and some climate scientists predicting that the Paris deal\u2019s preferred threshold of keeping temperature rises to 1.5C <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/10/dangerous-global-warming-will-happen-sooner-than-thought-study\">could be broken as soon as 2020</a>, calls for a greater urgency in Brussels have increased of late. </p> <p> \u201cWe cannot miss this opportunity,\u201d Gianni La Via, the European Parliament\u2019s rapporteur on the file, told the Guardian. \u201cA timely EU ratification decision would send a strong signal and highlight the leadership of the EU and its member states.\u201d</p> <p>The EU was a core member of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/08/coalition-paris-push-for-binding-ambitious-climate-change-deal\">\u201ccoalition for high ambition\u201d</a> in Paris which pushed a deal through. Ratifying it now will at least allow the bloc speaking and voting rights at <a href=\"http://climate-l.iisd.org/events/unfccc-cop-22\">a key COP22 summit</a> on its implementation at Marrakesh in November.</p> <p> EU sources say that 80 or 90 countries have still not ratified the Paris agreement but that a fear of being counted among them focused minds in Brussels.</p> <p>\u201cWe would not have been isolated but in terms of our global leadership it would have been politically embarrassing if we had not been able to show unity at this stage,\u201d the official said.</p> <p>The speed of today\u2019s extraordinary council decision was hailed as \u201ctruly remarkable\u201d by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a UK-based thinktank which includes MPs, peers and climate scientists on its board. </p> <p>One spectre haunting the summit though was the prospect of a victory for the climate-sceptic Republican candidate, Donald Trump, in US elections later this year.</p> <p>EU sources say that the bloc would aim to stick to its climate commitments if that happened. One told the Guardian: \u201cIt can\u2019t be indefinite but our initial reaction would be to try to lead others in anticipation that this was a temporary aberration in US politics and that common sense would prevail, whether in four years time or sooner.\u201d</p> <p>Europe\u2019s own intentions have been clouded for some by resistance from coal-dependant Poland to any review of the EU\u2019s existing climate pledge in 2018. In the Paris deal, this is seen as an opportunity to scale up ambitions towards a 1.5C target.</p> <p>The EU has not proposed any new climate actions in line with a 1.5C goal, but new legislation on renewables and energy efficiency is expected later this year, to help meet Europe\u2019s existing climate pledges.</p> <p>Officials believe the measures could have \u201cunpredicted but positive impacts\u201d, helping Europe to go even further than <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/24/eu-leaders-agree-to-cut-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-40-by-2030\">its promised 40% emissions cut for 2030</a>.</p> <p>Today\u2019s discussions in Brussels were dominated by Polish demands for an effective veto over future climate decisions, such as reforms to the EU\u2019s emissions trading system or national emissions cutting targets.</p> <p>\u201cThey were looking for a change to the treaty basis of EU climate policy that would have required unanimity by all member states,\u201d a source said. \u201cThey did not achieve that.\u201d</p> <p>Some environmentalists are concerned at the lack of deadlines for the EU\u2019s 28 members to individually ratify the Paris deal, or peak their emissions. These are currently forecast to continue rising until 2030 in some countries.</p> <p>Wendel Trio, the director of Climate Action Network Europe complained of \u201ca certain level of hypocrisy\u201d in calls from Brussels for other countries to implement the Paris deal\u2019s tenets.</p> <p>\u201cWe can no longer follow the myth that the EU is acting alone or that it is a leader,\u201d he said. \u201cThis ratification process shows that the EU is actually running behind [other countries]. It is important for the EU to know that they need to adapt to this new era of climate action, get their act together and improve their climate policies rather than think they can continue on a business as usual trajectory.\u201d</p> <p>Several EU countries have formaly signed off on the Paris deal to date, including France, Germany, Hungary, Slovakia, Portugal and Austria.</p> <p>Theresa May has promised to ratify the agreement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/20/theresa-may-uk-ratify-paris-climate-change-agreement-this-year\">by the end of this year</a>. </p>",
  "<p>Actors, like Donald Trump, prefer to remain \u201csemi-exact\u201d when it comes to the facts. Perception is our domain, not to be undermined by actuality. A fact like an actor\u2019s date of birth stands in the way of our dreams at some point in all our working lives \u2013 we\u2019re no different from anyone else in this \u2013 but it\u2019s notoriously true that actors contend with age in unequal ways. Without a doubt, since I\u2019ve left my twenties the roles have become more interesting. Maybe that\u2019s just art reflecting life. Young men are never as interesting as they think they are. Demetrius is no match for Helena, Lysander for Hermia, nor that dolt Romeo for the wry and cogent Juliet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/26/law-passed-enabling-actors-to-remove-age-from-imdb\">Law passed enabling actors to remove age from IMDb</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Roles for older women, if they reflected life, should be the stuff of great drama. I think of my mother for whom a whole shadow life came into light after she was widowed. Meanwhile the men of her corresponding age began to run out of steam. Those subjects remain rare in the stories we tell ourselves. Perhaps that is an emphasis that goes back to the earliest stories.</p> <p>I like watching actors as they grow old. The best and most generous actors show us, without vanity, what Philip Roth called the \u201cmassacre\u201d of old age. I think of great performances from Vanessa Redgrave in Atonement, Julie Christie in Away From Her, Emmanuelle Riva in Amour. Jason Robards in Magnolia. Peter O\u2019Toole in Venus and My Talks with Dean Spanley \u2013 where he found an eerie translucence as though one foot was in the afterlife. I was lucky to work with Michael Gambon on Churchill\u2019s Secret in which he portrayed a stroke-stricken Churchill as though in his second childhood. </p> <p>There\u2019s a distinction between the way age is treated in films, television and the theatre. Hollywood has always framed desire as something for the straight and the young \u2013 or young women, at least. Bacall was 19 to Bogie\u2019s 45 in To Have and To Have Not. But Bacall was smart, in control, Alpha \u2013 an adult. As were Katharine Hepburn, Claudette Colbert, Rosalind Russell, Barbara Stanwyck, Bette Davis. The conclusions of their films usually required a man to complete the picture but you sometimes wonder where that combination of humour and strength has gone now that we\u2019re so baby-ish. But there\u2019s a whole raft of women working hard in Hollywood who are in their late forties. Things are growing up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/06/luise-rainer-remembered-patrick-kennedy\">My friendship with Luise Rainer: art, advice, Einstein and champagne</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An actor once described to me a very famous male star now in his late seventies: \u201c\u2018I call him <em>Norman</em> Desmond,\u2019 she said, \u201che\u2019s got a loooong staircase.\u201d Well, most actors haven\u2019t had to descend from the heights of that actor\u2019s beauty, or suffered the waning of our star at the lonely end of Sunset Boulevard like the original Norma, so our vanity should be less of an issue. We work far away from what David Thomson called \u201cthe great cabinet of desire\u201d that is Hollywood and our youthfulness as it pertains to fantasy is not a very important factor. We hope to reflect life \u2026 in all its baldness. But we\u2019re never quite out of the shadow cast by the American dream factory and its conservative standards.</p> <p>In Hollywood a whole parasitic community sprung up around these images \u2013 doctors and quacks given over to the pursuit of youthfulness and its corollary, health. That economy is going strong. The parochial preferences of age-leery, surgery-happy west Angelenos, whose nipping and tucking begins to look normal through the windscreen of a tinted Lexus, becomes a global standard for us all to worry over.</p> <p>As any Hollywood agent will tell you, something else is changing too. The men are getting as much \u201cwork\u201d as the women. And once the inventory of Californian narcissism has been exhausted \u2013 the grapefruit oil, spirulina, brain dust, activated dingleberries, diet pills, coke, bulimia, fake pregnancies, and the surgeon\u2019s knife \u2013 there\u2019s the guaranteed-youthfulness-or-your-money-back cure of early death.</p> <p>Somewhere in Hollywood, the middle managers are adding up the numbers, and the market, they calculate, demands youth. But as the US population ages that\u2019s bound to change. The older demographic will assert their buying power. This has already started to happen in television which, for all its formulae and cliche, reflects the lives we lead so much better than the American cinema now does. Will the power of these storytelling industries make age less important? Will age become as fluid as sexuality and gender?</p> <p>Instinctively, I welcomed the news that a new California law will require IMDb to omit or remove age and birth date from an actor\u2019s profile upon request. Publishing actors\u2019 ages on the internet just provides another impediment to the imagination. Agents find it unhelpful. For actors it\u2019s an unwelcome intrusion \u2013 limiting the range we suppose we have, counter to the spirit of self-invention. But the idea that \u201cage doesn\u2019t matter\u201d cuts both ways. The law, which applies only to California, would seem to compound Hollywood\u2019s prejudice rather than remove it. If it doesn\u2019t matter, why hide it? I suspect that most of the time we\u2019d like to fool ourselves as much as anyone else.</p>",

It is the swelling sense that Rosberg, so often the diligent and very able understudy, is now capable of stepping up and beating Hamilton in a straight fight to the line.</p> <p>The sacrilegious whispers have become full-blown predictions. And on Friday one of Hamilton\u2019s greatest admirers, Sky TV\u2019s expert analyst Johnny Herbert, picked up on the notion when he told the Guardian: \u201cWho will win the title? I just pick Nico. My heart would always say Lewis but the way things have gone I think Nico might just have the momentum to carry him through.\u201d</p> <p>Herbert was following the thinking of his colleague, another former British driver, Martin Brundle, who said: \u201cFor the first time I feel that Nico has the speed, ingredients and confidence to take this title in a straight fight but it could well go down to the wire.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Daniel Ricciardo said: \u201cI\u2019m going to throw a spanner in the works and say Rosberg.

It\u2019s more to do with the suspicion that the British driver may be in the grip of a malaise. Both Rosberg and Hamilton have won seven poles this year. But while Rosberg has won five of those races (71.43%) Hamilton has won only three (43%). And only twice on those seven occasions did he retain the lead at the end of the opening lap.</p> <p>In 2016 Hamilton has made his most memorable bad starts in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/mar/20/formula-one-grand-prix-season-opener-in-melbourne-live\" title=\"\">Australia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/03/nico-rosberg-wins-f1-bahrain-grand-prix-lewis-hamilton-sebastian-vettel\" title=\"\">Bahrain</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/12/lewis-hamilton-wins-f1-canadian-grand-prix-close-gap-nico-rosberg\" title=\"\">Canada</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/04/nico-rosberg-wins-italian-grand-prix-lewis-hamilton\" title=\"\">four weeks ago in Italy</a>, where he dropped from pole to sixth by the first corner.

The message was clear: I was supposed to be poor, wasn\u2019t I? So why couldn\u2019t I just look like it?</p> <p>In a system that regularly brands you as undeserving, a liar or a fraud, wearing your poverty correctly becomes ever more important. When I first presented as homeless, there was ample evidence that I was telling the truth. I had been on the child protection register pretty much since I was born, and had a family history of homelessness. Despite this I was turned away by my London council for not \u201clooking homeless enough\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What if I had been among the 74% of people turned away from a service because my needs level was too high?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hours later I slept on the floor of the homeless person\u2019s unit in my school\u2019s borough, to prove that I was, indeed, homeless enough. In the morning I churned out my story to another official, sitting in a row of strangers discussing similarly gory details of their lives with officials. Our privacy was protected only by thin glass partitions, with thicker partitions protecting the officials in case we attacked them.</p> <p>Perhaps having to back up what you say sounds like standard interview fare. But there is a difference between providing evidence and disproving someone\u2019s prejudice. These conversations felt more like fights, in which every statement you make is followed by \u201cand did you record that at the time?\u201d.</p> <p>My experience of being turned away, despite being eligible for support, feeling distrusted and being denied privacy, has <a href=\"http://www.crisis.org.uk/data/files/publications/MysteryShopping_Report_FINAL_web.pdf\">been shown</a> to be a common one among homeless people seeking support. In places like London where there are huge budget pressures and a lack of available housing, the experience moves from being common to being the norm.</p> <p>Those are difficult conditions when you are trying to give evidence of messy family problems. What if your parents are abusing you but they deny it and, being a child, you\u2019ve never pressed charges? What if the council contacts them and they provide a doting account of how they love you and just want to see you home again? Luckily for me I was well placed to argue my case: I was eloquent, had professionals around me to provide support, and I met the requirements for the council\u2019s priority list. Still the process took three months.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/28/anti-begging-posters-banned-nottingham-city-council\">Anti-begging posters banned over 'negative stereotypes'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That makes me sorry for those who weren\u2019t as lucky as me.

What if I was one of the 74% of people in that same study who were turned away from a service because my needs level was too high for them to manage?</p> <p>Perhaps hard-pressed officials adopt these tactics when interacting with homeless people to manage the soul-sapping juggling of scarce resources? The sad reality is it means that many eligible people will be turned away for not knowing the rules of the game. I am grateful that I passed the tests, but I am not happy. I am no more deserving of my fortune than I was of my disadvantage: the same is true for the rest of Britain\u2019s homeless.</p>",

His last defeat was seven races ago, in June 2015, and he has progressed through the season so smoothly that the uproar that surrounded his sudden switch to Varian\u2019s stable from Luca Cumani little more than 12 months ago has been largely forgotten.</p> <p>That is a testament to Varian, who took delivery of Postponed when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/17/luca-cumani-bemused-sheikh-obai-moves-postponed-roger-varian\" title=\"\">Sheikh Mohammed Obaid, his owner, fell out with Cumani last September</a>, and it typifies the trainer and his quiet, even-tempered approach to the business of training winners.

That\u2019s good in a way, it keeps the mind focused on plenty of other stuff.\u201d</p> <p>Varian is not the sort to allow himself an idle moment but if he has ever daydreamed about winning an Arc, he almost certainly imagined it at Longchamp, the race\u2019s traditional home, and not Chantilly, magnificent though its setting in front of the famous chateau and <em>grandes \u00e9curies</em> undoubtedly is.</p> <p>Arc weekend has been a fixture in the diaries of thousands of British and Irish racing fans for decades, and more recently a big draw for Japanese fans too as the country pursues an elusive first success in the race. This year\u2019s crowd will be capped at 40,000, however, while Longchamp is being rebuilt, and the use of temporary facilities may lead to a very different race-day experience for those who make the trip.</p> <p>On the track itself, however, Varian does not expect the switch from Longchamp to Chantilly to make a significant difference.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same as Longchamp, but it\u2019s not a world apart,\u201d Varian said. \u201cIt\u2019s a right-handed Grade One track, a shortish straight with a stiff finish, and Postponed is a versatile horse. I leave that sort of thing to Andrea [Atzeni, his regular jockey], but I can\u2019t really see us blaming the track if he doesn\u2019t win.\u201d</p> <p>Postponed has raced only twice since March, winning the Coronation Cup at Epsom in June and the International two months later, but the trainer saw no need to send him to Chantilly on Arc Trials day three weeks ago. The punters who will send him off as their warm favourite on Sunday will hope that it is a sign of Varian\u2019s confidence that Postponed is exactly where he wants him.</p> <p>\u201cIt took a while to get to know him, and probably vice versa,\u201d Varian says. \u201cI don\u2019t think a horse settles in straight away, although he only moved across town and he was largely using the same facilities that he would have used with Luca. A horse has to settle into a new environment and culture, and perhaps a slightly different diet, as every trainer does things differently.</p> <p>\u201cI think the important thing when you inherit a high-profile horse is to look at him as a blank canvas and form your own opinion. If you study too much what he\u2019s done before, you can get led into a feeling or opinion that might not be your own.\u201d</p> <p>The canvas is no longer blank, and it would take just one more victory on Sunday afternoon to turn it into a masterpiece.</p>",

Later, on the Q-Tip-assisted Borderline (An Ode to Self Care) she sighs: \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d So, while there\u2019s anger and frustration throughout A Seat at the Table, it\u2019s often presented calmly, almost matter-of-factly.

Revolving around the line, \u201cThis shit is for us\u201d, Solange places herself directly in the song\u2019s celebration of blackness when she sings: \u201cI hope my son will bang this song so loud, that he almost makes his walls fall down, cos his momma wants to make him proud, oh to be us.\u201d It\u2019s a joyous moment. </p> <p>Similarly joyous is the synthetic funk of Junie, a song dedicated to Ohio Players legend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/solangeknowles/status/781582002004828162\">Junie Morrison</a>, while the zigzagging electronic pulse and cascading vocals of Don\u2019t You Wait recall the softer moments on True. The airy Cranes in the Sky, meanwhile, must be the prettiest song ever about trying to alleviate the thick fog of sadness (\u201cI tried to dance it away\u201d). Once again, her voice \u2013 assisted by forgotten R&amp;B singer Tweet \u2013 is almost unspeakably lovely.</p> <p>Anyone hoping for another Losing You, or Sandcastle Disco from her undervalued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/aug/15/urban1\">Sol-Angel and the Hadley St Dreams</a> album, is likely to be initially disappointed by A Seat at the Table. Clearly crafted to be listened to as a full album, songs segue into each other with the interludes helping to govern tone and move the album through its various moods. Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/23/blood-orange-freetown-sound-review-dev-hynes\">Blood Orange\u2019</a>s equally sprawling Freetown Sound, it\u2019s an album that unfurls at its own pace, each song packed with as many melodic flourishes as you\u2019d get across whole albums by many artists. Its delicate anger and the measured way it unpacks a host of issues means you want to give it the time it deserves rather than demanding it reveal itself immediately. There\u2019s a unique brilliance to that.</p>",
  "<p>The first <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/revaluation-of-business-rates\">revaluation</a> since 2010 is likely to create winners and sore losers. Entrepreneurs across the UK are finding out on Friday about the impact of the biggest <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/555932/Transitional_Relief_consultation.pdf\">change to business rates</a> in a generation.</p> <p>Many London-based businesses are facing sharp rate rises, although firms in the Midlands and the north are largely unaffected or are seeing a reduction. </p> <p>The changes, which are due to come into force in April 2017, include an increase in rates relief to \u00a312,000. But, crucially, the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/valuation-office-agency\">Valuation Office Agency</a> (VOA) has performed a revaluation of rentable values and this means the changes will be unevenly spread.</p> <p>Business rates are calculated in part by the rentable value of a property. The last time the VOA collected this data was in 2008, with new rates set in 2010. The latest revaluation is drawn on figures from 2015 and rents in London have skyrocketed in that period. </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.colliers.com/en-gb/uk/services/business-rates/revaluation-2016\">report</a> by estate agent Colliers predicts big winners and losers from the revaluation. It says the biggest losers will be businesses based in central London, with Dover Street, in Mayfair, earmarked for an enormous 415% increase. Other popular London areas such as Brixton and Hammersmith are also likely to experience sharp spikes. Outside of London, businesses in Brighton, Winchester and Oxford are also likely to see their rates hiked. </p> <p>\u201cThe 2017 rating revaluation will produce the largest changes in rateable value for a generation \u2013 businesses may be sleepwalking into the effects without planning for the consequences, both good and bad,\u201d says the report.</p> <p>Andy Atalla, founder of Camden-based online marketing agency atom42, expects his business rates to rise by more than a quarter following the revaluation, from approximately \u00a345,000 per year to \u00a357,000. Atalla, who employs just over 40 staff, says high rent prices, coupled with rising business rates, mean UK business is becoming less competitive. </p> <p>\u201cHigher costs and taxes inevitably have a direct impact on how much we charge our clients,\u201d he says. \u201cThis makes us less competitive in the market, and potentially we lose income to offshore business, based in economies such as India, who are able to offer similar services at lower costs.\u201d</p> <p>Alex Wrethman, founder and owner of the Charlotte\u2019s Group restaurant business, discovered on Friday morning that one of his three restaurants will receive a 43% rates increase next April. He says this is far higher than the actual rent increase he has had since moving into the Chiswick building in 2009. </p> <p>Furthermore, Wrethman is already appealing the VOA\u2019s valuation on one of his other restaurants and says he is likely to appeal this one, too. \u201cOur rent has gone up 12% since we moved in but now the VOA is saying our value is up 43%, which isn\u2019t right. [...] The government is almost creating a whole new industry based on businesses appealing valuations,\u201d he says. </p> <p>Wrethman says retail businesses have so many costs, margins are falling and so the sharp increase in rates is a major concern. \u201cIt is a squeeze. Rents are rising and so are costs such as energy, licensing, rubbish collection and the minimum wage. But if you look at the actual costs for customers who eat out, the prices are pretty much the same.\u201d </p> <p>Sue Terpilowski, London policy chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), says the business rates system is preventing growth and job creation and threatens the future of business in the capital. \u201cRents keep on rising in London and as business rates are based on rents, they go up together. It\u2019s stopping businesses from taking long-term leases. It\u2019s making London unaffordable and is affecting the whole eco-system of business in the capital and it could mean the whole lot comes crashing down,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Terpilowski says one of the counter-intuitive aspects of the way business rates work is that they act as a disincentive for businesses to improve their buildings. \u201cIf you improve your building by putting in air conditioning you increase its potential rateable value and so you\u2019ll see an increase in business rates. So, basically, if you create a decent working environment for your staff you get penalised for it. It\u2019s the wrong type of system for businesses in the 21st century.\u201d</p> <p>Business rates are close to Terpilowski\u2019s heart. Her own company was forced to relocate because of soaring rents and taxes. She set up office for her PR company Image Line in Old Street, Shoreditch, in 2005, initially paying business rates of \u00a38,130 per year. However, by 2015 her rates had increased to \u00a323,815 and so the business moved to South Quay, east London. \u201cEither we moved or I made three people redundant,\u201d she says.</p> <p> James Layfield, CEO of office space company Central Working, rents out space to entrepreneurial companies and also argues that business rates are an unfair tax. He says he understands the sentiment of the changes, which he feels are designed to reflect the fortunes of the \u201cpost-crash economy\u201d. However, he says the system is fundamentally flawed. \u201cTweaks like this ignore the fact the system fundamentally doesn\u2019t work \u2013 it also still disproportionally impacts entrepreneurs [based in Britain],\u201d he says. </p> <p>\u201cRates at our sites in central London could double, yet, to remain competitive with international corporates, we have to absorb this cost ourselves. Otherwise we\u2019d have to pass it on to our members, who themselves are startups,\u201d</p> <p>Layfield says a completely new business rates system needs to be implemented that is not based on \u201chistoric property values\u201d. However, business rates are a major part of the government\u2019s tax revenue amounting to \u00a326bn per year. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-promises-fairer-bills-for-business-across-the-country\">government</a> defended the changes, arguing that it is cutting business rates and that the system needed to be updated. It also says three-quarters of businesses will see no change and that 600,000 companies will have the rates cut completely. </p> <p>Marcus Jones, minister for local government, says: \u201cBut for the small minority of businesses that do face an increase, we\u2019re putting in place \u00a33.4bn of transitional relief to provide vital support as they adjust to these fair and impartial changes.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/small-business/\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.</strong></p>",

But this cool little coal hole of a place breaks the mould. It groups its whiskies \u2013 250 of them, from around the world \u2013 by flavour rather than country, so choosing is easy, and most drams, apart from a few rarities, are \u00a37-\u00a311. The Japanese-influenced cocktails are excellent too, with beautiful ice, prepared by staff who really know their stuff (but don\u2019t indulge in jargon). And the table is show-stopping \u2013 an 18ft slab of oak tree with channels of whisky flowing through it.

This is the kind of place you can come to have a sensible chat with a colleague over a Black Cow vodka and tonic at the gold bar; for a sexy date with someone new or someone you love (most couples seem to end up snogging on the sofas); for an experimental whisky cocktail; or to get sloshed on a round of signature Hix Fixes with some pals. Come on a Thursday after 10pm for the regular Mark\u2019s Lates party and you\u2019ll end up dancing until 3am (and watching bartenders dancing on the bar).

There\u2019s just this kebab shop upstairs then, next to it, there is this well-presented guy on the door \u2013 there\u2019s nothing else to look at. To go for the first time, especially if you\u2019re taking someone who\u2019s never been, is special \u2013 but you really should book in advance. Walking down the stairs through a long thin corridor and into that bar for the first time is amazing. It\u2019s a dark space, with candles everywhere. It has this beautiful tin ceiling that reflects light beautifully. Waiters will greet you, and they know the menu inside out. The menu changes regularly and the drinks are bespoke, but you can\u2019t really go wrong: the waiters push you in the direction of how you\u2019re feeling. The Nightjar changed the game a bit, with that seated cocktail dining experience with live jazz and swing in the background. The atmosphere when the music is peaking is dark and sexy and I can\u2019t think of another bar that goes to so much effort in the presentation of every single drink in its list.

It\u2019s that moment that takes you from being a stranger in a strange place to a welcomed guest, waiting for a drink. Even when it\u2019s three deep at 69, there will always be someone who works there whose eyes go directly to the door when it opens. 69 is a tiny, tucked-away bar lifted out of a Fellini film. Inside, there\u2019s black wood, white-jacketed staff \u2013 and a relaxed elegance. If I pop in on the early side I\u2019m sure to run into a mix of artists and writers, some of the designer friends of Tony Conigliaro \u2013 its owner \u2013 as well as high-end bartenders from around the world who make pilgrimages to the bar to experience Tony\u2019s drinks. 69 has been influential on the cocktail bar scene. It was one of the earlier bars to take a chance on stepping up into higher-end cocktailswhen there was this change from people looking for the place that gave you the biggest drink to the place that gave you the best drink. I loved the Lipstick Cocktail and the Fig leaf Martini, where Tony distils fig leaf into the spirit. The Caper leaf Martini is also gorgeous. And the Prairie oyster, with the deconstructed tomato, is something well worth trying. <br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"http://www.69colebrookerow.com/\">69colebrookerow.com</a>.

Trailer Happiness attracts an excellent crowd and does the best rum cocktails in London. It\u2019s a great bar to visit with a group of friends or even when travelling solo. It\u2019s been an institution for many years and is known for its adoration for my favourite spirit: rum. That\u2019s not to say itdoesn\u2019t do a killer G&amp;T or vodka Martini, but the highlights and more innovative cocktails on the menu are usually rum-based. During Notting Hill Carnival, the team can be found cooking up jerk chicken and serving it alongside delicious rum punches. Trailer Carnival Lockdown is my favourite party, and where I can be found with a punch cocktail in hand. My favourite night at Trailer had to be after Imbibe Live 2013 (an annual drinks trade show). I had just found out that I had been offered the job at OXO Bar and Restaurantand I remember it was an extremely hot day. Many faces from the bar trade were at Trailer after the Imbibe show and we had an amazing night. The atmosphere, the drinks and the people absolutely made the evening. I felt like I was on a Caribbean Island with all of my best mates \u2013 and it\u2019s where I met my boyfriend. But, honestly, no matter what time of year it is, a night in Trailer can transport you to a party in Barbados \u2013 until closing time anyway.<br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"http://www.trailerhappiness.com/gallery.html\">trailerhappiness.com</a>.

Nobody goes to a bar to have a bad time. Loads of places do it extremely well, but none, in my opinion, more so than the Sun Tavern. The owners will probably tell you different, but my take on it is that this place is a modern-day version of a pub. The decor is tough to pin down to one particular style, but it feels like a pub should feel. Homely, welcoming and reliable, along with one of the best-looking back bars in London; the days of Fosters on draught and a dusty bottle of Cointreau on the back bar are dead. The Sun has a great selection of beers on tap, which change regularly, a short, but very well put together list of house cocktails and staff as knowledgable on classic cocktails as anywhere else in London.

As soon as you go in, you find yourself buying into the whole thing and that\u2019s what great bars do. It\u2019s themed around blitz-chic and is designed with a high level of authenticity: down to the staff talking in received pronunciation. It\u2019s all been thought through so wonderfully; the way the staff dress, talk, the theatre of the entrance \u2013 as if being ushered into a bomb shelter. Part of the bar is in what used to be the Kingly Court tube station, so I think that\u2019s where it got some of its theme from. The drink menus come on a kind-of 1940s-style newspaper, but it has serious people in charge of its bar programme; there\u2019s been an effort to hire people who see making drinks as an artform. Products are chosen carefully, there a lot of homemade ingredients and the owners spend time and effort on the presentation and garnishing. But really it\u2019s just a lot of fun.

  "<p>A red evening dress has beaten tough competition from some clams in the shape of penises to become the star of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s royal visit to Canada.</p> <p>The international attention focused on visits by the younger royals is disproportionate to the substance of the itinerary. Engagements for this trip have included watching a college volleyball match, sending a tweet by telegram, riding a train and sampling the aforementioned clams at a food festival. So it is inevitable that in the absence of moments of substance for the media to focus on, the royal wardrobe is called upon to do the heavy lifting, and imbue a succession of photocalls with a message.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"823c96cc54c0babaffbd3b9637d5f958e56f9b78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/823c96cc54c0babaffbd3b9637d5f958e56f9b78/0_0_2269_3000/756.jpg\" alt=\"The Duchess of Cambridge in Preen.\" width=\"756\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Duchess of Cambridge in Preen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FD/Francis Dias/NEWSPIX INTERNATI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f9cbaf9753434c49e80c86e820be717043b22a8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9cbaf9753434c49e80c86e820be717043b22a8b/0_0_1996_3000/665.jpg\" alt=\"The Duchess of Cambridge in Whitehorse, Canada.\" width=\"665\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Duchess of Cambridge in Whitehorse, Canada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For many daytime engagements the Duchess has chosen to wear jeans, boots and knitwear, informal choices that emphasise her youth and modern outlook. This message has been underscored by a schedule weighted towards themes of family, young people and the environment. (The couple have visited a youth centre, and the Great Bear rainforest.) But the standout fashion moment came for one of the few formal occasions, with a red evening gown by London fashion week designers Preen by Thornton Bregazzi.

When the Duke and Duchess visited Australia and New Zealand two years ago, the toddler Prince George was dubbed \u201cthe Republican Slayer\u201d, and credited with an upswing in support for the monarchy. The Canada trip is the first the Cambridges have made as a family of four, with both George and his younger sister Charlotte in tow, and it will be hoped that the photogenic family will shore up support for the future of the monarchy in Canada. Earlier this year, a Canadian poll reported that the Queen\u2019s high approval ratings were not matched by those of Prince Charles \u2013 and that Charles\u2019 rating lagged far below that of his elder son. <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/canadians-like-the-queen-but-her-heir-not-so-much-surveysays/article29658118/\">The style stakes in Canada</a> have been raised, too, by the high profile of photogenic prime minister Justin Trudeau.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"634b3bb3417b825d09dc5dedd5012dea131c561f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/634b3bb3417b825d09dc5dedd5012dea131c561f/0_0_3712_5500/675.jpg\" alt=\"The Duchess of Cambridge in Alexander McQueen.\" width=\"675\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Duchess of Cambridge in Alexander McQueen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Rooke/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The intense preparation that goes into the Duchess\u2019s wardrobe was illustrated by the red-and-white Alexander McQueen dress that she wore in Vancouver on the second day of their visit. Undoubtedly chosen to represent British fashion while honouring Canada\u2019s national colours, it was a bespoke version of a dress from McQueen\u2019s resort collection. In the dress made for the Duchess, the voluminous three-quarter length sleeves of the original were switched for long, shirt-style sleeves \u2013 more suitable for waving at crowds \u2013 and the tiered skirt lengthened from mid-thigh to just above the knee.</p>",

Rosetta is the first time that a spacecraft has really studied a comet. It has been travelling with Comet 67P/C-G since August 2014. In that time, the scientists believe that they have understood for the first time the way in which comets are formed more than 4 billion years ago, at the same time that our own planet was forming.</p> <p> Key to their new understanding are features on the comet called \u2018positive relief features\u2019. These are lumps of about a metre across. The scientists refer to them as goose bumps; I\u2019ve even heard them called dragon\u2019s eggs.</p> <p> Today\u2019s descent is designed to get the best images possible of these goose bumps. Rosetta is heading towards a pit in the Ma\u2019at region of the comet. Inside the pit, it will be trying to see more goosebumps. </p> <p>These are thought to be the original icy boulders that formed in the solar system more than four billion years ago and then came together to form this comet. In short, the goose bumps are some of the most ancient unaltered objects from the beginning of the solar system. They contain all the ingredients that were available to form life on Earth.</p> <p> The descent today is designed to see these natural treasures in as much detail as possible \u2013 and the only way to do it is to sacrifice the spacecraft. </p> <p> But what a way to go \u2013 cutting edge science to the very end.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-30T11:38:02.499Z\">at 12.38pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ee28d3e4b0c38a12e7154b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-30T08:57:47.464Z\">9.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>First you see it, then you don\u2019t.

Not really, because the spacecraft is descending too slowly. People here seem to be calling it a controlled descent.</p> <p> At 90 cm/s, Rosetta is touching the comet at the same speed that the Philae lander did in November 2014. Back then, Philae bounced across the surface for hours before finally coming to rest. Opinion is divided about whether the same will happen to Rosetta today.

Since August 2014, Rosetta has been studying comet 67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko in order to better understand how the Earth formed, where the water in Earth\u2019s oceans came from, and how the chemical building blocks of life were delivered to this planet. </p> <p>Rosetta is the most ambitious space mission ever launched by Europe. Indeed, it is one of the most ambitious space missions any space agency has ever launched, and it has been full of drama.</p> <p>The highpoint of the mission came in November 2014, when the Philae lander <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/live/2014/nov/12/rosetta-comet-landing-live-blog\">detached from the Rosetta mothership and made its descent onto the comet</a>. A global audience watch as the lander tumbled across the surface before finally coming to rest in a crevice. Robbed of sunlight, scientists worked feverishly to complete its science mission before the batteries ran down and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/live/2014/nov/14/rosetta-mission-philaes-third-day-on-comet-as-it-happens\">Philae \u2018went to sleep\u2019 three days later</a>.</p> <p>Since then, the main Rosetta spacecraft has been working, orbiting the comet and watching the way it is evaporated by the Sun. It has been making a chemical inventory that shows what molecules were delivered to the early Earth, and from which life formed. </p> <p>Today the mission comes to an end with the main spacecraft itself touching down on the comet. Rosetta will not survive the landing but will gather even more data on the way down.</p> <p>I\u2019m here in ESA\u2019s European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany. Rosetta is controlled from here, and it is the natural place to draw a line under the operational phase of this mission. I was here for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2014/jan/20/rosetta-comet-chasing-spacecraft-wakes-up-esa-live-blog\">the wake-up</a> of the mission in 2014, and for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/live/2014/nov/12/rosetta-comet-landing-live-blog\">Philae landing</a>. Now, it is the end.</p> <p>Overnight the spacecraft executed a final manoeuvre that robbed it of orbital energy. It is now falling gently to its inevitable fate upon the dusty surface of the comet.</p> <p>Touchdown is expected at around 12:20 BST. <br></p> <p>During the course of today, I\u2019ll be looking back at the mission and bringing you the details of what is going on. Plus, I\u2019ll be talking to as many people as possible to bring you their reactions. To many here, the Rosetta mission has been a way of life. Today that way of life is ending.</p> <p>Stay tuned.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-30T08:23:59.689Z\">at 9.23am BST</time></p>  </div>",

The problem is huge: in India 38.7% of children are stunted, in Pakistan 45% and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 70%. \u201cInequality is baked into the brains of 25% of all children before the age of five,\u201d Kim told the Guardian. \u201cSo the only way that we can realistically say there is equality of opportunity is if we bring stunting down to zero.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/30/world-bank-name-and-shame-countries-fail-stunted-children\">World Bank to name and shame countries that fail their stunted children</a></p> <h2>US to boost military capability in Asia</h2> <p>The US has promised to \u201csharpen its military edge\u201d in Asia Pacific in order to remain the dominant power in a region, the defense secretary, Ash Carter, has announced.

  "<p>Tannishtha Chatterjee laughed along with the first jokes, but they stung. The Indian actor had agreed to attend a comedy roast to promote her latest film, Parched. But again and again, as the programme went on, the hosts\u2019 jibes seemed to centre on one thing.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cYou must like black plums.

One of Bollywood\u2019s most popular songs last year was the syrupy Chittiyaan Kalaiyaan, performed by a lip-synching Sri Lankan actor, Jacqueline Fernandez.

Lower caste equals dark skin equals untouchable,\u201d Chatterjee wrote in her post. \u201cYes, I have pronounced it. Probably most of us will not admit that our hatred for dark skin also comes from caste bias.\u201d</p> <p>Caste continues to determine the shape of hundreds of millions of Indian lives, but in the country\u2019s increasingly affluent cities \u201cit\u2019s not a cool thing to talk about\u201d, Chatterjee said. \u201cBut in the back of our minds we all still have those biases.\u201d</p> <p>She recounted roles where she played a wealthier, educated woman, \u201cand the makeup artist says: can I make you one or two shades lighter? This is a bit of an upper-middle class character.\u201d</p> <p>Independent Indian cinema often confronts issues of colour, caste and gender prejudice, and some of Bollywood\u2019s biggest stars, including Shah Rukh Khan, are members of the country\u2019s marginalised Muslim minority. </p> <p>But Mehta said popular cinema often ended up reflecting the country\u2019s biases rather than challenging them. \u201cBollywood films are consumed by the popular masses, and we supply what the audience wants. So the bias gets reinforced,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think people in Bollywood really subscribe to the colour bias per se, but they have to enforce it. Because how else do you make the film work?</p> <p>\u201cThis bias isn\u2019t Indian in nature,\u201d he added. \u201cIn Hollywood, how often do you see a dark man with a white woman?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/30/indian-film-producers-motion-pictures-association-imppa-ban-pakistani-actors-crew-kashmir-crisis-escalates\">Indian film producers ban Pakistani actors 'for ever' over Kashmir crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The reaction to Chatterjee\u2019s Facebook post has pleased Agnes Joseph, a spokeswoman for the Dark is Beautiful campaign, which aims to change Indian mindsets about skin.</p> <p>\u201cAbout 95% of people in India are dark-skinned, yet a lot of us are forced to lighten,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the influence of the media and cinema which is constantly projecting light-skinned women, so the normal population thinks that\u2019s what it takes to look beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>The campaign goes into schools and colleges, teaching young people how to interpret the output of the country\u2019s media and entertainment industry. \u201cWe tell people you don\u2019t have to believe everything you see on the screen. We\u2019re not saying that fair isn\u2019t beautiful, but the point is dark is also beautiful,\u201d she said.</p> <p>All agree that such a deeply rooted mindset won\u2019t change overnight, but Mehta said the deep penetration of social media among India\u2019s middle classes meant debates over colour and caste \u2013 and other issues, such as homosexuality \u2013 could now be forced into the spotlight more easily. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a result of the digital era,\u201d he said. \u201cDeeply rooted biases can be brought out into the open.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Ever since Donald Trump blamed President Obama for the poverty and violence black people face in his \u201chome town\u201d <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-donald-trump-chicago-violence-speech-met-0722-20160721-story.html\">during</a> the Republican National Convention, the GOP candidate has become increasingly obsessed with the city of Chicago. </p> <p>\u201cWe have a situation where we have our inner cities \u2013 African Americans, Hispanics are living in hell because it\u2019s so dangerous,\u201d Trump said at this week\u2019s presidential debate. \u201cYou walk down the street, you get shot. In Chicago, they\u2019ve had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1. Thousands of shootings. And I say, where is this? Is this is a war-torn country? What are we doing?\u201d</p> <p>A reasonable person would think that someone who loves to talk about a city as much as this would, in turn, care about it \u2013 especially when that person has his name on one of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_International_Hotel_and_Tower_(Chicago)\">tallest buildings</a> in that city. But reasonable and Trump are two words that rarely go together.</p> <p>I can\u2019t believe that Trump\u2019s love of Chicago as a talking point has anything to do with him wanting to make it better for black people. Rather, it seems like an easy way of connecting with the racist assumptions of his supporters.</p> <p>Chicagoans haven\u2019t forgotten what happened when he touched down in March to attend his first rally in the city, at a university that prides itself on its diversity. After hearing about the crowd of protesters outside the venue, he cancelled the event, claiming police advised him to. Chicago PD, however, stated that they issued <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/272760-police-say-they-didnt-advise-trump-to-cancel-rally-ap\">no such instruction</a>.</p> <p>The arena exploded with a mixture of celebration and anger. Trump supporters took out their rage at the cancellation on the minorities who had come to show that they would fight to ensure he didn\u2019t win the election \u2013 and being there that day I can tell you \u201cminority\u201d was definitely not the word they used to describe us. The anger seemed to unite them in their support for Trump more than anything he could have on stage. It gave them a clear enemy.</p> <p>Trump has continued to use that moment in his Chicago-focused rhetoric. He also likes to cite the city\u2019s violent crime and homicide rates, boasting that he could bring them down \u2013 and that, for this reason, black people should vote for him. His strategy, he told Bill O\u2019Reilly, would involve the police being \u201cvery much tougher\u201d than they are now. He even claimed a \u201ctop police officer\u201d had told him that he could fix the problems in \u201cone week\u201d. (Chicago police <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-caught-embellishing-story-meeting-top-chicago-article-1.2764158\">denied</a> that any member of the senior team had met with him). </p> <p>Meanwhile, his former campaign manager, when asked why Trump doesn\u2019t discuss these issues with those affected by them, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/trump-chicago-rally-not-safe-lewandowski-227301\">said</a> that while he had once tried to go to talk to African Americans in Chicago, \u201cit was not a safe environment\u201d.</p> <p>Trump has yet to reschedule the rally, but he has since returned to the city for other events \u2013 the latest being <a href=\"http://abc7chicago.com/politics/donald-trump-campaigns-in-chicago/1530093/\">lunch</a> at a suburban country club that sold tickets ranging from $1,000 to $250,000. On the same day he spoke at the Polish National Alliance headquarters. Two places in which the only black people he would likely encounter would be working there. <br></p> <p>As the campaign continues, I expect he\u2019ll carry on avoiding neighborhoods like the south side of Chicago. Places he\u2019d actually have to engage with communities subject to some of the violence he tries to exploit, not, in my view, to win the support of black voters, but to gain the sympathy of supporters who don\u2019t believe black lives actually matter.<br></p> <p>Because to be quite blunt \u2013 and to borrow from Kanye West, the most famous artist of late to come out of the Windy City \u2013 I believe Donald Trump doesn\u2019t care about black people.

Meanwhile, the water to the house would be switched off that day.</p> <p>\u201cListen, we can do this the easy way or the hard way,\u201d he said. \u201cYou make the call.\u201d</p> <p>In Las Vegas, where an up-and-down economy creates big winners and desperate losers, thousands of houses sit vacant, abandoned to the gray-area between people who could no longer afford them and banks trying to get a handle on a spiraling inventory.</p> <p>Into the breach has stepped thousands of squatters, among them suspected scam artists who scheme to get utilities turned on at their chosen targets, living for free as they plot their end game: getting a bank to pay them to leave in a racket known as cash-for-keys.</p> <p>Using bogus leases, the scammers bring crime. Some have run drug, prostitution and weapons sale rings from their adopted homes. Others have started fires and slowly stripped houses of all resalable items.</p> <p>This scourge of illegal occupancies is the lasting legacy of the region\u2019s housing collapse of nearly a decade ago, which at the time left more than 80% of homes in southern Nevada underwater, a figure three times the national rate. Today, more than 2%, or nearly 14,000 homes, sit vacant in southern Clark County; the national average is 1.6%.</p> <p>Las Vegas metropolitan police, which patrol an area of nearly two million residents, have seen a 25% leap in the last three years in calls for service regarding suspected squatters, up to nearly 5,000 annually. In North Las Vegas, a city with 200,000 residents, officers have worked to remove trespassers from 180 homes in the last year alone.</p> <p>Now, authorities are upping their game with new laws and more aggressive enforcement.</p> <p>North Las Vegas has created a taskforce of police, code enforcement and utilities officials that have developed ways to red flag foreclosed vacant houses before squatters get a chance to move in.</p> <p>A new law approved by the state legislature last year now brings possible jail time for such offenses as housebreaking and forcibly entering a vacant home to take up residence or letting someone else live there without the owner\u2019s consent.</p> <p>Victoria Seaman, a Nevada assemblywoman and real estate agent who helped sponsor the new anti-squatter law, said Nevada is leading the nation in tough new housebreaking laws.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a problem nationwide, but no more so than here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing from other states who want to jump onboard with similar laws.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d323f4489680f5acd3365fa93871ff3581a24a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d323f4489680f5acd3365fa93871ff3581a24a8/0_139_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"North Las Vegas police officers Alain Villanueva and Scott Vaughn investigate a possible squatter residence.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">North Las Vegas police officers Alain Villanueva and Scott Vaughn investigate a possible squatter residence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Becker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Romina Wilson, business services manager for the North Las Vegas utilities department, has seen most of the tricks scammers use.</p> <p>Many times, the owner\u2019s name is wrong or humorously misspelled on the boilerplate lease.

Vaughn arrested a mother with five children, aged two to 11, who squatted in a house for eight months, the last five without water. Neighbors spotted her jumping fences at night to steal water.</p> <p>\u201cThe grandmother took custody of the kids, and was flabbergasted her daughter could allow them to live this way,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were both flabbergasted.\u201d</p> <p>On a recent week day, Vaughn and Officer Allen Villanueva were busy.</p> <p>After the stop on Ocotillo Mesa, another tip from a neighbor led the patrolmen to a house inhabited by four suspected squatters.</p> <p>After questioning, two men were arrested for unrelated warrants, and the women dragged their belongings out to the street, as city workers bolted the doors behind them.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I go home to the neighborhood I\u2019ve chosen for a safe environment,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m satisfied that I\u2019ve helped provide that safe environment for someone else.\u201d</p>",

Findings showed that despite 81% of millennials believing business has a key role to play in achieving the SDGs, the majority of businesses are not yet acting. </p> <p>This is not surprising, says Lord Mark Malloch-Brown, chairman of the Business and Sustainable Development Commission (a not-for-profit organisation focusing on sustainable business), and former deputy UN secretary-general.</p> <p>\u201c[Sustainable business] is a movement that\u2019s still gathering momentum and authority,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s also a realm of difference [between] those who are trying to make sustainability part of their core business strategy and those who still see it as an \u2018add-on\u2019.\u201d</p> <h2>US engagement low</h2> <p>Regionally, respondents in Africa, Latin America and the Middle East are engaging most with the goals, according to Ethical Corporation\u2019s research, with the lowest level of engagement (37%) in North America.</p> <p>US-headquartered businesses are sometimes slower than their counterparts in Europe to embrace UN-sponsored initiatives, says Aron Cramer, CEO of sustainability consultancy BSR, adding they \u201chave a cultural preference to do first and talk later\u201d. \u201cThat said, we see a great many [US] companies, such as Microsoft and others, embracing the goals and working towards integrating them into their business strategies.\u201d</p> <p>Developed regions are focusing primarily on climate action (SDG 13), the report finds, while developing regions are prioritising pressing development challenges. SDG four, quality education, came out top in Africa, for example.</p> <p>Climate action was also the most supported goal among corporate and brand respondents (63%), followed by SDG eight, decent work and economic growth (52%), and SDG 12, responsible consumption and production (51%), which was particularly popular among apparel, fast-moving consumer goods and manufacturing companies. SDG one, no poverty, and SDG two, no hunger, were among the least supported goals, scoring 22% and 20% respectively.</p> <h2>Integrating the SDGs into business </h2> <p>Although it\u2019s too early for practical, widespread business action on the SDGs, companies are doing the groundwork to integrate the goals into their sustainability strategies, according to Malloch-Brown.</p> <p>Building on a sound, established approach to human rights and environmental issues is vital, says Ole Lund Hansen, chief of leadership programmes at the UN Global Compact, before companies determine where their activities have an impact on people, economies or the environment, and prioritise specific goals. </p> <p>From there, businesses need to consider which SDGs reflect their own purpose, review existing sustainable development work in the bigger picture context of the goals, and identify where they stand to make the most difference, says Cramer. </p> <p> Hansen says companies should incentivise every employee to achieve SDG-related targets, including through performance reviews.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.dnvgl.com/technology-innovation/spaceship-earth/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a> by risk management firm DNV GL highlights 17 companies (including Unilever, Siemens, Marks &amp; Spencer and Danone) taking action on specific SDGs, and concludes that businesses of this kind are ready to take \u201cextraordinary action\u201d to help achieve the goals. </p> <p>The report says these firms are characterised by their ability to see the potential of combining growth and sustainability, form collaborations, use technology to achieve scale and reach, and see the SDGs as a way to achieve competitive advantage.</p> <p>The business it highlights for SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), Kenyan telecommunications giant Safaricom, created the mobile money platform M-Pesa, which is now used by more than 25m people in Africa, Asia and Europe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a78b170675ab6f74916c7387e0acc7ba8667bc6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a78b170675ab6f74916c7387e0acc7ba8667bc6f/61_0_2631_1579/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Safaricom headquarters in Nairobi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Safaricom headquarters in Nairobi</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Mukoya/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It allows people who struggle to access traditional financial services to send and receive money via their mobile phones, and has provided a springboard for further innovations in renewable energy, healthcare, food and agriculture.

Catalysing further progress on the goals will require a more balanced approach to regulations on investment, particularly renewable energy investments v fossil fuel subsidies, says Malloch-Brown. Policy-makers could also consider making corporate contributions to sustainable development mandatory, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jun/03/the-missing-development-trillions-how-you-would-fund-the-sdgs\">says</a> Ashoka\u2019s Archana Sinha.

Services account for almost 80% of the UK economy.</p> <p>The ONS said there was no sign that Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU triggered an immediate shock to the economy, but it was waiting for the full picture to emerge. </p> <p>Economists largely agree that while Britain will almost certainly avoid a recession this year, the economy is likely to slow in 2017 as businesses and consumers grapple with heightened uncertainty. </p> <p>Here is a roundup of economists\u2019 reaction to the latest figures.</p> <h2><strong>Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to forecasters EY Item Club</strong></h2> <p>\u201cConsumers did most of the heavy lifting that supported the upward revision of GDP in the second quarter. More importantly, the services sector showed a 0.4% increase in output in July, a very strong out-turn which should end any fears that GDP will contract in the third quarter. </p> <p>\u201cOur short-term model suggests that we are now on track to see GDP growth in the region of 0.2-0.3% in the third quarter. The economy looks to be in much better shape than many had feared it would be as we move towards the fourth quarter. The latest data supports our above-consensus view that the economy will grow by 1.9% this year. And with activity carrying more momentum than anticipated, there is the chance of an upside surprise for 2017.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>John Hawksworth, chief economist at accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCooper</strong></h2> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s data confirmed the generally favourable picture of how the UK economy evolved immediately before and after the Brexit vote.</p> <p>\u201cWe do still expect some moderation in GDP growth later this year and in 2017 as increased uncertainty acts as a drag on business investment, but there are no signs yet of the Brexit vote pushing the UK into recession.\u201d </p> <h2><strong>Scott Corfe, director at the </strong><strong>Centre for Economics and Business Research</strong></h2> <p>\u201cThere is very little evidence of a slowdown in the UK economy either prior to or immediately after the Brexit referendum. A recession will almost certainly be avoided this year.</p> <p>\u201cHaving said that, 2017 is set to be a challenging year in Cebr\u2019s view, with economic growth expected to slow from about 2% this year to close to 0.5%. Economic growth has been partly driven by UK consumers becoming less cautious and saving less. This could easily unravel in the face of headwinds that cause consumers to adopt a more cautious attitude \u2013 such as the significant degree of economic uncertainty that is likely to be seen over the coming years, both Brexit-related and otherwise.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics</strong></h2> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>The jump in services output in July is the clearest sign yet that the Brexit vote has not pushed the economy into a recession. Since the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee expected GDP growth to slow to 0.2% in the third quarter, considerable doubt is now cast over whether the MPC will cut interest rates again in November. </p> <p>\u201cA strong case remains, however, for expecting the economic recovery to slow ahead. Surveys show clearly that businesses are holding back from investment, while households will soon be hit by a rebound in inflation due to sterling\u2019s depreciation.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight</strong></h2> <p>\u201cNews that services output grew 0.4% month-on-month in July in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote is a significant boost to third quarter growth prospects; consequently we are lifting our third quarter growth estimate to 0.4% quarter-on-quarter from 0.3%.</p> <p>\u201cNevertheless, we expect the economy will find growth increasingly difficult over the coming months, particularly in 2017, although it will most likely dodge recession. We expect the economy to suffer as the uncertainties facing businesses and consumers are magnified by the triggering of Article 50. Additionally, the fundamentals for consumers will likely increasingly weaken as their purchasing power is diluted by rising inflation and muted earnings growth. Furthermore, the labour market looks likely to soften in 2017.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics</strong></h2> <p>\u201cAlthough the incoming economic data has suggested that the immediate economic impact of Brexit has not been as severe as some had expected, growth still looks to have slowed markedly in the third quarter. Survey measures point to quarterly growth of only a bit above zero.</p> <p>\u201cNonetheless, with another cut in interest rates likely when the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee meets again on 3 November, and some easing in the fiscal squeeze set to be announced later that month in the autumn statement, we don\u2019t think that the economy is headed into a more pronounced downturn. We maintain our view that GDP will expand by a subdued, but above-consensus 1.5% in 2017.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank</strong></h2> <p>\u201cThe more interesting release was the monthly services output data for July. Representing around three quarters of the economy, this was the first official output data for the sector to cover the post Brexit vote period. </p> <p>\u201cServices grew by 0.4% month-on-month, well above consensus, with the prior month also revised up for good measure. So despite the Brexit vote and the anxiety surrounding it, it was business as usual in the services sector.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>James Lovelock\u2019s parting words <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2008/mar/01/scienceofclimatechange.climatechange\">last time we met</a> were: \u201cEnjoy life while you can. Because if you\u2019re lucky, it\u2019s going to be 20 years before it hits the fan.\u201d It was early 2008, and the distinguished scientist was predicting imminent and irreversible global warming, which would soon make large parts of the planet uninhabitably hot or put them underwater. The fashionable hope that windfarms or recycling could prevent global famine and mass migration was, he assured me, a fantasy; it was too late for ethical consumption to save us. Before the end of this century, 80% of the world\u2019s population would be wiped out.</p> <p>His predictions were not easy to forget or dismiss. Sometimes described as a futurist, Lovelock has been Britain\u2019s leading independent scientist for more than 50 years. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/aug/27/james-lovelock-gaia\">Gaia hypothesis</a>, which contends that the earth is a single, self-regulating organism, is now accepted as the founding principle of most climate science, and <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/voices-of-science/interviewees/james-lovelock/audio/james-lovelock-on-measuring-haze-and-cfcs-in-englands-air\">his invention of a device to detect CFCs</a> helped identify the hole in the ozone layer.

At 97, he\u2019s conceived a beautifully illustrated book of essays described as a \u201ctool kit for the future\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/graphic_design/all/02888/facts.james_lovelock_et_al_the_earth_and_i.htm\">The Earth and I</a>, and written the introduction and conclusion; he goes walking every day, his hearing is perfect, his focus forensic and his memory unimpaired. \u201cYes, why not? I\u2019m writing a fiction book at the moment. It\u2019s tremendous fun, you know.\u201d He applies his holistic philosophy of science to his own health. \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer that if you don\u2019t use it, you lose it \u2013 and if you do a lot of walking, and if you use your muscles quite a bit, your brain seems to work as well. You\u2019ve got to look at the whole system, not just bits of it.\u201d</p> <p>What has changed dramatically, however, is his position on climate change. He now says: \u201cAnyone who tries to predict more than five to 10 years is a bit of an idiot, because so many things can change unexpectedly.\u201d But isn\u2019t that exactly what he did last time we met? \u201cI know,\u201d he grins teasingly. \u201cBut I\u2019ve grown up a bit since then.\u201d</p> <p>Lovelock now believes that \u201cCO2 is going up, but nowhere near as fast as they thought it would. The computer models just weren\u2019t reliable. In fact,\u201d he goes on breezily, \u201cI\u2019m not sure the whole thing isn\u2019t crazy, this climate change. You\u2019ve only got to look at Singapore. It\u2019s two-and-a-half times higher than the worst-case scenario for climate change, and it\u2019s one of the most desirable cities in the world to live in.\u201d</p> <p>There are various possible explanations for his change of heart. One is that Lovelock is right, and the models on which his former predictions were based were fatally flawed. Another is that his iconoclastic sensibility made revision irresistible. An incorrigible subversive, Lovelock was warning the world about climate change for decades before it began to pay attention, and just when the scientific consensus began to call for intervention to prevent it, he decided we were already too late. But there is a third explanation for why he has shifted his position again, and nowadays feels \u201claid back about climate change\u201d. All things being equal \u2013 \u201cand it\u2019s only got to take one sizable volcano to erupt and all the models, everything else, is right off the board\u201d \u2013 he expects that before the consequences of global warming can impact on us significantly, something else will have made our world unrecognisable, and threaten the human race.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0918dde447d25076e6af81ecdd7d9f56809cc603\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0918dde447d25076e6af81ecdd7d9f56809cc603/0_105_1263_1577/801.jpg\" alt=\"Lovelock in 1991 with the book that made his name\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lovelock in 1991, with one of his books on Gaia theory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Gardner/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lovelock maintains that, unlike most environmentalists, he is a rigorous empiricist, but it is manifestly clear that he enjoys maddening the green movement. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a religion, really, you see. It\u2019s totally unscientific.\u201d He was once invited to Buckingham Palace, where he told Princess Anne: \u201cYour brother nearly killed me.\u201d Having read that Prince Charles <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZBxRMpQ5ZtwC&amp;pg=PT161&amp;lpg=PT161&amp;dq=prince+charles+grass+burning+boilers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=13QQWG6ZKr&amp;sig=MwWd18lt8dJvIYn8LZO7SD62CP8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU37XV47TPAhUlIcAKHZuyDu4Q6AEIHDAA\">had installed grass-burning boilers</a> at Highgrove, Lovelock had tried one in his house. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to smoulder and keep the place warm; but it doesn\u2019t, because it goes out, and clouds and clouds of smoke come out.\u201d He giggles. \u201cPrincess Anne thought this was hilariously funny.\u201d</p> <p>Lovelock had been trying to heat his old mill in Devon, where he lived for more than 35 years, inventing contraptions in a workshop that resembled a Doctor Who set. He and his wife recently packed up his life\u2019s work and downsized to a remote cottage on Chesil Beach in Dorset, after the bill to heat the mill for just six months hit \u00a36,000. \u201cI remember <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2014/apr/24/james-lovelocks-book-genius-defence\">George Monbiot took me up on it</a> and wrote that it was impossible, that I had to be lying. But I wasn\u2019t lying, I\u2019ve got the figures.\u201d Monbiot doesn\u2019t quite accuse him of lying, in fairness; just of \u201ctalking rubbish\u201d and \u201cmaking wild statements\u201d. In any case, he says that in the US he found he could heat a house for six months, in temperatures of -20C (-4F), for just \u00a360. As a result, he has withering contempt for environmentalists\u2019 opposition to fracking. \u201cYou see, gas in America is incredibly cheap, because of fracking,\u201d he says. But what about the risk of triggering earthquakes? He rolls his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cSure enough, that\u2019s true, there will be an increase. But they\u2019re tiny little tremors, they would be imperceptible. The only trouble is that you can detect them. The curse of my life has been that I\u2019ve spent a lot of time inventing devices that are exceedingly sensitive. And the moment somebody can detect something, they\u2019re going to attach a number to it, and then they make a fuss about it.\u201d He chuckles, then pauses. \u201cI\u2019m not anti-green in the sense that I\u2019m in favour of polluting the world with every damn thing we make. I think we\u2019ve got to be careful. But I\u2019m afraid, human nature being what it is, the thing gets exaggerated out of all proportion, and the greens have behaved deplorably instead of being reasonably sensible.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/aug/27/james-lovelock-gaia\">How James Lovelock introduced Gaia to an unsuspecting world | Science Book Club</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even more heretical than his enthusiasm for fracking is Lovelock\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.jameslovelock.org/page11.html\">passionate support for nuclear power</a>. But, like fracking, he says, it offers only \u201ca stopgap\u201d solution. \u201cBecause in the long term, they\u2019ll use up all the uranium.\u201d How long would that take? He pauses to do some quick mental arithmetic, as casually as I might tot up how many pints of milk to grab from Sainsburys.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s see \u2026 I think uranium that is affordable to extract would last about 50 years, something in that range. It might be 100. When you\u2019ve used all that up, you go to thorium, and that would last you three times as long as uranium \u2013 so, shall we say, about 200 years?\u201d The most sensible energy solution would be to cover 100 sq miles of the Sahara in solar panels. \u201cIt would supply the whole of Europe with all the energy they needed,\u201d but it won\u2019t happen \u201cbecause it would be so easy for terrorists to go and bugger it up\u201d. So for now, nuclear energy is the only viable option.</p> <p>But all this, he clarifies cheerfully, is more or less academic. \u201cBecause quite soon \u2013 before we\u2019ve reached the end of this century, even \u2013 I think that what people call robots will have taken over.\u201d Robots will rule the world? \u201cWell, yes. They\u2019ll be in charge.\u201d In charge of us? \u201cYes, if we\u2019re still here.

Still, when Lovelock outlines this vision, his tone is so matter-of-fact that for a moment I wonder if he\u2019s joking. He isn\u2019t. \u201cWe\u2019re already happily letting computers design themselves. This has been going on for some time now, particularly with chips, and it\u2019s not going to be long before that\u2019s out of our hands, and we\u2019ll be standing aside and saying, \u2018Oh well, it\u2019s doing a good job designing itself, let\u2019s encourage it.\u2019\u201d Computers will develop independent volition and intuition (\u201cTo some extent, they already have\u201d) and become capable of reproducing themselves, and of evolving. \u201cOh yes, that\u2019s crucial. We\u2019ll have a world where Darwin\u2019s working.\u201d Darwinism doesn\u2019t work now? \u201cOh no, we\u2019ve temporarily turned Darwinism backwards.

I don\u2019t want this appearing in the Guardian that he just wants all the dumb and the lowlifes wiped out.\u201d</p> <p>Lovelock doesn\u2019t sound the least bit troubled by the prospect of robots taking over, though, despite the possibility that they will destroy us. \u201cOnce they become at all established anywhere, that\u2019s the end, because to robots time happens one million times faster \u2013 that\u2019s a fairly exact figure \u2013 than it does to us. That\u2019s rather wonderful in a way, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>I ask him to explain. \u201cWell, for a neuron to travel a foot takes a microsecond \u2013 which is fairly fast. But for electrons to go down a foot of wire takes a nanosecond. It\u2019s a million times faster, as simple as that. So to a robot, once fully established in that new world, a second is a million seconds. Everything is happening so fast that they have on earth a million times longer to live, to grow up, to evolve, than we do.\u201d</p> <p>It is possible, he goes on, that human beings may fuse with robots to become a blend of robotic and human tissue (\u201cThat\u2019s one route\u201d), but the likelier scenario will be pure robots. Why does he think we\u2019ll go for all-out robots? He shoots me an amused look. \u201cI don\u2019t think <em>we </em>will. I think that <em>they </em>will \u2013 that\u2019s the key thing here.\u201d</p> <p>The implications for climate change are obvious. \u201cThe world that they\u2019re going to be comfortable in is wildly different from the one that we feel comfortable in. So once they really get established, they will \u2013 with regret \u2013 start losing organic life.\u201d Will they care about rising temperatures? \u201cThey won\u2019t give a fourpenny fuck about the temperature, because to them the change will be slow, and they can stand quite a big change without any fuss. They could accommodate infinitely greater change through climate change than we can, before things get tricky for them. It\u2019s what the world can stand that is the important thing. They\u2019re going to have a safe platform to live in, so they don\u2019t want Gaia messed about too much.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/15/james-lovelock-interview-gaia-theory\">James Lovelock: The UK should be going mad for fracking</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Notwithstanding his caveats about the dangers of predictions, his confidence in the robotic future he describes is \u201cfairly high. Yes, all sorts of things can happen, but that\u2019s the intuitive feeling I have\u201d. As for our interaction with robots: \u201cWell, it\u2019s going to be very peculiar.\u201d In the classic Frankenstein tradition, will humanity not understand what it has created until it\u2019s too late? \u201cWell, too late is the wrong word. Let\u2019s say, until it has happened.\u201d The phrase \u201ctoo late\u201d, he explains, implies regret \u2013 but whereas the robots might see no use for our continued existence, \u201cmaybe we\u2019ve got some special property that they will appreciate.

So it was taken when I was a CSKA Moscow player, not with&#xa0;Leicester. But when I read the story&#xa0;I was laughing because it\u2019s very funny \u2013 \u2018Why is Ahmed Musa wearing a Man&#xa0;U kit?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It says much about Musa\u2019s personality that during the course of that story he casually drops into the conversation that he was handing out food to those who are not as fortunate as him, as if it is a perfectly normal thing for a professional footballer to do in his spare time. Musa is that sort of man. Softly spoken, humble and with a strong Muslim faith, the 23-year-old has not forgotten his roots.</p> <p>He is currently having a sport centre built in Hotoro, where he played for Kano Pillars, the Nigerian Premier League club. \u201cThe people back home have been so nice to me, so I want to give something back to them,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I go back home in the future I can train with the children and feel very&#xa0;happy.\u201d</p> <p>Musa remembers what it was like growing up in Nigeria with a ball at his feet and it turns out that back in those days he was more likely to be seen wearing the colours of one of Manchester United\u2019s rivals. \u201cI grew up as an Arsenal fan,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cAll because of Nwankwo Kanu.\u201d</p> <p>Musa\u2019s eyes light up when he is asked about Kanu\u2019s influence. \u201cKanu is like a role model for me,\u201d he says. \u201cI got to know him when I started playing in the national team. He\u2019s like a hero in Nigeria. We always have contact with each other and I spoke to him before I came to Leicester. I was in Russia and he called me, because he always advises me what to do. He told me that I would enjoy it in the Premier League and England, that it was a nice place.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b6ffd11f2b712ee925bdd00a72456e60d26dee5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b6ffd11f2b712ee925bdd00a72456e60d26dee5/0_77_4128_2477/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ahmed Musa has a shot saved by Chelsea\u2019s Asmir Begovic during Leicester City\u2019s EFL Cup third round defeat last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ahmed Musa has a shot saved by Chelsea\u2019s Asmir Begovic during Leicester City\u2019s EFL Cup third round defeat last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everything that Musa has seen so far has convinced him Kanu was right. Together with his wife and two young children, Ahmed Jnr and Halima, Musa has quickly settled into his new surroundings. He has found a mosque in Leicester where he can attend prayer and enjoys the fact that he can speak freely to his team-mates after four years in Moscow relying on a translator.</p> <p>Musa\u2019s time on the pitch for the Premier League champions has been limited \u2013 two starts and six substitute appearances \u2013 but the winger has no problem with that and accepts Claudio Ranieri\u2019s view that he needs time to adjust to the speed and intensity of English football.</p> <p>His own pace is not a problem, as he showed with the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa1AwuyYYHE\" title=\"\">first of his two goals against Barcelona in pre-season</a>, when he sprinted from inside his own half to score, and it would be intriguing to see who crosses the finishing line first in a 100m race with Jamie Vardy. \u201cWe haven\u2019t tried yet so I can\u2019t say now who is the quickest. But I tell you this \u2013 we\u2019re going to have a race one day,\u201d says Musa, smiling.</p> <p>Born and raised in Jos as one of five children, Musa\u2019s skills were honed on the streets before he started to train at the Aminchi Football Academy six days a week, getting up at 6am to go before school. His talent soon shone through. \u201cMy friends called me Cristiano Ronaldo because I was playing on the wing and they thought I had a little bit of speed like him,\u201d says Musa.</p> <p>It was not an easy upbringing, however, and Musa had to come to terms with the devastating loss of his father while he was at school. \u201cHe passed away when I was little, he doesn\u2019t know anything about his son being one of the stars in Nigeria, so for me it\u2019s sad that he didn\u2019t see what I am today,\u201d Musa says. \u201cBut I know I have to keep on playing for him and I think he\u2019d be proud of me.\u201d</p> <p>Musa\u2019s first big break came in 2010, when he signed for the Dutch club VVV-Venlo. He speaks warmly about his experience in Holland, describing the football as \u201camazing\u201d and chuckling at the memory of a match against Ajax, when he scored twice and gave Daley Blind the runaround to such an extent that the now Manchester United defender was substituted.</p> <p>By the time Musa emerged as one of the standout players at the Under\u201120 World Cup in 2011, several Premier League clubs were linked with him, but at the age of 19 he felt that it was too soon to come to England and instead signed for CSKA Moscow. Apart from the weather and the language \u2013 \u201ccrazy\u201d says Musa, shaking his head \u2013 he thoroughly enjoyed his four years in Russia, where he played in the Champions League and won three league titles.</p> <p>Musa talks about how Russia has made \u201ca lot of improvement in relation to racism \u2013 I didn\u2019t see anything during my time there\u201d \u2013 and he has some special words for Leonid Slutsky, the CSKA coach, who briefly converted him to a striker and was always offering encouragement. \u201cHe\u2019s like a father to me,\u201d he says. \u201cI think he is the one who made me what I am today.\u201d</p> <p>If there was a moment when Musa came to global prominence it was at the World Cup finals in Brazil, where he scored a couple of brilliantly-taken goals in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/25/nigeria-argentina-world-cup-group-f-match-report\" title=\"\">3-2 defeat against Argentina</a>. As he walked off the pitch with Gonzalo Higua\u00edn\u2019s shirt, he knew that his life was never going to be the same. \u201cThat was when my profile changed,\u201d Musa says. \u201cFor me, that Argentina game was a big surprise, I\u2019d never experienced anything like that \u2013 I never thought I could do that. After the match I said: \u2018Wow.\u2019 It was like a dream.\u201d</p> <p>The great sadness for Musa is that the man who was Nigeria\u2019s coach at the time is no longer with us. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/08/stephen-keshi-brawler-talker-most-successful-black-african-coach\" title=\"\">Stephen Keshi died in June after suffering a heart attack at the age of 54</a> and Musa sounds like he is still coming to terms with the loss of one of the most influential people in his life.</p> <p>\u201cIt came as a big shock to me. I couldn\u2019t believe it because two days before he died we spoke with him,\u201d Musa remembers. \u201cSo I was so surprised when I heard the sad news, because he sounded so healthy. I\u2019d played under him for about three and a half years, in the Nations Cup and the World Cup, and he was a very nice guy, another who was like a father to me. As Nigerians and Africans, we miss a great man.\u201d</p> <p>As Musa looks to the future, he hopes to help Nigeria qualify for the World Cup finals in 2018 and between now and then intends to make his mark at Leicester, even if he has to bide his time. \u201cThe Premier League is much faster than Russia \u2013 there is so much running here \u2013 but I think within a few games I will be able to adapt,\u201d he says as his team prepare for Sunday\u2019s game against Southampton. \u201cWhenever the manager decides, I\u2019ll be ready to play and give 100%.\u201d</p>",

You will score points by passing through doorways to collect fish, and with the penguin models weighted to allow for dramatic curves and rolls, it\u2019s possible to pull off some impressive trick shots, even launching your<strong> </strong>figure into the air to leap over walls or rival penguins that get in your way.<br></p> <p>Each round also sees one player take on the role of the \u201ccatcher\u201d, attempting to score points by colliding with other penguins.

Since its release in 2004, it\u2019s sold more than 3m copies, and over the years it\u2019s spawned a series of spin-offs allowing players to build rail empires in different locations around the world. <a href=\"https://www.daysofwonder.com/tickettoride/en/rails-and-sails/\">Rails and Sails</a> is designer Alan R Moon\u2019s latest take on the game\u2019s popular card-based formula, and it takes things to a new and much grander scale, with players competing on a global map to build worldwide networks of railways and shipping lanes.<br></p> <p>If you have played previous games in the series, you will find the core of the game largely unchanged. Players collect cards to claim routes on the board, secretly aiming to connect certain locations on the map to score bonus points. You\u2019ll attempt to find the most efficient routes between cities and to block off the connections your opponents desperately need. The biggest change, though, is that you will need different types of cards to claim land- or sea-based routes. In effect, you\u2019re building two separate networks, and it feels a lot like playing two games of Ticket to Ride simultaneously.</p> <p>It\u2019s a more mentally taxing take on the original game\u2019s premise, but unfortunately it doesn\u2019t take long for this edition to come off the rails. The requirement to collect different cards means that you can spend several turns fishing for the ones you need before you\u2019re actually able to do anything, and it soon becomes frustrating. Rails and Sails adds length and complexity, but it offers little new in terms of gameplay.</p> <p>If you\u2019re new to Ticket to Ride, this isn\u2019t the place to jump aboard; you\u2019ll have much more fun with the original game. If you\u2019re already a fan, the existing map pack expansions bring more variety and better value for money. My recommendation: the excellent <a href=\"https://www.daysofwonder.com/tickettoride/en/united-kingdom/\">UK and Ireland</a> expansion.</p> <h2>Mystic Vale</h2> <p><strong>2-4 players, 30 - 45 minutes<br>RRP: \u00a338.99</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44df5f6c6f8cd3f00ab463a578b18f10f60afc71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44df5f6c6f8cd3f00ab463a578b18f10f60afc71/0_0_1920_1280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mystic Vale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mystic Vale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Strategy card games such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/10/magic-the-gathering-pop-culture-hit-where-next\">Magic: The Gathering</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/14/netrunner-took-over-my-life-and-why-it-should-take-over-yours-too\">Android: Netrunner</a> are a cornerstone of gamer culture.

There\u2019s little in the way of actual interaction between players, meaning that it can feel as though everyone at the table is immersed in their own individual game. While there are multiple deck-building strategies to choose from, it won\u2019t take long to discover them all.

  "<p>Today is a good day for the roughly 500 prisoners at Ramsey County correctional facility in St Paul, Minnesota. Today is an egg day.

Wardens and prison managers are under intense pressure to cut costs across the board, including the food provided to inmates, some of whom are thought to be fed for less than $1.20 a day.</p> <p>In many prisons across the US, inmates only rarely receive eggs, dairy or meat and fresh fruit and vegetables are sometimes banned altogether. Instead nutritionists are called into figure out ways of achieving states\u2019 minimum calorie counts and vitamin and nutrient intakes via tubs of margarine and fortified mineral powders and supplements.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Being in prison is punishment enough, they don\u2019t have to be tortured by bad food</p> <footer> <cite>Tom Roy, Minnesota\u2019s commissioner for corrections</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many prisons\u2019 food service has been outsourced to private companies offering big cost savings and making big profits for their shareholders. One of the biggest, Philadelphia-based Aramark, a company with annual sales of $14.3bn, continues to serve up 380m meals a year as the sole food provider to more than 600 prisons and other correctional institutions despite repeated fines over scandals including serving food tainted by maggots and rats.</p> <p>While they have a long list of complaints about the food, which is prepared by teams of fellow prisoners, the inmates at Ramsey are luckier than most. Minnesota has brought its food service provision back in-house after years of outsourcing to the private sector and has committed to providing real food for inmates even if it costs more money.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to fill a bowl with a substance that might meet the calorie requirement and vitamins and minerals [the state requires], but has no appeal,\u201d Tom Roy, Minnesota\u2019s commissioner for corrections, said in an interview. \u201cBeing in prison is punishment enough, they don\u2019t have to be tortured by bad food.\u201d</p> <p>Roy said he has been able to spend a little bit more than most other states as Minnesota has one of the lowest per capita incarceration rates in the country at less than 200 per 100,000 people compared to more than 800 per 100,000 in Louisiana, the state with the highest.</p> <p>There is no nationally collected data on prison food spending, which is set at the state or individual prison level. Roy said Minnesota spends an average of just under $3 a day on food for its 10,000 prisoners. \u201cThat is on the high end, there are some states that do it for considerably less.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/22/ramen-unlikely-new-symbol-of-prison-neglect\">How ramen became the unlikely new symbol of prison neglect | Chandra Bozelko</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tim Thielman, a lieutenant at Ramsey and the president of the Association of Correctional Food Service Affiliates (ACFSA) which brings together prison officials and food providers for an annual conference taking place across town, said some jails feed prisoners for as little as $1.20 \u2013 the average cost of each meal at Ramsey.</p> <p>Thielman, who has devoted his career to thinking about the food provided to prisoners, said spending a little bit more money on food can have a huge impact in improving prisoners\u2019 mental and physical health and bringing down reoffending rates.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people are still in the mentality of bread and water,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are passed that in this country.

He talks to the prison administrator, a general prison staff member and at least one offender. \u201cMy icebreaker is always: \u2018How\u2019s the food today\u2019?\u201d he said.</p> <p>Roy, who says he makes a point of hanging out in the mess hall and eats with the inmates occasionally, said the responses are \u201cmixed\u201d. \u201cWe do have some days when it\u2019s pretty tasty, there are others when its school cafeteria food.\u201d </p> <p>If Roy had asked Ragland about this breakfast morning, he would have given him an \u201call right, but could do better\u201d mark mainly because the prisoner who normally makes the porridge was off today.</p>",

  "<p>For Afghan refugees such as me, we are now entering a perfect storm. Europe wants to make aid to our country contingent on its acceptance of at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/28/eu-secret-ultimatum-afghanistan-accept-80000-deportees-lose-aid-brussels-summit-migration-sensitive\" title=\"\">80,000 deported asylum seekers</a> who arrived on the continent last year. Simultaneously, Pakistan \u2013 the country that houses more expatriate Afghans than any other \u2013 plans to repatriate the 3 million Afghans who have sought refuge there since 1978. The former face reprisals from the extremists from whom they fled. The latter must head for a country where most of them have never even set foot.</p> <p>All this will create or worsen three separate crises. The European asylum system might have to bend its own rules to send people back to a war zone, which would set a bad example to other countries \u2013 not least Pakistan. It will also greatly affect refugees already in Europe \u2013 people in similar situations to me.</p> <p>I am an Afghan refugee living in the UK. Thankfully I am now a legal resident here \u2013 but if I were sent back to Afghanistan, I would risk being killed by the militias that forced me to flee in the first place. And then there are the Afghans currently in Pakistan. Tens of thousands of these people are second- or third-generation immigrants who were born and raised in Pakistan. These refugees made Pakistan their home, started businesses, went to college. For most of them, Afghanistan is a foreign country.</p> <p>It could also spark crisis in Afghanistan itself. The return of more than 3 million people would cause mayhem in an already fragile country. It would stretch limited resources, increase ethnic and religious tensions and exacerbate the violence that is already forcing many people from their homes. <a href=\"http://thediplomat.com/2016/07/the-problem-with-afghanistans-counterinsurgency/\" title=\"\">According to a recent report by the Afghan government\u2019s Independent Directorate of Local Governance</a>, over 50% of the country\u2019s 384 districts face some threat of violence.</p> <p>The return of millions more people can only make this situation worse \u2013 and cause yet another wave of refugees to flee their homes. In trying to contain one refugee crisis, Europe and Pakistan are about to create another. There are no quick fixes, and it is foolish to think otherwise.</p> <p>A bit of context: in historic terms, Afghanistan is the world\u2019s top exporter of refugees. Together, the communist revolution in 1978 and the Soviet invasion in 1979 sent 5 million refugees to Pakistan and 3 million to Iran. More followed during the civil wars between the extremist factions who defeated the Soviets. Then more fled the Taliban. And while the western invasion in 2001 may have ousted the Taliban from power, the conflict \u2013 and the migration \u2013 continues to this day. The US and UK armies gave Afghans little reason to stay, and neither has the new Kabul government.</p> <p>Many Afghans living in major cities would rather take a risky route to reach Europe than live with the economic uncertainty and the security threats. And if you live in a rural area \u2013 like nearly 70% of the Afghan population \u2013 you might prefer to leave than be recruited into the ranks of the Taliban, al-Qaida, or Islamic State.</p> <p>Meanwhile, many believe the 2014 presidential election was rigged and that the government is incapable of responding to their basic needs. The rivalry between the president, Ashraf Ghani, and his chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah, has made things harder \u2013 the two have been squabbling since beginning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/14/ashraf-ghani-visit-pakistan-afghanistan\" title=\"\">a power-sharing exercise</a> in November 2014. All the while, political polarisation is on the rise due to ethnocentric agendas within the Afghan government.</p> <p>The west\u2019s response has been to throw aid money at the government. The UK remains one of the largest aid donors, giving \u00a3178m per year. But this is wasted money. As David Cameron himself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/10/david-cameron-afghanistan-nigeria-possibly-most-corrupt-countries\" title=\"\">said during an anti-corruption summit</a>, the Kabul administration is \u201cfantastically corrupt\u201d. It so far has no proper strategy for re-assimilating such a large number of refugees, nor the funding to make it possible. This makes it very hard for any repatriation plan to be successful.</p> <p>There is little hope that the government in Kabul can care for the existing residents of Afghanistan \u2013 let alone another 3 million with no shelter and food. The plan to return 80,000 Afghans from Europe \u2013 as well as millions from Pakistan \u2013 is dangerous and misguided.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s fair to say that the UK book market is not exactly groaning under the weight of Mauritian literature, (though it\u2019s there if you know where to look).

The blurb describes these as \u201cmonologues\u201d, which seems wholly apt: one of Devi and Zuckerman\u2019s greatest triumphs in this book is that each character has their own distinct rhythms, with power and poetry drawn from the cadences of their speech.</p> <p>The titular Eve \u201ctrades\u201d her body with men who she is perfectly aware take but do not give, acquiring in&#xa0;the process something she herself cannot define. Her narration is extraordinary, shifting between describing solid, often sordid details with vivid precision, and soaring into more abstract passages that echo the ebb and flow of the sea that \u201csurges, escapes, shatters\u201d on the island\u2019s shore. The overall effect is vertiginous; it is as though Eve has been unmoored from reality, pulled in contrary directions.</p> <p>Saadiq, who claims to love her, has similar lyrical flights, inspired by a classroom encounter with the words of his fellow 17-year-old Rimbaud. Yet he oscillates uneasily between time spent alone with Eve or with books, and subsuming himself to the will of his gang, a \u201cmoving, powerful, hot body that nothing can stop\u201d. This tension between page and street also finds expression in the copied lines of poetry Saadiq daubs on Eve\u2019s apartment wall, and the insistent refrain that pulses through the nightclub where he watches her dance with her friend Savita: \u201cBaby won\u2019t you give it to me, you know I want it.\u201d</p> <p>Savita is less sharply drawn, but her tender, protective relationship with Eve offers the latter a space of \u201ccalm sunlight\u201d which leaves Saadiq furious but impotent. His obsessive focus on Eve\u2019s body is no match for what Eve herself calls \u201cthe poetry of women\u201d \u2013 something she finds in quiet moments with Savita, their shared gender freeing them from the politics that mar relationships conducted within \u201cthe purview of men\u201d.</p> <p>Then there is Clelio, another member of Saadiq\u2019s gang, waiting in vain for his older brother to return from France, for someone to guide his life and give it purpose. His importance to the story isn\u2019t revealed until the second half, but all his chapters provide a wonderful textural contrast, their short, punchy sentences strewn with swearwords and broken up by chunks of untranslated Creole.</p> <p>Threaded through the novel is one further strand, nameless and italicised, whose initial mystery descends into chillingly predictable territory with the all-too-ordinary action of a man removing his belt.</p> <p>Together these voices provide a stunning immersion in Troumaron, an impoverished area of Port Louis, and in the surges of teenage lust. But these sensory details are more than a mere backdrop: they are an environment where poverty, combined with tropical heat, seems to produce identities still uncomfortably in flux. \u201cHumidity seeps through the walls,\u201d Eve notes, at the same time that she feels she is \u201cthe one seeping through\u201d.</p> <p>Eve\u2019s sense of dislocation from her own body, not uncommon in adolescence, is heightened and confused by its simultaneously being the only bargaining chip she can offer \u201cthe sovereign man\u201d. Though she stresses that what her biology teacher \u201cdissected\u201d on a bench in their classroom, after the other pupils had all gone home, was \u201ca human body, nothing more, nothing less\u201d, penetration inevitably brings the threat of contamination, even dissolution.</p> <p>But the darkness is not unremitting. Just as Savita\u2019s love offers Eve a way out, so do books for Saadiq. \u201cI&#xa0;read as if books could loosen the noose tightening around my throat. I read to understand that there is somewhere else. A dimension where possibilities shimmer.\u201d It could be a manifesto for reading translated fiction, and this stunning short novel is&#xa0;a&#xa0;perfect&#xa0;starting point.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Eve Out of Her Ruins</em> is published by Les Fugitives/CB Editions.

  "<p>For years, some Peruvians assumed that being short was a trait that was innate to the country\u2019s indigenous people, until a multi-pronged campaign of health checks, a conditional cash transfer scheme and public spending managed to halve childhood stunting in less than a decade. </p> <p>In the seven years between <a href=\"http://blogs.worldbank.org/health/three-factors-halving-childhood-stunting-peru-over-just-decade\">2007 and 2014 stunting among children under five dropped from 29% to 14%</a>, according to Peru\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.inei.gob.pe/\">National Statistics Institute</a>.

Several years later, despite an estimated $200m (\u00a3154m) spent on nutrition programmes every year, the stunting rate had barely budged an inch, says Alessandra Marini, a senior World Bank economist and leader of the Peru Juntos project between 2007 and 2016.</p> <p>\u201cWe had to try and change the understanding of the problem,\u201d Marini told the Guardian. Chronic malnutrition and chronic growth retardation of children was related not just to their diet but to the high prevalence of diarrhoea due to poor sanitation, respiratory infections and poor breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices in the under-twos, she explained. </p> <p>The first thousand days in a child\u2019s life became the focus. The World Bank backed the conditional cash transfer scheme Juntos (Together) which, between 2005 and 2015, more than doubled regular health and growth checkups for children in their first three years, and school attendance for older children, in return for a <a href=\"http://www.younglives.org.uk/content/impact-juntos-conditional-cash-transfer-programme-peru-nutritional-and-cognitive-outcomes\">monthly cash payment of about $30</a> to the female head of the household for beneficiary families. The scheme, which began in 2005, operates in 22 of Peru\u2019s 25 regions in rural areas, where <a href=\"http://www.ruralpovertyportal.org/country/home/tags/peru\">poverty is more than 50%</a>.</p> <p>\u201cJuntos was the engine behind the change. It was critical because it was creating incentives for women,\u201d said Marini. Pregnant and breastfeeding mothers were expected to attend antenatal and postnatal checkups and have a medically assisted delivery. Families with children aged under five had to have regular checkups for growth monitoring, receipt of fortified complementary food and vitamin supplements, vaccinations and deworming. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/sep/16/malnutrition-children-under-five-2015-global-nutrition-report-sustainable-development-goals\">Malnutrition linked to nearly half of deaths among under-fives</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chronic malnutrition among Juntos beneficiaries under five years of age was <a href=\"https://www.inei.gob.pe/media/MenuRecursivo/publicaciones_digitales/Est/Lib1356/index.html\">nearly halved</a> from 47.9% in 2009 to 25.2 in 2015, according to Peru\u2019s statistics institute. </p> <p>But education was also key, explains Marini as \u201cindigenous communities were just convinced that just being indigenous you were expected to be short\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOur work was making sure that everyone understood that between the ages of zero and five every child in the world has the same growth potential,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Ariela Luna, former policy minister for the development and social inclusion ministry, said that combating infant malnutrition counted on \u201cexplicit presidential and governmental support and targeted public spending\u201d which meant using the evidence-based <a href=\"http://www.mef.gob.pe/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2139:programa-articulado-nutricional&amp;catid=211&amp;Itemid=101528\">Articulated Nutrition Programme</a>.</p> <p>The finance ministry, which holds the purse strings for the other ministries in Peru, played a key role in mobilising other stakeholders and prioritising investments in areas of more stunting, said Marini. <br><br>\u201cIt moved to results-based budgeting to ensure that demand and supply efforts worked together to reach nutrition goals,\u201d she added. </p> <p>Nathalye Zu\u00f1iga, a technical coordinator with Juntos, says \u201cnature has given [Peru] a lot\u201d in terms of nutrition, yet the population needed to learn how to combine the variety of foods. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27ea62dfb358d1b407cab7acaf88cae3401942b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27ea62dfb358d1b407cab7acaf88cae3401942b1/0_0_4608_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Juntos beneficiary Juana Mayhua, 47, lives in Peru\u2019s poorest region Huancavelica.

  "<p>The president of the World Bank has warned he will name and shame countries that fail to tackle the malnourishment and poor growth of their children, as part of a mission to rid the world of stunting.</p> <p>Jim Yong Kim, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/11/world-bank-jim-yong-kim\">the former physician who heads the Bank</a>, told the Guardian he would take to the podium at the World Economic Forum in Davos every year to point the finger at governments who failed to live up to promises to tackle a scourge affecting tens of millions of children.</p> <p>Kim said stunting \u2013 which refers to children with a height considerably below the average for their age \u2013 was a humanitarian disaster but also an economic issue that held back nations. Malnutrition, the lack of stimulation and toxic environments take their toll on children\u2019s brain development, modern neuroscience shows. </p> <p>For the sake of their children but also their countries\u2019 future prosperity in a world that increasingly needs an educated workforce with technological skills, governments must take action, said Kim, adding that equality of opportunity was meaningless when children started with such disadvantage. The problem is huge. In India 38.7% of children are stunted, in Pakistan 45% and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo around 43%.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone puts all their eggs in the equality of opportunity basket,\u201d said Kim. \u201cBut we\u2019re essentially lying when 25% of children in the world are stunted. Inequality is baked into the brains of 25% of all children before the age of five. So the only way that we can realistically say there is equality of opportunity is if we bring stunting down to zero.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/stunting-zip/giv-1406DICzmByf3udq/\" data-alt=\"Stunting around the world\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/stunting-zip/giv-1406DICzmByf3udq/\">Stunting around the world</a> </figure>  <p>There were certainly other issues, he added, such as the competence of schools. But there was little point complaining that children in the DRC could not read a single letter after going through three or four years of schooling. \u201cIt might not be because the education\u2019s bad,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a stain on our collective conscience. I think we can start a global movement. My goal is to cut stunting in half. We have 14 years until 2030. We can cut stunting in half in seven years and then end stunting in the world by 2030. That is the only way we can look ourselves in the mirror and say there is equality of opportunity in the world,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>Kim pointed to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/oct/16/nutrition-stunting-development-peru-india\">World Bank-supported programme in Peru</a> as an example of what is possible. It gave conditional cash transfers to the mothers of stunted children, enabling and educating them to give their children nutritious food and stimulation through play. Similar incentives were given to health clinics to support them. If the children did well, monthly payments continued. \u201cIt was the first time we tried this aggressive, what we called a demand-side intervention. They went from 28% in the mid-2000s to 14% in seven years,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to say to every country in the world that has a problem with stunting, we\u2019re ready to bring you the Peru formula. We\u2019re willing to provide financing for these conditional cash transfers. Conditional cash transfers are great anyway. They help poor people. They stimulate the economy, they are a great thing to do. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbf662d58e68fa158f2e4e0ccf31a3a9ff24ed8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbf662d58e68fa158f2e4e0ccf31a3a9ff24ed8f/0_293_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Yong Kim\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jim Yong Kim says equality of opportunity is meaningless when children start with disadvantages as a result of poor growth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Altaf Qadri/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBut you have to start making an effort at reducing stunting. Or else every year I\u2019m going to stand up in front of all the potential investors in your country and say \u2013 you\u2019re not making any progress on stunting. This has very serious implications for the quality of your workforce into the future,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Scientists have found that all children, regardless of race, should grow 25cm in their first year of life and 12cm in the second. </p> <p>Only recently has the impact on the brain been explored. Imaging shows fewer neural connections in the brains of stunted children than in those of children who have grown well. That does not necessarily mean they are damaged for life, but their ability to learn can be impaired.</p> <p>\u201cThis is probably the root of intergenerational poverty,\u201d said Kim. \u201cStunted women who are malnourished become pregnant. Just because they were stunted and malnourished doesn\u2019t mean that their children have to be, but they probably end up not having sufficient nutrition when they are pregnant and they give birth and their children are stunted and it just goes on.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/30/the-country-that-cracked-its-stunting-crisis\">The country that cracked its stunting crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Technological change means that countries will have ever fewer low-skilled jobs in agriculture and manufacturing. \u201cIn that case, the most important infrastructure we can invest in is grey matter infrastructure,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Many people, including the Nobel economic sciences laureate Amartya Sen, have been arguing for years that investing in people is the way to growth. \u201cI think that with the new science of stunting we have now the direct link. If you don\u2019t have light manufacturing and you don\u2019t have low-skilled work in agriculture, you\u2019re left with mostly services. If you are going to compete in the service economy you\u2019re almost certainly going to have to be digitally competent. And you\u2019re almost certainly going to have to be able to learn throughout your lifetime.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m arguing is you need to make first and foremost an investment in your people and specifically you need to make an investment in the grey matter of your children.\u201d</p> <p>Kim believes governments will respond. In 2002, when he was head of the HIV department of the World Health Organisation, he launched a campaign to get 3 million people on antiretroviral treatmentby 2005 and let it be known which countries were lagging behind. Known as 3 by 5, it was controversial, but the initiative resulted in a rapid increase in access to the drugs. There are now 17 million people taking them.</p> <h2>What is stunting?</h2> <p>Childhood stunting is a huge problem worldwide, affecting an estimated 162 million children under five in 2012. These are children whose height is considerably below the average for their age. They are below the 5th centile on the child growth charts of the World Health Organisation \u2013 which means that fewer than 5% of healthy children would be expected to be their size.</p> <p>Undenutrition is the prime cause of stunting. Children can be born to a malnourished mother, so they have not grown properly in the womb, or they can have too little nutrition in the first years of life. Stunting can also be the result of recurrent infections such as diarrhoea in places where sanitation is poor. If children are stunted at the age of two, it is unlikely that their growth will catch up with the norm. They are likely to be small and underweight.</p> <p>Stunted children tend to have poor cognitive development, with underdeveloped brains. Malnourished children also have little energy, resulting in apathy and a lack of curiosity, which means they are unable to learn and are unlikely to be able to escape poverty.</p> <p><em>Producing in-depth, thoughtful, well-reported journalism is difficult and expensive - but supporting us isn\u2019t.

One single mother with an 11-year-old child was temporarily evicted, he says, and has had to take on three jobs to afford the new rent.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who have a good, decent-paying job can\u2019t afford to buy in Vancouver, and they can barely afford to rent,\u201d Jordens says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5363f7216714b1d3300d442a8bcb9251f6f2271d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5363f7216714b1d3300d442a8bcb9251f6f2271d/0_102_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ron Jordens is facing eviction from his rent-controlled apartment block in Mount Pleasant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><a href=\"http://www.metronews.ca/news/vancouver/2016/09/12/tenants-question-bc-rent-laws.html\">Ron Jordens is facing eviction</a> from his rent-controlled apartment block in Mount Pleasant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jennifer Gauthier/Metro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The new tax, he adds, is just \u201cputting a Band-Aid\u201d on the problem, predicting that \u201cthere will be ways around it with side-contracts. It has got to the point where the only solution has to be a \u2018no foreign ownership\u2019 deal on the table.\u201d<br></p> <p>But isn\u2019t Canada a country built on immigration? Jordens points to the thousands of unoccupied flats across the city, built for investors who often never reside there. \u201cIf you are coming to live here, get a job and pay taxes, that\u2019s great. The trouble is they don\u2019t live here, and they don\u2019t pay taxes.\u201d</p> <p>There are an estimated 10,000-plus empty apartments in Vancouver, of which a significant number are owned by foreign investors. In mid-September, 200 protestors from a new campaign group, <a href=\"https://haltvancouver.org/\">HALT</a> \u2013 Housing Action for Local Taxpayers \u2013 took to Vancouver\u2019s streets demanding action to control the market.

Even owners of empty Airbnb flats could be fined $10,000 for failing to comply. Vancouver is fast turning into a test-bed of initiatives to cool outrageous property prices and rents.</p> <p>But over on West Vancouver\u2019s Marine Drive, home to plush waterfront estates (one sold for $50m last year), the city\u2019s biggest realtor to Chinese investors, Clarence Debelle, says the new taxes are \u201cdriven by jealousy and envy\u201d.</p> <p>He says the Vancouver market was slowing in any case, and that the 15% tax on overseas buyers will do nothing to help priced-out 25- to 35-year-olds buying entry-level apartments. But it could, he warns, destroy the local economy. </p> <p>\u201cVirtually everything being built in West Vancouver is being built for a Chinese buyer. Vancouver has no industry apart from tourism and construction. So what do we do? Decide to insult the Chinese. You may not just blight the property market, but bankrupt the construction industry, too.\u201d </p> <p>Debelle predicts stalemate in Vancouver\u2019s market as sellers refuse to drop prices. And he fears for Canada\u2019s global reputation: \u201cIn my view, the Chinese see this as a racist-motivated tax. It\u2019s a dark moment in Canadian political history.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the wrong tax too,\u201d he adds, \u201cas it won\u2019t help the people at the bottom wanting to get into the market. It has not changed the pricing of their homes one bit. There are better ways to help, such as increasing supply.\u201d</p> <p>Debelle\u2019s own father emigrated from Europe after the second world war. \u201cVancouver is now an international destination. You can\u2019t have it both ways: benefit from trade and tourism, <em>and</em> have the tax.\u201d </p> <h2>\u2018The market has been distorted\u2019<br></h2> <p>Vancouver\u2019s experiment is being closely watched in London. According to London Assembly member <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/sianberry\">Sian Berry</a>, who stood as the Green party\u2019s candidate for mayor: \u201cVancouver shows that the very rich buying up luxury flats at the expense of ordinary people is not just a London problem \u2013 it\u2019s a growing problem all over the world. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Vancouver shows that the rich buying up luxury flats at the expense of ordinary people is a growing problem worldwide</p> <footer> <cite>Sian Berry</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cLondon needs more devolution so we can take similar steps,\u201d Berry says, \u201ccontrolling stamp duty and council tax, and closing the loopholes that allow people to buy property through offshore companies \u2013 so that the people who actually live in London can stand a chance.</p> <p> \u201cA huge amount of housing in London is being bought up by offshore companies to avoid paying tax,\u201d she adds. \u201cIn my area in north London, overseas companies bought up \u00a32.5bn of property in just four years and avoided hundreds of millions in stamp duty.\u201d</p> <p>Berry\u2019s concerns are shared not only by the left. The Bow Group, a conservative thinktank, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2015/nov/21/foreign-buyers-british-property\">issued a paper last year</a> in which it talked of a global super-rich elite, some of them criminal, snapping up property in London, pushing up costs for existing residents and throwing the poor to the edges of the city. </p> <p>The report\u2019s author, Daniel Valentine, traces the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/24/the-bubble-that-turned-into-a-tide-how-london-got-hooked-on-gentrification\">phenomenal increase in London house prices</a> to the mid 1990s, when three factors came together: a sudden surge in population, the explosion in buy-to-let lending, and the entry of China and Russia into the global economy, producing a global elite seeking a safe home for their cash.</p> <p>These factors have, he says, corrupted the market, creating an insatiable \u201cinvestment demand\u201d divorced from the underlying needs of British society.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"27041d975afe488d8c15479ab29412945488c4ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27041d975afe488d8c15479ab29412945488c4ff/0_267_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prospective buyers wait to inspect a house for sale in Sydney\u2019s Eastwood suburb.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prospective buyers wait to inspect a house for sale in Sydney\u2019s Eastwood suburb.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the other side of the Pacific to Vancouver, the same arguments are rehearsed in Australia and New Zealand, although not just about the global elite. One <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3752283/Young-Chinese-buyers-dominating-Sydney-property-market.html\">recent report </a>followed a day of family home auctions in Sydney\u2019s northern suburbs; all but one property were said to have been bought by Chinese buyers, with even modest homes fetching A$1.8m (\u00a31.05m). <br></p> <p>Two decades ago, buying a house in a major Australian city cost around five times the income of the average young Australian. Now, after the country\u2019s economic boom, it is about 15 times.</p> <p>Pete Wargent is a leading property buying agent in Sydney and Brisbane. \u201cThe phenomenon of the Chinese buyer has been a huge story here for years now. But you just have to look where Australia is; there are a lot of pathways for Chinese money.\u201d</p> <p>He says the flood of Chinese cash has sparked an <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com.au/strength-or-a-sign-of-weakness-to-come-this-index-of-cranes-across-australian-capital-cities-is-up-20-2016-4\">extraordinary building boom</a>. \u201cThere are more high-rise apartments under construction than ever \u2013 with 150,000 going up across the country.\u201d </p> <p>Given that Australia bans foreign buyers of existing homes, nearly all the Chinese money is pouring into new-build towers. The 4% stamp duty surcharge means a non-resident buyer pays about A$30,000 more than an Australian resident for a A$750,000 apartment in Sydney.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/29/gentrification-global-problem-better-solution-oliver-wainwright\">Gentrification is a global problem. It's time we found a better solution</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s difficult to assess the impact of the surcharge yet, says Wargent, although he notes a gathering panic in some Australian banks, which are now far less keen to lend to non-residents. From 2017 a second new surcharge will hit non-residents: a 0.75% land tax, which has to be paid each year. Some fear that apartments bought off-plan will be dumped back on the market en masse.</p> <p>Will that help to moderate prices for local buyers? \u201cEventually it could help,\u201d says Wargent. \u201cThe problem in Sydney and Melbourne is that the market has been heavily distorted in favour of investors. In Sydney more than half the market is investors, which is a crazy imbalance.\u201d.</p> <p>Critics say that a flood of apartment purchases through domestic pension \u201csuper-funds\u201d is more to blame for the spiralling prices than Chinese buyers. Wargent also throws into the mix \u201clandbanking\u201d by major developers \u2013 drip-feeding sites into the market to ensure prices keep soaring \u2013 plus loose lending criteria from the major banks.</p> <p>\u201cIn truth, it has been tough for first-time buyers for nearly a generation now,\u201d he says. He advocates a broad-based land value tax (LVT) as about the only measure \u201cto cool the sheer demand for housing here\u201d.</p> <p>The bad news for young Australians wanting a foothold on the fabled property ladder is that the latest house price figures are <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-28/sydney-housing-market-fourth-on-global-bubble-index/7883816\">just out</a>.

He emphasised that the \u201cfinancial resources gap\u201d was the biggest challenge to Ethiopia\u2019s quest for growth that reduces poverty, increases social inclusion and promotes environmental sustainability.</p> <p> Mahua Acharya, GGGI\u2019s assistant director general, said that designers of development projects are not speaking the language that institutional investors want to hear. \u201cThe supply of capital is not a problem,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is the moving of that money into a project.\u201d </p> <p>She said financiers find many prospective projects either too risky or not rewarding enough, pointing out that in 2014 only $391bn of the trillions sitting in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development member countries was made available for green finance.</p> <p>In a speech to open the conference, which gathered hundreds of delegates from 50 countries, GGGI\u2019s president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, called for the walls between available finance and unfunded green projects to be knocked down. </p> <p>He said more money for sustainable development has become available from private investors and public donors, as the world has realised that modern economic growth \u2013 in Asia, for example \u2013 has come at a huge cost to the environment and has exacerbated inequality.

  "<h2>The vice-captain</h2> <p>The first thing that happened at the inaugural Ryder Cup in 1927 was the team captains played each other. Back then there was no doubting the importance of the captain, leaders on and off the course. But since 1963, when Arnold Palmer became the last to also wield his clubs, the role has become partly tactical, partly motivational and largely about turning up to press conferences and flirting with sponsors. Perhaps it was because the captains started to feel a little unimportant that the role of vice-captain was invented, because only exceedingly important people have multiple assistants. Over the first couple of days each match will get its own vice-captain, leaving one left over whose job is, in the words of the official website, \u201cto dispense advice and provide assurance to the quartet of players omitted\u201d. He is, essentially, vice\u2011captain of getting the pints in. This is not an actual job.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/30/ryder-cup-2016-five-key-holes-hazeltine-showdown\">Ryder Cup 2016: five key holes at the Hazeltine showdown</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Ambassadors</h2> <p>Another relatively new innovation, since 2012 ambassadors have blossomed like so many azaleas at Augusta National. This year\u2019s roster includes Peter Schmeichel, Kevin Pietersen and Niall Horan from One Direction. The Ryder Cup is the most famous event in golf; while the active involvement of 23-year-old pop stars may open it up to a new demographic \u2013 albeit one whose interest is unlikely to be sustained once the likes of Sam Torrance become involved \u2013 it is hard to see how it can possibly benefit from an association with 52-year-old Danish former goalkeepers. \u201cSeeing guys who fight against each other on a weekly basis being best friends for a week, it\u2019s great to see,\u201d Horan says. \u201cI can understand from being in a band, the brotherhood, the friendship.\u201d Horan\u2019s band are on an extended break amid rumours of fractured relationships, while Horan has declared his need to \u201cgo away, become a mad old recluse, then come back again with a giant beard\u201d, perhaps explaining his willingness to spend time with Darren Clarke.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91632b8d4110f9405face026786dd1d5938d79f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91632b8d4110f9405face026786dd1d5938d79f4/96_26_3599_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Murray, Huey Lewis, Niall Horan and Paul O\u2019Connell: giving it some Ryder Cup\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Murray, Huey Lewis, Niall Horan and Paul O\u2019Connell: giving it some Ryder Cup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ddp USA/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The fashion</h2> <p>Team captains are responsible for choosing the uniforms their team will wear, a tradition that continues despite Ben Crenshaw\u2019s infamously hideous design for the final day of the 1999 Ryder Cup that featured photographs of past victorious USA teams and which Tiger Woods declared he \u201cthrew into the fireplace and burned\u201d because \u201cit was so ugly\u201d. They certainly brought luck to the team, whose stunning if aggressively celebrated comeback from a 10-6 deficit on that last day was surely assisted by their opponents being paralysed by aesthetic horror.</p> <h2>The merchandise</h2> <p>Property prices may have spiralled in recent years but only at the Ryder Cup has the cost of keyrings kept pace with that of the houses for which they assist entry. In 2014 a Ryder Cup keyring, handmade in Scotland, cost \u00a340. For a keyring. This year organisers expect to sell 100,000 hats at the rate of one every 2.4 seconds, and the online shop thus lists 77 varieties. If the organisers\u2019 claim that \u201cless than 5% of what is offered in the store will be sold online\u201d is reflected in hat designs, there will be 1,540 options available for those who actually go to Hazeltine. Also available will be official Ryder Cup hockey sticks, which seems wilfully confusing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d198919aa2e84b66e6ab9753932651415d735b75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d198919aa2e84b66e6ab9753932651415d735b75/96_262_4827_2897/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roll up, roll up.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roll up, roll up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Halleran/PGA of America via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Ryder Cup Trophy Tour</h2> <p>If you\u2019ve missed the Ryder Cup Trophy Tour, it\u2019s probably because it didn\u2019t come anywhere near you. The European leg started in Northern Ireland, took in France, Germany and Italy and then left again, having visited the homelands of precisely two members of the 12-man team. The US leg was a little more extensive but still 80% of states didn\u2019t get a visit. It was, overall, like an Olympic torch relay for people who can\u2019t really be bothered organising an Olympic torch relay.</p> <h2>Hype</h2> <p>The official Ryder Cup website splits its news stories into a variety of categories. Most of them are hard to quibble with: history, behind the scenes, team, corporate partners, but then there\u2019s a section labelled \u201ctrophy and hype\u201d. An event as storied and celebrated as the Ryder Cup surely needs little hyping, though the page at least allowed fans to follow the Trophy Tour as it made its way around a handful of extremely distant locations.</p> <h2>Fish</h2> <p>In 2005 Paul McGinley ended the year ranked the 21st best golfer in the world. Nine years later, as Europe\u2019s team captain, he got to choose the fish for the dressing-room fish tank. This is what modern-day Ryder Cup-taincy entails. \u201cIt was my idea for the fish tank and it worked great,\u201d he crowed. \u201cIt was the colours I was interested in rather than the breed. It was just a little, small touch.\u201d In 2014 the European team played under a blue and yellow flag, wore blue and yellow clothes, and saw only blue and yellow fish. Buoyed by their piscine proponents, they swept to victory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31bb381982a768141706304596eaaec583c5b356\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31bb381982a768141706304596eaaec583c5b356/466_58_1822_1094/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul McGinley was allowed to choose the Europe team\u2019s fish.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul McGinley was allowed to choose the Europe team\u2019s fish.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Teamwork</h2> <p>As Horan points out, the \u201cbrotherhood\u201d forged between teams of sportsmen used to competing only as individuals can be inspiring but this is a difficult path to tread. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/sep/17/rydercup2004.rydercup3\">An excess of team spirit, as at Brookline in 1999</a>, is grating but an absence of it is nearly as bad. Phil Mickelson\u2019s criticism of Tom Watson after USA\u2019s defeat in 2014 was awkward, while the fallout from Nick Faldo\u2019s captaincy of Europe in 2008 was still continuing two years ago when the Englishman declared Sergio Garc\u00eda arrived at Valhalla with a \u201cbad attitude\u201d and proceeded to be \u201cuseless\u201d, prompting Torrance to suggest that if he wanted to find someone with no idea how to work in a team he should \u201clook in the mirror, pal\u201d.</p> <h2>Politics</h2> <p>Great Britain once competed alone in the Ryder Cup but they found life in isolation unforgiving and success hard to achieve. More recently they have discovered working together with the rest of Europe has increased their chances of making an impact on the global stage and that for all the disparate languages of their home continent there is something \u2013 some kind of inherent common outlook on life \u2013 that bonds its people. (This common outlook may well be the one articulated by Paul Casey in 2004, who revealed \u201cwe want to beat them as badly as possible\u201d on the grounds \u201cAmericans can be bloody annoying\u201d.) Of course, there are likely to be British golfers who feel frustrated when some Spaniard comes along and takes their place in the team, but blah blah Brexit yadda yadda.</p> <h2>Fans with funny hats</h2> <p>In 2008 Lee Westwood accused the USA captain, Paul Azinger, of \u201cinciting\u201d the US\u2019s \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201cabusive\u201d fans. There is something about the Ryder Cup that transforms the normally staid golf enthusiast into a screaming, baying fiend. Worse, it brings out their inner fancy-dress enthusiast, and stars-and-stripes onesies and comedy outsized Eiffel Tower-themed headgear duly abound. It is quite possibly the sight of the latter that drives people to the shop in search of more sober alternatives at the rate of one every 2.4 seconds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68170e1eac03e4403e46dd4369545895f7d56524\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68170e1eac03e4403e46dd4369545895f7d56524/0_203_5143_3086/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some fans, yesterday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some fans, yesterday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ddp USA/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>",
  "<p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/birds\" title=\"\">bird</a> is a small, fragile thing. It chirrups, flutters and nests. It definitely does not chair board meetings, run multinational corporations or govern nations. So it\u2019s little surprise that a new survey shows \u201cbird\u201d topping the list of \u201cpet names\u201d that <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=newssearch&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGxMLn0rTPAhUMLcAKHd0XCTAQqQIIICgAMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.liverpoolecho.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fliverpool-news%2Fword-most-women-want-banned-11948753&amp;usg=AFQjCNFOmXX4cwz_GOZpbFortQ6SAIdgvg&amp;sig2=N9m9lIurU0AAOF3m-E2xvQ\" title=\"\">British women would like banned from everyday use</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/19/my-family-is-casually-sexist-but-say-they-are-entitled-to-their-opinions\">My family is casually sexist, but say they are entitled to their \u2018opinions\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The research, commissioned by Kellogg\u2019s Special K, surveyed 2,000 women around the country. Fifty-four per cent said \u201cbird\u201d was a word they\u2019d like to consign for ever to Room 101; 45% would bin \u201cdoll\u201d; 44% would choose \u201cchick\u201d, while 38% loathe \u201cbabe\u201d. They\u2019re all diminutives, you\u2019ll notice. Infantile, in the case of \u201cchick\u201d and \u201cbabe\u201d. In all four cases, incapable of speech or even complex thought. Cute, but ultimately unable to change a light bulb unaided.</p> <p>But \u2013 oh, come on now, love \u2013 what does it really matter? They\u2019re just words, after all \u2013 harmless terms of affection, in fact. The chosen names aren\u2019t even insults or sexist slurs. Who doesn\u2019t love a fluffy chick? Where\u2019s the harm in being compared to one? So stop flapping about it. Don\u2019t brood over it. All this nagging is just henpecking.</p> <p>A single word, you see, can hatch and breed until you have a whole flock of related words, each different but all related. All pecking slowly away at women\u2019s self confidence, shaping the way women are seen in the workplace and having consequences every bit as real as the damage done by sticks and stones.</p> <p><a href=\"https://womenintheworkplace.com/\" title=\"\">Another report</a> came out this week, this time from the global management consultancy firm McKinsey and Co and Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s Lean In organisation. It analysed data from 132 American companies, representing 4.2 million employees. And for every 100 women promoted to managerial positions, it found, 130 men made the same leap up the ladder. Why? In part, because \u201cbirds\u201d aren\u2019t being given the opportunity to show their ability. The report highlighted the fact that women are less likely to be given challenging assignments or to receive the critical feedback we all need in order to get any better at the jobs we do.</p> <p>While 46% of the men surveyed said they had received difficult feedback, only 36% of women had. The most common reason managers gave for holding back this criticism from women was the fear of being hurtful. And who wants to hurt a little fluffy \u201cchick\u201d? That would just be mean.</p> <p>A couple of years ago, in the course of writing a book called <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/100-leading-ladies.html\" title=\"\">100 Leading Ladies</a>, I spoke to 100 of Britain\u2019s most influential women, across all fields and from different walks of life. In an interview with the psychotherapist Susie Orbach, she told me: \u201cI think we have a little difficulty with female public intellectuals in this country because we still attribute gravitas to masculinity.\u201d</p> <p>Stories such as this piled up. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/sep/19/five-things-know-about-style-betty-jackson-designer\" title=\"\">Betty Jackson</a> CBE, one of the UK\u2019s most successful fashion designers, described how: \u201cWhen we first applied for a loan from the bank, the bank manager addressed all his questions to [her husband] David, even though he\u2019s French and could barely speak a word of English at the time. I had to translate between them.\u201d</p> <p>Things have moved on since the 1970s and many of these terms sound peculiarly old-fashioned. But words can still hold women back. As the brilliant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/may/07/women.lords\" title=\"\">Baroness Lola Young</a>, currently an independent crossbench peer, told me: \u201cAmbition is almost a dirty word sometimes, especially when applied to women. It\u2019s meant as a covert insult: \u2018She\u2019s a really ambitious woman.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps surprisingly, McKinsey\u2019s research showed that more women than men ask for a raise at work (29%, compared with 27% of men). In response, 30% of women were told that they were being \u201cbossy\u201d, \u201caggressive\u201d, or \u201cintimidating\u201d, compared with just 23% of men.</p> <p>No surprise, then, that the fifth most hated term singled out by British women is \u201cqueen bee\u201d. Because, in a world where the fond nicknames for women are fluffy and cute, being a boss becomes a mild insult. Words matter. You can kill two birds with one stone. But you dent the ambitions of 3.52 billion of them around the world by showering them with a whole lexicon of little pebbles.</p>",
  "<p>The BBC has confirmed that former Labour culture secretary James Purnell will succeed Helen Boaden as the corporation\u2019s director of radio.</p> <p>Boaden, who earlier this week confirmed that she is set to retire, has worked at the BBC for 34 years.<br></p> <p>Purnell\u2019s new role will see him take charge of radio, education, arts, music, learning and children\u2019s departments, confirming him as one of the leading internal candidates to potentially take over from director general Lord Hall when he stands down in the next two or three years.<br></p> <p>\u201cI grew up loving the BBC, so it\u2019s been a privilege to work here, fighting for a licence fee increase in the 1990s and now working on charter review,\u201d said Purnell. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to have been asked to lead the new division. We\u2019ve got a singular advantage in all our areas: we either have or could get global rights. I want us to use this advantage to think about how we could take on the world for the benefit of our audiences and for Britain.\u201d</p> <p>The former Labour cabinet minister has been widely expected to take over from Boaden and his political background has led Tories including John Whittingdale, the former culture secretary, and Damian Collins, a member of the culture select committee, to argue that his appointment could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/23/michael-grade-defends-bbc-role-james-purnell-tory-labour\">jeopardise the BBC\u2019s impartiality</a>.<br></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve talked a lot about a BBC that\u2019s more digital, more open and more global than ever,\u201d said Hall. \u201cAnd, with the [royal] charter now all but done, I need the right top team in place, with the right responsibilities, to deliver just that. \u201cI want real ambition: a powerhouse for radio - and our education mission around the world. I know we\u2019ve got the people, programmes and ideas to do just that.\u201d</p> <p>Purnell, who is paid \u00a3295,000 a year, joined the BBC as director of strategy in 2013. His promotion to director of radio is seen by some as a reward for his part in negotiating a new favourable royal charter with the government.<br></p> <p>The BBC said that Purnell will stay on the same salary, Boaden is paid \u00a3352,900.</p> <p>The BBC is to look to appoint an experienced radio executive under Purnell to run the operation day-to-day to make up for his lack of hands-on experience.<br></p> <p>Boaden will continue to run radio until Purnell takes on the new division on 31 October. She will then continue to remain responsible for myBBC, the BBC\u2019s major digital project, until leaving the corporation next March.</p> <p> \u201cI love the BBC and it has been the privilege of my life to serve our audiences for 34 years,\u201d said Boaden. \u201cBut now is the right time to leave. With a new charter to implement, Tony Hall needs a top team committed to the long haul. By contrast, I am keen to embrace a different life and put my energy, skills and experience into other things I care about.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>A South Australian power price shock in July and a state-wide blackout in September provided fertile ground for those who live by the motto: never waste a good crisis. It would be a very poor outcome if in the aftermath of these events we lost focus on the biggest challenge facing the energy system in the pursuit of short-term political gains.</p> <p>There are illegitimate and legitimate roles that can be attributed to wind generation in the recent South Australian drama. The power of the wind certainly wreaked havoc on the state\u2019s transmission towers as evidenced by graphic footage of bent and broken transmission towers. </p> <p>Yet all the evidence available indicates that wind power generation did not contribute to either the initial system failures or the subsequent state-wide blackout. Wind generation was on line prior to Wednesday\u2019s storm and was part of the mix as the system returned.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/30/ignorant-rubbish-daniel-andrews-slams-malcolm-turnbull-over-sa-blackout-comments\">\u2018Ignorant rubbish\u2019: Daniel Andrews slams Malcolm Turnbull over SA blackout comments</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At 7.30pm on 7 July, the state\u2019s wind generators were virtually idle. The last coal plant had shut in May, the sun was down and there were constraints on backup due to the unavailability of the interconnector with Victoria. Gas generation set the electricity price and it was high. The market delivered, the lights stayed on and prices had reduced close to prior months\u2019 levels by August. Yet, this event did expose potential threats to the price and reliability of power that need to be considered and have been raised by Josh Frydenberg, the federal Minister for the Environment and Energy.<br></p> <p>To put all this in perspective requires a return to the underlying issue: the need to address climate change. Australia has committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26%-28% below 2005 levels by 2030. It is the absence of a credible, national climate change policy to reduce power sector emissions in line with this target that creates unmanageable investor uncertainty and drives state and territory governments to adopt their own policies, misguided as they might be.</p> <p>The policy priority for the commonwealth government is to use its planned 2017 review to build on its Direct Action policy to deliver a credible and predictable plan that can meet the existing target and can be scaled up to meet future, more stringent, targets that almost certainly will emerge. The Climate Change Authority and a recent Grattan Institute report, <a href=\"https://grattan.edu.au/report/climate-phoenix-a-sustainable-australian-climate-policy/\">Climate Phoenix: a sustainable Australian climate policy</a><em>, </em>showed that this could be done.</p> <p>With such a policy in place, attention can turn to two key issues. The first is to review the national electricity market to see if and how it might need to be complemented with commercial or regulatory changes to respond to the specific challenges of integrating high levels of intermittent generation sources such as wind and solar power. There will be solutions, but a conscious focus is needed to ensure they can and do emerge. This is also where the prime minister\u2019s concern about renewable energy and system security should be addressed.</p> <p>The second issue is the role of renewable energy targets adopted by federal, state or territory governments.</p> <p>In 2001, the Howard government introduced a national mandatory renewable energy target (RET). Through a period of Labor governments and re-elected Coalition governments, the target has been expanded and contracted, almost to exhaustion. A key outcome has been the deployment of wind power in South Australia to the extent that 40% of that state\u2019s electricity now comes from wind. This was due to favourable wind conditions, proximity to transmission lines and effective approval processes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/29/is-this-a-new-low-politicians-using-a-natural-disaster-to-push-a-fact-free-agenda\">Is this a new low: politicians using a natural disaster to push a fact-free agenda? | Matt Grudnoff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The South Australian government does have a target of 50% renewable energy by 2025, subject to national renewable energy policy being retained. So far, this target has taken a back seat to the national target. </p> <p>Last Sunday, a Grattan Institute report, <a href=\"https://grattan.edu.au/report/keeping-the-lights-on-lessons-from-south-australias-power-shock/\">Keeping the lights on: lessons from South Australia\u2019s power shock</a><em>, </em>concluded that policies such as the RET had been introduced with inadequate consideration of the consequences for the electricity market. This concern relates as much to the federal target as it does to state or territory renewable energy policies.</p> <p>The report raised specific concerns in regard to a proliferation of uncoordinated state and territory policies that could lead to perverse outcomes when designed without consideration of national policies or market impacts. These could include subsidising specific technologies in specific states when a lower cost outcome with the same environment outcome could be achieved through a national, coordinated approach.</p> <p>Primary responsibility for sorting out this mess sits with the federal government. The right national climate change policy would negate any justification for renewable energy targets at any level. It should get on with the job.</p> <p><em>Tony Wood is the director of the energy program at the Grattan Institute. </em></p>",
  "<p>Today is <a href=\"https://www.freewordcentre.com/whats-on/international-translation-day-2016\">International Translation Day</a>. Look at any bookshop bestseller shelf in the UK and you\u2019ll see translated names everywhere: Elena Ferrante, Karl Ove Knausgaard, Haruki Murakami, Swedish names all over crime fiction. Recent sales figures seem to suggest that the British public has steadily become more open to European and international authors: according to Nielsen, which undertook research for the International Man Booker prize this year, the number of translated books bought in Britain increased by an astounding 96% between 2001 and 2015. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/09/translated-fiction-sells-better-uk-english-fiction-elena-ferrante-haruki-murakami\">Translated fiction sells better</a>, overall, than English literary fiction and made up 7% of all UK fiction sales in 2015.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/09/translated-fiction-sells-better-uk-english-fiction-elena-ferrante-haruki-murakami\">Translated fiction sells better in the UK than English fiction, research finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But when you examine what is translated into English, only 1.5% of all books published in the UK are translations. Compare that to Germany (a bigger book market than the UK), France or Italy, where translated fiction is 12.28%, 15.9% and 19.7% of the respective markets, <a href=\"http://www.lit-across-frontiers.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Translation-Statistics-Study_Update_May2015.pdf\">according to a 2015 study by Literature Across Frontiers</a>.</p> <p>Its author, <a href=\"http://www.lit-across-frontiers.org/about/\">Alexandra B\u00fcchler</a> argues that the UK sale figures are pulled up by bestsellers. \u201cI don\u2019t think we are getting the picture of piles of translated books not selling, because booksellers are really picky about who ends up on the shelves,\u201d she says. \u201cThe independent booksellers who were happier to get translated books are disappearing.\u201d Bestsellers are the exception, she says, and beyond those lucky few, the plight of translated fiction remains pretty grim.</p> <p>But Daniela Petracco, from Elena Ferrante\u2019s UK publisher <a href=\"http://www.europaeditions.com/\">Europa Editions</a>, says that Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan series has actually helped their other authors\u2019 sales, because the sheer popularity of the Italian novelist \u201cmade reading translations more familiar to a wider British audience\u201d. However, Petracco adds, she is still dreaming about \u201ctranslation-blind readers\u201d and \u201cbookshops that don\u2019t ghettoise translated fiction in the back room\u201d.</p> <p>Where does this bias come from? With Brexit in mind, some point to an insular mindset, mixed with an imperialist complex. \u201cOur alienation from Europe is partly to do with the fact that we don\u2019t read much European literature,\u201d says Susan Curtis-Kojakovic from <a href=\"http://istrosbooks.com/\">Istros Books</a>, a publishing house specialising in south and east European authors. \u201cWe read so much about America. And to me, Wisconsin is not any more interesting than Bucharest. And in fact Bucharest is to me nearer to my culture.\u201d</p> <p>James Tennant from <a href=\"http://www.pen-international.org/\">PEN International</a> blames lack of translations on \u201cthe deep-seated protectionism of an island people and a certain complacency coming from the fact that our language happens to be, for the time being, the global lingua franca\u201d. Curti-Kojakovic further explains: \u201cWe have so much literature in English \u2013 from India, South Africa and so on \u2013 that we have the false impression that we have the world in English.\u201d</p> <p>Being published in English does indeed increase an author\u2019s chances of an international career. But Tennant warns: \u201cToo often in former British colonies, local-language writing and storytelling are being neglected due to pressure or desire to conform to the globalised publishing market, working in English.\u201d </p> <p>This also means that British publishers can work without speaking or reading other languages, which makes them unable to source foreign books. Anna Webber, at United Agents, says: \u201cThere are very few people [in publishing] who speak languages other than English, so they have to rely on readers\u2019 reports. That\u2019s why unless something is surefire hit internationally, where you have a lot of publicity and success in other countries, people are very cautious. Understandably - I wouldn\u2019t take a book myself if I couldn\u2019t read it. But the problem is that not many publishers speak foreign languages \u2026 This is why I have to stick to representing a low number of foreign authors \u2013 about 10% of all the writers I work with.\u201d </p> <p>Some publishers used to blame costs \u2013 the minimum UK rate recommended by PEN and the Society of Authors for translation is <a href=\"http://www.societyofauthors.org/Advice/Rates-Fees#translation\">\u00a390 per 1,000 words</a>, and in addition to that, if an author doesn\u2019t speak English, an interpreter will need to be paid for public appearances. But Tennant says that today, \u201cso many foundations, cultural ministries or institutes offer support that it\u2019s not a problem that\u2019s insurmountable\u201d. However, it is wealthier countries that are often the ones with budgets for translation funds, which means that those languages gain a cost advantage to languages from poorer countries. </p> <p>Webber outlines further problems with how subsidy schemes work: \u201cThe funding body wants a proof of purchase and the publisher is unable or unwilling to buy the book unless there is a guarantee for the funding. So it\u2019s like the cat that bites its own tail.\u201d She believes that more grants to support sample translations would be a helpful step.</p> <p>But it all starts from school, according to Ann Morgan, who is reading 196 books \u2013 one from every country in the world \u2013 for her blog <a href=\"https://ayearofreadingtheworld.com/\">A Year of Reading Around the World</a>. Morgan says that \u201cat school in the UK we don\u2019t really read translations, we just don\u2019t develop that habit\u201d; unlike French or German students, schoolchildren below A-level in the UK \u2013 with the exception of International Baccalaureate students \u2013 are only asked to read literature originally written in English.</p> <p>So how do we break this chain? The International Man Booker prize has pointed to one way forward by awarding half of its \u00a350,000 prize to the translator for the first time this year. Schools, bookshops, cultural institutions and publishers should follow. But we can all make a conscious decision to read more translated books. Because the way things stand, the UK is not just missing out on great books, but further isolating itself from the rest of the world.<br></p>",
  "<p>Birds don\u2019t stop still very often. Nests are their only clutter and the necessity to incubate eggs their only anchor; both are temporary ties to the fabric of the planet. Before camera technology could itself move fast enough to capture the speed of life, its early users sought fixed things to snap. So it was that in Boreham Wood on 10 April 1892, the brothers Richard and Cherry Kearton took the first ever photograph of a bird\u2019s nest in use. Richard found a song thrush\u2019s nest with a clutch of four eggs. \u201cI called out to Cherry,\u201d he wrote afterwards, \u201ccome and let us see what sort of a fist you can make of this bird\u2019s nest with your old sun-picture apparatus.\u201d</p> <p>The brothers realised they were on to something.

A stream of similar volumes followed across more than 30 years; Bevis lists 42. To this day almost every secondhand bookshop in Britain will have one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2016/jul/14/the-keartons-inventing-nature-photography-in-pictures\">The Keartons: inventing nature photography \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first professional nature photographers became famous, and to feed their fame they had to keep showing more and more of what they had captured and how they captured it. To secure their pictures, which meant getting cumbersome, static gear close to moving, nervous nature, Richard Kearton invented<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/nov/04/garden-birds-feeding\"> the portable hide</a>. As well as clinching the shots, by stealing up on birds and watching them for days on end, the brothers saw things that no one had noticed before. The lower mandible of the wryneck, Richard proved, was longer than the upper \u2013 you can tell by looking at the picture that they took of one of these weird snaky woodpeckers bringing food to its chicks in a hole in a tree.</p> <p>For the 16 years of their partnership Richard Kearton (born 1862) wrote most of the words and Cherry (born 1871) took most of the pictures. Cherry was more technically active and he diversified too, making the first field recording of wild birds singing (a nightingale and a song thrush in Kenley in 1900); filming London from the air and big game in East Africa for the first time (1908 and 1909); and capturing cinema sequences of the beginnings of the first world war in Belgium.</p> <p>But it is the Keartons\u2019 early bird photographs that remain their most original and which are still of most interest. Bevis\u2019s excellent book, informative and intelligent, beguiled and questioning, hinges on them. He is most interested in the evidence offered by the Keartons\u2019 work of how distortion, even fakery, is inevitable in any account of the natural world made by man. His subtitle has a double meaning: \u201cinventing nature photography\u201d might involve gardening a nightingale\u2019s nest to make it more photogenic; tethering a supposed wild lion in order to photograph it being attacked by Masai hunters; changing the sequence of pictures to tell the story as it ought to be told and not as it actually unfolded. Ever since the Keartons there has been reel nature (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/apr/14/3\">Gregg Mitman</a>\u2019s term) as well as real nature.</p> <p>Two tremendous photographs by the brothers, reproduced by Bevis, capture their own story and their achievements. The first features a sturdy cow, brown-looking (everything, of course, is black-and-white in Kearton-land), standing in the hedged corner of a grassy field. So far, so bucolic. But its caption tells us that the photograph is actually of a stuffed ox. In 1900, Richard got the taxidermist Rowland Ward to hollow out a cow and reinforce its legs, leaving its gut space unstuffed, making room enough (just about) for a crouching brother and his hidden camera. A hole was cut in a hairy flank for a lens to peep through. A skylark was the first target, and it fell for the ox. Thus began the parallel storytelling, how we tricked nature and got the picture, that runs alongside, sometimes even outstripping, the story itself, and which has continued down to the 10-minute extra \u201cwill they get the shot?\u201d segments that are near mandatory these days at the end of big natural history TV productions.</p> <p>The Keartons knew that the story of getting the story was as saleable as any exquisite composition of a black-throated diver on its nest on a small island in a Hebridean loch (the picture that Richard said he prized most). The dummy ox was strong enough to sit on and light enough to carry by hand. The Keartons took pictures of this and of hides made from hollow sheep and concealing cartloads of hay. They also photographed themselves, like precocious performance artists or a bizarre open-air acrobatic act, both standing high in a bare winter tree where, amazingly, one brother holds a ladder on a thin branch so that the other might climb with the camera towards a twiggy nest. In east Africa, Cherry thought of hollowing out a zebra, until local hunters reminded him that they might shoot at such a frozen target or a lion pull it down into its hot mouth.</p> <p>The second notable photograph was actually two exposures printed alongside one another. Again the caption is telling, but here for its poetic choice of words. The picture is two square plates taken from above a host of daisies, the common or garden lawn-type of daisies, more than a thousand in each shot. The caption reads \u201cDaisies Asleep (photographed before sunrise); Daisies Awake (after sunrise)\u201d. The photographs are both ordinarily and extraordinarily beautiful, and their effect is enhanced by the dreamy words. We understand them to be photographs of time. And they illustrate what the sun-picture apparatus has released into our imaginations since the Keartons\u2019 era \u2013 more than a century of time-travel and light-capture.</p> <p>The daisy gets its name from the \u201cday\u2019s eye\u201d and the Keartons worked their apertures under the same eye in the sky. They gathered the truth (all those birds\u2019 nests) but they also gardened it as they did so. Another pair of photographs from the brothers\u2019 behind-the-scenes series features a further hide (it allowed the Keartons to see the truth about the wryneck\u2019s beak). They are captioned \u201cArtificial tree-trunk open\u201d and \u201cArtificial tree-trunk closed\u201d. Over and between these images of tree-trunks and daisies, the hidden and the seen, the innocent and the watchful, plays the history of nature photography and much more besides.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Keartons: Inventing Nature Photography</em> is published by Uniformbooks.

  "<p>Gentrification is a word on many lips. Property values, rent rises, people displacement, speculative development, offshore investment; coffee shops, beards, bikes and vanishing nightlife. In the world\u2019s big cities, gentrification and its discontents have become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre.</p> <p>But as that range of complex ideas suggests, gentrification is also a notoriously slippery concept. Is it a purely economic process, or is it culturally driven? Is every deprived neighbourhood that experiences an influx of wealthy residents an instance of gentrification? Must the change occur organically, or can governments gentrify areas according to a plan? </p> <p>In the half-century since Ruth Glass first employed the term \u2013 to describe the return of the London middle classes to Victorian properties previously subdivided into slums \u2013 sociologists, geographers, economists and anthropologists have all struggled to agree on a coherent and transferable definition of the politically loaded G-word.</p> <p> In recent years, however, increasing amounts of data and the ability to overlay divergent phenomena has led to studies that try to make sense of what is sometimes described as a \u201cphantom concept\u201d. By understanding and measuring the process, some believe it may be possible to alleviate the most damaging effects of gentrification: the impoverishment and displacement that frequently accompany it.</p> <p>The most fundamental evidence for gentrification comes from the cost of property. Rapid increases in the cost of buying or renting a house, above rises in income, are clear signs of a rapid change in the urban character of a neighbourhood. </p> <p>Last year, NYU\u2019s Furman Center prepared <a href=\"http://furmancenter.org/news/press-release/report-analyzes-new-york-citys-gentrifying-neighborhoods-finds-dramatic-dem\">a report on New York City</a>, source of much of the rhetoric around gentrification, that charted changes in rental value from 1990-2010.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9d9da88cf611ec9b023d4f867f143ea182b7d4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9d9da88cf611ec9b023d4f867f143ea182b7d4c/0_0_1926_1038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Activists in the Brooklyn neighbourhoods of Bushwick created an interactive mapping resource to track gentrification.

Graphic by <a href=\"https://bushwickcommunitymap.org/\">Bushwick Community Map project</a></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: North West Bushwick Community Map</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While rents increased generally over this 20-year period, various neighbourhoods, such as the infamous Williamsburg \u2013 spiritual home of the hipster \u2013 saw increases as much as 50% higher than those of the city as a whole. These changes corresponded to generally perceived changes in demographics and social class.</p> <p>The Voorhees Center at the University of Illinois called its study of Chicago over 40 years a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.voorheescenter.com/gentrification-index\">gentrification index</a>\u201d. Taking information from the US Census from 1970 to 2010, it attempted to measure the local changes in a wider set of variables \u2013 such as education, poverty, private school attendance or family income \u2013 against the city average. The goal, again, was to understand which neighbourhoods could be said to have gentrified.</p> <p>The results, too, tallied with anecdotal evidence. Chicago\u2019s central lakeside areas, which had seen postwar decline with American suburbanisation, have become highly desirable again; they have significantly gentrified. But the data also shows that these upwardly mobile neighbourhoods are surrounded by many suburbs that have declined severely over the same time.</p> <p>While census data is rich and comprehensive, there are concerns that the relatively sporadic collection of information just doesn\u2019t have the fine resolution required to identify gentrification in some of its wilder forms, where neighbourhoods are transformed within a matter of years. If the phenomenon is to be spotted in time to help those who suffer from it, we need to be better at predicting it.</p> <p>In these cases, the challenge is to identify the preconditions for gentrification. The classic analysis is to find the \u201crent gap\u201d, as developed by geographer Neil Smith: a period of decline in which the <em tabindex=\"-1\">potential</em> value of land and property in an area is much higher than what is currently being charged. This is a necessary condition for gentrification, but can be a blunt measurement, and applies to many areas that are nowhere near actually gentrifying.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c5163abbbf13cd07aa9f8ce07d33311f392bfacf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5163abbbf13cd07aa9f8ce07d33311f392bfacf/0_0_2193_1120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The gentrification map of Los Angeles.

A recent study of Boston identified a number of factors, including proximity to public transport and locations of subsidised housing projects, to create a <a href=\"https://sites.tufts.edu/gis/files/2016/01/Migliorato_Hana_UEP232_2016.pdf\">gentrification vulnerability index</a>. Similarly, researchers from Berkeley and UCLA working on the <a href=\"http://www.urbandisplacement.org/research\">Urban Displacement Project</a> take into account a huge variety of data, including transport connections, education levels, population density, types and tenure of housing, all to create interactive maps of LA and the San Francisco Bay Area that give easily digestible information on changed neighbourhoods \u2013 and the possibilities of change in the future.</p> <p>Dynamically overlaying statistical information on to maps is becoming popular, too. Partly, this is due to the increasing availability of data. But it\u2019s also due to the strength of its communicative power. For example, the recent deprivation maps of <a href=\"http://dclgapps.communities.gov.uk/imd/idmap.html\">England</a> and <a href=\"http://simd.scot/2016/#/simd2016/BTTTFTT/9/-3.8809/55.9815/\">Scotland</a><em>, </em>or work by the <a href=\"https://alasdair.carto.com/viz/dfeec58e-44dd-11e6-ae1a-0e3ebc282e83/embed_map\">Joseph Rowntree Foundation</a>,<em> </em>starkly mark out the proximity of rich and poor in our cities.</p> <p>Some studies aim to be tools for residents to stay one step ahead. Activists in Bushwick, one of Brooklyn\u2019s rapidly changing neighbourhoods, have created <a href=\"https://bushwickcommunitymap.org/\">an interactive mapping resource</a> that looks to track \u201cthe urban vices of gentrification and displacement\u201d. Here, the graphic display of data is deliberately aimed at activists and community members who stand to lose the most.</p> <p> Data graphics can even be a polemic. When the Heygate, a 1970s council estate in London, was controversially demolished to make way for new and mostly private developments, the campaign group Heygate Was Home used freedom of information requests to graphically map out the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1X2g5-A1ehIjEcQ7iAXs9lHpXd-U\">displacement</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1-_p4rJQDsMx3C6We2nB0Ft_7jSM&amp;hl=en_US\">original residents</a> \u2013 not just out of central London but across the country. This \u201cdecanting\u201d map has become a famous symbol of the pain of gentrification.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"237516d9149a86f504a0fc8ef7ad8994db6768c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/237516d9149a86f504a0fc8ef7ad8994db6768c5/0_0_1581_1036/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mapping gentrification in Nottingham.

For example, the particular character of American inequality means that race is frequently considered to be a major factor. The late 20th century saw the white middle classes largely abandoning the inner cities, and an increase of white residents is now taken to be a sure sign of gentrification. But this metric can\u2019t apply in less politically segregated contexts.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, the evidence of whether victims of gentrification are primarily displaced or simply <a href=\"http://www.trustforlondon.org.uk/news-and-events/news-and-comments/blog-despite-cuts-to-housing-benefit-claimants-are-remaining-in-london/\">further impoverished</a> is mixed. And data on various social factors \u2013 such as access to public education \u2013 is only relevant if it applies to the local political context. These ambiguities encourage the creation of alternative strategies for mapping gentrification, utilising disparate data, or even public sentiment itself: the \u201cI know it when I see it\u201d factor. </p> <p>For example, a Dutch communications firm has conducted <a href=\"http://popupcity.net/help-us-map-gentrification-in-toronto/\">crowdsourced research</a> on Amsterdam, Brooklyn and Toronto, asking where people believed gentrification was occurring, without recourse to data. The public were asked to draw \u201cfront lines\u201d of gentrification on the map, as if the process were a battle between old and new. This may be methodologically flimsy, but it does highlight the fact that perceptions of various areas are part of what makes up our understanding of gentrification. </p> <p>One infamous metric is the coffee shop. Academics have looked at correlations between the <a href=\"http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/The-312/July-2012/Coffee-Crime-and-Chicago/\">prevalence of coffee shops</a> against deprivation and crime, noting that more coffee shops coincided with less crime \u2013 highly suggestive of gentrification. This concept can surface in unpleasant ways, such as one study in London that mapped the presence of coffee shops against fried chicken shops, looking for cheap areas that showed signs of being <a href=\"https://medium.com/@Sam_Floy/how-to-know-if-where-you-live-is-up-and-coming-fried-chicken-vs-coffee-shops-546080119f98#.u0qktdsl3\">\u201c\u2018legitimately\u2019 up and coming\u201d.</a></p> <p>Other innovations came from Cambridge academics, who compared data on deprivation against the <a href=\"http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/predicting-gentrification-through-social-networking-data\">use of social media</a>. Here, the signs of impending gentrification are taken to be social deprivation in combination with a high degree of social diversity \u2013 as exemplified by the top scoring of Hackney, one of the areas of London with most rapidly increasing house prices and demographic shifts. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/29/gentrification-global-problem-better-solution-oliver-wainwright\">Gentrification is a global problem. It's time we found a better solution</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even more clever is a study of Chicago that included images from Google Street View to exclude non-gentrifying forms of value-increase. The rationale was that <a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2014/07/09/google-street-view-shows-that-gentrification-in-chicago-has-largely-bypassed-poor-minority-neighborhoods-reinforcing-urban-inequality/\">\u201cthe visible streetscape of neighbourhoods provides direct indicators of change\u201d</a>: in other words, examining visual evidence allows us to better judge precisely what kind of urban change is occurring in each area.</p> <p>Taken together, what the wide variety of research shows is that a single, universal measurement of gentrification is probably impossible, with all the fraught political and cultural considerations at work. </p> <p>Nonetheless, what all studies take as their basis is the affordability of, and access, to housing. The fundamental force of gentrification is a rapid upward change in these costs. Across the world, the <a href=\"http://content.knightfrank.com/research/1026/documents/en/q4-2015-3653.pdf\">highest rises in residential property</a> value are dominated by US, European and Australasian cities. San Francisco and London both near the top, with annual rises of more than 10%.</p> <p>Even so, it\u2019s not enough: while Shenzhen has seen a staggering rise in housing costs (nearly 50%), it would be hard to say that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/10/china-pearl-river-delta-then-and-now-photographs\">this brand-new megacity</a> was gentrifying; whereas its neighbour Hong Kong, whose housing supply is extremely limited, is currently experiencing a serious struggle.</p> <p>Istanbul, with a rise last year of 25%, is one of the starkest examples. In 2013, the proposed redevelopment of a public space into a shopping mall sparked the Gezi Park protests \u2013 and a campaign familiar to anti-gentrification activists worldwide took on a whole new dimension, demonstrating just how embedded the issue is with all other political struggles. Above all, it\u2019s this fact \u2013 that gentrification so often opens the floodgates to more cataclysmic urban change \u2013 that shows just how important it is that it can be identified and measured.<br></p> <p><em>Are you experiencing or resisting gentrification in your city?

While 90% of families with children aged under five had used their local park at least once in the past month, the study said, 92% of park managers had had their budgets cut and 95% were facing further reductions. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The cuts have raised concerns that parks could become hubs for crime and antisocial behaviour, or be sold off to developers or private companies.</p> <p>There has been public outrage when councils have sold off sections of the parks under their control, such as an <a href=\"http://www.hamhigh.co.uk/news/anger_as_go_ape_course_is_approved_for_alexandra_palace_1_4460565\">approval this year for part of Alexandra Park</a> in north London to be sold to the outdoor adventure company Go Ape. </p> <p>Dave Morris, the chair of the National Federation of Parks and Green Spaces, said: \u201cThe only way to halt the ever-deepening funding crisis affecting all parks across the UK is to make it a statutory service.\u201d<br></p> <p>He added: \u201cParks take a long time to fall apart. It\u2019s not immediately noticeable, like a library closing, but all the pillars of effective park management and maintenance are crumbling. If not reversed, parks will be plunged into the disaster crisis of the 1980s and 1990s when they became no-go areas full of syringes and no park rangers.\u201d<br></p> <p>The government inquiry is looking into how people use their parks, and what could be done to protect them. It will consider whether to recommend a change to the administrative status of national parks that will make the provision and maintenance of outdoor spaces a statutory duty.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cAll too often, the things that are really important to our day-to-day lives are ignored by politicians. But when we come together, we show we can get important issues, like our parks, on the political agenda,\u201d said Megan Bentall, a 38 Degrees campaigner.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cIn just two weeks, hundreds of thousands of 38 Degrees members have joined the campaign to protect our parks from neglect. Together we\u2019re calling on the committee to recommend our parks are legally protected. It\u2019s people-powered campaigning that is putting our lovely parks in the spotlight \u2013 to protect them for generations to come.\u201d<br></p> <p>Of the 115,000 38 Degrees members who completed the survey, 84,000 said they used parks at least once a week, with 97% saying they felt positive about the green spaces they used.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

At the same time, as more and more Londoners struggle to get on the property ladder, there are real concerns about the prospect of a surge in the number of homes being bought by overseas investors.\u201d</p> <p>One key aim of the research will be shining a light on who is investing and where the money originates from.</p> <p>Khan said: \u201cWe urgently need <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/02/sadiq-khan-make-london-property-ownership-transparent\">more transparency around overseas money</a> invested in London property. Londoners need reassuring that dirty money isn\u2019t flooding into our property market, and ministers must now make all property ownership in London transparent so we can see exactly who owns what.\u201d<br></p> <p>But some housing market commentators warn it would be a mistake to focus only on foreign investment when tackling London\u2019s housing crisis. Yolande Barnes, director of <a href=\"http://www.savills.co.uk/research/world.aspx\">Savills\u2019 world research department</a>, said <a href=\"http://www.savills.co.uk/_news/article/55328/177606-0/7/2014/london-s-overseas-buyers-have-been-overstated--says-savills\">foreign buyers accounted for only 7% of property purchased across Greater London</a>, although that figure is likely to be higher in inner-London hotspots. And she said that investment had helped bring forward nearly all the \u201caffordable homes\u201d built in London since the 2008 financial downturn.</p> <p>\u201cForeign buyers are often the focus in discussions about the housing crisis, but really they are only one element in an incredibly complicated picture. Without them investing in properties at the top end, we would not have been able to fund very much social or affordable housing since the financial crash.\u201d<br></p> <p>Barnes said the real issue was the price and scarcity of land available for development in the capital.</p> <p>\u201cLike any major world city, the issue in London centres around the fact that there is not enough of the most popular bits of the city to go around. Inner London land rarely comes on to the market, and it only makes sense for people to release land and turn it into residential units if they are going to get a suitable return \u2013 which normally means high-end luxury developments.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/29/gentrification-global-problem-better-solution-oliver-wainwright\">Gentrification is a global problem.

And because of the brave and historic decision of the British people to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">leave the European Union</a>, I believe the UK is in a prime position to become a world leader in free trade.</p> <p>Globalisation represents an acceleration of the trend in which the world has become increasingly compressed, economically, culturally and politically. However, it is becoming increasingly misunderstood and its benefits not championed vigorously enough. While the increased economic activity that globalisation has generated has been broadly welcomed by business, politicians have often worried about how the dissolving concepts of sovereignty will affect their ability to influence events, and many have worried about the effects on the world\u2019s most vulnerable people.</p> <p>There is no doubt that our increased interdependence can make us more vulnerable to external shocks, with less ability to isolate ourselves from instability in different parts of the global economy. This should not, however, obscure the tremendous benefits that can be brought to those across the globe by a free and fair global trading environment.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/10/01/if-youre-anti-poverty-you-should-be-pro-free-trade-and-globalisation/#7497ed9b6c4c\">According to the World Bank</a>, in the three decades between 1981 and 2010, we witnessed the single greatest decrease in material human deprivation in history. At a time when the population of the developing world has increased by almost 60%, the number of those in extreme poverty (subsisting on less than $1.25 per day) has dropped from around 50% to around 20%.</p> <p>While this number remains much too high and global poverty is, <a href=\"http://www.makepovertyhistory.org/extras/mandela.shtml\">as Nelson Mandela commented in 2005, an act of man and not an act of nature</a>, we should not be in denial about the potential benefits of globalisation. We should rather try to change the elements within it so that we can produce the biggest positive changes. We must also beware of conflating the drive to eliminate absolute poverty with arguments about relative poverty in already developed nations.</p> <p>I have always believed that free trade is one of the most powerful tools we have to help those in the greatest need around the world, and that a policy of aid that is combined with punitive tariffs on goods from developing countries is counter-productive at best and downright hypocritical at worst. And as we establish our independent position post-Brexit, we will carry the standard of free and open trade as a badge of honour.<strong> </strong>Yet free trade by itself will not be enough to be the empowering and liberating tool that many of us want to see.</p> <p>Research tends to suggest that while trade does indeed reduce poverty, it can only do so effectively with a number of pre-existing conditions. These are: high levels of education, developed financial sectors, and, hugely importantly, good governance and minimal corruption. In a classical Adam Smith analysis, these factors would enable an economy to reallocate resources effectively. The good news is that there are many more developing countries that satisfy the tests.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/27/globalisation-is-about-taxes-too\">Globalisation isn't just about profits.

The problem, however, is that while many countries have sufficiently deep financial sectors and sufficiently improved educational systems, many of the institutions and the level of governance still fall below what is required for the poor to benefit fully.</p> <p>It is not therefore the concept of globalisation, nor the liberalisation of free trade, that should be the target of those who rightly want to see the elimination of the scourge of global poverty but the aims of eliminating corruption and improving governance in many of these developing countries.</p> <p>Continued focus on good governance, mediated and encouraged by international aid and assistance programmes, combined with increasing attempts to see a more open and liberal trading environment, are our best hope to see grotesque levels of poverty consigned to history.</p>",

About 40 minutes later, mission control will receive the last close-up photograph of 67P. Then radio silence will mark the end of Rosetta\u2019s 12-and-a-half year voyage through space.</p> <p>Mission controllers will never be certain of the probe\u2019s fate, but are aiming for a gentle landing that will leave it resting on the surface. \u201cWe could have abandoned it in space or let it bounce off the comet and just switched it off.

To be clear, I\u2019m not a bubble dweller. I find the hothouse conditions stifling. I don\u2019t require the prime minister to agree with me on any particular policy proposition. I harbour a modest hope that, periodically at least, he will agree with himself.</p> <p>I understand there is a more complex dynamic in play presently than a weakened prime minister performing a grim liturgical dance for the gratification of people with the power to move against him. At the broader strategic level, there is clearly an element of circling the wagons going on. Turnbull is trying to keep his fractious troops together when in practice the Coalition in 2016 is a conservative party with Hansonesque leanings and a centrist liberal party.</p> <p>Most days, in abundant ways, we see how hard it is to synthesise those differences. In attempting to rally and bind his troops, perhaps our individualist prime minister has become a tribalist, after all.</p> <p>Bubbles really can\u2019t be avoided in modern politics. Depressingly, it is the way of things. The prime minister has to develop the trick of subsistence in the bubble, but he also has to puncture it, forcefully when necessary, both to avoid slow suffocation and as a gesture of recognition \u2013 because outside the cloisters the Australian people are watching and hoping that someone in major party politics can rise above the aggressive insularity and the brinkmanship, give them the courtesy of a genuine conversation, and face up to the challenges of the moment.</p>",
