It\u2019s all part of looking at how many games English players play and how many international games there are generally. We look at these things on a four-year cycle and my view is that [an agreement] has to address that. We do believe [a reduction] should happen.\u201d</p> <p>The RFU has confirmed there are no plans to stage England Tests in the north of England despite widespread support for the idea. Andy Cosslett, the RFU\u2019s new chairman, comes from Manchester but says the funding for grassroots rugby generated by a sold\u2011out Twickenham outweighs the potential benefits of northern Tests. \u201cIt\u2019s a big sum of money because there\u2019s no stadium in the north of England with 82,000 seats and we would have to share the gate revenues,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have a pretty large financial impact and you would have to consider our 15,000 debenture holders as well.\u201d</p> <p>He also said there was no rush to reform the 60-strong RFU Council but the union is prepared to discuss possible changes to Championship promotion and relegation. \u201cOur view is that conceptually promotion and relegation is a good idea as opposed to ring-fencing,\u201d Ritchie said. \u201cWe were content to leave it as it is but if there\u2019s an appetite for change, we\u2019ll look at it. I\u2019m quite open-minded to discuss it as long as Premiership Rugby and the Championship clubs think that\u2019s a good thing to do.\u201d A review of the Championship is being undertaken by the RFU\u2019s professional rugby director, Nigel Melville, with the end-of-season play-offs under particular scrutiny.</p>",
  "<p>The UK Athletics performance director, Neil Black, insists he is unconcerned that two of his brightest young prospects, the heptathlete Katarina Johnson-Thompson and the sprinter Adam Gemili, are still without coaches as they begin their preparations for the 2017 world championships in London.</p> <p>Johnson-Thompson parted with her coach, Mike Holmes, after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/14/jessica-ennis-hill-to-decide-on-future-after-claiming-silver-in-heptathlon\" title=\"\">disappointing Olympics where she finished sixth</a>, while Gemili left Steve Fudge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/usain-bolt-jamaica-200m-gold-medal-olympic-rio-2016\" title=\"\">after missing out on a 200m medal in Rio by three-thousandths of a second</a>. Both are understood to have been searching for replacements, with Johnson-Thompson considering whether to stay in the UK or move to the Netherlands or the US and Gemili understood to be favouring relocating to the US.</p> <p>Black, who on Wednesday announced which British athletes would be funded by lottery money in 2017, said he hoped the pair would make up their minds sooner rather than later. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult thing finding a coach who\u2019s got the right background, skill set, environment, personality \u2013 and the chemistry between the athlete and coach has to be exceptional,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are working with both Adam and Katarina to explore their options and we hope they make good decisions as soon as they can.\u201d</p> <p>Black also denied that with Jessica Ennis-Hill having retired, Mo Farah saying that 2017 would be his last year on the track, and Greg Rutherford turning 30 this month, that the next generation of British athletics would struggle to hit the same heights. \u201cWe all know how close Adam Gemili and Dina Asher-Smith have been to the podium, and we also have Katarina, Laura Muir, Zharnel Hughes, Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake and Sophie Hitchon to mention but a few,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned at all. We just have got to get converting top-eight finishes to medallists. I\u2019m excited about what the future looks like.\u201d</p> <p>Black defended his decision to strip a number of athletes of lottery money, including the 100m sprinter James Dasaolu, the 1500m runner Laura Weightman and the former 400m hurdles world champion Dai Greene \u2013 as well as the decision not to reward Eilish McColgan, who made huge strides in the women\u2019s 5,000m, finishing 13th in the Olympic final and lowering her personal best by almost 40 seconds.</p> <p>The 800m runner Michael Rimmer suggested that UK Athletics had wrongly decided that McColgan was \u201cpast it at 25\u201d while McColgan\u2019s mother, Liz, the 10,000m world championship gold medallist in 1991, attacked the sports governing body, tweeting: \u201cIf I were London marathon I would pull out of the UK endurance programme and fund their own. UKA have the talent but lack the leadership.\u201d</p> <p>Black defended his decisions, saying: \u201cThis programme has an emphasis in winning medals at the Olympics and the Paralympics. That\u2019s its primary goal. In this next year in particular, there\u2019s an interest in the world championships and the IPC worlds at London 2017. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to focus on.\u201d</p>",

He was linked to the case of Zahra Kazemi, an Iranian-Canadian photographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/apr/05/iran.worlddispatch\">who died in Evin prison in 2003</a>. <br></p> <p>Tara Sepehri Far of Human Rights Watch said Mortazavi was linked with \u201cthe most flagrant human rights abuses committed in recent years\u201d, including \u201ccredible allegations of torture and deaths of protesters detained in the crackdown following the 2009 presidential election\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWhile this verdict shows that figures such as Mortazavi are not immune from prosecution for ever, justice should first and foremost prioritise addressing his role in Iran\u2019s darkest recent history,\u201d she said. \u201cYet, he also should be treated humanely, something that was denied to Iranians during his time as a prosecutor, and not be subjected to corporal punishment or other inhuman treatment.\u201d<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/nov/02/iran-new-wave-repression-says-akbar-ganji\">Iranian writer Akbar Ganji</a>, a victim of Mortazavi\u2019s targeting of journalists, told the Guardian the sentencing was a \u201cwhitewash\u201d. \u201cIt means that he is not being punished. It is not surprising \u2013 one could not expect anything else from the Iranian judiciary. Mortazavi is protected by the most powerful people in Iran.

Mortazavi has since been acquitted of charges relating to this. <br></p> <p>Hadi Ghaemi, of the New York-based International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, said: \u201cThis sentence is yet another example of rampant impunity in Iran. No justice is being delivered here, given the extent of graft and corruption committed by Mortazavi, and his involvement in the torture and deaths of protesters in custody in 2009. Also, sentencing him to flogging, if meant to demonstrate a serious punishment, is just physical barbarity that does nothing to hold him accountable in any meaningful way.\u201d</p> <p>Ahmadinejad went to great lengths to protect Mortazavi after the Kahrizak scandal, appointing him head of Iran\u2019s social security organisation, which provides insurance to many government and private employees. <br></p> <p>In 2013, Mortazavi\u2019s name was mentioned in the Iranian parliament in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/05/mahmoud-ahmadinejad-ayatollah-ali-khamenei\">hugely embarrassing public row</a> between Ahmadinejad and the parliamentary speaker, Ali Larijani. Ahmadinejad played a secretly filmed tape showing that Larijani\u2019s brother was allegedly trading on his sibling\u2019s influence for personal financial gain in a conversation with Mortazavi. Mortazavi was briefly detained after the incident. <br></p> <p>Amnesty International\u2019s Iran researcher, Raha Bahreini, said: \u201cFlogging and other forms of corporal judicial punishment violate international law and cannot be justified in any circumstances. <br></p> <p>\u201cInstead of meting out brutal punishments, the Iranian authorities should be abolishing all forms of corporal punishment and conducting an independent, impartial and thorough investigation into Saeed Mortazavi\u2019s alleged involvement in human rights violations, including the deaths, torture and arbitrary detention of dozens of protesters following the disputed presidential election in 2009.\u201d</p>",

Leaving the EU on the slightest of referendum majorities, after a campaign in which the leave side was never constitutionally compelled to agree what leave meant, is already plunging Britain into a constitutional, political and legal quagmire. Prolonged economic stagnation, perhaps depression, seem inevitable. A liberal, tolerant, outward-looking country is being transmuted into an illiberal, intolerant, inward-looking one. This is as fundamental as it gets. Battle is being joined for our soul, yet many of those who see all they hold dear being ripped away from them are strangely mute. Nigel Farage was right when he said it was a revolution \u201cwithout a shot being fired\u201d.</p> <p>It is time to return fire. But the political truth is that no success is possible without the full-throated support of the Labour party, strikingly absent from the unfolding trauma. That must change \u2013 both in the interests of the country and the people it aims to serve.</p> <p>It is the great unravelling. The painful economic uncertainties of unwinding 43 years of EU membership must surely trigger an investment strike and consequent economic stasis. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/01/gates-closing-tensions-rising-brexit-feels-tangible-and-frightening\">Britain has a $1tn</a> stock of foreign direct investment \u2013 equalled only by China and the US \u2013 involving some 500 multinationals. Their regional or global headquarters are in Britain because of our participation in the European single market. Leaving it, as the Japanese government and the US Chamber of Commerce have both unequivocally warned, will seriously affect investment. The impact will cascade down into every nook and cranny of our economy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/01/gates-closing-tensions-rising-brexit-feels-tangible-and-frightening\">Nissan is an early sign of the downturns and the divisions Brexit could bring | Will Hutton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hopes of an export boom are overdone. Our export sector is uniquely weak. Britain\u2019s share of world markets has been falling for decades, largely because of unaddressed systemic economic weaknesses. The response to the devaluation after the financial crisis was paltry. It promises to be paltry again. One prominent economic forecaster \u2013 the National Institute of Economic and Social Research \u2013 foresees a drop of up to 60% in our service exports as a result of Brexit. Exports of goods will have to boom just to offset that effect. They can\u2019t and won\u2019t.</p> <p>British society is in no great shape to handle the consequences. Inequalities of income and wealth between generations, regions and classes are unedifyingly high. But addressing these inequalities requires financial resources \u2013 which will be reduced by Brexit. The public sector deficit in the current financial year is already \u00a314bn higher than projected. The Resolution Foundation warns that just on a modest downward revision of growth, the deficit will widen by \u00a323bn by 2020-21 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/26/hammond-80bn-black-hole-economic-worsens-brexit-treasury\">a cumulative shortfall of \u00a384bn</a>. It is almost certainly an understatement.</p> <p>As serious is the impact on our culture and national conversation. Although leavers talk the language of embracing the globe, they simultaneously talk of controlling borders to keep the foreign \u201cother\u201d out. Mounting anti-foreigner sentiment is morphing into a generalised language of reaction; bigots of all descriptions \u2013 racists and misogynists alike \u2013 have a new licence to \u201cspeak the unspeakable\u201d, as they would describe it. This is not the backdrop for a major mobilisation and programme of enlightened reform. It is the backdrop for retreat, closure and stagnation.</p> <p>So what to do? The first thing is to get as passionate about what is happening as leavers were in making their case. Britain must not leave the EU. It is not just that leaving is an act of wilful economic self-harm \u2013 it is also abandoning the continent\u2019s most noble project. This will be attacked by leavers as defying the democratic will. But democracy is about constant argument and deliberation, not permanently deifying one vote at one moment in time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/02/mark-carney-brexit-bolsheviks-new-target-chancellor\">After Mark Carney, the Brexit Bolsheviks have a new target | Rafael Behr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But to have traction, the argument has to be coupled with a political challenge. It must be made by a political party serious about winning political power, and capable of doing it. The electorate must be convinced that their darkening circumstances can be feasibly and realistically changed. A second referendum in this context is no more than an enabling building block in a larger programme of improvement.</p> <p>There are many elements in such a programme. The case needs to be made for a repurposing of British capitalism, housed in a reimagined ownership, financial and innovation system that can seize the opportunities opened up by new technologies. The labour market must be recast to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/03/gig-economy-zero-hours-contracts-ethics\">challenge the gig economy</a> with trade unions that enfranchise ordinary people. Risk, which haunts so many lives, must be minimised by a renewed, cradle-to-grave, flexible and skills-based welfare system. The public realm must be reconceived with a sufficiently broad tax base to foster public initiative and enterprise. And Britain must reaffirm EU membership, which is the bridge to international openness and fundamental to our prosperity.</p> <p>These are the propositions around which the centre and left \u2013 and the best of the conservative tradition \u2013 can unite. They are what the overwhelming majority of British people want, if only there were a party capable of making the arguments and putting together the coalition of interests to propel it to power to implement them.</p> <p>Millions are aching to contest what is happening. We need a transformative public conversation \u2013 and a willingness to argue our heads off for tolerance, fairness and openness, as well as for membership of pan-European institutions and the markets on our continent.</p> <p>This is above all a political project. It can encompass social movements, but cannot be delivered by them. This is why a group of centre-left Labour MPs has launched a new movement to make the case. I support their efforts because Britain stands on the verge of a great unravelling with untold consequences for its economy, society, place in the world, and its people\u2019s souls. The standard must be raised: fire must be returned. We need to make the case for a reimagined Britain and its membership of the EU. We say not what we are against, but what we stand for. We want our country back. And we want it now.</p> <p><em>This article is part of </em><a href=\"http://www.labourtribunemps.org/\"><em>a speech delivered</em></a><em> at the launch of the Labour Tribune MPs Group on Wednesday.</em></p>",
  "<p>As a team of physicians and social scientists studying how choices are made during consultations, we were disturbed to read that the Royal College of Surgeons agrees with Lady Hale that doctors should not be making treatment recommendations (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/27/patients-must-understand-options-royal-college-surgeons\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 27 October). While a \u201cpaternalistic\u201d approach is clearly inappropriate for the 21st century, decades of health communication research point to shared decision-making as the best alternative. This is categorically not the same as the \u201cinformation-only\u201d approach advocated in the new guidance, which requires doctors to withhold their views even when they have good grounds for making a recommendation, and even when the patient asks for one.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.pec-journal.com/article/S0738-3991(16)30082-9/abstract\" title=\"\">our research</a>, we found numerous problems with the enactment of patient choice, including patients not knowing how to decide, patients seeking the neurologist\u2019s recommendation when it was not offered, and the near impossibility of providing information in a fully neutral fashion. Moreover, we found that there was no evidence that being offered choice was associated with higher levels of patient satisfaction.</p> <p>Patients vary widely in their knowledge, preferences and decision-making capacity. Part of enacting shared decision-making is to work sensitively with the patient to establish what role they wish to play at that particular time. Certainly, patients should be given clear, balanced information about the range of available options, and the potential risks and benefits of each. But imposing choice on patients who do not want it is just as paternalistic as insisting that they follow doctors\u2019 orders. <br><strong>Dr Paul Chappell</strong> <em>Department of sociology, University of York</em><br><strong>Professor Roderick Duncan</strong> <em>Associate professor of neurology, University of Otago, New Zealand</em><br><strong>Dr Clare Jackson</strong> <em>Department of sociology, University of York, UK</em><br><strong>Professor Markus Reuber</strong> <em>Professor of clinical neurology, University of Sheffield</em><br><strong>Dr Merran Toerien</strong> <em>Department of sociology, University of York</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is clearly right that patients are given all the information they need to make a decision concerning their treatment options, but could I have the temerity to suggest that, quite often, doctor does know best?

To fail to take a decision on their behalf in that situation would be an abdication of responsibility, and a betrayal of their trust.<br><strong>Dr Bob Bury</strong><br><em>Leeds</em></p> <p>\u2022 Re your article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/24/many-treatments-give-no-more-benefit-than-doing-nothing-leading-doctors\" title=\"\">Leading doctors list dozens of procedures that \u2018give no benefit\u2019</a>, 24&#xa0;October), the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges research is a welcome contribution to the debate about the pressures faced by doctors daily.

But will patients want to know? | Fay Schopen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the study, about 60% of doctors said their decisions were driven by a fear of litigation. A similar proportion said interventions were a result of increasing pressure and expectations from patients. I would argue that these statistics are in fact the most striking and concerning, and they concur with our own research. A survey of 600 GP members showed 67% are fearful of being sued \u2013 and of those, 85% say this fear impacts negatively on the way they practise. Furthermore, 86% of our members said they sometimes, most of the time or always encounter challenging experiences with patients when they do not provide the prescription, treatment or referral to a specialist they request.</p> <p>This paints a clear picture of the increasingly challenging environment in which doctors are working, and highlights the need for doctors to understand and be supported on how to manage patients\u2019 expectations. When expectations are not met, it can lead to dissatisfaction, a breakdown in trust and a greater risk of the patient pursuing a complaint or claim.

Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.

The Committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen but decided, for the time being, to wait for some further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a2a13e4b07ceadb3a1b63\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T18:02:32.519Z\">6.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This time there were only two Fed dissenters who wanted to raise rates not three, Esther George and Loretta Mester.</p> <p>Eric Rosengren, who voted for a rise last time, has now sided with the majority.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T18:15:56.703Z\">at 6.15pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581a2667e4b07ceadb3a1b51\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T18:00:32.417Z\">6.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Federal Reserve leaves US rates unchanged</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>BREAKING NEWS</strong></p> <p>To no one\u2019s great surprise, the Federal Reserve has opted to leave US interest rates unchanged just days ahead of the presidential election.</p> <p>It said it was waiting for further evidence of progress towards its objectives before hiking.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a2846e4b0d073c27d0c35\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T17:54:20.617Z\">5.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AWMCheung/status/793873322211696640\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Awaiting any subtle change in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FOMC?src=hash\">#FOMC</a> language to hint towards Dec hike... look out for &quot;next meeting&quot; or &quot;further strengthened&quot;</p>&mdash; Anthony Cheung (@AWMCheung) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AWMCheung/status/793873322211696640\">November 2, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a1cfbe4b029b92ca44cce\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T17:10:10.405Z\">5.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The US Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate decision will be released in less than an hour.</strong></p> <p>While most commentators expect there to be no change - not this close to the presidential election - the prospect of a rate rise in December is thought to be reasonably likely, given the recent reassuring US economic data.</p> <p>There is likely to be a focus - as usual - on the exact wording of the Fed statement and whether it shows any changes from the September comments.

Combined with a slump in oil prices following a record weekly rise in US crude stocks, this has pushed markets in Europe sharply lower.</p> <p>But on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which lost 100 points or so on Tuesday, has not been hit as badly (so far), and is currently down just 20 points ahead of the latest US Federal Reserve interest rate decision.<br></p> <p>Meanwhile the Vix index of volatility, seen as a gauge of investor fears, is up 3% to 19. When Clinton looked a shoo-in to win, the index was hovering around 13. But despite this recent rise, it is still well below the 25 level it reached after the Brexit vote in June. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Less than a week out from the US election and markets are demonstrating both complacency and a palpable fear at the same time. A surge in the VIX index shows volatility is on the rise and investors are hedging equity exposure with safe havens like gold and government bonds. But at the same time equity benchmarks are only modestly down, showing an overriding comfort in owning stocks.</p> <p>The VIX is up over 40% in the last seven days, reaching above 18, a level in which many investors sit up and pay attention to signs of heightened risk in the market. Over that same period the FTSE 100 and S&amp;P 500 are down 2-3%. </p> <p>There is still a general perception that Hillary Clinton will take the White House, but the surprise Brexit result is fresh in minds of investors and they are buying gold and VIX index tracking products to hedge their bets.</p> </blockquote> <p>The final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 fell 71.72 points or 1.04% to 6845.42, its lowest level since 27 September</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.47% to 10,370.93</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.24% at 4414.67</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished 2.51% lower at 16,474.52</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.85% at 8873.4</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.15% to 581.56.</strong></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a0f8ee4b029b92ca44c77\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T16:12:51.686Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ahead of the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision in a couple of hours and the Bank of England meeting tomorrow, the dollar continues to weaken against the pound.</p> <p>Jitters about the prospect of Donald Trump winning the White House have sent the US currency lower, to the benefit of sterling which is now up 0.57% at $1.2313, a three week high.</p> <p>The pound is not faring so well against the euro but nor is it losing ground, being pretty much unchanged at \u20ac1.1078.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a0bc3e4b07ceadb3a1abb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T15:52:41.324Z\">3.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with oil:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/chris1reuters/status/793836490023460865\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Back to Algiers<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brent?src=hash\">#Brent</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WTI?src=hash\">#WTI</a> crude <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/oil?src=hash\">#oil</a> have now lost all gains made after <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPEC?src=hash\">#OPEC</a> agreed output limits with other producers Sept 28<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OOTT?src=hash\">#OOTT</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/xb3NZzdBKN\">pic.twitter.com/xb3NZzdBKN</a></p>&mdash; Christopher Johnson (@chris1reuters) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chris1reuters/status/793836490023460865\">November 2, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a09fae4b07ceadb3a1aae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T15:48:40.140Z\">3.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Global manufacturing grew at the fastest rate for two years in October, according to data from purchasing managers surveys in more than 30 countries.</strong></p> <p>The JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI, compiled by Markit, rose to 52 in October form 51 the previous month, its highest since October 2014.

Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The markets are not in full on panic mode right now, suggesting that they still think Clinton could clinch a win next week. This is reflected in the Vix volatility index, which is considered a fear gauge for Wall Street. Even though it has risen in recent days it is still below 20%, to put this in context, after the Brexit vote in June volatility spiked above 25%.</p> <p>Global stock markets are generally lower on Wednesday, but US markets have outperformed their European counterparts even with 6 days to go before the US election. Interestingly, the Dow Jones Transport Index, considered a lead indicator for Wall Street, is higher today. Considering a Trump presidency is considered the worst outcome for the US economy, the fact that this index has not fallen further on the back of the bad poll news for the Clinton camp, suggests that the US equity market may not sell off sharply until volatility spikes further, or until the actual result is confirmed.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the other potentially market moving event is the US Federal Reserve interest rate announcement later. Brooks said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The market is expecting a 14% chance of a hike tonight. If the Fed does hike, that would throw the cat among the pigeons, and we could see a steeper sell off in equities, a rally in bond yields and a broad-based recovery in the dollar.</p> <p>However, in our view the bigger risk from today\u2019s meeting could be a dovish slant from the Federal Reserve, who may not want to commit to a rate hike until the election result is confirmed. Although the Fed is expected to be politically neutral, a potential market sell-off on the back of a win for Trump next week could put the prospect of a December rate hike to bed for the Fed. Added to this, the Fed chair and vice chair have given speeches with fairly dovish slants in recent weeks, so a sell-off in the dollar on Wednesday could be in advance of a dovish \u201cshock\u201d from the Fed later on today.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5819fcc5e4b029b92ca44c01\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T14:48:42.158Z\">2.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/793825218724782080\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">$50 fading fast.

While most voters fear the growth of Isis, she\u2019s calling for cutting military spending by 50% along with closing more than 700 US military bases abroad. This may be why her longshot bid keeps her hovering at around the 2% mark in national polls.</p> <p>In Utah and 11 other states, voters will see Evan McMullin on their ballots.

But barring deep religious conviction, in other states the notion of casting a protest vote is just too dangerous in this cycle.</p> <p>The Grand Ole Party is having a grand ole food fight for all to see. The Tea Party wing of the party has morphed into a Trump-fueled alt-right populist movement that <a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/the-voice-in-donald-trumps-head-austins-alex-jones/nst9F/\">trusts Alex Jones conspiracy theories</a> more than facts and data. And Trump himself has even lashed out at the House speaker, Paul Ryan, and other congressional Republicans in recent weeks.</p> <p>But in a sign of the times for the GOP, Ryan <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/11/us/politics/donald-trump-gop-hillary-clinton.html\">abandoned Trump</a> last month only to <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/paul-ryan-votes-donald-trump-house-freedom-caucus-2016-11\">cast his vote for him</a> this week. It\u2019s that kind of unprincipled, even feckless, leadership from the Republican party that led to the rise of the misogynistic and racist Donald Trump. Republican leaders have stoked fear in their base since President Obama was elected and now they have lost control of their own narrative and voters.</p> <p>That\u2019s why this isn\u2019t the year to mess with a third-party vote \u2013 since no third-party candidate is going to win, all those votes might do is prevent a Clinton victory, putting the GOP meltdown front and center in global governance. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/31/us-election-green-party-jill-stein\">Don't settle for the lesser of two evils in this election.

For the past two decades he has been a security expert well trusted within cricket as well as an increasing number of other sports.

But now the trust remains.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all gone very smoothly,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been very happy with the effort the Bangladesh government and their board have put in.

Occasionally it seemed excessive to the layman, most obviously the convoy between the hotel and the ground or airport when the roads were cleared for the buses carrying the teams and the press. In cities such as Dhaka and Chittagong that was a major operation as well as a major luxury since the journey time through streets that are usually extremely congested was slashed&#xa0;dramatically.</p> <p>Dickason said about 2,000 police a day were allocated to the security plan in Dhaka, 1,400 in Chittagong. It was a little eerie to arrive at a cricket ground to be surrounded by so many armed guards as well as men with guns stationed on nearby rooftops, but Dickason does not believe this had an adverse effect on the players.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you enter a different environment after two or three days it becomes the norm. There were huge convoys and when you get off the plane there was a huge security presence. But after a few days it just becomes part of the landscape.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"962efb6d2fd745819593582d824ccec0244597e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/962efb6d2fd745819593582d824ccec0244597e1/0_140_2731_1638/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reg Dickason\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England\u2019s security expert Reg Dickason said the security operation in Bangladesh was probably the most comprehensive he had seen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The success of the security arrangements \u2013 and the tour \u2013 may enhance the prospect of more home Tests for Bangladesh.

Their strength on their home turf is obvious to all. A snippet of encouragement for England\u2019s tourists comes with the announcement of their Test squad, however. They have some injury concerns. Rohit Sharma, a heavy run-scorer in the recent series against New Zealand, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/02/rohit-sharma-india-test-squad-england-injury-cricket\" title=\"\">absent from the squad</a> because of a thigh problem. So, too, is the colourful opening batsman Shikhar Dhawan and another opener, KL Rahul.</p> <p>So England will be confronted by a familiar figure at the top of the order, the more prosaic veteran Gautam Gambhir. The swing bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar is also recovering from a hamstring injury but India\u2019s reservoir of pacemen is somewhat deeper than that of Bangladesh.</p>",

Clearly given the importance of Anglo-Irish relations, the border with Northern Ireland, the billions in trade across the Irish Sea, the government in Dublin is worried about the prospect of a fresh diplomatic war breaking between the EU and the UK whenever Theresa May triggers article 50.</p> <p>Another significant part of the Taoiseach\u2019s contribution today during the all-island summit on Brexit in Dublin was Kenny suggesting that his British counterpart might press the exit button before the spring. Was Kenny hinting that pressure to get to an earlier Brexit from within the Tory Party was pushing the UK out the EU door before the Spring of 2017? Or indeed was the Irish premier sending a warning signal to London about the perils of doing so without negotiations having been properly started and exit strategies properly thought out?</p> <p>The main absentees from the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, a former military hospital and now the museum of modern art in Ireland, were the unionists. Neither the pro-Brexit Democratic Unionists or the pro-remain Ulster Unionists attended. Both parties have argued that today\u2019s conference went beyond the remit of the agreements that established devolution, power sharing and north-south bodies under the island of Ireland: the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and the 2006 St Andrews Agreement. In a sense they are right because the main business between all the political traditions on the island regarding Brexit will be done at the next North-South ministerial council, which will take place on 18 November in Armagh city. </p> <p>Away from the rhetoric there appears to be a willingness between unionism and nationalism to hatch a pragmatic deal that will not destabilise peace or plunge the island economy into the abyss. This cross-border body was established under the Good Friday peace deal and brings together ministers from Dublin to Belfast to discuss all island matters. Which obviously would include how do both states on the island cope with Brexit.</p> <p>Another important meeting takes place next week in Downing Street when Theresa May again invites the leaders of the devolved parliaments in Belfast, Edinburgh and Cardiff to Number 10 to discuss Brexit negotiations and plans ahead to deal with the 26 EU states.</p> <p>Today\u2019s conference now seems to have been a means by which Dublin sent out two messages to London and the other EU capitals. It was a warning to Britain that exit-talks with Ireland\u2019s European partners are going to be messy and perhaps even a little brutal. To their fellow Europeans, Kenny\u2019s suggestion that the other EU states should not get obsessed over what Britain gets is also a warning that if other countries start to issue specific demands of their own as pay-off to London then the entire European project could be put in peril. In both scenarios the entire political establishment in Dublin acknowledges Ireland has a lot to lose. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa53bb94f5fd0b9c59ad2e02880c8e2928e33723\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa53bb94f5fd0b9c59ad2e02880c8e2928e33723/0_162_4928_2955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Enda Kenny speaks to the media on arrival at the all-island summit in Dublin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enda Kenny speaks to the media on arrival at the all-island summit in Dublin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a0e5be4b07ceadb3a1ac5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T16:04:45.970Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The hearing has adjourned for at least 15 minutes because the MPs have to take part in a vote.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a0cb2e4b029b92ca44c69\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T15:57:43.054Z\">3.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Chilcot says the cabinet should have received formal written advice from the attorney general about whether the war was legal.

It is probably fair to say that a British politician can never go wrong whacking Fifa - with left or right, tabloid or broadsheet - and May milked this for all it was worth. It was an easy hit, but you can\u2019t blame her for taking it.</p> <p>Should Jeremy Corbyn have asked about Fifa? If Alastair Campbell was in charge of his PMQs planning, doubtless it would have been question number one. But this is not Corbyn\u2019s style and, if he had tried to set himself up as a Fifa-bashing poppy patriot, it would probably have sounded phoney.</p> <p>Instead Corbyn focused on welfare, highlighting cuts to universal credit, benefit sanctions,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/27/benefit-sanctions-food-banks-oxford-university-study\"> the research showing their link to increased demand for food banks</a> and Ken Loach\u2019s film, I, Daniel Blake. Some of his questions were quite effective, but others, less so. (For example, given that he was asking about universal credit, why didn\u2019t Corbyn point out that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/28/iain-duncan-smith-challenge-theresa-may-universal-credit-cuts\">even Iain Duncan Smith wants these cuts to be reversed?) </a></p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s best moment was probably when, referring to sanctions, he urged May to stop \u201cthis institutionalised barbarity against often very vulnerable people\u201d. But May seemed comfortable with Corbyn\u2019s questions because she was able to condemn Labour\u2019s stance on welfare. She told the Labour leader:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You have a view that there should be no assessments, no sanctions and unlimited welfare. I have to say to you that the Labour party is drifting away from the views of Labour voters. It\u2019s this party that understands working-class people.</p> </blockquote> <p>The moment Corbyn\u2019s election as Labour leader probably became inevitable in 2015 was when he was the only candidate to vote against the welfare bill. The other three candidates abstained on the bill, which included welfare cuts, in line with the Labour whip. But abstention was Labour\u2019s official position because Harriet Harman, the acting leader, took the view that being seen as soft on welfare spending had contributed to the party\u2019s election defeat. PMQs today confirmed that Corbyn does not accept this view, but it remains to be seen whether he has found a way of selling Labour welfarism to the electorate. May sounded like someone who thinks that he hasn\u2019t.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/nov/02/may-and-corbyn-clash-over-benefits-at-pmqs-video-highlights\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5afng\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2865607\"            data-video-name=\"May and Corbyn clash over benefits at PMQs \u2013 video highlights\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5819f826e4b0d073c27d0b04\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/02/161102PMQs2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/02/161102PMQs2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/02/161102PMQs2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/nov/02/may-and-corbyn-clash-over-benefits-at-pmqs-video-highlights\">May and Corbyn clash over benefits at PMQs</a></figcaption> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T15:37:04.209Z\">at 3.37pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5819e361e4b029b92ca44b61\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T13:02:20.448Z\">1.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">May tells Fifa to 'sort their own house out' before giving orders to UK over poppies</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Theresa May has launched a blistering attack on football\u2019s governing body Fifa, which has turned down a request from England and Scotland players to wear armbands featuring poppies when the sides meet on Remembrance Day.</p> <p>Speaking at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, May said the stance taken by Fifa was \u201cutterly outrageous\u201d and said the strength of feeling across the House of Commons was clear.</p> <p>\u201cOur football players want to recognise and respect those who have given their lives for our safety and security,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it is absolutely right they should be able to do so.\u201d</p> <p>Her response was prompted by a question from Steve McCabe, Labour\u2019s MP for Birmingham Selly Oak who was born in Inverclyde. \u201cWill she tell the respective associations [England and Scotland] that in this country, we decide when to wear poppies and they\u2019ll be wearing them at Wembley?\u201d</p> <p>May said the decision should lie with the respective associations but said \u201ca clear message is going from this House.\u201d</p> <p>Fifa, has been mired in a long-running corruption scandal, should be more concerned with its own affairs, May went on. \u201cI should say to Fifa before they start telling us what to do they jolly well ought to sort their own house out.\u201d</p> <p>The footballing body normally bans any political, religious or commercial messages on shirts.

Corbyn used all six questions to ask about welfare, but he moved from one topic to another, with varying success. May was at her weakest at the start, when Corbyn asked about cuts to universal credit which are coming down the line, which will effectively undo the tax credit cuts U-turn announced by George Osborne, but these calculations are complex, and hard to explain, and although May did not address the point at all, Corbyn did not drive his point hard home. He was more passionate, and effective, on benefit sanctions, but at this point May may had a solid response which involved accusing Labour of being opposed to any form of sanction or fiscal discipline in welfare spending. Corbyn finished with a dignified plea on behalf of parents who had difficulty affording funeral costs for children who die, and this prompted a semi-consensual response from May, who said funding was already available. So, overall, a bit of a draw.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgxEglC73aA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MgxEglC73aA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T13:16:40.063Z\">at 1.16pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5819d814e4b029b92ca44b1f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T12:15:03.482Z\">12.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn says the housing benefit bill is going up.

It will be his first big financial statement as chancellor and his first proper chance to reset economic policy in the light of the Brexit vote.

Hammond has yet to say what his replacement target will be, but the FT story makes it clear that his new rules will be more lax than Osborne\u2019s. Chancellors used to pride themselves on their \u201ciron\u201d discipline. Given the uncertainty caused by our departure from the EU, Hammond seems to see being a \u201crubber\u201d chancellor as more pragmatic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/793554132665761792\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">FT: Hammond seeks &#39;headroom&#39; to let deficit rise if Brexit hits growth <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tomorrowspaperstoday?src=hash\">#tomorrowspaperstoday</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bbcpapers?src=hash\">#bbcpapers</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/b5HPAvobqx\">pic.twitter.com/b5HPAvobqx</a></p>&mdash; Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/793554132665761792\">November 1, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Here\u2019s an extract from the FT story, which the Treasury is not commenting on.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mr Hammond told cabinet colleagues on Tuesday to expect only a modest fiscal stimulus, with a programme of new infrastructure spending <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8ef2bbe6-8ca3-11e6-8cb7-e7ada1d123b1\">expected to run to the low billions of pounds a year</a>.</p> <p>But his new fiscal plan, while aimed at achieving a balanced budget in the next parliament, would allow a greater stimulus package to be unleashed if <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aabf5bce-a010-11e6-86d5-4e36b35c3550\">the current robust rate of economic growth</a> starts to falter.</p> <p>\u201cThe goal is to create some headroom so it can be deployed if necessary,\u201d said one official close to the cabinet discussions. \u201cThe chancellor made it clear we face an unprecedented level of uncertainty.\u201d</p> <p>Theresa May\u2019s spokeswoman said the cabinet discussed the \u201cimportance of continued fiscal discipline\u201d and \u201cthe need to drive up productivity\u201d; the new infrastructure projects will be aimed at boosting growth.</p> <p>The government has already said it will not try to hit former chancellor George Osborne\u2019s aim of running an absolute surplus by 2019-20 and Mr Hammond\u2019s ambitions are set to be significantly more lax even if the government rejects what the chancellor calls a public spending \u201csplurge\u201d.</p> </blockquote> <p>I will post any reaction that comes in.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.

  "<p>The verdict is in and the government is guilty. In a landmark ruling, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/02/high-court-rules-uk-government-plans-to-tackle-air-pollution-are-illegal\" title=\"\">the high court has ruled</a> that the plans to cut fatal air pollution are not only inadequate, but also illegal. To anyone who has seen <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/air-quality-plan-for-nitrogen-dioxide-no2-in-uk-2015\" title=\"\">these plans</a>, the verdict is not surprising.</p> <p>\u201cIf there was a toxin in our water system that we knew was killing thousands of people every year, the government would be coordinating Cobra meetings every day,\u201d Matthew Pennycook, the Labour MP for Greenwich and chair of parliament\u2019s cross-party group on air pollution, said after this morning\u2019s ruling. But when it comes to the fatal toxins in our air, the government has not been coordinating any emergency meetings. It has been moving at a snail\u2019s pace.</p> <p>Air pollution is a known killer. The UK has been in breach of legal limits on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) for years. The government\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-archive/environmental-audit-committee/eacpn220310/\" title=\"\">own reports</a> show air pollution is causing 40-50,000 deaths every year, by exacerbating respiratory illnesses, heart disease and asthma. New evidence suggests it is not only finding its way into our lungs, but into our brains too, where it may <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/05/toxic-air-pollution-particles-found-in-human-brains-links-alzheimers\" title=\"\">bring about the premature onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease</a>. In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/27/uk-air-pollution-public-health-emergency-crisis-diesel-cars\" title=\"\">words of MPs from all parties</a>, we are facing a public health crisis.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/30/theresa-may-launches-tory-leadership-bid-with-pledge-to-unite-country\" title=\"\">Theresa May has pledged</a> that she will fight the \u201cburning injustices\u201d that entrench social inequality and blight the life chances of children from working-class families. She says that many in Westminster \u201cdon\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to live like this and need to be told that what the government does isn\u2019t a game\u201d. But perhaps the prime minister is among them.</p> <p>Children know that air pollution is not a game because they are substantially more vulnerable to toxins in the air, which permanently stunt the development of their lungs. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/10/londons-black-communities-disproportionately-exposed-to-air-pollution-study\" title=\"\">So too</a> are people from ethnic minority backgrounds, those living in areas of higher levels of deprivation, the elderly and those with chronic health conditions. In short, they are the most vulnerable people in our society.</p> <p>Yet still, the apathy persists. It has now been more than a year since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2015/sep/24/vw-volkswagen-diesel-emissions-carmaker-why-video\" title=\"\">Volkswagen scandal broke</a>, when a major car manufacturer was revealed to have been covering up air pollution through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/16/volkswagen-emissions-scandal-criminal-evidence\" title=\"\">criminal activity</a>. In the US, VW has agreed to pay $15.3bn to compensate consumers and mitigate some of the damage it has done to the environment. In the UK the government has failed to take legal action or compensate consumers \u2013 all while lobbying at an EU level to water down regulations that would encourage the car industry to change. Indeed, the only reason the government has an air quality plan at all is because the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/29/supreme-court-orders-uk-to-draw-up-air-pollution-cleanup-plan\" title=\"\">supreme court ordered it to draw one up</a> 18 months ago.</p> <p>So what now? Speaking at prime minister\u2019s questions today, May promised that the government did not \u201cdoubt the importance of the issue\u201d and would look again at the proposals. She is right, it will \u2013 because it will have to. It now has one week to negotiate with the NGO ClientEarth, which emerged victorious from the high court this morning. It will be forced to scrap its current air quality plan, which called for clean air zones in just five cities, and backed the mayor\u2019s plans in London, but did not mandate change in major cities such as Manchester and industrial hot spots such as Port Talbot.</p> <p>Any new plan is likely to implement clean air zones in many more cities and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/02/diesel-vehicles-face-charges-after-uk-government-loses-air-pollution-case\" title=\"\">could mean that diesel cars will face charges</a> in many city centres. But the government should ensure local authorities have proper resources to implement the zones. It is also likely the government will have to redo the flawed modelling on which its current plans are based, which fail to properly take into account <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/21/all-top-selling-cars-break-emissions-limits-in-real-world-tests\" title=\"\">the vast discrepancy</a> between tests in the laboratory and tests on the road.</p> <p>But even this is likely to be inadequate. Road transport is the number one contributor to NO2 pollution and diesel is the main culprit. Yet we currently have a tax system that incentivises consumers to purchase diesel cars, which currently make up close to half of the nation\u2019s fleet. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/02/make-central-london-diesel-free-to-solve-air-pollution-crisis-report\" title=\"\">Research published today</a> suggests that for central London to become compliant, the proportion of diesel cars on the road would need to be as low as 5%. The sale of diesel cars must end and the government must reform a regulator <a href=\"http://energydesk.greenpeace.org/2015/10/12/dieselgate-scandal-government-regulator-receives-over-80-million-from-auto-industry-in-past-10-years/\" title=\"\">that hauls in millions from the car industry itself</a>.</p> <p>But the car industry does not have to be the villain in this story. May has the opportunity to make it the hero and deliver a boost to the government\u2019s shiny new industrial strategy to boot. Both Norway and the Netherlands understand this \u2013 they are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/18/netherlands-parliament-electric-car-petrol-diesel-ban-by-2025\" title=\"\">striving for</a> an emissions-free industry within the decade.

If the UK doesn\u2019t move fast by delivering the incentives and infrastructure required to clean it up, we will get left behind. If the prime minister realises this opportunity, perhaps then she might really start to play the game.</p>",

Experts argue the framework is not sufficient to deliver the emissions reductions Australia signed on to in Paris.</p> <p>There has also been a change of political emphasis in the Turnbull government over renewable energy.</p> <p>Greg Hunt, the then federal environment minister, at the Paris conference, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/04/renewable-energy-get-your-story-straight-act-tells-coalition\">gave state governments clear encouragement to develop their own renewable energy schemes</a>. \u201cI have encouraged the states that if they want to do something extra, [they should] apply reverse auctions to the renewable energy target (RET) in the way the Australian Capital Territory has done,\u201d Hunt said last December in Paris.</p> <p>But since the election, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/06/victoria-says-coalitions-energy-meeting-a-stunt-to-save-malcolm-turnbulls-skin\">Turnbull government has been sharply critical of state-based renewable energy targets</a> that will help Australia meet its Paris commitments.</p> <p>State governments argue the commonwealth will not be able to meet the emissions reduction targets agreed in Paris without the state-based RET schemes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/16/direct-action-funds-likely-spent-on-projects-that-would-have-happened-anyway\">Direct Action funds 'spent on projects that would have happened anyway'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Correspondence from a senior federal official to the energy regulators after an energy council meeting in August seen by Guardian Australia underscores that point, suggesting the state-based schemes will deliver just under 40% of renewables in the national electricity market by 2030.</p> <p>The Coalition has agreed to review the Direct Action climate policy in 2017, but the government has played down expectations that review will lead to a significant strengthening of the current policy framework, despite the widespread criticism of the current regime.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/07/chief-scientist-to-lead-review-into-australias-energy-security\">The South Australian government has signalled</a> it wants to build broad support across the states for a form of carbon trading to apply to the electricity sector.</p>",

  "<p>One of Scotland\u2019s most recognised and reproduced paintings, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2012/mar/02/deer-study-highlands-scottish\">Sir Edwin Landseer\u2019s The Monarch of the Glen</a>, is to appear at auction with a real possibility of it being sold abroad.</p> <p>The Englishman\u2019s depiction of an enormous stag in a misty Highlands landscape is being sold by Diageo, the multinational drinks company. The painting came into the firm\u2019s possession after a merger \u2013 it was formerly owned and used as a trademark for Dewar\u2019s and then Glenfiddich whiskies.</p> <p>For the past 17 years the artwork has been on long-term loan to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/feb/17/national-museum-of-scotland-to-open-10-new-galleries-in-major-expansion\">National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh</a>. It will go on sale at Christie\u2019s in London on 8 December and is expected to fetch about \u00a310m.</p> <p>A spokesman for Diageo said the painting was being sold because it had no direct link to its business or brands. \u201cWe have made a major contribution by loaning the work for the past 17 years, but we believe the time is right for us to pass on the ownership of the painting.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe priority for Diageo is to ensure all our assets are focused on growing our business and delivering value for our employees, shareholders and the communities where we operate.\u201d</p> <p>The question posed by the sale is whether any public gallery would be able to make a bid for such a well-known painting. If it were sold to a foreign buyer the government could place a temporary export bar on the work to allow a Briton to purchase it instead.<br></p> <p>A spokesperson for the National Galleries of Scotland said The Monarch of the Glen was \u201can important Victorian picture that has taken on various layers of meaning, which include its use in advertising and as a romantic emblem of the Highlands of Scotland.</p> <p>\u201cNational Galleries of Scotland always carefully considers any paintings with a strong Scottish dimension that come on to the market, but for obvious reasons we never comment on our potential interest ahead of a sale.\u201d</p> <p>The 1851 painting, commissioned for the House of Lords. Peter Brown, Christie\u2019s international head of Victorian and pre-Raphaelite art, said it was an extraordinary artwork, describing it as \u201cone of the greatest pictures of the 19th century and known worldwide\u201d. </p> <p>He said Landseer was conveying universal qualities of nobility, command of environment and athleticism. There will be some who find it a tricky painting to enjoy, perhaps seeing it is a biscuit tin cliche, but Brown disagreed. </p> <p>\u201cYes of course it has a universal currency in that it has been so widely reproduced,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is an extraordinarily masterful piece of painting \u2026 the brushwork is superb, the way the mist parts round the beast, the dew on the antlers, the realisation of fur, the way the heather sparkles in the morning light. </p> <p>\u201cThere is an incredible sense of command and destiny there and it is those qualities that lift it out of the ordinary and make it so beloved.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, the painting divides people. Landseer was undoubtedly celebrating the stag\u2019s splendour but he was also seeking to raise sporting subjects to high art. The overfed animal is a quarry and presumably one the artist, a keen hunter, would have wanted as a trophy.</p> <p>Does Landseer\u2019s celebration of sport in the Highlands ignore the displacement of working families in the 19th century to make way for vast sporting estates?</p> <p>The Monarch of the Glen belongs to a group of grandiose deer paintings Landseer created in the 1840s. Others include <a href=\"https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/403195/the-sanctuary\">The Sanctuary, in the Royal Collection, </a>and The Challenge, owned by the Duke of Northumberland.<br></p> <p>Though Diageo is selling its Landseer, it has donated another famous painting to the National War Museum for long-term loan \u2013 Robert Gibb\u2019s The Thin Red Line, <a href=\"http://www.military-history.org/regiment-profiles/the-93rd-highlanders-and-the-thin-red-line.htm\">depicting the 93rd Highlanders halting a Russian cavalry charge during the Crimean war</a>.</p> <p>Gordon Rintoul, director of National Museums Scotland, said he was \u201cdelighted\u201d that Diageo was donating The Thin Red Line, which \u201cis one of the best known of all Scottish historical paintings and is the classic representation of military heroism as an icon of Scotland\u201d.<br></p>",

It is Paiute land.</p> <p>From the beginning, we at Standing Rock gathered in a spirit of prayer and non-violent resistance to the destruction of our homeland and culture. We came together with our ceremonies, songs and drums. Weapons are not allowed into our camps. The Bundys\u2019 occupation began with threats and guns.

He also said the law required the protection of health to come above the costs of measures: \u201cI reject any suggestion that the state can have any regard to cost.\u201d</p> <p>The government said it would not appeal against the decision and agreed in court to discuss with ClientEarth a new timetable for more realistic pollution modelling and the steps needed to bring pollution levels down to legal levels. The parties will return to court in a week but if agreement cannot be reached, the judge could impose a timetable upon the government.</p> <p>At prime minister\u2019s questions, May said: \u201cWe now recognise that Defra [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] has to look at the judgment made by the courts and we now have to look again at the proposals we will bring forward. Nobody in this house doubts the importance of the issue of air quality.\u201d</p> <p>The government\u2019s own estimates show air pollution causes at least \u00a327.5bn a year and in April MPs called the issue a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/27/uk-air-pollution-public-health-emergency-crisis-diesel-cars\">public health emergency</a>\u201d.</p> <p>ClientEarth lawyers said they looked forward to working with Defra ministers to make a genuine attempt to rapidly cut pollution to legal limits throughout the UK, including a national network of clean air zones by 2018. \u201cThe government will have to be tougher on diesel,\u201d said James Thornton, CEO of ClientEarth. \u201cIf you put in clean air zones, it works overnight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s ruling lays the blame at the door of the government for its complacency in failing to tackle the problem quickly and credibly,\u201d said the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/02/make-central-london-diesel-free-to-solve-air-pollution-crisis-report\">who took part in the case</a>. \u201cIn so doing they have let down millions of people the length and breadth of the country.\u201d Khan aims to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/05/sadiq-khan-unveils-plans-for-extra-charge-on-londons-most-polluting-cars\">pollution charging in place in central London by 2017</a> and across the area within the north and south circular roads by 2019.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3be9f287f56f763bb34b1588d07f7148f8d380db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3be9f287f56f763bb34b1588d07f7148f8d380db/0_77_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The government said it would not appeal against the decision and agreed in court to discuss with ClientEarth a new timetable for more realistic pollution modelling and the steps needed to bring pollution levels down to legal levels.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The government said it would not appeal against the decision and agreed in court to discuss with ClientEarth a new timetable for more realistic pollution modelling and the steps needed to bring pollution levels down to legal levels.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Toscano/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>ClientEarth defeated the government on the same issue at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/29/supreme-court-orders-uk-to-draw-up-air-pollution-cleanup-plan\">supreme court in April 2015</a>.

The UK\u2019s duty to cut illegal air pollution as quickly as possible derives from EU laws but the action required following the high court defeat will be taken well before Brexit takes place. The government has said it will transfer all EU rules into UK law but, post-Brexit, the government could revise air pollution legislation.</p> <p>The court defeat is also a blow for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/heathrow-airport-expansion-gets-government-approval-gatwick\">new runway at Heathrow the government has backed</a>. Its approval depended on the effectiveness of the government\u2019s national air pollution plan to meet legal requirements on air quality. The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, said: \u201cThis ruling deals a huge blow to May\u2019s reckless Heathrow expansion plans. The government has already illegally delayed meeting EU pollution limits until 2025 - building a third runway would make the situation even worse.\u201d</p> <p>Documents revealed during the high court case showed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/18/treasury-blocked-moves-to-charge-diesel-cars-to-enter-polluted-uk-cities\">Treasury had blocked initial government plans to charge polluting diesel vehicles</a> for entering towns and cities blighted by air pollution, due to concern about the political impact of angering motorists.</p> <p>Both the environment and transport departments recommended changes to vehicle excise duty rates to encourage the purchase of low-pollution vehicles. But the Treasury also rejected that idea, along with a scrappage scheme for older diesels, which ClientEarth supports.</p> <p>The government\u2019s draft plan had envisaged 16 clean air zones, but in the final plan the number was cut, on the grounds of costs to business, to just five outside London: Birmingham, Leeds, Nottingham, Derby and Southampton. The further cities and towns that now need to introduce clean air zones will be determined by the more realistic pollution modelling ordered by the court on Wednesday.</p> <p>Keith Taylor, Green party MEP, said: \u201cThe failure highlighted by the judge today is as much moral as it is legal: ministers have displayed an extremely concerning attitude of indifference towards their duty to safeguard the health of British citizens.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1QM6MaJVCX8zTeHR8aO9o-3HVpjfijuKGfkjCOEFKWiE\" data-alt=\"NO2 exceedance\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1QM6MaJVCX8zTeHR8aO9o-3HVpjfijuKGfkjCOEFKWiE\">NO2 exceedance</a> </figure>",
  "<p>Sometimes I\u2019d walk into the lab and the guys \u2013 although they were nice \u2013 just seemed to stop talking,\u201d says Rosa Fox, 26, of her time at university studying music infomatics at the University of Sussex. She only gained confidence in her abilities when, having gone into a non-tech role after university, she started going to events like the Ladies Who Code conference. Now she\u2019s a back-end developer on the gov.uk website and runs events herself, including Coding for Girls and the Music Makers workshop at this year\u2019s Brighton Digital festival.<br></p> <p>Her experience isn\u2019t uncommon. Women make up just 14.4% of all employees in the UK\u2019s Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) workforce. Why? </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s well known that girls often outshine boys at school academically, but this seems to change when it comes to science and tech-related subjects,\u201d says Ella Roche, board member at Develop HER, an organisation dedicated to supporting women in tech. </p> <p>\u201cA key reason is that girls often lack the confidence to pursue a subject that is dominated by boys. When you leave school, this lack of confidence doesn\u2019t simply disappear \u2013 it is strengthened, when they join a society that reinforces certain stereotypes. </p> <p>\u201cBut a team that is filled with diverse people can only be beneficial. A diverse workforce, not only in terms of gender but also different backgrounds and skills, brings fresh ideas. We truly believe women contribute a different perspective that can challenge the status quo.\u201d</p> <p>So there\u2019s a huge amount going on to show girls and women of all ages that they\u2019re welcome in tech. Develop HER runs breakfasts, networking events and panels, while Stemettes organises female-only panels and \u201ccodeathons\u201d for school-age girls and students.</p> <p>\u201cThat safe space is a lot less intimidating,\u201d says Stemettes founder Anne-Marie Imafidon, who was herself one of only three women studying maths and computer science at Oxford University.</p> <p>\u201cWe eat Haribos, we play Justin Bieber, and we have fun. I want girls to feel as comfortable as possible. It\u2019s enjoyable and relaxed and we do it under the guidance of female coders. We\u2019re in a nice environment, not a dark basement. It gives female coders the chance to experience what it is to build a mobile app or a website, to create something using some kind of Stem knowledge.\u201d</p> <p>Employers are also keen to open up opportunities for women who want a career change, or a return to the workplace. Sky\u2019s first ever women-only training course earlier this year, Get into Tech, had more than 300 applications for 16 positions. \u201cFrom our first courses, 17 women have applied for roles within Sky, and we expect at least 11 hires to go on to our Software Academy scheme, or apply for apprenticeships,\u201d says Anna Cook, director of Women in Leadership at Sky. \u201cThere\u2019s a real appetite for it.\u201d</p> <p>She adds: \u201cWe teach about the tech but we also teach confidence. The course is basically a kind of starter kit to give our participants the foundations of coding. It\u2019s a very supportive environment and they form really strong relationships with each other. There\u2019s a huge population of returners to work out there, and a real appetite for learning.\u201d</p> <p>So the message is: come on in \u2013 tech is the future, and women are needed. \u201cOnce you make the initial contact, you\u2019ll find out that these are incredibly welcoming spaces,\u201d says Fox. \u201cHackathons and codeathons are very supportive, collaborative environments.\u201d </p> <p>Imafidon agrees: \u201cReach out to networks like ours. It\u2019s free! Ask questions, seek advice and attend events with other people. That\u2019s one of the easiest ways to learn about what your options are and how you get on to that apprenticeship or challenge those roles. Get on Google, get on Twitter and be a part of that conversation. Come and join the party.\u201d</p> <h2>Emi Mitchell, creative engineer: \u2018I\u2019m doing what I love\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18fabaf0b2f7b6d6c74f7e40cb29a7d20209ab06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18fabaf0b2f7b6d6c74f7e40cb29a7d20209ab06/422_1079_2856_3765/759.jpg\" alt=\"Woman in front of wall-based machine.\" width=\"759\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rube Goldberg variations: Emi Mitchell with her \u2018physical digital\u2019 work for the V&amp;A.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Emi Mitchell, 24, loved art and design at school, and loved playing video games at home. \u201cOne day, I just thought: why can\u2019t I make video games? That would be a really cool career.\u201d It was the first step along a pathway that\u2019s led to her current role at digital and physical technology design studio Knit, designing bespoke creative technology for clients such as the V&amp;A.</p> <p>Looking for a place where technology and creativity intersect, she took a BSc (Hons) in creative computing at Goldsmiths, University of London. \u201cI thought it would be a lot more artistic but it was actually quite programming-based, which was really alarming to start with, as I had absolutely no coding experience before the degree. But that ended up being absolutely perfect for me \u2013 and after a bit of a learning curve, I was making things I never thought I would be able to make. My final degree project was a game where the player wears an EEG headset that feeds brainwave data into the game in real time.\u201d</p> <p>After her degree, she spent a few months creating an online portfolio. \u201cI designed my own little games and spent a bit of time in education, going into schools and helping IT teachers teach kids how to code using Scratch.\u201d</p> <p>Her first job was as head of creative engineering for education startup Erly Stage Studios, creating hardware prototypes and web applications. \u201cA friend of a friend knew the CEO, so that was a word-of-mouth thing. I then did part of a master\u2019s degree at UCL in computer graphics and imaging. It was different to Goldsmiths and not really related to physical computing at all \u2013 lots of hardcore graphics programming with elements of medical imaging and virtual reality.\u201d</p> <p>In April 2016 she joined Knit, doing, as she says, \u201cpretty much everything that I love doing, which is awesome. I get to do software and hardware engineering and I\u2019m developing cutting-edge tech all the time. I mostly do research and development. Recently I\u2019ve built virtual reality apps for 360-degree viewing. I\u2019ve also been working on a project for the V&amp;A \u2013 a physical digital version of a thing called a Rube Goldberg machine. It\u2019s a machine where one thing triggers another thing, which triggers another \u2013 a whole series of interactions.\u201d</p> <p>Mitchell is planning to stay at Knit and continue working on bespoke projects. \u201cTech can seem like a daunting industry, especially if you haven\u2019t studied anything similar at school. But once you put your head into that world, you\u2019ll find it\u2019s very inclusive. So go to hackathons \u2013 they\u2019re really nurturing places \u2013 and create and learn any way you can.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s a subtle point, easily missed.

They have made it clear that her relationship with Harry is scandalous, for a number of reasons: she is divorced; she is older (Markle is 35, Harry 32); she\u2019s played raunchy scenes in the US TV series Suits \u2013 and her mother is visibly black, with dreadlocks.</p> <p>These details would be unremarkable \u2013 irrelevant, inappropriate, even \u2013 were it any other celebrity romance. But Prince Harry, fifth in line to the British throne, is a different matter. The very concept of the royal family is the antithesis of diversity. The terminology says it all: \u201cblue blood\u201d, from the Spanish <em>sagre azul</em>, coined in the late 1500s to distinguish between the racially superior white Christian nobility (with pale skin revealing blue veins) and the Jews, Muslims and West Africans whom Europeans were increasingly ousting from their continent.</p> <p>In spite of its roots, we are apparently still perfectly comfortable using the phrase, even though royal blood has probably been mixed for centuries. There have been Africans throughout Europe since at least Roman times, and marriages between European royals, with their fondness for black servants, slaves and extramarital reproduction, make it unsurprising that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/12/race-monarchy\">Queen Charlotte</a>, wife of George III \u2013 described, in an era when slaves were omnipresent, as \u201cugly\u201d, with a dark complexion and flared nostrils \u2013 may well have had some African heritage. So might Queen Philippa, wife of Edward III, described as having broad nostrils and a wide mouth, and as being \u201cbrown of skin all over\u201d.</p> <p>We are as unwilling to embrace the ethnic heritage of the royal family as we are to investigate their centuries-old links with the slave trade. When asked about Queen Charlotte\u2019s origins a few years ago, the royal historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/12/race-monarchy\">Hugo Vickers assured Brits</a> that even if African blood had penetrated the royal bloodline \u201cthere would be no shame attached to it\u201d and \u201cit certainly wouldn\u2019t show that they are significantly black\u201d.

  "<p>The amount of electricity generated from UK coal power stations is on track to fall by two-thirds this year, a decline which analysts said was so steep and fast it was unprecedented globally.</p> <p>Climate change thinktank Sandbag said the drop was due to a doubling in the price of a carbon tax and the lower price of gas.

Everyone\u2019s talking about what they can do to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, people talk a few percentage points here or there, but 66% is completely unprecedented in any country ever.\u201d</p> <p>Jones said the price of a tonne of carbon doubling from \u00a39 to \u00a318 in 2015 under the carbon floor price scheme was the driving force making coal plants uneconomic.

  "<p>The world\u2019s indigenous communities need to be given a bigger role in climate stabilisation, according to a new study that shows at least a quarter of forest carbon is stored on communal land, particularly in Brazil.</p> <p>The research by a group of academic institutions and environmental NGOs is the most comprehensive effort yet to quantify the contribution of traditional forest guardians to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. </p> <p>Authors say the expansion of tribal land rights is the most cost-effective way to protect forests and sequester carbon \u2013 an issue that they hope will receive more prominence at the upcoming United Nations climate conference in Marrakech.</p> <p>The paper by the Rights and Resources Initiative, Woods Hole Research Centre and World Resources Institute aims to encourage governments to recognise indigenous land rights and include tribal input in national action plans. Currently this is not the case for 167 of 188 nations in the Paris agreement, including Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which are home to some of the world\u2019s biggest forests.</p> <p>It is also likely to feed into a growing debate in Brazil, which has won kudos for recognising more indigenous land than any other country in the past decade but is now under a new government that has yet to be tested in international climate talks.</p> <p>Based on satellite surveys of 37 tropical countries, the study estimates community-claimed lands sequester at least 54,546m tonnes of carbon \u2013 roughly four times the world\u2019s annual emissions.</p> <p>Ownership of a 10th of that land is public, unrecognised or contested, which raises the risk that it could fall into the hands of developers, farmers, miners or others who want to clear the forest for short-term financial gain at the expense of long-term environmental costs. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71e6bc7bfad9e80d44b3021441189128c9652799\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71e6bc7bfad9e80d44b3021441189128c9652799/0_122_3597_2159/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rainforest is cleared for agriculture in Amazonas state, Brazil\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rainforest is cleared for agriculture in Amazonas state, Brazil.

It\u2019s what economists call an optimal solution. Everyone wins,\u201d he said. \u201cBy contrast, large-scale development initiatives produce quick wins, but the long-term environmental, economic and political costs are not taken into account. They are just pushed on to future generations.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs well as reducing 20-30% of carbon dioxide emissions, the forests provide benefits of clean water, pollination, biodiversity, flood control and tourist attractions that are said to be worth $523bn to $1.165tn in Brazil, $54-119 bn in Bolivia, and $123\u2013277bn in Colombia over the next 20 years.</p> <p>The data shows the most important region is Latin America, where 58% of emissions come from deforestation, more than double the global rate of 24%. Without protection, much more could yet be released. Five of the top 10 countries for forest carbon are in the continent. Brazil with 14,692 megatonnes has twice the amount of the next biggest country, Indonesia. </p> <p>Having expanded indigenous land considerably since 2003, Brazil \u2013 and later Bolivia and Colombia \u2013 initially slowed deforestation. The World Research Institute estimates that tropical forests without such protection were two to three times more likely to be cleared. </p> <p>But in recent years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/27/amazon-deforestation-report-brazil-paris-climate-talks\">forest destruction in Brazil has started to creep up again</a> and many environmentalists are worried that the new centre-right government of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/michel-temer\">Michel Temer</a> could accelerate this trend. </p> <p>Since the impeachment of former president Dilma Rousseff in September, the new government has cut the budget for the National Indian Agency (better known by its acronym Funai), and removed many of its key personnel. </p> <p>\u201cThere are causes for concern,\u201c said Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, UN special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples. She urged Brazil not to backtrack. \u201cAs this report shows, if Brazil enhances its respect for indigenous peoples\u2019 rights, they will be able to contribute more to the Paris agreement.

  "<p>We have always looked to people who we regard as larger-than-life for guidance on how to live \u2013 that is a truth as old as time.

Maybe it\u2019s also time for us to destigmatize pop culture news.</p> <p>Tracking the shift in celebrity narratives about pregnancy in People magazine over a 40-year-period, alongside shifts in family norms, Dr Hanna Grol-Prokopczyk, an assistant professor of sociology, found: \u201cThe early model dictated that you should marry by the time the baby is born. By the mid-2000s that had changed, and it became widely acceptable in the celebrity world to have a child without marrying first.\u201d<br></p> <p>And thank goodness for that: according to the most recent numbers published by the CDC, 40.2% of children in the US are now born to unmarried mothers, with higher rates among women who are not white. While this represents a slight decline since the peak in 2007, it\u2019s impossible to ignore that for many communities, having kids outside of marriage is the reality for a majority of people. Celebrities: they really are just like us.</p> <p>Some research <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/08/children-with-married-parents-are-better-off-but-marriage-isnt-the-reason-why/\">shows</a> that kids who grow up with married parents experience certain benefits, particularly economic ones. <a href=\"http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/8/single-mothers-need-solutions-not-shaming.html\">But stigmatizing unmarried mothers doesn\u2019t help anyone</a> \u2013 though there\u2019s plenty of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalene_Laundries_in_Ireland\">historical evidence of the opposite</a>. </p> <p>And if celebrities\u2019 freedom to choose how they build their families leads to greater acceptance of a wider range of family structures for the rest of us, it can only lead to better, more accepting communities and a more positive environment for children from all kinds of families to grow up in.</p> <p>Decrying popular media consumption as evidence of the wider demise of culture has long been a beloved tradition of the self-righteously serious. And there\u2019s no doubt that some portrayal of celebrity living can have a less positive impact on folks who are keen consumers of magazines like People: <a href=\"https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/media-body-image-and-eating-disorders\">there\u2019s some correlation between media consumption and body image issues, for example</a>. And it would have been good if no one had ever read a magazine that advocated that they wear jeggings.</p> <p>But magazines like People are an important part of the fabric of our culture that also includes the New York Times and Foreign Affairs. No one is forced to consume popular media. But millions choose to look at People\u2019s website every month \u2013 not to mention its continually huge newsstand circulation. </p> <p>Many of us are always going to be interested in learning what celebrities are up to. There\u2019s nothing wrong with criticizing certain kinds of media for covering news that lacks seriousness. But alongside this criticism, we must acknowledge their value: in telling the contemporary versions of stories we\u2019ve been sharing with each other since the beginning of time, People and other pop culture outlets can use their presence in our lives to make the world a slightly kinder place.</p>",

Aurora says this kind of education has been missing in Silicon Valley, which is famous not only for its hi-tech products but for the low numbers of women and minorities involved in making them. Major tech firms have started publishing their diversity data over the last two years, which has only served to confirm that the industry\u2019s employees are still overwhelmingly white and male. Women are twice as likely as men to drop out mid-career, often complaining of hostile work environments which are biased against their gender.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Aurora sees Silicon Valley\u2019s most prominent efforts to increase diversity as backwards. Encouraging women to give the industry a try and exhortations to \u201cLean In\u201d \u2013 a motto and accompanying book by Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg \u2013 wrongly puts the onus on those who are marginalized to change their own behavior, she believes. </p> <p>Instead, her \u201cally skills\u201d training asks those with the privilege to change theirs. Protected by that privilege, as well as generally having more power and influence, they can speak up and are in a better position to take the heat. \u201cIt is the exact opposite of Lean In,\u201d says Aurora. \u201cEverything has been framed in terms of \u2018what can women do to overturn sexism\u2019. I have reframed it as \u2018what can men do to stop sexism, because it is their responsibility\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>It is easier for allies to act, she says, because they don\u2019t experience the same repercussions as members of a marginalized group when they speak up.

It is very difficult to prove that diversity programs of any sort work, he says, but trying to recruit allies makes sense. \u201cIt is a great intuition that you want to get people to think of themselves as on your side,\u201d he says.

  "<p>When Dublin launched its first bike-share scheme in 2009, sceptics said every last pair of wheels would end up stolen or floating in the river Liffey.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Instead, <a href=\"http://www.dublinbikes.ie/\">Dublinbikes</a> was embraced with such fervor that subscriptions immediately surpassed expectations, usage rates topped international rankings and the no-nonsense bikes \u2013 three gears with a basket on the front - became a fixture in the Irish capital, whizzing alongside traffic in the congested core. </p> <p>Today, the scheme is hailed as one the of most successful in the world. There\u2019s just one problem: it\u2019s losing money. </p> <p>Initially funded through an advertising deal with billboards giant JCDecaux, the scheme broke even for a number of years before running a deficit in 2015. This shortfall, together with a public row over billboards associated with the programme, has halted expansion plans while organisers seek new ways to cover basic operating costs. </p> <p>This is proving difficult. JCDecaux \u2013 the firm behind Paris\u2019s V\u00e9lib\u2019 bike-share scheme \u2013 funded all set-up costs for Dublinbikes in exchange for the right to advertising space on city land. The scheme has since tripled in size to 1,500 bikes and 101 stations. That\u2019s tiny compared to London\u2019s scheme of 11,500 bikes or Paris\u2019s fleet of 23,600 bikes, but enough to push costs beyond what\u2019s brought in through subscriptions and sponsorships, leaving a \u20ac376,000 shortfall that Dublin council says it cannot afford.</p> <p>\u201cOther bike schemes get major support from the government but with Dublinbikes we kind of have to run it ourselves,\u201d said project manager, Michael Rossiter. \u201cSo if people want the scheme to grow to its full extent, hard decisions have to be made about priorities.\u201d</p> <p>Organisers are wary of the tradeoffs involved with squeezing more money from existing revenue streams. For instance, annual subscription fees have already doubled to \u20ac20 since the scheme\u2019s launch or \u20ac5 for a three-day pass, compared to the London scheme\u2019s \u00a390 annual fee. If they are raised much more, they could become too expensive for residents on lower incomes, Rossiter said. And while an increase might help the existing programme break even again, it wouldn\u2019t meet the ongoing costs of expanding and managing a larger scheme, he said.</p> <p>Indeed, organisers hold ambitious plans to expand the network to 5,000 bikes and 300 stations across the city within 10 years. </p> <p> \u201cAn expansion like that would cost \u20ac10m a year just to run,\u201d Rossiter said. \u201cThe costs would get bigger and bigger and membership will never grow to the extent that it covers that amount.\u201d</p> <p>A major extension of Dublinbikes into a new university campus in the northside suburb of Grangegorman - which had received capital funding from Ireland\u2019s National Transport Authority \u2013 was already shelved this year due to the funding crisis.</p> <p>Though Dublinbikes could seek a new sponsorship arrangement with Coca-Cola - worth \u20ac 300,000 a year under a deal that expires in 2017 - it is the advertising-funded model that has the greatest potential to end the scheme\u2019s funding woes, Rossiter said. </p> <p>But there are signs the public\u2019s enthusiasm for the ads may be fading. Recent plans to install billboards connected to the scheme were rebuffed by both local residents and by heritage charity An Taisce. The charity said the ads would be \u201cvisually obtrusive, out of character with and seriously damaging to the city\u2019s environment.\u201d</p> <p> \u201cPsychologically I think the key point both the city and users have to address is that this is a form of public transport,\u201d said Kevin Mayne, director of development at the European Cycling Federation. \u201cIf you accept advertising on bus and railway stations, then you need to accept it as part of bike share too.\u201d</p> <p>While ad deals have been crucial to the genesis of bike-share schemes in major cities, not everyone believes they must also be part of their future. Increasing parking charges, folding schemes into public transportation budgets and raising subscription fees while offering discounts to lower-income residents are all viable alternatives, said Eric Britton, a sustainable development consultant based in Paris.</p> <p>\u201cThere will always be people who don\u2019t like ads and I agree with them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think there are a whole plethora of ways to pay for this out there.\u201d</p> <p>What ends up holding many schemes back, Britton says, is a failure to look beyond \u201ctraditional accounting\u201d to the contribution public bikes make to major cities.</p> <p> \u201cPeople who are taking public bicycles, some of them are not taking taxis, some are not taking buses, some are not driving alone in their car,\u201d he said. \u201cDo the numbers and you will figure out the saving in terms of repair and maintenance on the road system, in terms of accidents, obesity. </p> <p>\u201cIf you run the numbers and it turns out it\u2019s all a complete loss, a terrible waste of public money, then ok. But to begrudge them a couple of million euros in public funds before having those numbers, is socially and environmentally irresponsible.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Every winter, it seems, we see pictures in the press and on TV of St Mark\u2019s Square looking like a lake. People wading through thigh-high water. Boats bobbing outside the famous cafes.

In 2014, the Nuova Venezia newspaper published photos that showed that the steel flaps had already suffered more corrosion than the builders had anticipated. In August this year, a test-run of the floodgates was a fiasco. But let\u2019s assume that, eventually, Mose will work as intended. Will it be Venice\u2019s salvation? To answer that question, we need to look at why the water spills into the city\u2019s streets so often.</p> <p>The acqua alta, as the seasonal flooding is known, is caused by a combination of high tides, fluctuations in atmospheric pressure and southeasterly winds. It\u2019s always been a feature of Venetian life. But the frequency and severity of flooding has increased markedly since the middle of the 20th century. Between 2000 and 2013 there were eight highest-category floods recorded \u2013 more than in the preceding 50 years. This phenomenon is not explained by subsidence or any rise in sea level. It\u2019s the result of changes in the way the lagoon has been managed.</p> <p>One factor has been the reclamation of large areas of land, for Marco Polo airport and the industrial sites of Marghera, and in central Venice itself \u2013 notably around the docks and the Tronchetto car parks. The marshes and mudflats of the lagoon play a crucial role in dissipating the energy of the incoming water, so their reduction has led to an increase in the destructiveness of the tides. Even worse has been the impact of shipping. When the refineries and factories of Marghera were developed in the interwar years, deep channels were carved out of the lagoon bed to allow tankers to get into the port. The result: too much sea water gets into the lagoon, and it\u2019s moving too quickly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7982fe1571756a570e3b4c9c1c8bfaca08a71ed5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7982fe1571756a570e3b4c9c1c8bfaca08a71ed5/0_119_2098_1259/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cruise ship makes its way through the Canale Della Giudecca during the 65th Venice Film Festival in 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cruise ship makes its way through the Canale Della Giudecca during the 65th Venice Film Festival in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All over the city, foundations are being scoured out by the quick-flowing tides.

They\u2019ll last for centuries as long as they stay underwater, but now the water level sometimes drops so far that air gets at the pilings, causing them to rot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2016/sep/27/dont-look-now-venice-tourists-locals-sick-of-you-cruise-liners\">Don\u2019t look now, Venice tourists \u2013 the locals are sick of you</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And there\u2019s another source of erosion.

Depressingly, Luigi Brugnaro, the businessman who became Venice\u2019s mayor in June 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/15/venice-mayoral-poll-cruise-ships-luigi-brugnaro\" title=\"\">does not see much of a problem here</a>. He\u2019s in favour of a scheme that will divert the mega-cruisers to the docks via the southern lagoon. This would entail large-scale redredging that critics say will damage the ecosystem even more than the cruise ships do at the moment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02bc7573e266a3a522159d48bb1a83e33e9010fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02bc7573e266a3a522159d48bb1a83e33e9010fc/0_33_3997_2398/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A demonstration against the negative environmental impact of cruise ships in January 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A demonstration against the negative environmental impact of cruise ships in January 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So it seems that the mega-cruisers will continue to bring in tens of thousands of people who spend very little time \u2013 or cash \u2013 in the city itself. Which brings us to the other issue that\u2019s giving rise to increasingly vehement protests in Venice: mass tourism. The population of central Venice and the lagoon islands has now dropped below 55,000. The number of visitors, annually, is approaching 7 million. Around half of those don\u2019t even stay for one night, and thus contribute almost nothing to the local economy.</p> <p>Venice\u2019s financial situation is dire: the town hall has a shortfall of tens of millions of euros in its operating budget, and its debts exceed \u20ac400m. In effect, the place is bankrupt. And with nearly all of Venice\u2019s special funding for maintenance of the historic centre having been diverted into the money pit of the flood barrier, much of the city\u2019s fabric is in need of urgent repair.</p> <p>That said, the churches and palazzi should continue to stand for many more decades. Long before the water overwhelms Venice, however, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/31/tunnel-death-venice-city-tourist\" title=\"\">it could die of tourism</a>. As short-stay rentals push the cost of living in Venice higher with every passing year, the native population is being driven out. Venice is becoming a ghost-city, a high-culture holiday resort. It\u2019s in that sense that it\u2019s really sinking \u2013 and fast.</p>",

  "<p>Just in time for Halloween the news has broken that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/27/scientists-discover-first-fossilised-dinosaur-brain-tissue\">fossil dinosaur brain</a> (well, part of one) has been discovered in the UK. This is a truly remarkable find but in some ways not as exceptional as you might think. Certainly the fossil record is dominated by hard parts of animals (bones, teeth, shells, etc.) but the soft tissues (skin, muscles, and all manner of internal organs) do turn up from time to time and in quite a variety of different guises.</p> <p>Such finds are incredibly important to palaeontology as inevitably there is a limit to what information can be extracted from bones alone. This can actually include plenty of information about soft tissues since there are some inevitable correlates at play \u2013 the eyeballs have to sit in the orbits, the brain inside the skull and so on. (As an aside many vertebrates have what is essentially a second mini-skull inside the head the encloses the brain so for example we know quite a bit about the size and shape of dinosaur brains from these). Bones also have scars on them where the tendons attached to hold muscles in place giving an idea of their size and how they operated the joints. <br></p> <p>To go into greater detail though we really need some direct evidence of soft tissues and thus discoveries like the brain are therefore extremely informative. Some animals of course are made up of little more than soft tissues (there\u2019s not too much that is very tough about the average jellyfish or octopus) so it\u2019s not just about filling in details like the feathers on a fossil bird but can relate to entire organisms. We know that some groups are extremely ancient but have left almost no fossil record behind making it hard to say much about their origins or evolution.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"add25e690f85051d63ec1a3449f9274ea5a9967c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/add25e690f85051d63ec1a3449f9274ea5a9967c/110_310_4053_2432/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pair of rare fossil jellyfish from the Jurassic of Germany\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pair of rare fossil jellyfish from the Jurassic of Germany</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Hone</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ultimately it all comes down to the decay of tissues. The reason that bones, teeth and shells (and for that matter wood) are common as fossils is that they decay only very slowly. Carnivores and scavengers don\u2019t tend to eat bones (and if they do, the bones might still survive the process) and bacteria don\u2019t break them down effectively. As a result, they can hang around for decades or centuries and have greater opportunities to be buried and potentially turn into a fossil. Soft tissues tend instead to be eaten so would need to be buried soon after the animal died in order to have a chance to be fossilised (and even here the bacteria or fungi may get to them). A more effective method of preservation though is to be in an environment where decay does not tend to occur.</p> <p>This can happen in a number of different ways, but ultimately it comes down to slowing or stopping the breakdown of the organic material. Very dry environments like deserts can lead to a form of mummification where the moisture is sucked out and nothing can digest the dehydrated remains. These animals can end up rather shrunken (like mummified humans from the deserts of South America) but it means plenty of soft tissues can survive and be preserved, especially if the skin was still present to hold them intact. There are even a few dinosaur mummies like this where muscles and even internal organs are preserved, though it\u2019s rather hard to get to them without damaging the outer layers and CT scanners big enough to take a whole dinosaur are few and far between.</p> <p>Rather more common are those that are in water but in conditions where bacteria are limited because of the water chemistry or lack of oxygen. Peat bogs are a favourite here though most things preserved in them are, although ancient, not fossils. This may however be the origin of the dinosaur brain \u2013 effectively pickled in the acidic peat waters and then later fossilised. Similarly, animals like mammoths frozen in the permafrost of Siberia are not actually fossils but the lack of decay means they preserve animals right down to their last meals still in their stomachs. Anoxic (oxygen free) waters can also be good for this and many of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/lost-worlds/2015/apr/29/bird-yi-qi-the-dinosaur-evolution-flight-feather-nature\">spectacular feathered dinosaurs finds</a> are from these kinds of conditions where the presence of fine volcanic ash in the waters also helped bury bodies quickly and with great fidelity producing some incredible finds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2da35a3de4aaf578864eb274e750ab162fea928e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2da35a3de4aaf578864eb274e750ab162fea928e/0_0_2750_2564/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A specimen of the non-avian dinosaur Anchiornis with the feathers preserved as black stains on the rock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"932\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A specimen of the non-avian dinosaur <em>Anchiornis </em>with the feathers preserved as black stains on the rock</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: University of Bristol/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finally, some things can be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/12/how-did-the-velvet-worm-cross-the-world-the-answer-lies-in-amber\">preserved in amber</a>. Glued into tree sap that then fossilised, there\u2019s no possibility of decay and whole animals (even quite large things like lizards) and even spider silk can last tens of millions of years like this.</p> <p>Even without these forms of preservation, soft tissues can still sneak into the fossil record as impressions. Footprints will often be clear enough to show the pattern of soles of animals\u2019 feet, including the sizes and shapes of any scales or pads. Things like feathers or the membranous wings of pterosaurs may decay, but not before they have left an impression of where they were. Some of these can be very detailed (the feathers on <em>Archaeopteryx</em> for example are actually mostly impressions and not fossilised feathers) and provide a great deal of information.</p> <p>Despite all these routes to preservation, the fossil record (and more recent things like ice mummies) remain rare for extinct animals. However, they are not vanishingly rare as many might think, and in particular some areas are producing huge numbers of preserved animals with various soft tissues intact. These might not always be in the best condition and examining or interpreting them may be difficult, but even a patch of skin or a bit of a brain has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/10/ancient-pigments-reveal-evolutionary-history-of-our-eyes\">enormous potential</a>. Plenty of contentious areas have been resolved from such finds as well as opening up new areas of research (like<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/lost-worlds/2013/jun/25/dinosaurs-fossils\"> the colours of extinct animals</a>) and they promise much for the future and so the excitement around even partial finds.</p>",

He points out that FrieslandCampina does have large digesters, but also says that what\u2019s attractive about the small digesters is that they help reduce transport costs. \u201cWith larger ones, you need to transport manure, causing more traffic and energy use,\u201d he adds. \u201cSmart technology on farms is a better solution.\u201d</p> <p>Out in the fields, the Heegs are optimistic.

Take heart: this is far less complex than it sounds as, in reality, there is only one type of dysfunctional organisation \u2013 all the others are mutations of the same virus.</p> <h2>The diagnosis</h2> <p>On visiting a prospective employer, I now look for small details that are likely to be symptoms of a toxic working environment. The greater the number of symptoms, the more likely my diagnosis is accurate. </p> <p>Start with a school\u2019s website, building, playground, lobby and correspondence. They can tell you a lot about how it functions \u2013 after all, these features constitute the public face of the institution and, if you are planning to look at that face on a daily basis, it should be well scrutinised. </p> <p>Look for signs of twitching, uncontrollable gurning or the blank, thousand-yard stare of corporate culture. If the overall impression is chaotic or cold, it is likely this is how you will feel working there.</p> <p>Standing outside a playground and analysing the type of noise generated by it can also be useful as it can tell you about the quality of behaviour and social interaction that is acceptable in the school. If the games seem dangerous and the adults are shouting, you can draw some easy conclusions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2015/oct/23/fact-or-fiction-the-reasons-teachers-choose-the-job-and-quit\">Fact or fiction? The reasons teachers choose the job \u2013 and quit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Spending 10 minutes in the school\u2019s reception area can also provide clues as to how adults and children deal with each other once inside. It is also worth noting how adults relate to each other, especially school management. If you don\u2019t feel any warmth, pay very close attention to any other interactions you come across as you take the pre-application tour.<br></p> <p>On any walkabout, you will get good opportunities to see how \u201cthe suits\u201d deal with the school staff and pupils. On one such visit I made, it was clear that there was absolutely no rapport between the headteacher and the children \u2013 we walked and talked as the children passed by like dull weather. The only exchange initiated by the adult was a reprimand about school uniform. </p> <p>On entering a classroom with this head, the poor teacher\u2019s face adopted a look that I last saw in Evil Dead II: a spasm of horror that slumped back into ground-down despair. This told me as much as I needed to know about communication, culture and, more precisely, who the school had been set up to serve. If the sole purpose of a school is to anoint the ego of the headteacher, there is no need to inform anyone else of a walk round with a prospective employee.</p> <p>These are the schools where you will find that reduced teaching hours are a signifier of importance and increased teaching hours are a punishment. If you are ambitious and not interested in your profession, this is perfect for you.<br></p> <h2>Downton divide</h2> <p>In these non-collaborative environments, you are also likely to hear the word \u201cstaff\u201d used in a way reminiscent of Maggie Smith in Downton Abbey, and there will be an equally clear divide between upstairs and downstairs. Such a \u201ctop-down\u201d approach will ensure that any stakeholder consultation, including those undertaken with \u201cstaff\u201d, will be viewed with disdain. This cannot fail to lead to an exploitative culture. In such an environment, you are likely to end up working with those who value data over humanity. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2015/jun/04/job-hunting-tips-teachers-how-to-ace-presentation\">Job hunting tips for teachers: how to ace the presentation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is also likely that you will be treated as a Job Description whose aim is to Add Value to the business by having Structured Conversations with another Job Description. If you are really lucky and do exactly what the policies tell you to, you could fast-track your way to having no contact with children whatsoever.<br></p> <p>Unsurprisingly, these cultures are more common in larger schools and multi-academy trusts because posturing grandeur is laughable when placed on the small stage. However, the size of the organisation is only one indicator of possible dysfunction. Others to look out for are: an excess of logos, Xeroxed classroom environments, joyless or fearful pupils, a general lack of character and an abundance of personnel who conduct themselves with clipped efficiency or a corporate swagger in the Clarkson vein.

  "<p>People are surprised when I express support for Hillary Clinton. My economic politics are hard to the left and, unlike hers, explicitly socialist. But it\u2019s entirely because my analysis of inequality is economic that I endorse Clinton \u2013 not as a least-worst option, not even due to the nature of her opponent, but on her own terms as a leader pledged to the material improvement of women\u2019s economic and social reality. </p> <p>This is a structurally radical framework for broad-based American change. Yet over the course of many a bleating bro-beating on the internet, the dread realisation has landed with me that among too many men who identify themselves as on the left, notions of what constitutes social progress and radical redress of inequality are gendered concepts \u2013 with the result that Clinton\u2019s activist leadership is wilfully dismissed. </p> <p>Time magazine may have called Clinton a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://time.com/4550665/why-people-hate-the-clintons/\">\u201ccultural revolutionary\u201d</a>, but the Bernie Bros are having none of it.

The Australian writer <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://thebigsmoke.com.au/2016/08/01/phenomenon-silent-hillary-clinton-supporters/\">Jane Caro described an experience of praising Clinton</a> and being \u201cabused, sneered at, patronised (oh my God, how you will be patronised) and sent endless propaganda purporting to prove she\u2019s corrupt, a criminal, a murderer, a warmonger etc\u201d.</p> <p>I\u2019ve received this propaganda too. Clinton\u2019s critics cite unstructured blog posts about petrodollars, blame her for the US mire in the Middle East, and post links to rough-edit YouTube videos proclaiming her ownership by the banks.</p> <p>The alpha-bro outfit WikiLeaks has fuelled some<strong> </strong>old-school conspiracy theories by tweeting sly suggestions that she\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/?p=136983\">a puppet of the Rothschilds</a>.

Since the primaries exposed this behaviour, vast communities have formed of women organising secret Facebook groups so they can praise, analyse and debate concerns about the Clinton candidacy without abuse.

But there are more complex and nuanced elements here that apply to a broader western conversation about policy priorities.</p> <p>Problems of pay inequality, parental leave and access to affordable childcare exist across the western world because of the scarcity within political leadership of those who fight for women\u2019s causes beyond lip service and make actual legislative change. </p> <p>Fighting inequality in the US \u2013 and global \u2013 context has defined Clinton\u2019s political engagement for her entire career.

  "<p>\u201cJust because you\u2019re paranoid doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t after you,\u201d wrote Joseph Heller in the novel Catch 22. But it is doubtful he envisaged that algorithms used by search engines, social media platforms and websites would be after you to \u2018personalise your experience\u2019. Consequently, perhaps, personalisation and privacy have taken a new direction with the shift to messaging as the go-to communication platform.</p> <p>Search and social media platforms derive their income from advertising, so it makes sense for them to tailor what users see. Facebook\u2019s presentation at the <a href=\"https://theaisummit.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">AI Summit</a> in San Francisco explained how artificial intelligence (AI) is used to personalise the pages of each of its 1.7 billion users. </p> <p>How accurate \u2013 or intrusive \u2013 this is will be determined by our online activity. Connected devices and location data add context; Google\u2019s DoubleClick (which develops internet ad serving systems) take this further by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/21/how-to-disable-google-ad-tracking-gmail-youtube-browser-history\">combining personally identifiable information from Gmail</a> with browsing data.</p> <h2>Slaves to the algorithm</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/16/slaves-to-algorithm-machine-learning-hidden-bias\">Machine learning: why we mustn\u2019t be slaves to the algorithm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We have little or no control over the multiplicity of algorithms using our data, particularly as more devices become connected.

Tailoring content to user preferences potentially compromises online research. Search engines and ad networks are fingerprinting devices in real time, so it is impossible to know how neutral your search results are. And because search results are based on browsing history, we are less likely to see something new. Added to this is the platforms\u2019 own bias. The past few weeks have seen reports of Facebook\u2019s selective news curation and <a href=\"https://sputniknews.com/us/201609121045214398-google-clinton-manipulation-election/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google\u2019s perceived political bias</a> towards Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential candidacy.</p> <p>Josh Sutton, global head of data and AI at Publicis Sapient, believes that transparency is the key as it enables people to make a well-informed judgement call. \u201cTrust is enabled by transparency\u201d he explains. \u201cThere has been an implicit bias in our communications since the invention of the printing press, and we accepted this because we could assess the people who were creating and curating content. I believe that a similar opportunity must be provided in the age of machine learning by enabling people to understand the sources of the algorithms and the training data that powers them.\u201d</p> <p>But we cannot blame the personalisation phenomenon entirely on algorithms. It is also a conscious choice. As social media has matured \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/10/twitters-woes-signal-end-social-wars/?mbid=nl_101116_p2&amp;CNDID=43693487\" rel=\"nofollow\">and perhaps peaked</a> \u2013 we have become adept at blocking what we don\u2019t want to see \u2013 or don\u2019t agree with. Elections and referendums have seen social media users divide into tribes rather than engage in political debate.</p> <h2>A new kind of privacy</h2> <p>While voice is the obvious interface for human-machine conversation, with chatbots on many websites and virtual assistants on multiple devices \u2013 human-to-human conversation has shifted to messaging platforms. Snapchat, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger etc allow us to have rapid, private interactions with selected parties. </p> <p>This is a new kind of privacy because we don\u2019t know the extent to which the platform can read or understand our messages.

This has not been lost on investors \u2013 or advertisers. eMarketer forecasts that Snapchat will generate $367m (\u00a3300m) in advertising revenue this year, <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Snapchat-Ad-Revenues-Reach-Nearly-1-Billion-Next-Year/1014437\" rel=\"nofollow\">rising 155% to $936m</a> in 2017.</p> <p>A large part of the appeal of messaging is that it\u2019s \u201cfriction free\u201d \u2013 WhatsApp\u2019s brand promise is \u201cno ads, no games and no gimmicks\u201d. So how do brands join the conversation?</p> <p>\u201cThe responsibility of brands is changing,\u201d says Sutton. \u201cHistorically, the goal of advertising was to make people aware of a product and its merits.

  "<p>My how far we\u2019ve come in less than eight years. We have seen happen what those of us in the climate and energy fields knew could happen. The US has become a world leader on climate change, dramatically increased our production of clean and renewable fuels, reduced our emissions of greenhouse gases, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/dec/14/the-paris-agreement-signals-that-deniers-have-lost-the-climate-wars\">signed major international agreements</a> to continue progress into the future, and have done so without cost increases or power disruptions that the denial community proclaimed would occur.</p> <p>As we in the United States get ready to elect a new president, it is helpful to think about the impact a president can have. Particularly since we transitioned from the worst climate president ever (Bush) to the best (Obama). I am going to detail what I think are Obama\u2019s signature accomplishments.</p> <p>In my mind, the most important part of President Obama\u2019s legacy on climate is that he changed the conversation. He showed that not only should the US play a role in reducing emissions, but we can do just that. He showed that this problem isn\u2019t too big to solve. In fact, most of the solutions are subtle enough that we don\u2019t even notice them. He showed that we can change our future for the better.</p> <p>With respect to specific actions, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/jun/25/climate-change-carbon-emissions-president-obama-epa\">Clean Power Plan</a> is one of his biggest accomplishments. By working with the EPA, he created the first ever carbon pollution standards for the largest source of pollution \u2013 power plants. He did this in the midst of a do-nothing congress that fought him every step of the way.</p> <p>Under his presidency, we made huge investments in clean energy, which are paying off already. Jump starts to the wind and solar industry have led to enormous cost decreases \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/03/doe-charts-show-why-climate-doom-and-gloom-isnt-needed\">dirty energy isn\u2019t cheaper anymore</a>. It is really astonishing \u2013 wind power has tripled and solar power has increased by 30 times since he took office. <br></p> <p>Under his presidency, we improved standards for fuel economy of our vehicles, which not only reduces pollution but also saves money. Furthermore, Obama set targets to reduce the federal government\u2019s emissions by nearly 20% by 2025. He has worked to reduce other types of greenhouse gases such as methane and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/15/climate-change-environmentalists-hail-deal-to-limit-use-of-hydrofluorocarbons\">hydrofluorocarbons</a>, not only within the US but through international agreements.</p> <p>And those aren\u2019t the only international efforts. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/nov/14/fact-check-china-pledged-bigger-climate-action-republican-leaders-wrong\">Obama made a joint plan with China</a> that is almost unbelievably ambitious. It will reduce our emissions by approximately 27% by 2025 and puts major limits on Chinese emissions as well. He also forged an agreement with India to help low-income countries transition to modern economies that are not as polluting as current developed nations.</p> <p>There are many more items which would be too numerous to mention but I wanted to know how his presidency is viewed within Washington DC. I mean, among climate scientists, he is the president we\u2019ve been waiting for, but what do legislators think? I asked representative <a href=\"https://mccollum.house.gov/\">Betty McCollum</a> from Minnesota for her view. Ms. McCollum has a long history of focusing on the environment in general and climate change in particular \u2013 long before it was popular. She told me:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>President Obama has acted boldly to address the threat of climate change at home and abroad. He has demonstrated American leadership on the world stage in forging the Paris agreement and the Kigali amendment, steps that would have been unthinkable under his predecessor. And, using existing law, President Obama has helped shape a new approach to domestic carbon emissions with the Clean Power Plan. Sadly, Republicans in Congress have consistently put polluters ahead of our planet and attempted to stymie every administration initiative on climate change. That has made President Obama\u2019s job tougher \u2013 and it makes his accomplishments on climate even more impressive.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>We are certainly not out of the woods yet on climate change.

  "<p>The government\u2019s plan for tackling the UK\u2019s air pollution crisis has been judged illegally poor at the high court, marking the second time in 18 months that ministers have lost in court on the issue.</p> <p>The defeat is a humiliation for ministers who by law must cut the illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide suffered by dozens of towns and cities in the \u201cshortest possible time\u201d. </p> <p>Legal NGO <a href=\"http://www.clientearth.org/uk/\">ClientEarth</a>, which brought the case, argued that current plans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/18/treasury-blocked-moves-to-charge-diesel-cars-to-enter-polluted-uk-cities\">ignore many measures</a> that could help achieve this, placing too much weight on costs. On Wednesday Mr Justice Garnham agreed. He also said ministers knew that over-optimistic pollution modelling was being used, based on flawed lab tests of diesel vehicles rather than actual emissions on the road.</p> <p>The government said it would not appeal against the decision and agreed in court to discuss with ClientEarth a new timetable for more realistic pollution modelling and the steps needed to bring pollution levels down to legal levels. The parties will return to court in a week but if agreement cannot be reached, the judge could impose a timetable upon the government.</p> <p>At prime minister\u2019s questions, Theresa May indicated that the government would respond positively, with new proposals: \u201cWe now recognise that Defra [the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] has to look at the judgement made by the courts and we now have to look again at the proposals we will bring forward. Nobody in this house doubts the importance of the issue of air quality.

The high court has ruled that more urgent action must be taken. Britain is watching and waiting, prime minister.\u201d</p> <p>He said the increased action required would very likely include bigger and tougher clean air zones in more cities and other measure such as scrappage schemes for the dirtiest vehicles: \u201cThe government will have to be tougher on diesel.\u201d</p> <p>The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/02/make-central-london-diesel-free-to-solve-air-pollution-crisis-report\">who took part in the case against the government</a>, said: \u201cToday\u2019s ruling lays the blame at the door of the government for its complacency in failing to tackle the problem quickly and credibly. In so doing they have let down millions of people the length and breadth of the country.\u201d <br></p> <p>A spokeswoman for Defra said: \u201cImproving air quality is a priority for this government and we are determined to cut harmful emissions. Our plans have always followed the best available evidence - we have always been clear that we are ready to update them if necessary. Whilst our huge investment in green transport initiatives and plans to introduce clean air zones [in six cities] around the country will help tackle this problem, we accept the court\u2019s judgment. We will now carefully consider this ruling, and our next steps, in detail.\u201d<br></p> <p>ClientEarth defeated the government on the same issue at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/29/supreme-court-orders-uk-to-draw-up-air-pollution-cleanup-plan\">supreme court in April 2015</a>.

Both the environment and transport departments recommended changes to vehicle excise duty rates to encourage the purchase of low-pollution vehicles, but the Treasury also rejected that idea.</p> <p>Documents further showed that the government\u2019s plan to bring air pollution down to legal levels by 2020 for some cities and 2025 for London had been chosen because that was the date ministers thought they would face European commission fines, not which they considered \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. </p> <p>There had been a draft government plan for 16 low emission zones, which polluting vehicles are charged to enter, in cities outside London but the number was cut to just five on cost grounds. </p> <p>All these proposals will now be revisited.

  "<p>With the possible exception of <a href=\"http://www.nba.com/article/2016/10/29/new-orleans-pelicans-anthony-davis-back-back-40s\">Anthony Davis</a>, currently putting up monster numbers for the winless New Orleans Pelicans, no player has started the season off better than Oklahoma City Thunder\u2019s Russell Westbrook. Freed from having to share the court with Kevin Durant, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/jul/07/kevin-durant-departure-oklahoma-city-nba-basketball\">who bolted to the Golden State Warriors during the offseason</a>, the newly liberated Westbrook has taken full control of his team and the early dividends have been astounding.</p> <p>In the first game of the season, Westbrook was an assist away from logging a a triple double at the expense of Philadelphia\u2019s defense. On Friday, Westbrook <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/29/russell-westbrook-50-point-triple-double-nba\">put up 51 points</a>, 13 rebounds and 10 assists in a 113-110 overtime win over the Phoenix Suns, the first time a player has scored 50 points in a triple double since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar pulled off a similar feat in 1975.</p> <p>Oh, and he won the game by making a layup with just 3.6 seconds left on the clock in overtime.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T7X-KZ8S_A\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6T7X-KZ8S_A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Westbrook was somewhat less impressive on Sunday, as he scored a mere 33 points in 33 minutes in a win over the Los Angeles Lakers, although he made up for that by accumulating 12 rebounds and16 assists. Yes, Westbrook only barely missed a chance to start the season with three<a href=\"http://thecomeback.com/nba/yes-russell-westbrook-can-average-a-triple-double-this-season.html\"> straight triple-doubles</a>. In short, he\u2019s been looking exactly like the player who people were predicting to be the MVP this season, despite the continued existence of LeBron James, Steph Curry and Durant.</p> <p>While few expected him to put up numbers quite this impressive, Westbrook\u2019s hot start shouldn\u2019t come as a total surprise. Although nobody could deny that his partnership with Durant was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/16/durant-and-westbrook-the-leagues-most-entertaining-duo\">a successful one</a>, there was always the sense that having to share the ball with a fellow Hall of Fame caliber player was preventing him from reaching his full potential. <br></p> <p>And his performance during these first three games, all Thunder wins, can\u2019t be completely dismissed as a small sample size anomaly, mostly because it corresponds with what Westbrook has done without Durant in the past. Most notably, Westbrook averaged 28.1 points per game during the 2014-15 season, nearly carrying a once-floundering team into the postseason while Durant was sidelined with an injury. Despite just missing the playoffs, Westbrook still came in fourth place during that year\u2019s MVP voting, just behind Curry, LeBron and James Harden.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/jul/07/kevin-durant-departure-oklahoma-city-nba-basketball\">Kevin Durant's exit hurts an Oklahoma mourning much more than basketball</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Somehow Westbrook looks even more dangerous this time around. In fact it\u2019s difficult to recall a NBA player having a better start to the season. While Westbrook is a player who doesn\u2019t need much motivation, he has always played the game like a surprisingly graceful wrecking ball, he looks like someone who has something to prove to the entire basketball world. Which he does.</p> <p>Not only is Westbrook attempting to prove that the Thunder are his team now, he\u2019s also competing with Durant now that he\u2019s with the team\u2019s arch-rivals in California. One imagines that he probably wasn\u2019t too unhappy when Durant\u2019s Warriors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/26/spurs-thrash-warriors-in-nba-opener-as-cavaliers-roar-past-knicks\">got blown out at home</a> by the San Antonio Spurs on opening day.</p> <p>While the 3-0 Thunder have to be thrilled about how Westbrook\u2019s performance so far, they are well-aware that no player, nobody, not even Westbrook, <a href=\"http://www.espn.co.uk/blog/okc-thunder/post/_/id/1900/russell-westbrook-wills-the-thunder-to-a-win-but-can-he-keep-this-up\">is able to sustain</a> this level of play for any long stretch of time. First off, there\u2019s the reality that he would be risking burnout by the time the playoffs come around. Secondly, his current exertions will put a strain on his body, a dicey proposition considering Westbrook\u2019s injury history.</p> <p>There\u2019s also the fact that there will be some nights where Westbrook\u2019s admirable recklessness on the court will backfire. Yes, Westbrook can \u2013 and will \u2013 single-handedly win games, but on occasion he\u2019ll also lose a few on his own as well. When Westbrook\u2019s game is off, his propensity for volume shooting can lead to some thoroughly ugly stat lines and even on his best nights, he often commits unforced turnovers, almost as if the ball can\u2019t quite keep up with him.<br></p> <p>That\u2019s the trade off when you have to rely on a player as unique as Westbrook, whose greatest strength also doubles as his biggest weakness. In the past, Durant has been able to bail out the team when Westbrook has one of those games where he has nearly as many turnovers as made field goals. The Thunder no longer have that security blanket.<br></p> <p>The good news for Oklahoma City is that head coach Billy Donovan is well aware that they can\u2019t count on Good Russell game-in, game-out, and is aware of the need to get more players involved. \u201cHe knows what happened last night is not sustainable,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.normantranscript.com/sports/russell-westbrook-still-adjusting-to-new-environment/article_c79b11e8-9e12-11e6-b81c-6bfa8ea08476.html\">Donovan said</a> after Friday night\u2019s win, emphasizing the Thunder\u2019s need to start playing more as a group and less like Westbrook\u2019s backup band. \u201cIt\u2019s been great working with him because he\u2019s really thinking from a leadership standpoint, \u2018How do I incorporate all these guys? how do I help these guys?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>This brings us the Thunder\u2019s biggest concern: they either need to surround Westbrook with better players or hope for a breakout season from one or more guys already on their roster. At times Westbrook can be an incredibly inefficient shooter, but it\u2019s hard to blame him here. If you were one of the best players in the league, and Victor Oladipo were your team\u2019s second-highest scorer, you just might put up <a href=\"http://www.normantranscript.com/sports/thunderroad/putting-russell-westbrook-s-shots-into-perspective/article_91fa5584-9e2c-11e6-a4f9-e7b2c0a61694.html\">44 shots</a> a game too. Because of this it\u2019s imperative that the Thunder be proactive in adding players who give Westbrook more options, boost their iffy bench and/or allow them to rest Westbrook more often during the regular season to keep him fresh, Gregg Popovich style.<br></p> <p>As fun as it is to watch Westbrook take over games all by himself, barreling through defenses and burying opponents under an avalanche of made baskets, it\u2019s not an effective long-term strategy. Just because the Thunder could depend on Westbrook lifting the entire team on his back, it doesn\u2019t mean that they should.</p>",

Where will those additional people live? How will they make their living? Will they bolster or weigh down national economies?</p> <p>For clues, we can look 35 years in the past, to the early 1980s. The world\u2019s headlines were dominated by the US president Ronald Reagan, China\u2019s leader Deng Xiaoping, Britain\u2019s prime minister Margaret Thatcher, the French president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, and the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Personal computer sales were miniscule. And children competed over Rubik\u2019s cubes, rather than augmented-reality Pok\u00e9mon.</p> <p>At that time, the world\u2019s population was about 4.5 billion, 42% of whom \u2013 almost 2 billion people \u2013 lived in extreme poverty. Excessive population growth, it was feared, would outpace agricultural production and create yet more poverty.</p> <p>Yet the Malthusian predictions were wrong. Although the world population has surged to 7.5 billion, today only about 750 million people \u2013 just 10% of the total population \u2013 live in extreme poverty. China and India, in particular, have lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty in recent decades, increasing their citizens\u2019 incomes and improving their health.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>90% of global poverty is concentrated in countries with growing working-age populations</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>China and India achieved this partly by strengthening institutions and pursuing policies that supported strong, relatively inclusive growth. China, for its part, also took advantage of a \u201cdemographic dividend\u201d: fertility rates fell, and the labour force grew faster than the dependent population, freeing up resources to invest in people and capital. This produced higher growth and living standards.</p> <p>Such a dividend can run for decades. And, for China, it has, although it is now reaching its conclusion. For India and other developing countries, however, the demographic dividend is just starting to be felt. In fact, fully 90% of global poverty is concentrated in countries with growing working-age populations, creating an important opportunity for rapid poverty reduction in the coming decades.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/gallery/2015/apr/01/over-population-over-consumption-in-pictures\">Overpopulation, overconsumption \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For example, in sub-Saharan Africa, which is currently plagued with high levels of extreme poverty, children under 15 years of age account for 43% of the total population. When these children are old enough to enter the labour force, the proportion of income-earners in the economy could be increased substantially, boosting average per capita incomes.</p> <p>But not all countries are set to benefit from a \u201cyouth bulge\u201d. Between now and 2030, several middle-income countries will experience a decline in the share of the working-age population. Among other things, this reflects the tendency, supported by <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/2007/MR1274.pdf\">evidence</a> [pdf], for higher incomes to impel households to <a href=\"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/4029/WPS4833.pdf;sequence=1\">delay having children</a> [pdf].<br></p> <p>Even here, however, the demographic news is not all bad \u2013 and not just because the shift from higher to lower fertility typically correlates with a shift from lower to higher life expectancy. History suggests that there is a second type of demographic dividend \u2013 one that actually lasts longer and is more durable than the first \u2013 which emerges when the accumulated savings of an aging population produce a surge in investment. Many wealthier countries have followed this path.</p> <p>But reaping a demographic dividend takes work. As the World Bank Group\u2019s 2015\u201316 <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-monitoring-report\">Global Monitoring Report</a> emphasised, countries\u2019 policy responses make all the difference in how demographic trends affect the well being of the population. With the wrong approach, a surging youth population can be destabilising, and a rapidly ageing population can become a burden on economic growth and public budgets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e0f860be70337d7303e196175c9fd3ff703bb1d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0f860be70337d7303e196175c9fd3ff703bb1d0/0_0_4936_3388/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elderly people work out with wooden dumb-bells in the grounds of a temple in Tokyo on September 21, 2015, to celebrate Japan\u2019s Respect for the Aged Day.

For those with an ageing population, it is to improve productivity and adapt social-welfare systems. In both cases, investment in human capital and an enabling environment for businesses to boost employment are essential.</p> <p>Furthermore, countries should take advantage of differences in their demographic situations with appropriate policies on cross-border capital flows, migration, and trade. More capital should flow to countries with younger populations \u2013 with their growing manufacturing bases and consumer markets \u2013 to support investment and employment growth; and more labour should flow to countries with ageing populations, to fill gaps in the workforce.</p> <p>For all of these policies to work, countries need to improve the effectiveness and credibility of their civic and government institutions. Mitigating uncertainty, in order to avoid fueling instability, is also essential.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jan/11/europe-africa-overpopulated-global-population\">Isn't it Europe that is overpopulated, rather than Africa?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The last 35 years prove that a larger population does not have to be poorer.

  "<p>What would the world look like if men were afraid of women rather than women being afraid of men? Science fiction has long questioned the conventional exercise of power between the sexes, from the utopian dreams of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/nov/25/review-yellow-wallpaper-charlotte-perkins-gilman\"> Charlotte Perkins Gilman</a>, through the wild speculations of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/12/joanna-russ-obituary\">Joanna Russ</a> and subtle inner journeys of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/20/ursula-le-guin-wizardry-is-artistry-interview-national-book-awards\">Ursula Le Guin</a>, on to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/15/margaret-atwood-interview-english-pen-pinter-prize\">Margaret Atwood</a>\u2019s dystopias and out to the seamier shores of pulp. Through exaggeration and reversal, many books have set out to illuminate inequality or open up new vistas of possibility. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen the status quo inverted to such devastating effect as in Naomi Alderman\u2019s fourth novel.</p> <p>It starts with teenage girls. At 14 or 15, the age when in our present world girls are waking to an awareness of their own sexuality tangled up in all the ways society will seek to stifle or exploit it, Alderman has them come alive to the thrill of pure power: the ability to hurt or even kill by releasing electrical jolts from their fingertips. \u201cSomething\u2019s happening. The blood is pounding in her ears. A prickling feeling is spreading along her back, over her shoulders, along her collarbone. It\u2019s saying: you can do it. It\u2019s saying: you\u2019re strong.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/28/naomi-alderman-interview-the-power\">Naomi Alderman: \u2018I went into the novel religious and by the end I wasn\u2019t. I wrote myself out of it\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Footage of girls electrocuting men floods the internet; uncontrolled individual outbursts swell into the knowledge of collective power as more girls learn how to harness this strange new ability, and show older women how to awaken it too. Men start to give teenage girls a wide berth on the street; boys are segregated into single-sex schools for their own safety. The phenomenon is blamed on nerve gas, witchcraft, an anti-male conspiracy, a mystery virus; it\u2019s assumed that an antidote will be found and the \u201cnormal\u201d balance of power restored.</p> <p>But every individual exercise of power contributes to power relations as a whole, and change is unstoppable. The victims of sex traffickers turn on their assailants. There are revolutions in Riyadh and Delhi. Oppressed women assume that divine intervention has saved them from the hell-on-earth of their previous existence, and a new religious leader is ready and waiting to feminise faith: \u201cJews: look to Miriam, not Moses ... Muslims: look to Fatimah, not Muhammad. Buddhists: remember Tara, the mother of liberation. Christians: pray to Mary for your salvation.\u201d Armies become female, to harness and exploit girls\u2019 natural aggression; sexual violence flows in the other direction now. Drugs are developed to heighten the power, and porn created to fetishise it.</p> <p>Alderman conducts her thought experiment through the lives of four main characters. There\u2019s Allie, an abused American foster kid who reinvents herself as faith leader Mother Eve, and is seeking to build a community away from men; she joins forces with Roxy, the daughter of a London crime boss, who revels in her new abilities. Tunde is a Nigerian journalist reporting on seismic global change and discovering what it\u2019s like to be an attractive young man in a woman\u2019s world; while Margot, an American politician on the rise, comes to see that power resides with strength rather than authority \u2013 and as an unscrupulous middle-aged woman, strength is what she suddenly has.</p> <p>The novel is constructed as a big, brash, page-turning, drug-running, globetrotting thriller, one in which people say things such as: \u201cIt\u2019s only you I\u2019ve blimmin come to find, isn\u2019t it?\u201d and \u201cYou wanna stand with me? Or you wanna stand against me?\u201d But it\u2019s also endlessly nuanced and thought-provoking, combining elegantly efficient prose with beautiful meditations on the metaphysics of power, possibility and change. We\u2019re counting down, throughout, to a global cataclysm, while the book itself is presented as a \u201chistorical novel\u201d from thousands of years in the future, written by one \u201cNeil Adam Armon\u201d who dares to question how the natural dominance of women over men might have developed. Alderman has sly fun with the letters between Neil and \u201cNaomi Alderman\u201d that bookend the novel, as Neil shyly and submissively invites Naomi\u2019s approval and advice on his manuscript: \u201cAnyway, sorry, I\u2019ll shut up now \u2026 Thank you <em>so much</em> for this.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The novel is constructed as a big, brash, page-turning, drug-running, globetrotting thriller</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>High-concept novels can be reductive, but Alderman\u2019s book is multivalent. You can read the girls\u2019 power as a symbol of untapped or unthinkable possibility as well as an SF plot device. It\u2019s not clear at first that society won\u2019t cast the new development as just another aspect of dangerous femaleness that needs to be contained, and it\u2019s no surprise that girls who won\u2019t use their power get called names: gimp, flick, flat battery, pzit (\u201cthe sound of a woman trying to make a spark and failing\u201d).</p> <p>Alderman wrote brilliantly in her last novel,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/06/liars-gospel-naomi-alderman-review\"> <em>The Liars\u2019 Gospel</em></a>, about how the narrative of faith is constructed to suit different agendas. Here domination gets, as usual, a religious blessing: Mother Eve, whose mission is powered by a drolly laconic voice in her head, has a theological blueprint for the new world order. \u201cThey have said to you that man rules over woman as Jesus rules over the Church. But I say unto you that woman rules over man as Mary guided her infant son, with kindness and with love.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most impressive aspects of the book is how it uses a new schematics of sex and power to illuminate our reality, with Tunde\u2019s experiences demonstrating what it\u2019s like to come of age as the weaker sex. \u201cNothing worse has happened to him than to anyone. There\u2019s no reason for him to be afraid, no more reason than any other man.\u201d The passages of sexual violence are truly horrifying, with atrocity venturing into the realm of Greek tragedy.</p> <p>Why do people abuse power? The novel can\u2019t offer any answer beyond the one already found in our world: because they can. \u201cThat is the only answer there ever is.\u201d This is a bleak truth, but not a bleak book \u2013 it\u2019s far too smart, readable and joyously achieved for that. <em>The Power</em> is an instant classic of speculative fiction.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Power</em> is published by Viking.

  "<p>Natural ways of stopping floods, such as tree planting and putting logs in rivers to slow water flow must be a key part of protecting the nation as climate change intensifies rain storms, according to a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/environment-food-and-rural-affairs-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/inquiry/\">report from MPs</a>.</p> <p>The cross-party committee criticised the government for its limited plans and insufficient funding, and called for the Environment Agency to be stripped of its responsibility for flooding and replaced by a dedicated floods authority and a national flood commissioner, as is the case in the Netherlands. </p> <p>Other measures proposed include paying farmers to store water in fields and forcing housebuilders to make new homes resilient to flooding.</p> <p>More than 5 million people in England are at risk of flooding and recent winters have seen devastating deluges, with storm Desmond alone causing \u00a35bn in damages in the northern UK. The coalition government <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/28/flood-defences-row-uk-paying-price-david-cameron-tories-broken-promises\">cut flood defence spending sharply</a>, and increases in finds only followed the recent floods.</p> <p>The government\u2019s National Flood Resilience Review (NFRR), published in September, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/08/flooding-uk-government-plans-for-more-extreme-rainfall\">increased the projections for extreme rainfall</a> and moved to protect critical infrastructure, but it was criticised for lacking a long-term strategy and ignoring flash flooding, which alone threatens 3m homes.</p> <p>\u201cWe propose a radical alternative to the NFFR\u2019s limited solutions to the current fragmented, inefficient and ineffective flood risk management arrangements,\u201d said Neil Parish, the Conservative MP who chairs the environment, food and rural affairs (Efra) select committee. </p> <p>\u201cOur proposals will deliver a far more holistic approach to flooding and water supply management, looking at catchments as a whole.\u201d</p> <p>The dominant approach to previous flood management was to get the water from hills to the sea as quickly as possible, via drainage and straightened rivers. But this means the flows in rivers can peak dramatically, threatening villages, towns and cities. Poor farming practices, the loss of woods and urban development have all further accelerated the runoff of water. \u201cThe likelihood of flooding is now at an all-time high and will continue to increase,\u201d the MPs said.</p> <p>Pilot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/13/500000-tree-planting-project-helped-yorkshire-town-miss-winter-floods\">schemes at Pickering</a> in Yorkshire, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/10/flood-defence-nature-experiments\">Holnicote in Somerset</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/11/planting-more-trees-can-reduce-uk-flooding-research-shows\">elsewhere</a> have shown that flood risk can be lowered by slowing the flow of water off the land by planting trees, managing soils better, putting logs in streams to form leaky dams and by using fields to temporarily store water. A large-scale trial across a whole catchment is urgently needed, the MPs said.</p> <p>\u201cIf you can hold back the water, even for 12 hours, you can hold back the peak,\u201d said Parish. He opposed Brexit, but said it would give the opportunity to implement new subsidies for farmers who help prevent floods.</p> <p>The Environment Agency\u2019s responsibilities include national flood risk management and defence-building, as well as pollution and waste control. Parish said it has done a good job on the large-scale issues but was seen as too remote by communities affected by flooding. An overhaul of all the various local, regional and national bodies involved would streamline roles and pool expertise, he said.</p> <p>The committee said it was impossible to prevent all future floods and so the resilience of people\u2019s homes and businesses had to be improved, such as by protecting doorways and placing electrical sockets at higher levels. </p> <p>\u201cThe trouble with developers is they don\u2019t want to put these resilience measures into a house because as soon as anyone walks in, they say \u2018oh, is this area prone to flooding\u2019?\u201d said Parish. The MPs said new building regulations should be imposed if the industry failed to agree a voluntary code by the end of 2016.</p> <p>The committee also said insurance companies should do much better in incentivising people who have been flooded to improve the protection of their homes during the repairs, rather than just replace what was damaged. </p> <p>Daniel Johns, head of adaptation at the government\u2019s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, welcomed the report: \u201cClimate change is likely to increase the risk of flooding for many communities in England [but] there is no long-term strategy in place from the government to address it. Like the Efra committee, we\u2019ve also called repeatedly for the government to take further steps to ensure new development isn\u2019t adding to the long-term problem.\u201d </p> <p>The landowners\u2019 association, the CLA, welcomed the suggestion that a post-Brexit farm subsidy regime could include payments for flood prevention, but said it would be a \u201cbackward step\u201d to remove flood responsibilities from the Environment Agency. </p> <p>\u201cIt would risk a confused and disjointed approach at a time when people and businesses affected by flooding desperately need more investment,\u201d said Ross Murray, CLA president.</p> <p>Guy Shrubsole, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, also criticised the idea: \u201cIt would waste vital expertise and could cause more delays in planning better ways to avoid flooding. But the government should heed the MPs\u2019 welcome proposals to tackle flooding at root \u2013 working with nature across entire river catchments and dealing with climate change.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u201cWe take a long-term, strategic approach to protecting the nation from floods. We are spending \u00a32.5bn on building flood defence schemes across the country to better protect an additional 300,000 homes by 2021. </p> <p>\u201cWe are already implementing many of the suggestions this report makes, such as managing watercourses across entire catchment areas, but see no need for structural changes.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>If there is an irrepressible human trait it\u2019s the determination, against all odds, to reconnect. Though governments seek to atomise and rule, we will keep finding ways to come together. Our social brains forbid any other outcome. They urge us to reach out, even when the world seems hostile.</p> <p>This is the conclusion I draw from <a href=\"http://www.ewanmclennan.co.uk/breaking-the-spell-of-loneliness\">touring England</a> over the past few weeks, talking about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/nov/29/loneliness-eye-contact-oliver-burkeman\">loneliness and mental health</a>. Everywhere I have been so far, I\u2019ve come across the same, double-sided story: stark failures of government offset in part by the extraordinary force of human kindness.</p> <p>First the bad news: reminders of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/09/police-forces-mental-health-section-136\">shocking state of our mental health services</a>. I met people who had waited a year for treatment, only to be given the wrong therapy. I heard how the thresholds for treatment are repeatedly being raised, to ration services. I met one practitioner who had been told, as a result of the cuts, to recommend computerised cognitive behaviour therapy to her patients. In other words, instead of working with a therapist, people must <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2005/aug/30/g2.onlinesupplement\">sit at a screen</a>, using a programme to try to address disorders likely to have been caused or exacerbated by social isolation. Why not just write these patients a prescription instructing them to bog off and die?At least then they wouldn\u2019t have to wait a year to be told to consult their laptops. I heard of children profoundly damaged by abuse and neglect being sent to secure accommodation \u2013 imprisoned in other words \u2013 not for their own safety, or other people\u2019s, but because there is nowhere else for them to go.</p> <p>These are not isolated cases. It is a systemic problem. There has been no <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmhealth/342/34205.htm\">child and adolescent mental health survey</a> in this country since 2004 (though one is now planned). Snapshot studies suggest something is going badly wrong: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/23/nhs-figures-show-shocking-rise-self-harm-young-people\">figures published last week</a>, for example, suggest a near quadrupling in the past 10 years of girls admitted to hospital after cutting themselves. But there are no comprehensive figures. Imagine the outcry if the government had published no national figures on childhood cancer for 12 years, and was unable to tell you whether it was rising or falling.</p> <p>Of children referred for treatment for mental health disorders, 60% <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/04/nhs-child-mental-health-services-anxiety-depression\">do not receive it</a>. The Guardian recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/03/childrens-mental-health-in-crisis-readers-share-their-stories\">published a mother\u2019s account of how her child had been treated</a>. Despite a severe mental health disorder, it was only after the child attempted suicide that she received the care she needed. The treatment consisted of sending her to the other end of the country: the only available bed was 300 miles from home. You don\u2019t need to be a psychotherapist to imagine what that might do to a distressed and vulnerable child. But when the beds don\u2019t exist, the health service has no choice. Embarrassed into a semblance of action, the coalition government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/mar/14/uk-budget-to-include-extra-money-for-mental-health-services-say-lib-dems\">promised</a> another \u00a3250m a year for children\u2019s mental health. It will scarcely touch the sides.</p> <p>But amid the rubble of a collapsing state, I kept stumbling into something wonderful. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/20/ewan-mclennan-and-george-monbiot-breaking-the-spell-of-loneliness-review-fellside\">Performing with the musician Ewan McLennan</a>, using music and the spoken word to explore these subjects, has brought me into contact with groups that restore my faith in the human spirit.</p> <p>In Leeds we ate in a cafe run by the <a href=\"http://therealjunkfoodproject.org/\">Real Junk Food Project</a>, whose meals are made from waste or donated food. Seeing people of all ages, from all stations of life, who had never come together before, yakking away over dinner like old friends, I realised that the project is addressing not only the waste of food but also the waste of social opportunity. Breaking bread together: this is still the best and simplest way of reconnecting.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/12/neoliberalism-creating-loneliness-wrenching-society-apart\">Neoliberalism is creating loneliness.

Everywhere I look, I see the kind of enterprise and innovation with which business is credited, but which seems to be found most often in the voluntary sector.</p> <p>But what has struck me with greatest force is this. At the end of every gig, we ask people in the audience to turn to someone they don\u2019t know and say hello. I tell them they needn\u2019t do any more than that, but they can keep talking if they wish. On the first night I made the mistake of mentioning the idea before we had wrapped up the show. That was all it took \u2013 the conversation flared up immediately, and it was a long time before I could direct people\u2019s attention back to the stage. After every concert the talking has continued long into the night, in the venue\u2019s bar or the nearest pub. It\u2019s as if people have simply been waiting for permission to speak to the strangers who surround them.</p> <p>Britain, according to government figures, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jul/20/loneliness-britains-silent-plague-hurts-young-people-most\">the loneliness capital of Europe</a>, but even \u2013 or perhaps especially \u2013 here, the urge to connect is overwhelming. This reattachment, I believe, holds the key to both our psychological and political transformation. Connected, engaged and happy people do not allow themselves to be trampled into the dirt. It is when we are estranged both from each other and from our political environment that we are easiest to manipulate, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/19/welcome-to-the-age-of-trump\">the rise of demagoguery</a> in Europe and the US seems to attest.</p> <p>Neither state provision nor community action is a substitute for the other: we need both.

I think that my general rule when I talk to governors and state and local officials whenever they\u2019re dealing with protests, including for example during the Black Lives Matters protests, is there\u2019s an obligation for protesters to be peaceful and there\u2019s an obligation for authorities to show restraint.\u201d</p> <p>He continued: \u201cI want to make sure that as everybody is exercising their constitutional rights to be heard, that both sides are refraining from situations that might result in people being hurt.\u201d</p> <p>His comments comes as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/dakota-access-pipeline-protest-investigation-human-rights-abuses\">group with the United Nations</a> investigates allegations of human rights abuses after jailed Native Americans said they were held in cages and faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/dakota-access-pipeline-native-american-protesters\">cruel and inhumane treatment behind bars</a>. <br></p> <p>Police have used pepper spray, Tasers and batons against activists who have insisted they are remaining peaceful.</p> <p>Several protesters recently released from local jails told the Guardian at the Standing Rock camps that the Morton county sheriff\u2019s office was not prepared to process hundreds of those arrested, and that they wrote numbers and charges on inmates\u2019 bodies to track them while also temporarily detaining groups in cages that they said seemed like \u201cdog kennels\u201d. </p> <p>Activists have criticized Obama for <a href=\"http://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/09/07/dakota-access-pipeline-fight-grows-where-are-obama-and-clinton\">staying silent</a> and were dismayed when the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, released a short <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/27/north-dakota-access-pipeline-police-protesters-live-updates?page=with:block-58129388e4b08d944ba4b6f5#block-58129388e4b08d944ba4b6f5\">statement</a> saying she believed \u201call voices should be heard and all views considered in federal infrastructure projects\u201d.</p> <p>Last week it was also revealed that Republican candidate Donald Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/26/donald-trump-dakota-access-pipeline-investment-energy-transfer-partners\">close financial ties</a> to the pipeline operator.</p> <p>Xhopakelxhit, a Native American activist who has been at the Standing Rock camps for more than a month, said she was disappointed Obama didn\u2019t condemn the police tactics against peaceful protesters.</p> <p>\u201cWhy has he not made a more forceful statement in favor of us? He\u2019s basically trying to cover all his bases without actually doing anything,\u201d said the protester, who is a member of the Nuu-chah-nulth tribe. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising but it\u2019s a coward\u2019s way out.\u201d</p> <p>Xhopakelxhit urged Obama to say that he finds the \u201cviolence committed by the riot police to be reprehensible\u201d and to have the department of justice investigate the continuing human rights violations.</p> <p>Given how close the pipeline is to the river, Xhopakelxhit also said she was wary of any last-minute efforts to change construction plans. \u201cIt\u2019s completely laughable on every level and utterly ridiculous that they would be able to reroute at this point.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Security forces in the Indonesian capital Jakarta are on high alert in preparation for a Friday rally by hardline Islamist groups against the city\u2019s non-Muslim governor.</p> <p>Thousands of people are due to move into the capital to protest against Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ethnic Chinese and Christian nicknamed \u2018Ahok\u2019, who has governed the city since 2014.</p> <p>They accuse him of blasphemy after he criticised his opponents for referencing a <a href=\"https://quran.com/5:51\">verse</a> in the Koran that warns against allying with Christians and Jews.</p> <p>In September, Ahok suggested those who used the passage against him were \u201clying\u201d, leading to outrage from some hardliners who interpreted his comments as criticism of the Islamic holy text. He later apologised.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/nov/02/100-bn-dollar-gold-mine-west-papuans-say-they-are-counting-the-cost-indonesia\">The $100bn gold mine and the West Papuans who say they are counting the cost | Susan Schulman and Kate Hodal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>President Joko Widodo said on Monday that he had ordered the \u201cstate apparatus to be on alert\u201d during the protests.</p> <p>The main group behind the rally, the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) which formed in 1999, is known for violent demonstrations and attacks on minorities.</p> <p>The group tried unsuccessfully in 2014 to block Ahok from becoming governor on the grounds that a Christian should not lead a Muslim-majority city. And later that year, a protest by the FPI turned <a href=\"http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/indonesia-radicals-in-violent-protest-against-new-jakarta-governor\">violent</a> leaving several police officer injured.</p> <p>On Friday, demonstrators will attend prayers at Istiqlal Mosque and then march to the presidential palace, where armoured personnel carriers have been stationed and the police and military will be deployed.</p> <p>\u201cI appeal to everyone to stay calm. Do not be easily provoked by the social media,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/indonesia-on-high-alert-for-nov-4-protest-against-jakarta/3249324.html\">said</a> National Police Chief General Tito, adding that 18,000 personnel have been deployed. The Indonesian military will provide a further 500 troops.</p> <p>The rally is the second large demonstration against Ahok in a month. On 14 October, thousands took park in a generally peaceful event outside city hall.</p> <p>As the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority nation, Indonesians largely practice a moderate form of Islam. While the FPI is a relatively small group, the country\u2019s largest Islamic organisation, Nahdlatul Ulama, has told its 40 million members not to support the protests.</p> <p>But equally, Indonesia\u2019s Ulama Council, the country\u2019s top Muslim clerical body, agreed that Ahok had committed blasphemy and should be prosecuted. It said a non-Muslim should not become a leader of Muslims.</p> <p>The southeast Asian nation has a history of sporadic and isolated violence against Christian as well as its large ethnic Chinese minority, many of whom are Buddhists.</p> <p>International militant jihadists, some with influence and members in Indonesia, are looking to capitalise on the anti-Ahok sentiment.</p> <p>Last month, al Qaida\u2019s branch in Syria, Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, said that Indonesia should sentence Ahok or it would \u201csentence him with bullets\u2019. And ISIS supporters have sent messages to their supporters asking them to use the rally \u2018to fan the flames of jihad\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear that everyone is worried about violence, and huge numbers of police and soldiers have been called up for duty,\u201d said Sidney Jones, the director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict.<br></p> <p>The governor is looking toward a February election and looks likely to win. He is politically close with president Widodo, who also served as Jakarta governor for 18 months before rising to the country\u2019s highest office and handing over to Ahok.</p> <p>But Jones said that supporters of Anies Baswedan, a former minister of education who is second behind Ahok in the gubernatorial race, are exploiting the potentially explosive upheaval to damage him politically.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is that there are too many interests involved here: Ahok\u2019s rivals would like to decrease his likelihood of winning; hardline civil society groups want to show that they control the streets; pro-shariah groups want to show massive support for Islamic law; the tiny jihadi groups are urging their members to show their courage by attacking police.\u201d</p>",

The bad news? This series is heading back to Progressive Field and the Cubs have zero margin of error, one loss to the Indians and this series is over.</p> <p>It should be a great pitching matchup today, with the Cubs starting last year\u2019s Cy Young winner Jake Arrieta (18-18, 3:10) against Josh Tomlin (13-9, 4.40), who has allowed just 4 runs in 3 postseason games. <br></p> <p>This might be the most important game in Cubs history since 1945, although that distinction would change should they force a Game 7.

A 2012 report from <a href=\"http://www.earthworksaction.org/files/publications/Troubled-Waters_FINAL.pdf\">Earthworks and MiningWatch Canada</a> asserts that mine waste from Grasberg has \u201cburied over 166 square kilometres of formerly productive forest and wetlands, and fish have largely disappeared\u201d. </p> <p>Although most Kamoro still try to eke out a living fishing and foraging for food, they struggle to find paid work, says Urmani. \u201cWe need to earn money. But now we face major competition from non-Papuan migrants.\u201d</p> <p>Locals fear that the government\u2019s controversial transmigration programme, which resettles Indonesians from high-density islands such as Java to low-population areas, is <a href=\"https://westpapuamedia.info/2015/10/19/indonesias-colonial-transmigration-is-intentional-annihilation-of-papuas-indigenous-peoples/\">wiping out their population completely</a>.

The practice has devastated the environment, according to Earthworks and locals, turning thousands of hectares of verdant forest and mangroves into wasteland and rendering turgid the once-crystal waters of the highlands.</p> <p>The tailings from the Grasberg mine are so rich with ore that Papuans walk for as long as a week to get here. Crowding the length of the river and the delta wasteland, thousands of unlicensed panners shore up small sections to slow the river\u2019s flow and dig into the thick sediment on the side.  </p> <p>Although some of these panners are located within Freeport\u2019s official mining operations, they are not evicted or controlled in any way, they said. Instead, they claim they sell their findings to the police and military who work as security on the mine. (An anonymous Freeport source also confirmed this).</p> <p>One of the panners, Martine Wandango, 25, bends over her pail of water as she filters out rocks and searches for ore. \u201cYou can only survive with money, and you can only find money from gold,\u201d says Martine, who followed her husband to the delta 15 years ago by walking 60 miles over the mountains from their remote highland village.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"24ebd1b7d8453d418da051945e8268c0a9c5b81d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24ebd1b7d8453d418da051945e8268c0a9c5b81d/0_0_3984_2656/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Aikwa river delta, near Timika\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Aikwa river, which used to provide the Kamoro people with the staples of their existence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Susan Schulman/susan schulman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI work really hard as I want to give my children better lives, so they can go to school.

Under Indonesian law, Freeport is a designated \u201cstrategic industry\u201d, which mandates that external security for the mine, its access roads and its pipelines all be provided exclusively by Indonesia\u2019s security forces. Freeport has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14417718\">never been implicated in any human rights</a> abuses allegedly committed by the Indonesian military in Papua. </p> <p>Freeport McMoRan, based in Phoenix, Arizona, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. </p> <p>The company\u2019s website defends its method of disposal of tailings at Grasberg, managed by PT Freeport Indonesia (PTFI), an affiliate company: \u201cPTFI\u2019s controlled riverine tailings management system, which has been approved by the Indonesian government, uses the unnavigable river system in the mountainous highlands near our mine to transport tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and other sediments are managed in a deposition area.\u201d </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.circleofblue.org/2012/world/global-gold-rush-the-price-of-mining-pursuits-on-water-supply/\">2009 report by the company</a> says it utilises levees to contain tailings in the deposition area, and that the tailings management programme costs Freeport McMoRan $15.5m (\u00a312.7m) each year. According to the report, company monitoring of aquatic life in the rivers found that fish and shrimp were suitable for consumption, as regulated by Indonesian food standards, while water quality samples met Indonesian and US Environmental Protection Agency drinking water standards for dissolved metals. In a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14417718\">2011 BBC report</a> on alleged pollution in the area surrounding Grasberg, the company says that the tailings management method was chosen because studies showed the environmental impact caused by its waste material was reversible.<br></p> <p>Elsewhere on its website, the company says: \u201cWe are committed to respecting human rights. Our <a href=\"http://www.fcx.com/sd/pdf/hr_policy.pdf\">human rights policy</a> requires us (and our contractors) to conduct business in a manner consistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and to align our human rights due diligence practices with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UN Guiding Principles).\u201d</p> <p>The company also emphasises its work with indigenous people in West Papua. A 2015 Freeport McRoRan report on working towards sustainable development said: \u201cPTFI has engaged with indigenous Papuan tribes for decades, including through numerous formal agreements to promote workforce skills training, health, education and basic infrastructure development \u2026 In 2015, PTFI continued to evaluate the effectiveness of alternate options for Kamoro community members whose estuary transport routes are impacted by sedimentation associated with the controlled riverine tailings management system. Provision of smaller sized boats, in addition to 50 passenger vessels, for route flexibility as well as additional local economic development programmes were identified as additional mitigation measures during the year.\u201d</p> <p>Back in the area surrounding the Grasberg mine, many Papuans, struggling for work, find themselves pulled into the bar and sex industries that cater to the miners, particularly around the highland village of Banti. Here brothels and bars line up side by side, allegedly with help from the Indonesian military, who are said to supply sex workers and alcohol, according to a Freeport source who wished to remain anonymous.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d89c3b955d48c4b2445d4a472061e1a7be97ebe8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d89c3b955d48c4b2445d4a472061e1a7be97ebe8/0_66_3984_2390/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside a brothel complex in Timika, West Papua\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside a brothel complex in Timika, West Papua.

While we expect this to be only a temporary phenomenon, it will nonetheless weigh on the purchasing power of consumers over the next couple of years.\u201d</p> <p>Consumer spending has propped up GDP growth in the last year after a sharp downturn in construction and weaker manufacturing sector, which has lost momentum in response to slowing growth in global trade.</p> <p>The most recent assessment of the UK economy by the Office for National Statistics showed that manufacturing contracted in the three months to the end of September by 1%. A survey of manufacturers in October found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/11/pound-completes-worst-four-day-performance-since-brexit-vote\">the sharp fall in the value of the pound</a> since the EU referendum had helped to increase exports, but also forced manufacturers to raise the price of their goods at the fastest rate in more than five years.</p> <p>The latest Markit/CIPS manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) survey for October suggested that firms are starting to pass on higher import costs as the weak pound makes raw materials such as oil more expensive.

  "<p>One loosely applied law for the rich. Another tightly monitored one for the poor. Next&#xa0;Monday, the government reduces the total amount of benefits families are allowed to claim.

Now they are enacting laws to create not just poverty, but generations of destitution. Nor are they alone in this project. The benefits cap was brought in by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition. It was endorsed by Ed Miliband\u2019s Labour party. As acting leader last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/12/harman-labour-not-vote-against-welfare-bill-limit-child-tax-credits\" title=\"\">Harriet Harman instructed Labour MPs not to oppose the reduction of the cap</a>. Still, the fact remains that the benefit cap was a Conservative idea.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as a report from the Resolution Foundation points out this morning, the Conservatives have since 2010 brought in tax cut after tax cut, worth a total \u00a332bn this year. Set that against the reduction of the benefit cap, which will inflict chaos on hundreds of thousands of the poorest to raise a measly \u00a365m this year. Over George Osborne\u2019s six years in No 11, corporation tax rates have been slashed. The threshold at which personal income is taxed has risen to over \u00a310,000 and will next year hit \u00a311,500. Under&#xa0;the party that once promised \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/22/cameron-coalition-green-policies-one-year\" title=\"\">vote blue, go green</a>\u201d, fuel duty was first cut and then frozen. These giveaways have gone largely to big business and to the rich. The&#xa0;rise in the personal income tax threshold was sold by Nick Clegg and David Cameron as a way of boosting the living standards of the working poor. It was actually a hugely expensive sop&#xa0;to the rich.</p> <p>Then there is the kid-glove treatment of the super-rich, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/01/hmrc-investigating-19bn-in-potential-tax-avoidance-by-super-rich\" title=\"\">as detailed by the National Audit Office yesterday</a>. The NAO report is not political, yet its investigation is a must-read for all those who want to get to grips with the government\u2019s austerity project. Tax inspectors have identified potential evasion or avoidance worth \u00a32bn among 6,500 super-rich individuals. Of those, only two individuals have been criminally investigated, with one single prosecution. Tax inspectors have identified a variety of ways in which the very wealthy game the system: from failing to declare foreign income to investing in schemes that are sold as tax dodges. The NAO points out that hundreds of millions stand to be collected from enforcing the law. It also paints a picture in which the tax inspectors are outnumbered and outgunned by the super-wealthy and their armies of advisers.</p> <p>Theresa May\u2019s promise is \u201ca country that works for all\u201d. Yet she has been involved in and is now in charge of an austerity project that does the opposite: pushing the poorest deeper into poverty while letting the richest off scot-free. If the prime minister wants to make good on her pledges of social justice, she has her chance in the autumn statement later this month. She can follow Labour\u2019s suggestion of giving more money and more firepower to the tax inspectors. She can reverse the wasteful giveaway on income tax thresholds. And she can roll back the cuts to social security and public spending. Here\u2019s&#xa0;her chance; let\u2019s hope she takes it.</p>"
