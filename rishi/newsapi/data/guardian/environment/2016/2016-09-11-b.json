  "<p> Britain\u2019s economy will grind to a near standstill over the coming months as post-referendum uncertainty triggers a slump in business investment, a leading business group has warned as it slashed its growth forecasts.</p> <p>In its first set of forecasts since the vote to leave the EU, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) on Monday more than halved its GDP growth prediction for next year from 2.3% to 1.0%. That would mark the worst economic performance since 2009, when the UK was emerging from a deep recession sparked by the global financial crisis.</p> <p>Recent economic indicators <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/construction-exports-figures-uk-economy-growing\">suggest activity has rebounded from an initial post-referendum dive</a> but the BCC\u2019s gloomy outlook shows that businesses remain nervous about the prospect of protracted negotiations to leave the EU and about potential trade deals.</p> <p>The confidence of the business community was dealt another blow over the weekend as it emerged <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/liamfox\">Liam Fox</a>, the international trade secretary, had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/10/business-leaders-politicians-attack-fox-over-lazy-accusations\">launched an extraordinary attack on British executives</a>, suggesting they would rather play golf than export their goods and services.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/10/business-leaders-politicians-attack-fox-over-lazy-accusations\">Business leaders and MPs attack Liam Fox over 'fat and lazy' accusations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked about Fox\u2019s description of a Britain that had grown \u201ctoo lazy and too fat\u201d on earlier successes, BCC president Francis Martin called for politicians to support businesses as the country works out its EU exit.</p> <p>\u201cBusiness and government need to work together if we\u2019re to make a success of the transition ahead,\u201d said Martin. \u201cBusiness people don\u2019t mind a robust conversation, but they will insist on a constructive one.\u201d</p> <p>The business group\u2019s new forecasts put it broadly in line with the Bank of England, which also sees a sharp slowdown in GDP growth next year to just 0.8% from 2% this year.</p> <p>The Bank has already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">cut interest rates to a record low of 0.25%</a> and expanded its programme to pump electronic cash into the economy. It is widely expected to cut base rates again, to 0.1%, before the end of the year. But no move is anticipated when its policymakers meet this week, according to a Reuters poll of economists.</p> <p>The BCC is cautioning against reading too much into recent signs of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/manufacturing-figures-uk-economy-brexit-vote\">bounceback in output</a> for manufacturers and services firms, a pick-up in exports and a steadying in construction work.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough individual businesses continue to report strong trading conditions, the overall picture suggests a sharp slowdown in UK growth lies ahead,\u201d said Adam Marshall, the BCC\u2019s acting director general.<br></p> <p>\u201cOur forecast suggests that the UK is likely to avoid a recession, but with the health warning that businesses are still digesting the result of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/donald-tusk-theresa-may-article-50-brexit-negotiations-eu\">June\u2019s EU referendum</a> and the challenges and opportunities to come.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-11T12:10:16/embed.html\" data-alt=\"BCC forecasts\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-11T12:10:16/embed.html\">BCC forecasts</a> </figure>  <p>The group, which represents a network of 52 chambers around the UK, believes the economy will eke out quarterly growth of just 0.1% in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter. That compares with 0.6% in the second quarter of April to June.<br></p> <p>For 2016 as a whole the BCC has downgraded its growth forecast from 2.2% to 1.8%. After growth of 1.0% in 2017, it sees the economy gaining some momentum to grow 1.8% in 2018 \u2013 compared with an earlier forecast for 2.4%. </p> <p>Marshall said a number of uncertainties were weighing on sentiment. \u201cThe value of sterling, the shape of future trade relationships, the status of EU nationals in the UK workforce and other factors will all influence business confidence over the coming quarters,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A large fall in investment, along with weaker consumer spending, was the main reason for the weaker outlook. Business investment is expected to fall by 2.2% in 2016 and by 3.4% in 2017. That compares with previous forecasts for 4.5% growth in 2016 and a 7.4% rise in 2017.</p> <p>The group predicts some help to the UK\u2019s trading position from a weaker pound, which tumbled against other currencies following the referendum result, making UK goods cheaper in overseas markets.<br></p> <p>Businesses are looking ahead to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/philip-hammond-announces-autumn-budget-statement-for-23-november\"> Philip Hammond\u2019s autumn statement on 23 November</a> when the chancellor will set out how the government will use tax and spending plans to help the economy weather the post-referendum turmoil.</p> <p>Marshall said businesses were relying on ministers to support business investment and confidence. \u201cThey should start with the long list of business-boosting infrastructure projects that have been put on hold for far too long \u2013 including a firm decision on a new airport runway, new nuclear investment, and road and rail schemes,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/07/take-back-control-brexiteers-immigration-policy-johnson-davis-fox\">Take back control?

  "<p>And a fiddly-dee-dee with the waves lapping against the shore. It\u2019s Bodmin Assizes Part Two! But is Francis dead? Of course not. I said he would miss his own head. \u201cIt misfired ... the flint went down but the powder did not ignite ... I agree it\u2019s in very poor taste to use your hospitality for such a purpose.\u201d What a fantastically British way of saying: \u201cSorry for trying to kill myself in your hotel room, old chap.\u201d<br></p> \n<p>Not only was Francis saved but Ross too. And what a good job the trial turned out to be a total waste of time, because a series about the sensible side of the family would be no fun at all. And we certainly can\u2019t rely on Evil George or Boring Francis to take their shirts off. Although I reckon Dr Ennis would step up if pressed. Still, not a total waste of time as this was an extremely dramatically engaging episode with many tears shed. It was all nicely layered and cleverly built up. Because, I mean, I love Bodmin Assizes as much as the next fan of the late 18th-century Cornish legal system but LA Law this wasn\u2019t. There were times when I wondered if it was all going to go on a bit. But mostly I was just weeping and empathising with #TeamRoss.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e721b5b423ac853fb7b0e4fc414ab711eca06bd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e721b5b423ac853fb7b0e4fc414ab711eca06bd/0_26_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Don\u2019t kill off Ross!

Oh why must she always wear mustard and moss green? There is a Demelza palette. Is the wardrobe mistress on a deal with Colour Me Beautiful? (Demelza is definitely an Autumn. Elizabeth is a Winter.) For a meeting with Bergerac, though, it has to be claret, darling!</p> \n<p>It all went a bit Brexit when the vote was announced and the riot broke out. See how useful it is to have a clear majority, eh? (Topical!) But this needed to happen so Ross could witness someone who was about to die and therefore be further tempted into lowering himself by apologising for a crime he didn\u2019t commit. Meeting Beardy Ginger Riot-Inciting Man was not a good omen. As Ross took to the dock, his scar shining in the sunlight, even I began to believe that he might be guilty and I haven\u2019t had a penny from Evil George.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo you go to the gallows on a point of principle?\u201d \u201cI appreciate your efforts but I cannot put my name to beggary and flattery.\u201d Oh, Ross. Paint a penitent figure and escape the worst, I tell you! Do it, otherwise the next eight episodes will be six-pack-free and the fortunes of BBC1 cannot weather this loss. \u201cThat is why you must grovel. Do so now. Or you will not live to see the sun rise tomorrow.\u201d (More weeping at this point.)</p> \n<p>But it was not to be. \u201cI make no apology for my actions. In truth, I would do the same again.\u201d This was an excellent TED talk on morality and self-belief. It wasn\u2019t ideal when trying to save yourself from the gallows. Dr Ennis summed it up: \u201cI have heard more penitent speeches.\u201d But then it turned out they were just toying with us and the jury saved the day! Let\u2019s have a party on the beach with some driftwood and a horse. Oh, the relief. \u201cTo Ross!\u201d</p> \n<h2>Pewter Tankard Award for Bonkers Brilliance as Supporting Actor</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ddb767b0005f5f2e6dd3c388455ce31d664b067a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddb767b0005f5f2e6dd3c388455ce31d664b067a/0_34_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sindy doll dog woman, Caroline Penvenen (Gabriella Wilde).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Sindy doll dog woman, Caroline Penvenen (Gabriella Wilde).</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Rogers/BBC</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Derren Brown of Poldark, that notorious card sharp Aunt Agatha, winner of last week\u2019s award, made a brief early bid for victory with this excellent exchange. Elizabeth: \u201cNot once have I known you forecast an outcome that was remotely cheering.\u201d Derren Brown: \u201cI\u2019m not divining the future. I\u2019m entertaining myself with a game of snap. Go to Bodmin, Elizabeth.\u201d</p> \n<p>But she was not in the episode enough to hold on to the much-coveted tankard. Instead, that honour must go to the Sindy doll dog woman, Caroline Penvenen (the insufferably young, delicious and beautiful Gabriella Wilde), for the faces that she makes whenever Dr Ennis enters the room. As he took to the stand to defend his friend, she looked as if she wanted to eat him and his doctor\u2019s case. The weedy politician is not long for this world. <br></p> \n<h2>Classic Poldark lines</h2> \n<p>\u201cI is \u2019ard of \u2019earing so it\u2019s likely I mis\u2018eard what they said.\u201d Go, Judd! Thank heaven for people with peculiar loyalties. Give the man a drink. Actually, don\u2019t do that.</p> \n<p>\u201cIs it always like this in Bodmin?\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t say. I live near Truro.\u201d I want this on a T-shirt. Underneath the T-shirt I will wear my nudey mining secret tribute six-pack.</p> \n<p>\u201cI ask you to think of the traditions of our county.\u201d A rousing statement, but one which also suggests that one of the main traditions of Cornish life is waiting for booty to be washed up on the beach so you can plunder it. Which I\u2019m sure is not what he meant ...<br></p> \n<h2>Regulation reverse sexism bare chest moment</h2> \n<p>\u201cCandles burning ... The scent of new-picked violets ...\u201d There was a final chance for the chest to come out at Ross\u2019s homecoming, but it was not to be. We must surmise from the lack of chest this week that either the producers have got cocky and think they can keep the viewers happy with storylines, cinematography and great acting alone. Or Aidan Turner has finally had the clause inserted into his contract that he has been gunning for all long: \u201cNo more nudey mining and scything. Mr Turner is a proper actor. He is not a girl.\u201d This turn of events can\u2019t end well. I will be monitoring the viewing figures carefully.</p> \n<h2>Next week</h2> \n<p>Demelza struggles to convince Ross that her pregnancy is good news. Evil George\u2019s henchman Tankard reveals his hand. And Dr Ennis draws ever inevitably closer to the Sindy doll dog woman.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c3dc92f8-9b66-4c99-b0b2-64553a6a54e6\"

Major projects the group is working on include Coulomb Phase 2 and Appomattox in the Gulf of Mexico and Malikai off the coast of Malaysia.</p> <p>Shell began the costly Stones project in 2013, two years after the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/09/fossil-fuel-infrastructure-climate-change\">two-thirds of proven fossil fuel reserves will need to remain in the ground</a> to prevent the earth from warming 2C above pre-industrial levels \u2013 a proposed temperature limit beyond which scientists warn of spiralling and irreversible climate change.</p> <p>At Stones, oil and gas is pumped from several points on the sea bed through flexible riser pipes to a specialised tanker, incorporating a detachable 3,150-tonne buoy. In the event of a hurricane, Shell says the tanker can halt production and sail away safely from the buoy and riser pipes.</p> <p>Stones will produce the equivalent of about 50,000 barrels of oil a day when ramped up to full capacity at the end of 2017.</p> <p>Van Beurden\u2019s annual bonus depends, in part, on delivering major new projects on time and on budget. For 2015, he received a bonus of \u20ac3.5m, which formed part of an overall pay and pension package worth \u20ac5.58m.<br></p> <p>Van Beurden has repeatedly insisted he is determined that Shell should play a part in helping the world take action to end global warming.</p> <p>At Shell\u2019s annual shareholder meeting last year, the board promised a group of activist shareholders, including the Church of England, to better explain how bonus schemes for Van Beurden and others were aligned with its professed ambitions to help tackle climate change. At this year\u2019s meeting, however, activist investors<a href=\"https://www.rathbonegreenbank.com/insight/royal-dutch-shell-special-resolution-one-year\"> said</a> \u201cclarification is urgently required\u201d on this point.</p> <p>Shell has stressed that <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/sustainability/sustainability-reporting-and-performance-data/performance-data/greenhouse-gas-emissions/_jcr_content/par/tabbedcontent/tab/textimage.stream/1443609730440/d302cf0d4008fbfa4bbe31e515ebd3f3b8280027bff49a65ef985ee3e4653aa3/response-to-shareholder-resolution-on-climate-change.pdf\">10% of Van Beurden\u2019s bonus is tied to the group\u2019s \u201csustainability\u201d performance</a>. However, these incentives target how much energy the group uses, the volume of oil spilt and water usage. They do not focus on what campaigners see as the core concern: how Shell plans to manage its way to a low-carbon global economy.</p> <p>Meanwhile, 20% of the Van Beurden\u2019s bonus is still tied to delivering major new production projects, such as Stones. A further 30% is linked to the group\u2019s ability to generate cash, while 12% of the bonus depends on production volumes.</p>",
  "<p>As the sun blazed down on the heart of the capital, this was a late summer day with particular significance for two of the elder statesmen of British cycling. In the final stage of the national Tour the pocket-sized Australian sprinter Caleb Ewan sprinted to his first win of the week while Steve Cummings sealed the most important stage race title of his career and Sir Bradley Wiggins completed what he is adamant will be his final road race, with just the London and Gent six-day track events to come before he hangs up his wheels for good this winter.</p> <p>The 35-year-old Cummings and the 36-year-old knight of the realm have much in common beyond a shared background in track cycling through the British pursuit squad, from which they transferred successfully to road racing, plus the fact that they share overall victories in the relaunched national tour \u2013 the only other Briton to win the event, the Devonian Jonathan Tiernan-Locke, was disqualified after a positive test for blood doping.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/10/steve-cummings-tour-of-britain-cycling\">Steve Cummings holds off rivals to close in on Tour of Britain title</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pair share musical tastes \u2013 for years Wiggins\u2019s compilation of tracks for warming up was one made by Cummings \u2013 but, critically, both struggled to find the right environment within road cycling; Cummings truly blossomed only in the last two years after being given his head at MTN-Qubeka, now Dimension Data, while it took Wiggins seven years to find his feet. Cummings, like Wiggins, is at his best when choosing his own targets, to attain in his own way, but he is a tactician who thrives on broken racing whereas Wiggins needs a structured race to thrive.</p> <p>Cummings and his runner-up, Rohan Dennis, acknowledged that the key to the Briton\u2019s victory this week was the second stage through the Lake District, where Cummings paced his effort over the key climb of the Struggle to ensure that he had enough left in the tank at the end to open the decisive gap on the Australian and the eventual third-placed Tom Dumoulin of Holland. \u201cI won the race on stage two and I\u2019ve been hanging on to that ever since,\u201d said Cummings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/09/tour-of-britain-steve-cummings-yellow-jersey\">Tour of Britain: Steve Cummings battles his way into yellow jersey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cummings had twice finished second in his home Tour, in 2008 and 2011, but he is adamant that racing for an overall title does not suit him. \u201cI find it really stressful.

By contrast, Liberty\u2019s headquarters are in the sleepy town of Englewood, Colorado. The cable TV and media giant is listed on Nasdaq and majority owned by the billionaire John Malone, nicknamed Darth Vader for his ruthless deal-making style.</p> <p>In the year to 31 December 2015 Liberty made a $248m net profit from revenues of $4.8bn. Its big-name sports credentials have to date been limited to the Eurosport TV channel and the Atlanta Braves baseball team. The firm is not well-known in Europe but it is a power player in the entertainment world.</p> <p>Liberty holds a 34% stake in the event promoter Live Nation, which in turn owns Ticketmaster. The sister company Liberty Global, which is also majority owned by Malone, owns Virgin Media plus the TV production company behind Midsomer Murders and The Only Way is Essex, and 10% of ITV. It also has a stake in the Formula E electric racing series alongside Discovery Communications. Malone owns 29% of the voting rights in Discovery, which is the parent group of Eurosport.</p> <p>F1 is one of Liberty\u2019s biggest single investments and, provided that the deal gets regulatory clearance it will end up with a 35.3% stake, with Malone personally holding 3.1%. Another 1% will be in the hands of Liberty\u2019s chief executive, Greg Maffei, and 24.7% retained by the previous controlling owner, the private equity firm CVC.</p> <p>The purchase is being fuelled with more than $1bn of cash together with payment in Liberty shares and $351m of debt. Liberty is also taking on F1\u2019s existing $4.1bn in bank debt \u2013 meaning Delta Topco has an overall enterprise value of $8bn. It is high-octane and there is good reason for that.</p> <p>F1 has three core revenue streams. Starting at the bottom, in the year to the end of December 2015 $250m came from selling trackside advertising at each of the 19 races and sponsorship of the series. F1\u2019s partners include the parcel delivery service DHL and Heineken, which signed up in June, and will be handing over an estimated $40m&#xa0;annually.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/f1-zip/giv-22601oq1l6TqGTr0D\" data-alt=\"How F1's finances work\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/f1-zip/giv-22601oq1l6TqGTr0D\">How F1's finances work</a> </figure>  <p>There are two other major sources of F1\u2019s revenue \u2013 fees from circuits that host races and broadcasting rights. They each bring in roughly the same amount and last year it came to a combined $1.2bn.</p> <p>Along with $339.4m from other sources this gave Delta Topco total revenue of $1.7bn in 2015 \u2013 with underlying profits of $464m. In the decade that CVC has held the keys F1 has made total net profits of $3.5bn and it has a well-oiled formula.</p> <p>F1 doesn\u2019t own any tracks or teams so costs are kept under tight control. The company only has 356 staff and its biggest single cost is a payment of 63% of its gross profits to the teams as prize money. Over the five years to 2015 the prize money payment shot up nearly 30% to just over $900m due to the boom in interest in F1. It is a staggering sum but it isn\u2019t the only trick under F1\u2019s bonnet.</p> <p>Ecclestone has promoted F1 to emerging markets, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2015/sep/20/f1-singapore-grand-prix-live\" title=\"\">such as Singapore</a> and Bahrain, which view the races as away to boost their global status or drive tourism through the sport\u2019s 400m TV viewers. The limited number of slots on the F1 calendar has fuelled an arms race in the amount countries are prepared to spend to get a race with the highest hosting fees rising to nearly $80m annually.</p> <p>To insulate against inflation, the key contracts contain an escalator clause which increases the amount paid by 10% annually. Only 10% to 20% of them need to be renewed annually as they have an average length of around five years. It gives F1 contracted revenue of $9.3bn up to 2026 which makes it very different to other sports because its financial performance is not related to the events on track.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/sep/04/f1-italian-grand-prix-live\">F1: Nico Rosberg wins Italian Grand Prix \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And CVC has been the biggest winner. Since it invested in F1 in 2006 CVC has extracted $4.4bn from dividends and the sale of stakes in Delta Topco.</p> <p>Pro rata, CVC\u2019s 38.1% stake will give it $1.7bn in cash and shares in Liberty bringing its total haul to $6.1bn \u2013 that is a 532% return on the $965.6m that CVC invested in 2006 putting F1 in pole position to be its most profitable investment.</p> <p>In contrast, CVC made a 314% return from its investment in gaming firm William Hill and 292% from stockbroker Collins Stewart. Although its biggest return is believed to be the 831% it got from the 2005 sale of a Spanish hospital business \u2013 but that only returned \u20ac222m in cash.</p> <p>CVC can\u2019t afford to take its hands off the wheel just yet though as the sale to Liberty is still far from the finish line. Perhaps the biggest hurdle is that the FIA has a 1% stake in Delta Topco which CVC granted it in 2013. The FIA paid just over $458,000 for the stake which is now worth $44m and, according to the share transfer agreement, it can only be cashed in when CVC sells its shares.</p> <p>In order for the sale to proceed consent is needed from the FIA and the European Commission. The FIA has to decide whether Liberty is a \u2018fit and proper\u2019 owner of F1 but the EC may consider it to be conflicted due to its financial interest in the sale. Like any good F1 race a last-minute twist could still be on the cards.</p>",
  "<p>Nothing sharpens the focus on shortcomings like defeat in a city derby. Which, in the case of Rangers, is not to say those issues did not exist before. The club\u2019s return to the Premiership had been at best a slow\u2011burner before matters came crashing down around Mark Warburton\u2019s ears.</p> <p>Last week he returned to the issue of what he perceives as negative coverage of Rangers\u2019 start to the season. He might be best served spending the coming days in a Buddhist retreat. The merits of the manager\u2019s point aside, his key problem now is discord will emanate from another, more damaging source: the club\u2019s own supporter base. Worse Rangers teams than the one who took the field at Celtic Park on Saturday have not been subjected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/sep/10/celtic-v-rangers-scottish-premiership-live\" title=\"\">to a 5-1 trouncing</a> at the hands of their oldest adversaries. Capitulation was the response to a Celtic showing that was probably seven out of 10.</p> <p>That Rangers are in this position, of eight points from five matches and a generally unconvincing state, has three reasons. First, the obscene signing policy of 2012, with wages of \u00a37,000 a week bestowed on players when Rangers were consigned to the bottom tier of the Scottish game, removed any possibility of adequate planning in terms of personnel and cash reserves.</p> <p>Second, Warburton\u2019s recruitment has been highly questionable, his failure to address glaring shortcomings in central defence incredible for a manager of his ability. In a broader context, few of Rangers\u2019 players look like assets. One player who is, Barrie McKay, has had a troubled start to the season, which to be fair Warburton could not have legislated for. Likewise, Martyn Waghorn\u2019s injury has blunted Rangers\u2019 attacking threat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/celtic-rangers-scottish-premiership-match-report\">Celtic surge to Old Firm win over Rangers thanks to Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 hat-trick</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Were Joey Barton called Hamish MacTavish and a summer arrival from Montrose, he would not have been less conspicuous against Celtic. Barton\u2019s signing has been a disaster, the former Burnley man slowing down a team badly in need of the pace which, when applied last season, made Rangers look a strong side. One picture doing the rounds tells a thousand words: of Celtic\u2019s captain, Scott Brown, staring through Barton as the pair exchange pre-match handshakes. Barton\u2019s eyes are fixed on the turf.</p> <p>Niko Kranjcar is so slow he had to be removed at half-time before another of his lumbering tackles triggered a second yellow card. Kranjcar may have exceptional talent but this is a more competitive environment than the veterans series he looks more suited to.</p> <p>Third, Warburton is open to criticism of being one-dimensional. The use of a 4-3-3 formation against Celtic was not so much bold as reckless. Defenders overplayed. The team lacked energy. When 3-1 down, Warburton insisted he had to chase the game when moving to a three-man defence. Andy Halliday, who had starred in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/17/celtic-rangers-scottish-cup-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">the Scottish Cup semi-final victory</a> against Celtic in April, did not start to the bemusement of onlookers. If Halliday had been out of sorts, that owes plenty to his deployment in a more attacking midfield position than is his forte. He should have been the first name on Warburton\u2019s derby teamsheet.</p> <p>However, Warburton is due sympathy in one regard. No other promoted team would be expected to challenge for a title or accept scrutiny in the manner of Rangers. That, of course, owes everything to historical status.</p> <p>Nonetheless, it should not be a leap of faith for Rangers, while obviously trailing Celtic on and off the field, to prove vastly superior to the rest of the Premiership. Resources alone dictate that much; no other side outside of Celtic could afford \u00a31.8m for Joe Garner and his \u00a312,000-a-week salary even before the contracts of Barton, Kranjcar, Philippe Senderos, Clint Hill and others are taken into account.</p> <p>Warburton\u2019s adage is a simple one: \u201cJudge us in May.\u201d This is fair enough but the harsh reality is the manager will not see the end of the season with Rangers if his team continue to sleepwalk through their campaign. Patience is not a commodity associated with the Old Firm.</p> <p>It is also perfectly reasonable to make an early season assessment. A year ago Hearts, with a fraction of Rangers\u2019 resource, emerged from the second tier to win their first five Premier League games. Rangers\u2019 fixture list has not exactly been arduous, in what is essentially a poor league, but they had dropped points to Hamilton and Kilmarnock even before their Celtic debacle.</p> <p>\u201cWe just have to work harder,\u201dWarburton in the immediate aftermath of the derby loss. \u201cWhen you have adversity, work harder. The fans won\u2019t take that and we won\u2019t take that either. At Ibrox next week, we won\u2019t accept anything other than a victory. We are much better than we showed today. We have to be.\u201d</p> <p>Ross County are the visitors on Saturday. A humdrum fixture suddenly has deep meaning; Warburton has an agitated following to bring back on side.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cAn ordinary day ended as the biggest manmade ecological disaster in history,\u201d says one of the taglines. </p> <p>Trailers for the new disaster movie Deepwater Horizon, based on the April 2010 disaster, which will be released later this month, quickly shift from sickly sweet family scenes of Mark Wahlberg bidding farewell to his wife and daughter as he goes off to work on a huge oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico to a desperate fight for survival, as panicked workers scramble to escape the burning oil rig.</p> <p>The Hollywood marketeers are right with their tagline. It was a global disaster with far-reaching human and environmental consequences. Eleven people were killed and about 4.9m barrels of crude oil leaked into the Gulf in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bp-oil-spill\">worst spill in US history</a>.</p> <p>The story of Deepwater Horizon is also \u201ctragedy on an epic scale\u201d for BP, which operated the rig, according to the US corporate governance expert Lynn Stout. The oil company was later found to have been <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/04/bp-reckless-conduct-oil-spill-judge-rules\">grossly negligent in its handling </a>of the well and has faced <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/14/bp-fined-further-25bn-over-deeepwater-horizon-spill\">billions of dollars in penalties</a>.</p> <p>Stout, a professor of corporate and business law at Cornell Law School, chose the story of how profit-driven decisions at BP led to disaster to open her 2012 book The Shareholder Value Myth.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In her view, there are wider lessons to learn from BP\u2019s tale about how costcutting and skimping on safety procedures to secure short-term shareholder gains ended up costing investors in the long run. </p> <p>The Deepwater Horizon disaster is one example of a problem that afflicts many companies, she says. That problem is the idea that the company belongs to its shareholders and exists for one purpose only: to maximise wealth for those shareholders.</p> <p>Six years on from the deadly blowout, you do not have to look far for more examples of companies misbehaving and cutting corners, which subsequently hurts shareholders. </p> <p>Last week, Sports Direct <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/sports-directs-biggest-investors-want-independent-review-mike-ashley-keith-hellawell\">faced anger from shareholders</a> after the company accepted that it had not treated employees properly. The admission followed months of pressure on the retailer\u2019s founder, Mike Ashley, and Sports Direct after the Guardian highlighted <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">a climate of fear </a>at the company\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse in Derbyshire. As the revelations about the company began to batter its reputation, the share price fell and previously quiet stockholders emerged to voice their disquiet.</p> <p>Everyone loses here. The workers, the shareholders and business at large.<br></p> <p>Many companies, particularly smaller ones, will tell you they exist for their employees and customers, as much as for shareholder gains. Yet those who want to serve a wider base of stakeholders may find themselves hamstrung by a legal system that appears to put shareholder interests centre stage. For all their willingness to do good, is it not the primary duty of company directors to create value for shareholders?</p> <p>There does not appear to be a straightforward answer. Lawyers will disagree over how company directors should interpret the 2006 Companies Act, which <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/pdfs/ukpga_20060046_en.pdf\">states in section 172</a> (pdf) that \u201ca director of a company must act in the way he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members\u201d. But for Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, there is no question that this statement makes shareholder primacy explicit. As he put it in a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2015/833.aspx\">speech exploring company ownership</a> last year: \u201cFor the first time in history, shareholder primacy had been hardwired into companies\u2019 statutory purposes.\u201d</p> <p>This idea of shareholder primacy is seen in the way that a company\u2019s share price performance has increasingly become the key measure of success.</p> <p>As in Stout\u2019s Deepwater Horizon example, the pitfalls of this are obvious. When chief executives manage the share price rather than the company itself, short-termism can quickly take over. Investment suffers as shareholders hungry for dividends demand ever increasing payouts, while risk taking rises, as demonstrated to disastrous global effect by the financial crisis.</p> <p>When the shareholder is king, a company\u2019s long-term success and impact on those around it take a back seat.</p> <p>But campaigners for a different kind of capitalism say it does not have to be this way. A growing movement is putting forward a new model, where directors answer to a range of stakeholders, such as employees and the environment, not just investors. Those pushing for change may dare to hope their calls will be answered now that Theresa May is vowing tackle corporate irresponsibility and \u201creform capitalism so that it works for everyone not just the privileged few\u201d.</p> <p>The good news for the prime minister is that a simple amendment to company law could make a big difference. </p> <p>The charity <a href=\"http://bcorporation.uk/meet-b-lab-uk\">B Lab UK</a> is urging the government to pass \u201cbenefit company\u201d legislation. The reform would give companies the option to reject shareholder primacy and be managed for the benefit of all stakeholders, according to the charity, which represents a growing number of so-called B Corps, or benefit corporations. This model has three mandatory elements: a broadened purpose, director accountability and stakeholder transparency.</p> <p>The movement behind benefit corporations <a href=\"https://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps/the-non-profit-behind-b-corps/our-history\">started a decade ago</a> in the US to pioneer the idea that companies are \u201cbest for the world\u201d, rather than best in the world. The movement has spread to include 1,800 B Corps in 50 countries.</p> <p>In some places, laws have been changed for companies to turn themselves into B Corps, but in others, no such change has been deemed necessary. Some corporate governance experts argue that the UK is one such case and the law already allows for a wide range of stakeholders to be considered by company chiefs. At the moment, when a UK company becomes a B Corp, it changes its constitution.</p> <p>However, B Lab UK says a small amendment to the law would clear things up. As the charity\u2019s co-founder James Perry says, for directors worried about where their legal duties lie, a law \u201cgives you a fighting chance, or a platform\u201d to act in the interests of society and the environment.</p> <p>Perry, who helped set up the frozen ready meals retailer Cook, insists that the change would still leave companies with the option to continue putting shareholders first. But ultimately, the market will decide, he says. Those who choose the broader stakeholder model may find that it makes more business sense. The hope is that a sense of purpose raises longer-run success, helps recruit and retain skilled staff, and appeals to customers. The B Corps movement in the UK likes to say it is to business what Fairtrade certification is to coffee.</p> <p>If the new government is serious about shaking up capitalism, this is an easy win. Companies\u2019 corporate and social responsibility programmes can do good, but they do not address the root causes of corporate misbehaviour, misjudgments or recklessness. For that, we must move beyond a world where shareholders reign supreme.</p>",

The region has never flooded in living memory, and in many areas flood insurance was not even available.</p> <p>On Friday during a trip to Washington, Governor John Bel Edwards requested a $2bn bailout package in addition to the money the federal government has already pledged. In a two-day series of meetings with aid brokers in every corner of the capital \u2013 representatives, senators, and the president\u2019s advisers \u2013 Edwards stressed that his state wouldn\u2019t survive without a swift drop of cash.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/08/climate-change-louisiana-floods-increased-risk\">Climate change made Louisiana's catastrophic floods much more likely</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSimply put, we cannot recover without it,\u201d he told a House subcommittee hearing.</p> <p>While Edwards and his constituents await word on the aid bill, the White House did grant the state some measure of relief. In a letter to Edwards, Barack Obama said the Federal Emergency Management Agency (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/23/barack-obama-fema-louisiana-flood-recovery-culture-katrina\">Fema</a>) has so far spent more than $660m in public relief efforts, from housing and food to debris cleaning to the deployment of the National Guard.</p> <p>Normally the state would have to pay back 25% of that cost. But the flood had become so expensive, Obama wrote, that the federal government would cover 90% of those costs, leaving 10% for Louisiana.</p> <p>The financing is so stratospheric that it seems only theoretical to residents back in Louisiana, many of whom are still focused on where they might find a meal each day, or about whether a child\u2019s cough comes from a cold or a more ominous sickness caused by mold contamination.</p> <p>The most cagey home owners \u2013 some have experience with Fema, having moved north from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina \u2013 have started maneuvering to avail themselves of the aid money. More than 130,000 households have applied for federal relief.</p> <p>But many residents say bureaucratic restrictions make it nearly impossible to attain grants. Some are technical requirements about floodplains versus non-floodplains, or 49% damage versus 50% damage, or a house that is raised versus ground-level. The restrictions have kept some residents awake at night, at a loss not just for a home but seemingly their financial future.</p> <p>Heather Feierabend, for instance, lives in Park Forest, a neighborhood on the east side of Baton Rouge that had never before flooded. Her father, Ernie, lives next door, and during the floods they moved as many of their belongings as possible upstairs before escaping on a boat manned by firefighters.</p> <p>The water destroyed the ground floors of both homes, which they have now gutted with the help of friends and neighbors. But Feierabend, a teacher, was denied Fema money to rebuild. She doesn\u2019t technically own her home. Her father has, since the 1970s.</p> <p>And her father, she said, didn\u2019t qualify for that home either. \u201cHe only qualifies for the house he lives in, next door,\u201d she said. So her home \u2013 like many others \u2013 has fallen through a wide gap in the system. The Feierabends didn\u2019t do anything illegal or untoward, or even uncommon, but they find themselves tumbling outside the federal government\u2019s safety net.</p> <p>For now, Feierabend said, she\u2019s living among friends who have taken in her and her son. She sees herself as lucky, and repeats a refrain heard among many of her neighbors. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be self-pitying,\u201d she said. \u201cSo many people have it worse. At least I have friends who have been so kind to me.\u201d</p> <p>For now her home sits disassembled, awaiting repairs. She has tried to lure a contractor there to give an estimate, but they are too overwhelmed with the glut of similar homes. Whatever the estimate is, she said, \u201cit\u2019s going to add up\u201d.</p> <p>How will she pay for that, on a teacher\u2019s salary?</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t. I haven\u2019t figured that out yet.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson has endorsed a new cross-party campaign created by prominent pro-Brexit politicians aimed at pressuring Theresa May into fully delivering on the promise that Britain will leave the EU.<br></p> <p>Johnson, a prominent leave campaigner who is now foreign secretary in May\u2019s government, said the Change Britain campaign, led by the pro-Brexit Labour MP Gisela Stuart, would ensure the UK gained control over \u201claws, borders, money and trade\u201d as it exited the EU.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/10/business-leaders-politicians-attack-fox-over-lazy-accusations\">Business leaders and MPs attack Liam Fox over 'fat and lazy' accusations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His decision to record a message supporting Change Britain indicated the continued tensions over the issue within May\u2019s government, where Johnson, along with other prominent pro-Brexiters Liam Fox and David Davis, is seen as pressing the case for a rapid and comprehensive exit.</p> <p>Adding to the pressure on May this weekend, the former culture secretary, John Whittingdale, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/10/theresa-may-should-invoke-article-50-within-weeks-says-john-whit/\">said in an interview on Sunday</a> that she should invoke article 50, which triggers the formal process for EU departure, within weeks, rather than waiting for next year. </p> <p>It also emerged that the new manifesto for Change Britain <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/10/brexit-camp-abandons-350-million-pound-nhs-pledge\">makes no mention of the leave campaign\u2019s pledge</a> of a \u00a3350m-a-week bonanza for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">NHS</a> if Britain left the EU.</p> <p>Many senior figures from Vote Leave are involved in Change Britain. As well as Johnson and Stuart, these include Michael Gove, the Tory former justice secretary, the former chancellor Nigel Lawson, Digby Jones, former head of the CBI, and David Owen, the former Labour foreign secretary.</p> <p>The NHS pledge was at the heart of the Vote Leave message in the run-up to the 23 June vote, and was displayed on its official battlebus, but the <a href=\"http://www.changebritain.org/\">website for Change Britain</a>, which, the group says, aims to \u201cdeliver the UK\u2019s referendum result in the most effective way\u201d, makes no mention of the NHS.</p> <p>Instead, Change Britain\u2019s \u201cBrexit Means Brexit\u201d page said any savings made as a result of no longer having to pay into the EU budget should be spent on guaranteeing \u201ccontinued funding for farming, science, universities and poorer regions of the UK\u201d. </p> <p>Anna Soubry, the pro-remain Tory MP and former minister for small business, said it was outrageous that the leave campaigners had \u201cpeddled that lie\u201d during the campaign and were now quietly abandoning it.</p> <p>The remain camp argued all along that it was wrong to claim that the UK sent \u00a3350m a week to Brussels, as this was the gross figure and did not take account of the large sums of money that came back in EU farm and other subsidies, including structural funds and education and research grants. The idea that so much extra money could be guaranteed for the NHS post-Brexit was also challenged as totally unrealistic.</p> <p>Soubry, a leading light in Open Britain, the successor to the remain campaign, added: \u201cThey should all hang their heads in shame. There were many people, particularly in less wealthy areas, who were convinced by Leave\u2019s claim that if we left the EU we would be able to pour millions more into the NHS. The danger now is these people will become even more disillusioned with all politicians because this lot misled them.\u201d</p> <p>A group of more than 20 Labour MPs, meanwhile, have written an open letter to the leading Brexiters in Change Britain asking that they apologise over the \u00a3350m promise if it is not kept.</p> <p>There should be \u201cno escaping this pledge for the leave campaign\u201d, wrote the MPs, among them Liz Kendall, Chuka Umunna and Mary Creagh. The letter says: \u201cThey cannot walk away from it now, disown it or pretend it never happened. They must either admit it was a lie and apologise to their voters, or justify it and explain when it is coming.\u201d</p> <p>But speaking on Sunday, Stuart denied that anyone had been misled or that the pledge had been dropped.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, the priority was the NHS, but you need to be in government to actually implement that,\u201d she told BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr show of the pledge. \u201cFirst of all we\u2019ve got to leave, and then we can make the decisions. To me and to many of us the priority is the NHS.\u201d</p> <p>In his message for Change Britain, Johnson said: \u201cOn 23 June the people of this country voted to leave the European Union and they voted for change. <br></p> <p>\u201cThey did so by a clear majority. But there were many people who also voted for remain. So it\u2019s absolutely vital that we work together, leavers and remainers, as we seize the opportunities that this country now has to forge a positive and exciting new relationship, not just with the European Union, but also with the rest of the world; changing Britain and making it global again. </p> <p> \u201cNow, more than ever, we need to show the British people that as politicians we are listening to what they have to say. </p> <p>\u201cBrexit means Brexit and that means delivering on their instructions and restoring UK control over our laws, borders, money and trade.\u201d </p>",

  "<p>Where did the \u201ccyber\u201d in \u201ccyberspace\u201d come from? Most people, when asked, will probably credit William Gibson, who famously introduced the term in his celebrated 1984 novel, <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/neuromancer.html\"><em>Neuromancer</em></a>. It came to him while watching some kids play early video games. Searching for a name for the virtual space in which they seemed immersed, he wrote \u201ccyberspace\u201d in his notepad. \u201cAs I stared at it in red Sharpie on a yellow legal pad,\u201d he later recalled, \u201cmy whole delight was that it meant absolutely nothing.\u201d </p> <p>How wrong can you be? Cyberspace turned out to be the space that somehow morphed into the networked world we now inhabit, and which might ultimately prove our undoing by making us totally dependent on a system that is both unfathomably complex and fundamentally insecure. But the cyber- prefix actually goes back a long way before Gibson \u2013 to the late 1940s and Norbert Wiener\u2019s book, <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/cybernetics-or-control-and-communication-animal-and-machine\"><em>Cybernetics, Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine</em></a>, which was published in 1948. </p> <p>Cybernetics was the term <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener\">Wiener</a>, an MIT mathematician and polymath, coined for the scientific study of feedback control and communication in animals and machines. As a \u201ctransdiscipline\u201d that cuts across traditional fields such as physics, chemistry and biology, cybernetics had a brief and largely unsuccessful existence: few<strong> </strong>of the world\u2019s universities now have departments of cybernetics. But as Thomas Rid\u2019s absorbing new book, <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/rise-of-the-machines.html\">The Rise of the Machines: The Lost History of Cybernetics</a> shows, it has had a long afterglow as a source of mythic inspiration that endures to the present day.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The dream of technology augmenting human capabilities is an enduring theme in the evolution of computing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is because at the heart of the cybernetic idea is the proposition that the gap between animals (especially humans) and machines is much narrower than humanists believe. Its argument is that if you ignore the physical processes that go on in the animal and the machine and focus only on the information loops that regulate these processes in both, you begin to see startling similarities. The feedback loops that enable our bodies to maintain an internal temperature of 37C, for example, are analogous to the way in which the cruise control in our cars operates.</p> <p><a href=\"https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/thomas-rid(3215c4c1-55e7-4a6f-81be-b9c1a8eec2ed)/biography.html\">Dr Rid</a> is a reader in the war studies department of King\u2019s College London, which means that he is primarily interested in conflict, and as the world has gone online he has naturally been drawn into the study of how conflict manifests itself in the virtual world. When states are involved in this, we tend to call it \u201ccyberwarfare\u201d, a term of which I suspect Rid disapproves \u2013 on the grounds that warfare is intrinsically \u201ckinetic\u201d (like Assad\u2019s barrel bombs) \u2013 whereas what\u2019s going on in cyberspace is much more sinister, elusive and intractable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/23/virtual-reality-cool-empty-community-oculus-rift\">Virtual reality may look cool, but it will feel empty without community | Claire L Evans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In order to explain how we\u2019ve got so far out of our depth, Rid has effectively had to compose an alternative history of computing. And whereas most such histories begin with Alan Turing and Claude Shannon and John von Neumann, Rid starts with Wiener and wartime research into gunnery control. For him, the modern world of technology begins not with the early digital computers developed at Bletchley Park, Harvard, Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania but with the interactive artillery systems developed for the US armed forces by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperry_Corporation\">Sperry gyroscope company</a> in the early 1940s.</p> <p>From this unexpected beginning, Rid weaves an interesting and original story. The seed crystal from which it grows is the idea that the Sperry gun-control system was essentially a way of <em>augmenting</em> the human gunner\u2019s capabilities to cope with the task of hitting fast-moving targets. And it turns out that this dream of technology as a way of augmenting human capabilities is a persistent \u2013 but often overlooked \u2013 theme in the evolution of computing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4da4a7bbe7e1bc2a3f3f04c6b1c02671ab1c4f0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4da4a7bbe7e1bc2a3f3f04c6b1c02671ab1c4f0f/0_0_800_533/500.jpg\" alt=\"A mechanical dog manufacuted by robot maker Boston Dynamics\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mechanical dog manufactured by robot maker Boston Dynamics.

The underlying assumption is that the technology is empowering \u2013 which of course in principle it can be. What, after all, is the web but a memory aid for people? What the dominant narrative conveniently ignores, though, is that the motive force for most tech industry development is not human empowerment but profit. Which is why Facebook wants its 1.7 billion users to stay within its walled garden rather than simply being empowered by the open web.</p> <p>The dream of computing as a way of augmenting human capabilities, however, takes empowerment seriously rather than using it as a cover story. It is, for example, what underpinned the life\u2019s work of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart\">Douglas Engelbart</a>, the man who came up with the computer mouse and the windowing interface that we use today. And it motivated <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider\">JCR Licklider</a>, the psychologist who was, in a way, the godfather of the internet and whose paper <a href=\"https://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/people/psz/Licklider.html\"><em>Man-Computer Symbiosis</em></a> is one of the canonical texts in the augmentation tradition. Even today, a charitable interpretation of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass\">Google Glass project</a> would place it firmly in the same tradition. Ditto for virtual reality (VR).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Moonlight Maze attack was breathtaking in its ambition. It was probably small beer compared with what goes on now</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Given that he starts from cybernetics, the trajectory of Rid\u2019s narrative makes sense. It takes him into the origins of the concept of the \u201ccyborg\u201d \u2013 the notion of adapting humans to their surroundings rather than the other way round \u2013 an idea that was first explored by Nasa and the US military. Thence he moves into the early history of automation, and startling tales about ambitious early attempts to create robots that might be useful in combat. In 1964, for example, US army contractors built the Pedipulator, an 18ft tall mechanical figure that \u201clooked like a prototype of a <em>Star Wars</em> biped\u201d. The idea was to create some kind of intelligent full-body armour that would turn troops, in effect, into walking tanks.</p> <p>From there, it\u2019s just a short leap to virtual reality \u2013 also, incidentally, first invented by the US military in the early 1980s. Rid\u2019s account of the California counter-culture\u2019s obsession with VR is fascinating, and includes the revelation that Timothy Leary, the high priest of LSD, was an early evangelist. Leary and co thought that VR was better than LSD because it was inherently social whereas an LSD trip was just chemically induced isolation. Then Rid moves on to the arrival of public-key cryptography, which put military-grade encryption into the hands of citizens for the first time (and which had been secretly invented at GCHQ, so one can imagine its discombobulation when civilian geeks independently came up with it).</p> <p>The final substantive chapter of <em>Rise of the Machines</em> is about conflict in cyberspace, and contains the first detailed account I\u2019ve seen of the \u201cMoonlight Maze\u201d attack on US networks. Rid describes this as \u201cthe biggest and most sophisticated computer network attack made against the United States in history\u201d. It happened <em>in 1996</em>, which means that it belongs in prehistory by internet timescales. And it originated in Russia. The attack was breathtaking in its ambition and comprehensiveness. But it was probably small beer compared with what goes on now, especially given that China has entered the cyberfray.</p> <p>In some ways, Rid\u2019s chapter on conflict in cyberspace seems orthogonal to his main story, which is about how Wiener\u2019s vision of cybernetics functioned as an inspirational myth for innovators who were interested in what Licklider and Engelbart thought of as \u201cman-machine symbiosis\u201d and human augmentation.

Journalists and politicians and academics would say \u201ccyber\u201d and roll their eyes at it. Sometimes they would ask where the funny phrase actually came from. So every time my boss introduced me as, \u201cHey, this is Thomas, he\u2019s our cyber expert,\u201d I cringed. So I thought I should write a book. Nobody, after all, had properly connected today\u2019s \u201ccyber\u201d to its historic ancestor, cybernetics.</p> <p>Initially I wanted to do a polemic. But then I presented some of the history at Royal Holloway, and to my surprise, some of the computer science students warmed to \u201ccyber\u201d after my talk, appreciating the idea\u2019s historical and philosophical depth. So I thought, yes, let\u2019s do this properly.</p> <p><strong>You teach in a department of war studies, so I can see that </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/cyberwar\"><strong>cyberwar</strong></a><strong> might be your thing. But you decided that you needed to go way back \u2013 not only to </strong><a href=\"http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Wiener_Norbert.html\"><strong>Norbert Wiener</strong></a><strong> and the original ideas of cybernetics, but also to the counter-cultural background, to personal computing, virtual reality (VR) and computer conferencing. Why? </strong><br>War studies, my department, is an open tent. Crossing disciplinary boundaries and adding historical and conceptual depth is what we do. So \u201cmachines\u201d fits right in. I think understanding our fascination with communication and control today requires going back to the origins, to Wiener\u2019s cybernetic vision after the second world war. Our temptation to improve ourselves through our own machines \u2013 \u201cbig brains\u201d in the 50s, or artificial intelligence today \u2013 is hardwired into who we are as humans. We don\u2019t just want to play God, we want to beat God, building artificial intelligence that\u2019s better than the non-artificial kind. This hubris will never go away. So one of our best insurance is to study the history of cybernetic myths, the promise of the perennially imminent rise of the machines.</p> <p><strong>How long did the book take to research and write? </strong><br>It took me about three years. It wasn\u2019t hard to stay focused \u2013 the story throughout the decades was just too gripping: here was the US air force building touch-sensitive cybernetic manipulators to refuel nuclear-powered long-range bombers, and there\u2019s LSD guru <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/18/timothy-leary-papers-sale-lsd\">Timothy Leary</a> discovering the \u201ccybernetic space\u201d inside the machines as a mind-expansion device even better than psychedelic drugs \u2013 better, by the way, because the \u201cmachine high\u201d was more creative and more social than getting stoned on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/17/magic-mushrooms-lift-severe-depression-in-clinical-trial\">psilocybin</a>.</p> <p><strong>One group that\u2019s missing from your account is the engineers who sought to implement old-style cybernetic ideas in real life.

Did you think of including stuff like that? If not, why not? </strong><br>The cybernetic story is expansive. I had to leave out so much, especially in the 50s and 60s, the heyday of cybernetics. For example, the rise of cybernetics in the Soviet Union is a story in itself, and almost entirely missing from my book, as is much of the sociological work that was inspired by Norbert Wiener\u2019s vision (much of it either dated or impenetrable). Cybersyn has been admirably covered, in detail, by Eden Medina\u2019s <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/cybernetic-revolutionaries-2.html\"><em>Cybernetic Revolutionaries</em></a>. I would also mention Ronald Kline\u2019s recent book, <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/cybernetics-moment.html\"><em>The Cybernetics Moment</em></a>.</p> <p><strong>Your account of the Moonlight Maze investigation (of a full-on state-sponsored cyberattack on the US) is fascinating and scary.

But meanwhile we\u2019ve been fooling ourselves, expecting blackouts and explosions and planes falling out of the sky as a result of cyberattacks. Physical effects happen, but have been a rare exception. What we\u2019re seeing instead is even scarier: an escalation of cold war-style spy-versus-spy subversion and sabotage, covert and hidden and very political, not open and of military nature, like nuclear weapons. Over the last year we have observed several instances of intelligence agencies breaching victims, stealing files, and dumping sensitive information into the public domain: often through purpose-created leak forums, or indeed though Wikileaks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/01/bjork-digital-review-somerset-house-vulnicura-virtual-reality-vr\">Bj\u00f6rk Digital review \u2013 to virtual reality and beyond</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Russian agencies have been leading this trend, most visibly by trying to influence the US election through hacking and dumping.

One of the interesting parts of your story is the revelation that we have been here before \u2013 except last time, enthusiasm for VR was inextricably bound up with psychedelic drugs. Then, it was tech plus LSD; now it\u2019s tech plus money. The same cycle applies to artificial intelligence. So cybernetics isn\u2019t the only field to have waxed and waned. </strong><br>Absolutely not. I was often writing notes on the margins of my manuscript in <a href=\"http://www.fernandezandwells.com/\">Fernandez &amp; Wells</a> in Somerset House, where London fashion week used to happen. Technology is a bit like fashion: every few years a new craze or trend comes around, drawing much attention, money, and fresh talent. Right now, it\u2019s automation and VR, a bit retro-60s and -90s respectively. Of course our fears and hopes aren\u2019t just repeating the past, and the technical progress in both fields has been impressive. But we\u2019ll move on before long, and the next tech wave will probably have a retro feature again.</p> <p><strong>At a certain moment in the book you effectively detach the prefix \u201ccyber\u201d from its origins in wartime MIT and the work of Norbert Wiener and use it to build a narrative about our networked and computerised existence \u2013 cyborgs, cyberspace, cyberwar etc. Your justification, as I see it, is that there was a cybernetic moment and it passed. But had you thought that a cybernetic analysis of our current plight in trying to manage cyberspace might be insightful?

Or is that pushing the idea too far? </strong><br>You\u2019re raising a fascinating question here, one that I struggled with for a long time. First, I think \u201ccyber\u201d detached itself from its origins, and degenerated from a scientific concept to an ideology. That shift began in the early 1960s. My book is merely chronicling this larger history, not applying cybernetics to anything. It took me a while to resist the cybernetic temptation, if you like: the old theory still has charm and seductive force left in its bones \u2013 but of course I never wanted to be a cyberneticist.</p> <p><em>The Rise of the Machines is published by Scribe (\u00a320). </em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/rise-of-the-machines.html\"><em>Click here to order a copy for \u00a316.40</em></a><em> </em></p>",

Twenty-three people were injured. \u201cWe were flying along as smooth as can be and then were just slapped massively from the top as if someone had torpedoed us,\u201d one passenger told journalists.</p> <p>The aircraft, a Boeing 767-300, made&#xa0;an emergency landing at Shannon airport and the injured were taken to&#xa0;University Hospital, Limerick. No one was seriously hurt but all went through a terrifying experience and one, say experts, which will increasingly affect flights.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the US alone it is estimated that disruption from turbulence already costs more than $500 million a year</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt is predicted there will be more and more incidents of severe clear-air turbulence, which typically comes out of the blue with no warning, occurring in the near future as climate change takes its effect in the stratosphere,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~williams/\" title=\"\">Dr Paul Williams</a>, a Royal Society research fellow at Reading University, said last week. \u201cThere has already been a steady rise in incidents of severe turbulence affecting flights over the past few decades. Globally, turbulence causes dozens of fatalities a year on small private planes and hundreds of injuries&#xa0;to passengers in big jets. And as carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere keep on rising, so will the numbers of incidents.\u201d</p> <p>Williams said that at heights of around 10 to 12km (6-7 miles), a typical cruising altitude for a modern passenger jet plane, temperature changes caused by increased amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have the effect of making different layers of airflow move at increased speeds relative to each other. When this unstable airflow produces clear-air turbulence \u2013 and there are no visual clues to give a pilot warning of what lies ahead \u2013 then the aircraft is thrown about with considerable force. \u201cIf the effect is severe, it will overcome the force of gravity and fling people out of their seats. Turbulence of this severity is being encountered by planes thousands of times a year now,\u201d Williams added.</p> <p>In the United States alone, it is estimated that the damage, delays and&#xa0;disruption from turbulence already&#xa0;cost more than $500m (\u00a3374m)&#xa0;a year. And all studies suggest that incidents are getting more frequent. For example, in 2006, the US Federal Aviation Administration reported that the number of incidents in which turbulence caused serious accidents in US flights more than doubled between 1982 and 2003. Crucially, that figure includes adjustments made for the rise in numbers of flights produced by the growth of the aviation industry. \u201cSeveral other studies have produced the same, consistent pattern of a considerable rise in incidents of turbulence \u2013 even after adjusting for the aviation industry\u2019s growth,\u201d added Williams.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/08/heathrow-expansion-say-goodbye-to-emissions-targets-and-budget-flying\">Heathrow expansion: Planned price hikes will end budget flights not airport emissions | Leo Barasi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As to actions that should be taken, Williams is clear. \u201cAlways keep your seat belt fastened. I never used to bother until I started studying incidents of turbulence and the injuries involved. Of course, that won\u2019t protect you from someone else getting thrown in the air and landing on you, but it will substantially minimise your chances of getting hurt.\u201d</p> <p>As to tackling turbulence, limiting&#xa0;carbon dioxide emissions would be an obvious move, he added, though this remains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/03/breakthrough-us-china-agree-ratify-paris-climate-change-deal\" title=\"\">a problematic political goal</a>. More direct measures would be to improve the science of turbulence prediction and to find better meteorological algorithms for forecasting such incidents. Williams said that at present, the science involved had not reached the required precision for forecasting where and when turbulence might strike, but it was improving all the time.</p> <p>\u201cEngineers are also working on a technique that involves shining ultraviolet light along the path that a plane is taking,\u201d added Williams. \u201cThen you analyse the reflections that come back to the craft. From that, it has been found you can tell when you are likely to hit a turbulence pocket of air that is going to give the aircraft a severe buffeting.\u201d</p> <p>The problem is that retrofitting all the passenger aircraft currently in operation with ultraviolet detection systems would \u2013 at present \u2013 cost more than the expense that turbulence imposes on the air travel industry.</p> <p>\u201cIt is currently too expensive for airlines. However, as more carbon dioxide is pumped into the atmosphere, more turbulence disrupts flights, and more passengers get hurt, then we might see some action,\u201d added Williams. \u201cThis problem is not going to go away.\u201d</p>",

Protest, which opens later this month at the Victoria Miro gallery in London, will dramatise some of them. It is a show, in some ways, nostalgic for the dualities of 60s protest (currently celebrated in the V&amp;A exhibition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/21/san-francisco-exhibition-victoria-albert-revolution-silicon-valley\">You Say You Want a Revolution?</a>). Taking as a starting point the American painter Alice Neel\u2019s prophetic 1936 painting, <em>Nazis Murder Jews</em>, which depicts a Communist party torchlight parade through the streets of New York City, it collects new and recent pieces that address in different ways our own disorienting political moment.

The first was that, with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">phenomenon of Trump</a> in America and the threats to cohesive democracy in Europe, the need for a politically engaged art has rarely been more urgent. The second was that the means to that end are necessarily nuanced. It is harder to challenge power if, in a globalised world, you don\u2019t know precisely where power lies. How do you stick it to the man, when the man in question is not a state or a corporation, but, increasingly a tax-dodging global network of information systems run by smart former hippies with untold wealth?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81a3bb6b47f2e91635f706a9e7085523134556d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81a3bb6b47f2e91635f706a9e7085523134556d6/0_0_2289_3215/712.jpg\" alt=\"Nazis Murder Jews 1936, by Alice Neel\" width=\"712\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nazis Murder Jews, 1936, by Alice Neel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy the Artist\u2019s Estate and Victoria Miro, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Western artists are generally uneasy at being viewed as political in the way that Weiwei has come to accept; they see it as a limit on their asserted freedom.

Sarah Sze, the American sculptor, who creates wonderful, unsettling mind maps of consumerist detritus that spill across the gallery floor, fell foul of the Chinese censors in Guangzhou. While in no way comparing her situation to that of Ai Weiwei, in some ways confronting the blunt instrument of censorship gave her work extra force and clarity, she suggested.</p> <p>\u201cProtest requires focus,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the Occupy movement could have focused around one moment or image \u2013 like John and Yoko in a bed \u2013 it would have helped that movement a lot. My work really reflects the sense, I think, that we have masses of information coming at us from sources we don\u2019t know, and the speed of that makes the hierarchy of what to protest against very slippery all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Sze is somewhat wistful for the simple visual protests of her student years. \u201cAt my American college the entire main campus was filled with shanty towns protesting apartheid. A lot of students were kicked out as a result. Those are the kinds of things where art can be dangerous to power.\u201d</p> <p>In our digital age did she feel that any solid act of making becomes a political act?</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s an incredible longing for stillness,\u201d she said, \u201cin the way that you stand in front of a Vermeer and are having a physical conversation with Vermeer across time and place. The idea of the hand-made itself can be quite conservative. But what seems important to me is how you create a moment where you feel the presence of the maker, a live conversation. You see it in the growth of live events and talks and happenings. The premium on storytelling. Museum attendance rates even have gone through the ceiling.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d11734090ceb31f463be92e456c1f19c3edb1d2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d11734090ceb31f463be92e456c1f19c3edb1d2e/0_0_4096_2522/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ai Weiwei\u2019s installation depicting a scene from his time in prison\" width=\"1000\" height=\"616\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ai Weiwei\u2019s installation depicting a scene from his time in prison.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That one-to-one connection in itself might suggest a form of protest at the way culture and relationships are now mediated \u2013 the acceptance that conversation and intimacy are structurally eavesdropped by corporations and government.</p> <p>One of the motivations for American Doug Aitken\u2019s ongoing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/mar/25/barbican-station-to-station-art-exhibition-doug-aitken\"><em>Station to Station</em></a> project, which took groups of artists coast to the coast in the States by train, making spontaneous 60s-style happenings on the way, was to avoid any mediation at all.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted something that existed outside any system,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted a living platform for the artists to experiment. To be open to what crosses your path.\u201d</p> <p>What were the moments in that journey that he enjoyed most?</p> <p>\u201cI think of an artist like Ed Ruscha, famous for his painting. His response was to make 300 cactus omelettes out in the desert,\u201d he said. \u201cOr a musician like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/28/station-to-station-film-review\">Beck </a>who said he had always wanted to work with, like, a huge choir of gospel singers but he had never been allowed to do it in the commercial sector. So we were able to do that in an abandoned drive-in theatre in the middle of the desert where the train stopped, and the sound of this vocal was like a huge turbine engine, at dusk, and the warm wind blowing and you are in the middle of nowhere in America. It feels untethered to any existing system.

It is an honourable tradition. The abstract painter Joan Mir\u00f3 was never a political activist in a conventional sense, but he was always his own man. When he was asked late in life what he had done to oppose General Franco, he didn\u2019t hesitate to reply: \u201cFree and radical things.\u201d</p> <p>Aitken agreed. \u201cAny worthwhile art is never optional,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a political strategy.

Is it ever more important as an artist to make those statements?</strong><br>Fear is a very unfortunate thing for a culture if you want to make it vibrant and dynamic. And fear of offence shows you are scared of what happens if people express their opinions. That often ends up in a kind of stagnation, with everyone holding each other at gunpoint. It also ends up giving men like Nigel Farage or Donald Trump their popularity, because people are fed up being told what they can or cannot say in public. They vote as a protest, no matter what the consequences of it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The really frightening thing is that the generation now in their 20s, they don\u2019t believe things can be better</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>How do we process these things?

You are confronted with something physical and hopefully the art statement is a bit more nuanced and even profound. We recently did a <a href=\"http://www.tamuseum.org.il/about-the-exhibition/elmgreen-dragset\">show in Israel</a> at the Tel Aviv museum. In their main hall, we put a full-scale replica of a section of the Berlin Wall. We moved to Berlin soon after the wall came down, so we felt we could speak about walls in general and hoped that it would make people think about the wall that had been built between Palestine and Israel. We come from outside, we don\u2019t live with that conflict. But we could speak about our experience of how important it was for us that the Berlin Wall came down</p> <p><strong>What response did you get?</strong><br>People were moved by it, I think, especially because we did no finger pointing. It was something for them to stand in front of a wall as a single person being blocked in their movement. And we were of course also speaking about Donald Trump\u2019s idea of building a wall at the Mexican border. It is not uncommon to try to solve problems by putting up a physical barrier.

We have lost our sense of being good citizens, of having a wider vision. That sounds quite old school and nostalgic, but it is true. Politics has just become economics \u2013 how much do I pay in tax, how much do I get? The internet has made us very egocentric individuals. We are no longer proud of, say, being part of a third generation of steel workers that built a country. We call ourselves \u201cworking class\u201d or \u201cartist\u201d or \u201cfeminist\u201d or \u201chomosexual\u201d in a very different way from the way we would have said those things in the 1960s.

That piece was then accepted for a triennial in Guangzhou. When we were shipping it we were contacted by the Chinese authorities saying they wanted specific front pages to be removed.</p> <p><strong>What was the problem?<br></strong>It turned out that every front page I was being asked to remove said something about China; it could be just a phrase or something. So I made a new version for China. The piece was actually on the floor, like it was protecting the floor, spattered with paint and so on. So I took black paint and painted out the parts they wanted redacted and then mentioned the fact in the wall note. For this show, I have done the opposite.

He lives, inevitably, in California. </strong></p> <p><strong>Did you see <em>Station to Station</em> in the tradition of the great American road trip of the 50s and 60s?</strong><br>I did, but the project was born out of a desire for action. It\u2019s really interesting how segregated music, art, cinema, books and so on are. With <em>Station to Station</em>,<em> </em>instead of critiquing this, we tried to create something that erases the separation, that allowed many artists to be in motion together.</p> <p><strong>Do you think that fragmentation is a way of controlling those cultural forces?</strong><br>I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a conspiracy. Different mediums create infrastructures and infrastructures slow down the possibilities for change. It\u2019s funny. When I was talking to the gallery about Protest it conjured those ideas of a feminist rally in 1978 and people standing out in the cold with placards. The tools we have to work with now are so different. The power of an image to transmit an idea coherently is so much reduced. Take those seminal images from Vietnam \u2013 the monk setting himself on fire or the child running from the napalm. Those images were disseminated by conventional media. Now there\u2019s a constant river of images from millions of iPhones. The question is: what has potency? Technology is opening up incredible new possibilities but also dangers, not least a sense of the loss of self. It is a twilight that we are living in right now, which is very unpredictable and also very stimulating.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t separate social and political work from any other art.

Do we not need to find a direct way to engage with it?</strong><br>It\u2019s an interesting question and a strange time to ask it. What I see mostly is an incredible political apathy. By and large, the political system appears so corporate-driven that people have a hard time seeing how they can affect it. When you get to that point, real change comes from secession. The most interesting projects or groups or actions now don\u2019t exist in opposition in a traditional protest way, but as something entirely separate from the mainstream, for example, the Slow Food Movement, which is people following something they believe in ethically but also taking away the capital that is funding the existing system. They are voting with what they purchase or don\u2019t purchase.</p> <p><strong>Can art work in the same way?</strong><br>I don\u2019t separate social and political work as different from any other art. The value of any art is to be curious and to forge new languages and questions. The whole landscape has changed. You don\u2019t have to wait for a single critic in New York to come to your exhibition or hear your music. We don\u2019t have those high peaks of culture and dark valleys of culture \u2013 everything is eroded down to this kind of universal jungle.

  "<p>Yuval Noah Harari began his academic career as a researcher of medieval warfare.

Then, the story goes, having won tenure at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, he embarked on a crusade of his own. He was invited to teach a course that no one else in the faculty fancied \u2013 a broad-brush introduction to the whole of human activity on the planet. That course became a widely celebrated book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/11/sapiens-brief-history-humankind-yuval-noah-harari-review\" title=\"\"><em>Sapiens</em></a>, championed by Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Barack Obama, and translated into 40 languages. It satisfied perfectly an urgent desire for grand narrative in our fragmenting Buzz-fed world.

First, you never admit that the order is imagined.\u201d The most intriguing section of a wildly intriguing book was the last. Harari\u2019s history of our 75,000 years wound up, as all bibles are apt to do, with apocalyptic prophesy, a sense of an&#xa0;ending.</p> <p>Humanity, Harari predicted, would engineer one more epochal event to rival the agricultural and scientific revolutions. Having evolved to exercise a measure of mastery over our environment, having begun to shape not only our planet, for better and worse, but also our biology, we stand, he argued, at the point of creating networked intelligences with a far greater capacity for reason than our own. The result was likely to be a lose-lose scenario for the species. Sapiens would disappear in the foreseeable future either because they had appropriated such mind-making powers as to become unrecognisable or because they had destroyed themselves through environmental catastrophe. Either way, judgment day was approaching.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Individuals will become a just a collection of 'biochemical subsystems' monitored by global networks</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Like all great epics, <em>Sapiens</em> demanded a sequel. <em>Homo Deus</em>, in which that likely apocalyptic future is imagined in spooling detail, is that book. It is a highly seductive scenario planner for the numerous ways in which we might overreach ourselves. \u201cModernity is a deal,\u201d Harari writes. \u201cThe entire contract can be summarised in a single phrase: humans agree to give up meaning in exchange for power.\u201d That power, he suggests, may in the near term give us godlike attributes: the ability to extend lifespans and even cheat death, the agency to create new life forms, to become intelligent designers of our own Galapagos, the means to end war and famine and plague. There will be a price to pay for this power, however.</p> <p>For a start, Harari suggests, it is destined, if current trends continue, to be vastly unequally distributed. The new longevity and super-human qualities are likely to be the preserve of the techno super-rich, the masters of the data universe. Meanwhile, the redundancy of labour, supplanted by efficient machines, will create an enormous \u201cuseless class\u201d, without economic or military purpose. In the absence of religion, overarching fictions will be required to make sense of the world. Again, if nothing in our approach changes, Harari envisages that \u201cDataism\u201d, a universal faith in the power of algorithms, will become sacrosanct. To utopians this will look a lot like the \u201csingularity\u201d: an all-knowing, omnipresent data-processing system, which is really indistinguishable from ideas of God, to which humans will be constantly connected. To dystopians it will look like that too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/11/sapiens-brief-history-humankind-yuval-noah-harari-review\">Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Harari is mostly, thrillingly or chillingly, sanguine about this prospect. He has an ethicist\u2019s sense of rough justice: what <em>Homo sapiens</em> (in its wisdom) has visited on the natural world through industrialised food production will perhaps one day be visited on <em>Homo sapiens</em>. Individuals will become a just a collection of \u201cbiochemical subsystems\u201d monitored by global networks, which will inform us second by second how we feel\u2026</p> <p>Or perhaps, as Harari is stringent about reminding the reader, they will not. Like all rune-reading, this one comes with plenty of small print. From where we stand, he says, in the accelerating present, no long-term future is imaginable, still less predictable \u2013 and there is plenty of time for questions.

  "<p>Last October, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/25/healthcare-innovation-casues-bad-blood-in-us\" title=\"\">I wrote about a Silicon Valley startup</a> called Theranos that claimed to have developed a revolutionary technology for medical diagnosis. The essence of it was that instead of having a vial of blood extracted from your arm, all that you needed was a pinprick\u2019s worth. The peg for the column was <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901\" title=\"\">an impressive piece of investigative reporting</a> by John Carreyrou of the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>published under the headline \u201cHot Startup Theranos Has Struggled With Its Blood-Test Technology\u201d.</p> <p>Carreyrou had uncovered signs that all was not what it seemed in a startup that was straight from Silicon Valley central casting. It was led by a charismatic, glamorous, secretive young woman, Elizabeth Holmes, who modelled herself on Steve Jobs, right down to the black turtleneck sweater. It had a valuation of $9bn (\u00a36.74bn), which made Holmes the youngest billionaire on the planet.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Governments and media are so dazzled by digital technology that they seem unable to appreciate what\u2019s really going on</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But, unusually for Silicon Valley, it had a board largely comprising east coast establishment boobies: two former US secretaries of state (Henry Kissinger, George Schultz), a former chairman of the Senate armed services committee (Sam Nunn), and a former defense secretary (William Perry). Given that everything these guys know about blood-testing technology could be written in large type on the back of a postage stamp, it was clear that Holmes didn\u2019t want a board that could ask awkward questions.</p> <p>Still, a technology that could eliminate one of the biggest bottlenecks in every hospital in the world would be a boon for humanity and so I expressed the hope that things were not as bad as the <em>WSJ </em>suggested. But it transpired that things were much worse than even Carreyrou suspected. The company has attracted the attention of a slew of federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the FBI, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the northern district of California. It also faces two class-action fraud lawsuits. And <em>Forbes </em>magazine has deleted Holmes from its list of America\u2019s richest self-made women and reduced its previous estimate of her net worth from $4.5bn to zero.</p> <p>The rise and precipitous fall of Theranos is a cautionary tale for our times and is beautifully told by Nick Bilton of <em>Vanity Fair</em> in a <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/09/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-exclusive\" title=\"\">fascinating article</a> that is worth reading in full. For me, though, it has a wider significance, because it illustrates a more general problem with corporations that sail under the tech banner, namely their loud insistence that any attempt to regulate them constitutes an attempt by the analogue world to stifle innovation and hold back the digital future.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/04/dan-lyons-fake-steve-jobs-id-never-felt-old-before\">Dan Lyons: \u2018It made me confront myself\u2026 I\u2019d never felt old before\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the moment, most governments and almost all mainstream media are so dazzled by digital technology that they seem unable to appreciate what\u2019s really going on. What\u2019s happening is that the internet and its associated technologies have morphed from exotic novelties into a general purpose technology (GPT) like mains electricity. That has two implications. The first is that the companies that have mastered the technology are moving out of the tech compound and into the wider world. This is why <a href=\"http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/apple/icar-release-date-rumours-evidence-images-project-titan-new-report-3425394\" title=\"\">Apple is planning to move into the automobile business</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dezeen.com/2016/07/28/elon-musk-vision-autonomous-buses-updated-tesla-master-plan-part-deux/\" title=\"\">Tesla is heading for trucking</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-12/google-ventures-seeks-to-make-name-as-farsighted-health-investor\" title=\"\">Google is moving into healthcare</a>, Uber is aiming to <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21706258-worlds-most-valuable-startup-leading-race-transform-future\" title=\"\">eliminate car ownership</a> altogether and <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-06-16/airbnb-s-international-growth-strategy\" title=\"\">Airbnb has the global hotel business in its sights</a>.</p> <p>The second implication is that, as <a href=\"https://medium.com/humane-tech/there-is-no-technology-industry-44774dfb3ed7#.rq4li4y05\" title=\"\">Anil Dash puts it in an insightful essay</a>, there is no \u201ctech\u201d industry any more. \u201cUber is providing predatory sub-prime leases to its drivers through its subsidiary Xchange,\u201d he writes. \u201cMayonnaise startup Hampton Creek is under [inquiry] for buying back its own mayo.

And absurdly, we\u2019re expecting lawmakers, the media and average consumers to understand these wildly different offerings \u2013 and countless more ranging from mattresses to medical testing \u2013 as part of one single, endlessly complex industry\u201d, namely \u201ctech\u201d.</p> <p>He\u2019s right. It\u2019s absurd. Uber isn\u2019t a tech company any more than John Lewis is an electricity company. Theranos is/was not a tech company but a corporation supposedly providing medical services. Airbnb isn\u2019t a tech company, but an organisation that\u2019s in the hotel business. And so on. All these outfits should be regulated in ways appropriate to the businesses they are actually in, rather than being allowed to sail under a flag of convenience called \u201ctech\u201d. Which is why the fall of Theranos is actually a hopeful sign.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/nov/13/huxley-great-dynasties-aldous\">Thomas Huxley</a> knew a thing or two about the White Cliffs of Dover. \u201cWith vast needles and pinnacles standing out in the sea, sharp and solitary enough to serve as perches for the weary cormorant, [they] confer a wonderful beauty and grandeur,\u201d he wrote in an essay which he simply titled <em>On a Piece of Chalk</em>.</p> <p>For Huxley, a 19th-century pioneer of evolutionary biology, the white stuff was the perfect substance to demonstrate Earth\u2019s antiquity, made up, as it is, of microscopic, calcified creatures whose powdery remains give us the means to record events and express ourselves artistically. It even gave the country its name, Albion, from <em>albus</em> the Latin for white \u2013 a reference to the White Cliffs of Dover.</p> <p>So where better to sample a new national walking route than the chalk cliffs near Dover? The place that helped define the nation and the site of a recently opened section of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/26/england-coast-path-step-closer\">England Coastal Path</a> which, by 2020, will allow outdoor enthusiasts to walk round the 2,790 miles of the nation\u2019s shoreline. This journey will begin at the Scottish border near Bamburgh and take walkers down to Kent and the white cliffs, then along the south coast to Lyme Regis and to Land\u2019s End before heading up to Chepstow \u2013 for a brief break to enjoy the 870-mile Wales Coast Path \u2013 before rejoining its England Coastal Path at Queensferry and then heading to its northwestern extremity at Gretna.

My walk \u2013 from the National Trust\u2019s White Cliffs reception centre to Sandwich \u2013 would take in both refurbished path and new track and is part of the newly opened Kent section of the coastal path.</p> <p>And although only a few miles long, the section covers a startlingly diverse and strikingly beautiful chunk of countryside. The White Cliffs, in mid-summer, burst with colour and wildlife: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/16/alys-fowler-knapweeds\">greater knapweed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/aug/24/plant-of-week-scabiosa-blue-jeans\">scabious</a>, lady\u2019s bedstraw, wild mignonette, sea kale, wild marjoram and thyme providing a multicoloured home for marbled white, chalkmill blue, skipper and meadow brown butterflies.

Patches of bare chalk protrude all along the coastal path here and reveal how painfully thin is the soil layer that supports its plants and wildlife.</p> <p>Nor are the cliffs immutable. Their chalk crumbles at a fairly substantial rate, eroding at an average of a centimetre a year. Every so often a giant chunk collapses into the sea. And for a coastal path this could be bad news. You cannot have the ravages of natures regularly wiping out chunks of your pathway.</p> <p>Fortunately, the new trail, which was launched in 2007 by the then environment secretary David Miliband, has been established so that Nature England will have the power to rebuild, further inland, any path lost to erosion. In addition, land between the coastal path and shore can now be used for recreation, for example, picnics \u2013 a right that was also established when setting up the Coastal Path\u2019s legislation.</p> <p>With its spectacular plant and insect life, together with the hustle of Dover, the world\u2019s busiest passenger port, behind you and the sight of the Calais coastline to your right, this first section was the most intriguing part of our six-mile walk. It is an exhilarating stroll which, after a couple of miles, takes you to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/20/churchill-wartime-tunnels-dover-national-trust\">Fan Bay Deep Shelter</a>, a gun battery cut out of the Kent chalk in 1941 that allowed Britain to shell enemy shipping in the Channel.

From Deal, the path then follows the coast to Sandwich along a beach made of steep shingle. The pace here is slow and heavy though the place is not without its fascinations, the coast being rich in populations of waders and wildfowl.</p> <p>Two thirds of the way to Pegwell Bay, the path used to turn east to Sandwich, but now has an extra three miles of route added to it to take walkers round the peninsula at Shellness and down the River Stour to Sandwich, creating a series of new ponds and reserves that are already being colonised by egrets and other wildfowl. It is a stunning little thoroughfare bursting with history and wildlife and as pleasant a few miles as I have ever walked.</p> <p>Chalk one up to the coastal path.</p>",

I came to view it and that was that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"787b797247807038d4fa896931509400fc5efce9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/787b797247807038d4fa896931509400fc5efce9/0_743_5744_3447/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The book-lined sitting room with a large faded rug.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The book-lined sitting room with a large faded rug.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kristin Perers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I visit, the <a href=\"https://www.crittall-windows.co.uk/\">Crittall</a> front door is left permanently open. Delivery men come and go, and over the course of the day, a small pile of brown packages amasses at the front door, including a box addressed to Mr Reason and Mr Squalor (aka <a href=\"http://jakeanddinoschapman.com/\">the Chapman brothers</a>, whose studio is a few doors down).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m curious about how people congregate. I love creating corners of different experience</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was very masculine when I moved in,\u201d says Lattin of the cavernous apartment. Slowly, she has transformed the space, opening up the spare bedroom to create an office, adding internal French windows to the one remaining bedroom, and replacing the bathroom and kitchen. The industrial proportions of the property have been softened and apportioned with hanging fabric from <a href=\"http://www.caravane.fr/en/\">Caravane </a>and <a href=\"http://www.thelinenworks.co.uk/\">Linen Works</a> . By the front door, Lattin has stitched offcuts of vintage Berber skirts from <a href=\"http://www.theclothshop.net/\">The Cloth Shop</a> on to a plain linen panel. \u201cI love hanging fabric,\u201d says Lattin. \u201cIt\u2019s an affordable way to divide space and it creates a sense of airiness that reminds me of being on holiday.\u201d</p> <p>On open shelves throughout the space are groupings of carefully collected objects. \u201cI\u2019m fairly minimalist,\u201d says Lattin. \u201cI look for objects with texture and character, but it\u2019s really hard to find things in the UK alone \u2013 you end up having to pay a fortune.\u201d She points out some of her favourite finds, including a pink and blue tin plate from Damascus, and a pair of cracked French earthenware pots. For her, the faded pink and grey rug (from <a href=\"http://www.maroctribal.com/\">Maroc Tribal</a>) recaptures the colours of the Nevada desert where she recently travelled to see the artist <a href=\"https://utah.com/wendover/sun-tunnels\">Nancy Holt\u2019s salt tunnels</a>. \u201cIt was the most peaceful experience.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94066d98cd677c6de0f23efea1cc26153e5283ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94066d98cd677c6de0f23efea1cc26153e5283ee/0_2289_2804_1682/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A board of drying clay pots in the kitchen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A board of drying clay pots in the kitchen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kristin Perers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m really interested in the way people sit and congregate,\u201d says Lattin. \u201cAnd I love the idea of creating corners of different experience.\u201d This is clear in her personal space and the way different forms of seating are used within it. In front of a bookshelf is an unupholstered armchair with a nude-pink cushion, and a birch plywood occasional table and stool from the Shoreditch-based workshop <a href=\"http://unto-this-last.myshopify.com/\">Unto This Last</a>. There\u2019s an Ercol bench, vast sofa and secondhand Thonet rocking chair gathered around a patchwork of monochrome rugs. In the kitchen, a Windsor chair faces the dining table and beside the desk space is a deep, built-in daybed.</p> <p>This interest also informs the spirit of her restaurants. \u201cI wanted to open somewhere where you could pitch up by yourself, grab a seat at the bar and find good food, with good wines by the glass without paying a fortune for it or booking it two weeks in advance. The seating, the menu, the wine list\u2026 It\u2019s all about promoting conversation in an intimate environment.\u201d And sharing scobies, of course.</p>",
  "<p>The number of vegans has been rising in the UK \u2013 up by 360% over the past decade. At the moment there are more than half a million in this country, and as ever more disturbing information proliferates regarding the costs of meat and dairy production to the environment, many more look set to switch from steak to seitan. With vegan foodstuffs now commonplace in supermarkets and chefs getting creative with animal-free offerings, what\u2019s stopping the remaining 99% of us? Well, it might just be the reputation. Who wants to be labelled a sanctimonious tofu tout or a clean-eating vanity case? Which is how vegans still tend to be perceived, despite the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/03/veganuary-stars-sign-up-animal-free-month\">Brad Pitt</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/30/ellen-page-being-out-became-more-important-than-any-movie\">Ellen Page</a> flashing their credentials, Emma Watson going to the Met Ball in an \u201canimal-friendly\u201d dress and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/10/beyonce-fur-vegan-restaurant-veganism-lifestyle-celebrity\">Beyonc\u00e9</a> investing in a vegan meal delivery service. It\u2019s time the lifestyle\u2019s profile got a make-over.</p> <h2>Sean O\u2019Callaghan </h2> <p>42, London, Fat Gay Vegan blogger and PR. Founder of the Vegan Beer Festival</p> <p>I was driving along a freeway on a hot summer\u2019s day in Sydney and got stuck behind a truck taking chickens to be killed. I went to KFC all the time then and it made me realise what I was empowering with my money. A few days later, there was a cattle truck accident, some died and some were staggering around hurt, and I thought, \u201cOK, I\u2019m vegetarian.\u201d Later I moved to London and my sister, who teases me about everything, was living with me. She wasn\u2019t vegetarian, but would say: \u201cYou\u2019re going on about how you are ethical, but you\u2019re drinking milk and you know what happens to dairy cows, don\u2019t you?\u201d One day I was like, \u201cActually, you\u2019re right, I\u2019ve been a hypocrite.\u201d I changed overnight. When I switched I realised I hadn\u2019t really done anything. And this was back in 2000 when it wasn\u2019t as easy as today. Now you\u2019ve got almond milk, hemp, soya, even in places like Iceland. I was in Chelsea earlier and there are two vegan ice cream shops just on the King\u2019s Road.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One hot summer\u2019s day I got stuck behind a truck taking chickens to be killed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Before becoming a vegan I was a primary school teacher, then I started blogging and putting on events and it got so busy that I stepped away from teaching. It was hard, but I believed in what I was doing. I want non-vegans to see that they can do everything they do now as vegans, but also support and celebrate those who have made the choice. We\u2019ve just put on the fourth London Vegan Beer Festival and 1,000 people came. It was beautiful. I\u2019m going to hold it in Manchester and Glasgow soon, too.</p> <h2>Diana Pinkett</h2> <p>44, London, Vegan Peasant Catering</p> <p>There is the stereotype of the granola-eating hippie. That\u2019s not me. I became vegan for environmental reasons which really resonated with me. The amount of grain that has to be produced to feed cattle and other livestock doesn\u2019t make much sense when, with all that arable land, you can feed people directly while using less water. You then also have less methane and other polluting waste ending up in the atmosphere and waterways.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The amount of grain produced to feed cattle doesn\u2019t make much sense</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many vegans are not necessarily foodies, especially animal rights people. Their food choices can be made solely on whether something is vegan or not, whereas my chef partner and I are both very interested in food. Some of what we make can be healthy-ish, but it doesn\u2019t come under the health-blog banner, and not the vegan junk food banner either, as it\u2019s a bit more formal. We cater for events like weddings, 60th birthday parties and fundraisers, like the one we just did for Greenpeace.</p> <h2>Joseph Sheridan-Ruddy </h2> <p> 32, Preston, engineering buyer and trainee counsellor</p> <p>People are always saying, \u201cI bet you miss steak don\u2019t you?\u201d But I don\u2019t. I miss Dairy Milk and Nike Air Max more than meat. When I was 28, a friend turned. He didn\u2019t push me, but a couple of things he said prompted me to think about it. One being that he didn\u2019t like the fact that a cow was being \u201craped\u201d for its milk \u2013 almost a feminist perspective. Cows are artificially inseminated to keep them lactating and then their babies are taken off them so there\u2019s a growing part of the vegan community who see it as rape because humans are aware of the concept of consent so we hold that responsibility. That started me thinking about the meat and dairy industry. But I was never sold on the \u201cmeat is murder\u201d thing. It was the word \u201clivestock\u201d that struck me.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I miss Dairy Milk more than meat</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Back then I was working in stores and stock is something that you put on a shelf and sell. I felt so uncomfortable that an animal\u2019s life was being used to make money for a human. I had a fridge full of meat at the time and couldn\u2019t bring myself to eat it. It was the classic eureka moment.</p> <h2>Denai Moore</h2> <p>22, London, musician</p> <p>I grew up in a Jamaican household, where the diet is heavy on animal protein and I was obsessed with pizza, but I started to get tonsillitis often and it always seemed to be after I\u2019d eaten lots of dairy. I celebrated a tour by eating loads of chocolate and immediately became ill so I stopped eating dairy for my voice; the rest followed out of curiosity. It\u2019s been a life changing experience as it\u2019s made me question everything. I had no idea that meat and dairy consumption affected the environment before watching the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/05/think-dairy-farming-is-benign-our-rivers-tell-a-different-story\"><em>Cowspiracy</em></a> and <em>Earthlings</em> literally destroyed me, it\u2019s very blunt and took me several weeks to watch.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Creating vegan Jamaican food is what I\u2019m all about at the moment</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s amazing having access to so much information online which is why I think so many teenagers are becoming vegan. Also, they\u2019re being introduced to veganism without feeling judged. Seeing people blog and post pictures and youtubers living it shows how accessible and inexpensive it can be to be vegan. And you can still enjoy a lot of the foods you ate growing up, like Oreos. Creating vegan Jamaican food is what I\u2019m all about at the moment so I can do my own supper club. And there\u2019s loads of exciting vegan restaurants, too. <a href=\"http://fedbywater.co.uk/\">Fed By Water</a> in Dalston make amazing vegan pizzas with their own mozzarella \u2013 that\u2019s a massive thing for me.</p>"
