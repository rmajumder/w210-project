  "<p>Theresa May is under massive cross-party pressure to grant MPs a vote on any decision to leave or limit UK involvement in the European single market, amid growing outrage at the prospect that parliament could be bypassed over the biggest economic decision in decades.</p> <p>Tory MPs joined forces with former leaders of Labour and the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and Greens to insist that parliament have a say and a vote, pointing out that, while the British people had backed leaving the EU, they had not chosen to leave the biggest trading market in the western world.</p> <p>Former Labour leader Ed Miliband held discussions with pro-EU Tory MPs on Saturday, and was said to be considering tabling an urgent question in the Commons, demanding that May appear before parliament to explain its future role in Brexit decisions, when MPs return on Monday.</p> <p>The SNP and pro-EU Tory MPs Nicky Morgan and Anna Soubry were also considering tabling questions, while former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, now the party\u2019s Brexit spokesman, said it would be appalling if detailed terms of Brexit, including the UK\u2019s future relations with the single market, were not voted on by MPs.</p> <p>Miliband told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cHaving claimed that the referendum was about returning sovereignty to Britain, it would be a complete outrage if May were to determine the terms of Brexit without a mandate from parliament.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no mandate for hard Brexit, and I don\u2019t believe there is a majority in parliament for [it] either. Given the importance of these decisions for the UK economy \u2026 it has to be a matter for MPs.\u201d</p> <p>Clegg said: \u201cMy great worry is that while there will be a vote on repealing the 1972 European Communities Act, which is about the decision to leave the EU, it will be left to the executive alone to decide the terms of Brexit. That would not be remotely acceptable.\u201d</p> <p>The extraordinary cross-party alliance has formed since ministers made a succession of speeches at the Tory party conference in Birmingham last week, which left the clear impression they would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/brexit-theresa-may-prioritises-immigration-curbs-over-free-movement\" title=\"\">press ahead with a hard Brexit</a>. The suggestion was that this would mean leaving the single market if that was the cost of regaining control of the UK\u2019s borders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"578f5732ec71c22d1e56b4a0ecf4e0502f5523d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/578f5732ec71c22d1e56b4a0ecf4e0502f5523d7/0_27_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Exterior shot of Houses of Parliament\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Extraordinary cross-party alliance has formed since Tory party conference in Birmingham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Concern has also grown after business leaders, led by the Confederation of British Industry and EEF (formerly the Engineering Employers Federation), wrote an open letter to the prime minister, warning that a hard Brexit that failed to secure a close relationship with the single market should be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/07/business-leaders-urge-theresa-may-to-avoid-hard-brexit\" title=\"\">ruled out \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d</a>.</p> <p>The letter says the terms on which the UK leaves the EU will be critical to the UK economy, jobs and future investment, while resorting to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/29/liam-fox-looks-to-wto-in-hint-at-hard-brexit-stance\" title=\"\">World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules</a> would leave 90% of UK trading in goods subject to new tariffs. This would mean an additional 20% in extra costs for the UK\u2019s food and drink industry and 10% for car producers.</p> <p>\u201cWe respect the result of the referendum, but the government must make sure that the terms of the deal to leave ensure stability, prosperity and improved living standards,\u201d the business groups say.</p> <p>MPs demanding a vote point out that the 2015 Tory manifesto made explicit that, while there would be an in/out referendum, membership of the single market would still be in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/10/uk-membership-european-single-market-worth-4-more-gdp-eu-referendum-economy\" title=\"\">country\u2019s best economic interests</a>. The manifesto said \u201cWe say: \u2018Yes to the single market\u2019\u201d, and that the party would safeguard the country\u2019s interests within it.</p> <p>May has only said there will be a vote on a repeal bill to remove the 1972 act from the statute book, and that parliament will be kept informed when possible on negotiations on the detailed terms. But there is no prospect of a vote on what form Brexit will take, nor the terms.</p> <p>Ministers, including chancellor Philip Hammond, have been at pains to stress that the government will seek the best possible \u201caccess\u201d to the single market.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s former shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, said: \u201cWe conclude from the Tory conference that they are waving the white flag on remaining in the single market before negotiations have even begun. If there is any move away from it, there should be consultation in parliament and a vote.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/norway-may-block-uk-return-to-european-free-trade-association\" title=\"\">Norway is a member of the single market</a> but not a member of the EU and has to pay into its budget and accept free movement rules.</p> <p>Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas said: \u201cThe assumption that those who voted to leave were also signalling their wish to withdraw from the single market is unfounded. And for a government whose own manifesto commits it to continued membership of the single market, to now seek to overturn that and reinterpret the referendum result, while denying people a say through a vote in parliament, is a constitutional outrage.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, the referendum result must be honoured \u2013 but the vote was to leave the EU, not to inflict the greatest possible damage to our economy and tear apart community cohesion. \u201d</p> <p>David Cameron\u2019s former policy guru condemned May and her government for the direction she is taking the country in over Brexit. Steve Hilton, who broke with the former PM to back Brexit, was scathing about home secretary Amber Rudd\u2019s suggestion to make firms list the number of foreign workers they employ. Ministers might as well announce that \u201cforeign workers will be tattooed with numbers on their forearms\u201d, he wrote in the <em>Sunday Times</em>.</p> <p>At the Tory conference, May said a Great Repeal bill would be put forward in the Queen\u2019s speech next spring and would be voted on in the next session of parliament, coming into force on the day of exit. Ministers insist they cannot give a \u201crunning commentary\u201d on the details of negotiations.</p> <p>A No 10 source said: \u201cAs the prime minister said in her conference speech, we\u2019re getting on with the job of delivering Brexit, and we\u2019re going to make a success of it. Building relationships is absolutely essential in this business and putting in the hard yards in this way means Theresa will be one of the best travelled PMs by the time she meets everyone at her first European council meeting next month.\u201d</p> <p>A source at the Department for Exiting the European Union said: \u201cParliament voted by six to one to give people the final say on EU membership in the referendum held on 23 June. While there can therefore be no attempt to keep Britain in the EU by the back door, we have been clear that parliament will be consulted and engaged throughout the process of exit.</p> <p>\u201cWe will introduce a Great Repeal bill to end the authority of EU law and we have been clear that we will follow all the constitutional and legal precedents that apply to any treaty on a new relationship with the EU.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The first time that someone urged me to read Elena Ferrante, he mentioned her anonymity, along with her evocation of Naples, and her peerless representation of women\u2019s friendships, as among her most impressive qualities. This was in 2013, shortly after the critic James Wood had <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/01/21/women-on-the-verge\" title=\"\">introduced</a> Ferrante to readers of the <em>New Yorker</em>, in an essay that dwelt on her anonymity. \u201cCompared with Ferrante,\u201d Wood wrote, \u201cThomas Pynchon is a publicity profligate.\u201d</p> <p>A few things were known about the writer, thanks to Ferrante\u2019s generosity with written interviews, which routinely feature her anonymity. She grew up in Naples. She had a classics degree. She believed books should stand alone. Wood quoted a letter to her publisher, from 1991. \u201cI believe that books, once they are written, have no need of their authors. If they have something to say, they will sooner or later find readers; if not, they won\u2019t.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/31/elena-ferrante-literary-sensation-nobody-knows\">Elena Ferrante: the global literary sensation nobody knows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Enough of her readers now appear to share this austere analysis to justify a thorough rethink, in the media, of its coverage of novelists. \u201cNo one really wanted to know the identity of Elena Ferrante,\u201d wrote Frances Wilson, in the <em>Times Literary Supplement</em>. In which case, maybe people don\u2019t, really, want to know about John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s dad or the latest revelations about Elizabeth Jane <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/01/21/women-on-the-verge\" title=\"\">Howard</a>. We\u2019re above all that. \u201cLet\u2019s restore authentic centrality to the books themselves,\u201d Ferrante says.</p> <p>Mercifully for her publisher, Ferrante\u2019s books did find many thousands of readers, after which speculation about her identity intensified, even among admirers of her work. Wood, for example, mentioned a rumour about an Italian novelist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/15/who-italian-novelist-elena-ferrante\" title=\"\">Domenico Starnone</a>. He guessed at confessional reasons for her reticence, such as only confirmed her honesty. \u201cAs soon as you read her fiction, Ferrante\u2019s restraint seems wisely self-protective.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s an echo of the conjecture that followed the publication of <em>Jane Eyre</em>, under the name Currer Bell. \u201cWho, indeed, but a woman,\u201d wrote one reviewer, \u201ccould have ventured, with the smallest prospect of success, to fill three octavo volumes with the history of a woman\u2019s heart?\u201d</p> <p>The earlier review is quoted in a brilliant study by <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8745.html\" title=\"\">John Mullan, <em>Anonymity: A Secret History of English Literature</em></a>, in which context Ferrante\u2019s reticence and the avid response to it look far more like a return to literary convention than a rebuke to celebrity culture. As with Charlotte Bront\u00eb, it was a matter of time, given the sales and adulation, before Elena Ferrante was identified. Following years of false starts, a reporter, Claudio Gatti, now <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2016/10/02/elena-ferrante-an-answer/\" title=\"\">exposes </a>his \u201csuspect\u201d, in the manner of a police sergeant, as the Roman-based translator, Anita Raja. That Raja is married to Starnone is unlikely to end speculation about his involvement. As for Gatti, his reward, to date, has been sustained abuse. A British journalist proposed him as \u201cthe most despised Italian on the planet\u201d and said he deserved to be bashed on the head, Ukip style, with a copy of <em>My Brilliant Friend</em>. The <em>TLS</em> editor, Stig Abell, protested that exposure had been achieved in the beastliest sort of way, involving money, as opposed to via the more agreeable, practical criticism. If only Gatti had been nicer, less Brexity, or better still, a woman. Abell is not alone in recoiling from a painfully gendered pursuit, of a woman who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f019b5c-9d18-11e5-b45d-4812f209f861\" title=\"\">told </a>the <em>Financial Times</em>\u2019s Liz Jobey: \u201cMale power, whether violently or delicately imposed, is still bent on subordinating us.\u201d</p> <p>While the wretched Gatti is excoriated, anyone who shares his interest might as well, you gather, admit to a sneaking respect for Mazher Mahmood. The Booker prize winner Marlon James wrote on Facebook:, \u201cSeriously though, who is this <em>NYRB</em> [<em>New York Review of Books</em>]Elena Ferrante article for? What kind of person supports this shit and cared to find out?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The public know almost as little about Ferrante, unveiled, as they did before</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>OK, this kind. I\u2019m glad we know who wrote <em>Jane Eyre</em> and where she lived. And I\u2019m curious about Ferrante. Not merely because I belong to the same, debased trade as Gatti and do not share my friends\u2019 enthusiasm for the novelist. Despite dogged attempts to enjoy Ferrante \u2013 and to suppress conjecture about an oddly male glint, in some scenes \u2013 I find Neapolitan novels fiction (the interviews are great) much as I did the magic realism of the 80s: lurid and prolix. It came as no surprise to find Salman Rushdie posting in Ferrante\u2019s support, notwithstanding his own generous offering, to inquisitive readers, of<em> Joseph Anton</em>, in which true-life romances are thrillingly explored.</p> <p>But individual taste has no bearing on the principle that Elena Ferrante had a right to concealment. Whether she could reasonably expect full compliance, once she was revered and famous, sole cause of a tourism spike in Naples, is a different matter. JK Rowling, discussing her own outing as the detective writer Robert Galbraith, sounded resigned. \u201cI always knew if the books had any success, it would become harder and harder to remain anonymous because, quite reasonably, people would say, well, I would like to interview him or ask him some questions.\u201d</p> <p>In that respect people are unchanged since they enjoyed guessing \u2013 as they were sometimes intended to \u2013 about the authorship, among others, of <em>The</em> <em>Rape of the Lock, Gulliver\u2019s Travels, Joseph Andrews, Pride and Prejudice, Ivanhoe, Frankenstein, Evelina, Mary Barton, Middlemarch, Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland, Father and Son, The Bell Jar, The Diaries of Jane Somers</em>. \u201cA good proportion of what is now English literature,\u201d John Mullan writes, \u201cconsists of works first published, like <em>The</em> <em>Rape of the Lock,</em> without their authors\u2019 names.\u201d</p> <p>Seriously, again to quote Marlon James, what kind of person supports this shit and cared to find out? Might they not be Ferrante\u2019s admirers? In his time, Thackeray was not above biographical speculation. \u201cI have been exceedingly moved and pleased by <em>Jane Eyre</em>. It is a woman\u2019s writing, but whose?\u201d The English reading world, Elizabeth Gaskell wrote in her biography of Bront\u00eb, \u201cwas in a ferment to discover the unknown author.\u201d</p> <p>Insisting on the gendered aspect of the Ferrante outrage, some have argued, not entirely unlike women who defend the burqa, that Gatti violated a self-effacement that is peculiarly womanly. If so \u2013 and that behaviour did not originate with patriarchal restrictions on female writers \u2013 there is, still, the consolation that the public knows almost as little about Ferrante, unveiled, as it did before. As intended, her books prospered under anonymity, they speak for themselves and no loyal reader will care if she wasn\u2019t raised in Naples, a disclosure that only accords with Ferrante, in <em>Vanity Fair,</em> on \u201cthe centrality of the work\u201d.</p> <p>For the tiny number of Ferrante-resistant readers, the violence of last week\u2019s response may be as interesting as the unmasking. What\u2019s this sudden consensus, among eager consumers of author interviews and confessions, from regular participants in literary festivals and talks, that a decent reader is interested only in texts? Should publishers accordingly trim, if such a thing were possible, their publicity budgets? Or does that strange phenomenon \u2013 Ferrante fever \u2013 account for an anti-biographical fury that remained dormant during the exposures, respectively, of Belle de Jour, JK Rowling and Banksy? True, Ferrante threatened never to publish again. But that was as the novelist raised in Naples.</p>",

  "<p>In Crieff on Friday morning on the second day of the annual conference of Scotland\u2019s local authorities an otherwise unremarkable panel session took place to discuss local government reform. In the middle of the proceedings, Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dems\u2019 leader who always looks like a small-town bank manager about to admonish an old customer for his prodigal spending habits, threw out a challenge to the audience. \u201cAre there any SNP members here who want to put a question of the government,\u201d he asked.</p> <p>The government was represented on the panel by Derek Mackay, the recently appointed finance minister. To the surprise of no one in the room the silence of the grave rapidly descended. There were plenty of SNP members present but, as everyone in Scottish politics knows, any nationalists who valued a future in the party would rather go dooking for chips in a deep fat fryer than question its financial husbandry. Rennie\u2019s interjection was timely and pertinent. In a Scotland dominated by the SNP on every political level the task of maintaining the daily conduct of democracy, the practice of holding central government to account, falls a little more heavily on the shoulders of those party members who have been elected to office. Rennie\u2019s challenge to the SNP faithful came just a few hours after it had been announced that <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14787827.SNP_by_election_victory_in_Labour_heartland_signals_power_shift_in_Glasgow/?ref=rl&amp;lp=2\">their party had taken the council ward of Garscadden and Scotstounhill</a> in the north-west of Glasgow.</p> <p>This area, long a Labour stronghold, was furiously contested as each side sensed that the outcome would act as a weathervane pointing to the overall outcome of next May\u2019s local authority elections. The SNP have coveted control of Glasgow city council since they came to power nationally in 2007. At the 2012 local elections the SNP were just beginning to break out the champagne in Glasgow when it was announced that Labour, against all the odds and the prevailing nationalist headwind, had managed to hold on to the most prized of its municipal jewels.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/scotland-bans-underground-coal-gasification-ugc\">Scotland bans controversial gas extraction technique</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since then though, all the indications have suggested that the SNP has virtually annexed the city. In 2014, Glasgow was only one of four Scottish local authority areas to vote Yes in the independence referendum. The following year, every one of the city\u2019s seven Westminster seats fell to the SNP, in the fierce after-shock of the constitutional division. And although Labour recovered a little lost ground in Glasgow in this year\u2019s Holyrood elections, the momentum is firmly with the nationalists. If they do take Glasgow then their writ will effectively run in every important area of Scotland. This is why Rennie\u2019s challenge is such a pertinent one.</p> <p>Tories have made much of their elevation to become the official opposition at Holyrood and there has been much silly talk about the emergence of their leader Ruth Davidson as a credible future first minister. In reality though, Davidson has been a major disappointment at Holyrood. She has failed adequately to distance herself from the hard right, which has annexed the UK Conservative party at Westminster with its sinister anti-immigration views. Her policy programme begins and ends with opposing a second referendum in independence. She charges the SNP with obsessing about independence; in truth though, no one is more obsessed by it than she and it has made her position as leader of the opposition faintly ridiculous.</p> <p>It is virtually certain that the government of Scotland will remain in the hands of the SNP for a generation, yet already this party is beginning to fall into the same bad habits that finally did for Labour in Scotland. They talk a great deal but so far have delivered little. At the local authority conference, Mackay, whose performance was described as lacklustre and predictable, could only say that people had to be prepared to pay more if they wanted improved public services. Not a scintilla of fresh or innovative thinking in funding models, which the much-lauded community empowerment bill might have been expected to open up.</p> <p>Mackay was saying this even as it was being revealed that the NHS 24 computer project has experienced a <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14787758.Future_of_NHS_24_in_doubt_as_crisis_hit_IT_project_costs_soar_by_73_/\">73% hike in cost to more than \u00a3130m</a>. Elsewhere it was revealed that <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14787747.Crisis_hit_Scots_NHS_board_has__no_plan__to_deal_with___11_6m_budget_deficit__says_auditor/\">NHS Tayside needs to make \u00a358m of savings</a> following years of government bail-outs. ScotRail, the national rail operator has long been a national disgrace. Last week it was revealed that its Dutch owners Abellio has admitted making <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14762449.Abellio_making___1_million_profit_a_month_from_ScotRail_franchise/\">so much money from the deal</a> that it can plough the profits back into its Netherlands operation. Despite all of this, the SNP have become politically untouchable. Yet Labour is in no position to land a single blow.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/06/hard-brexit-could-see-scotland-lose-80000-jobs-and-cost-2000-a-head\">Hard Brexit could cost Scotland \u00a32,000 a head and 80,000 jobs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No matter how you try to crunch the numbers from Thursday\u2019s by election they convey disquietude for Labour. Certainly, the turnout at 24% was ridiculously low and the margin of victory slim, but it still represented a 20% swing to the SNP. In 2012, Labour gained 60% of the city vote. If the SNP do take Glasgow next year it will be less of a testament to its popularity and competence than the utter failure of Scottish Labour to engage at any level with voters. They really ought not to be losing so much ground in Scotland\u2019s biggest city. The SNP\u2019s antipathy to Glasgow is both real and historic.</p> <p>This city, which has suffered disproportionately from re-drawn local authority boundaries and health inequality, continues to drive Scotland\u2019s economy. Yet the SNP annually cuts its Holyrood block grant while throwing a third of Scotland\u2019s overall budget at a failing health service, which excels only at the rate at which it has increased managerialism and secured the financial futures of the children of thousands of NHS executives. Glasgow is lamentably under-represented at cabinet level in the SNP government. The neglect of Glasgow by the SNP should be on every Labour councillor seeking re-election next May.</p> <p>On 10 October, Glasgow will reveal its blueprint for thriving in the face of Brexit uncertainty. The theme of this fightback document will be Glasgow is Open For Business. It\u2019s not dissimilar to London\u2019s response but it doesn\u2019t have the vast riches that make it easier for the English capital. If Glasgow can convey and then maintain a sense of optimism in the face of Brexit and of deploying its gifts for innovation laughing in the face of adversity the SNP threat may yet be put to flight.</p>",

Candidates include the water vole, highland wildcat, fox, bottlenose dolphin, red squirrel and soprano pipistrelle bat.</p> <p>The poll, set up as part of Biology Week, which began on Saturday, is aimed at finding out what British people value most in the environment. \u201cPeople act on what they care about, so it\u2019s not just fun to explore their preferences and preconceptions, it\u2019s useful too,\u201d said Professor David Macdonald, director of Oxford University\u2019s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit. \u201cWe already know that the global favourites are big cats, and that knowledge can mobilise conservation campaigns \u2013 so let\u2019s find out which UK mammal people most want to champion.\u201d</p> <p>Last year a similar competition organised by the RSB saw the buff-tailed bumblebee being named <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/16/buff-tailed-bumblebee-voted-britains-favourite-insect\" title=\"\">the nation\u2019s favourite insect</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4f343b6cf412fb19ee6f6f7353316b053b368ab5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f343b6cf412fb19ee6f6f7353316b053b368ab5/455_799_1925_2407/800.jpg\" alt=\"water vole\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A british water vole eating blackberries.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MikeMcken/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Britain is home to 101 species of mammal. Some are recent arrivals, others have had their homes here since the last ice age. All are eligible for consideration in the poll. \u201cThe grey squirrel arrived about 150 years ago and the American mink appeared in the 1920s,\u201d said Macdonald. \u201cBy contrast, rabbits go back to Roman times and the fallow deer to pre-Norman times. As far as I am concerned, if it has fur and four legs and you see it in a local field, then it\u2019s a British mammal.\u201d</p> <p>Most animals on the list are land animals with only a few exceptions. The tiny soprano pipistrelle (<em>Pipistrellus pygmaeus</em>) \u2013 one of 18 species of bat found in the UK \u2013 is widespread and can consume more than 3,000 insects in a night. In addition, the bottlenose dolphin (<em>Tursiops truncatus) </em>is found in several different parts of the country, including the sea off Wales and Scotland. Many of Britain\u2019s mammals are now endangered as natural habitats disappear and farming intensifies. The water vole, often confused with brown rats (Ratty of <em>The Wind in the Willows</em> was actually a water vole), is now one of the nation\u2019s fastest disappearing mammals.</p> <p>Once found in almost every waterway in England, Wales and Scotland, <em>Arvicola amphibius</em> has disappeared from 90% of its former sites. The hedgehog (<em>Erinaceus europaeus</em>) has suffered from a drastic decline for the same reason: loss of habitat. The hedgehog population is estimated to number less than 1 million, down from more than 30 million in the 1950s. One third of this loss is thought to have taken place in the past 10 years.</p> <p>By contrast, the highland wildcat has suffered catastrophic decline for a very different reason. <em>Felis silvestris</em> can breed with the domestic cat and is losing its genetic integrity as a result. Surveys suggest pure-bred wildcat numbers are now lower than 400.</p> <p>\u201cWhichever mammal you choose, it\u2019ll be bumping up against some inconvenient aspect of the 21st century and will need society\u2019s support to prosper,\u201d Macdonald said. \u201cFor a nation that widely encourages others to protect wildlife in their communities, let us practise what we preach by nurturing the wildlife in our own backyards.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dd7cc594d58225e933a47c7a8c596bf09ef37e8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd7cc594d58225e933a47c7a8c596bf09ef37e8b/229_131_2869_1721/1000.jpg\" alt=\"red squirrel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A red squirrel, a species that has suffered since the introduction of the American grey squirrel in the 1870s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fazer44/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not every favourite candidate on the mammal poll list is doing badly. After the ban on otter hunting in 1978, along with a general improvement in water quality in rivers, numbers of otters (<em>Lutra lutra)</em> have slowly risen. The beaver (<em>Castor fiber</em>) has rebounded after becoming extinct, due to intense hunting, in the 16th century. Small numbers were reintroduced and the beaver is now a re-established UK resident \u2013 and a poll candidate.</p> <p>Finally there is the red fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) which has also thrived in recent years, spreading into urban areas and settling in large numbers. The animal is considered a pest in many areas, both in the country and the city. Nevertheless it is Macdonald\u2019s personal favourite to win the favourite mammal accolade for Britain. \u201cThey are beautiful, adaptable opportunists. Yes, they can be pests, but when you see one and catch the amber sparkle of their eyes, I defy anyone to find any animal in this country that is more lovely.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.rsb.org.uk/get-involved/biologyweek/favourite-uk-mammal\" title=\"\"><em>Register the vote at: rsb.org.uk/UKMammalPoll</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Stephen Daldry\u2019s 2000 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/billy-elliot\" title=\"\"><em>Billy Elliot</em></a> was a Bafta-winning critical and commercial hit. His 2005 stage musical version of the story about a working-class boy who wants to be a ballet dancer has been seen by 11 million people. His production of <em>An Inspector Calls</em>, JB Priestley\u2019s thriller of social conscience, has scooped armfuls of awards and is the National Theatre\u2019s longest-running show.</p> <p>Wondrously, both stage shows are still going strong today, with the touring production of Priestley\u2019s 70-year-old drama about a mystery visitor who unravels a family\u2019s secrets returning to the <a href=\"http://aninspectorcalls.com/\" title=\"\">West End next month</a>. It is now the longest-running revival in theatrical history. Yet any suggestion that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/stephen-daldry\" title=\"\">Daldry</a> has become a phenomenon akin to Andrew Lloyd Webber, an impresario who maintains a fleet of enduring stage hits in a variety of venues, is not welcome. Daldry wants to be more troublesome, less mainstream, than that.</p> <p>Next month he will have another go at rocking the cultural boat. Not content with an esteemed career in the world of film, making <em>The Hours</em> and <em>Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close</em>, or a recent theatrical triumph on both sides of the Atlantic with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/mar/05/the-audience-review-helen-mirren\" title=\"\"><em>The Audience</em></a>, the play with Helen Mirren as the Queen, the 56-year-old has now created the most expensive television drama of all time \u2013 and possibly the most ambitious.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/21/different-kind-of-royal-fever-victoria-the-crown-jenna-coleman\" title=\"\"><em>The Crown</em></a>, telling the story of Elizabeth II from 1947 to the present day, will launch on 4 November on Netflix and has already been hailed by critics as the television drama series that will blast through established viewing habits, drawing older audiences away from traditional channels. Awarded five stars by reviewers on the <em>Times</em> and the <em>Telegraph</em>, it is a forensic examination of the politics and personal dramas negotiated by the royal family and, at a rumoured cost of \u00a3100m, marks the American subscription service\u2019s big push into new audiences. \u201cThey are expanding, both in the number of people who are subscribing, and into territories like Australia and India. I assume that is why they responded to our request,\u201d said Daldry. One of the \u201cgreat joys\u201d, he adds, of working for Netflix is the creative freedom. \u201cThere were no anxieties in the area of editorial control, not that we set out to do a hatchet job on the royal family by any stretch of the imagination.\u201d</p> <p>The atmosphere at the production\u2019s Elstree base has been close to a backstage theatrical experience, he says, puffing cigarette smoke enthusiastically over the roof of the Young Vic theatre in London, where he is advising on Isango Ensemble\u2019s new show, <em>A Man of Good Hope</em>. \u201cNetflix have been a fantastic company to work for. I have never been in a more convivial and happy production team. There are no commercial breaks for viewers and they don\u2019t tell us how long to make the thing either.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"23049019d9cf46eea00e8f0a135824dd5a003e87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23049019d9cf46eea00e8f0a135824dd5a003e87/36_0_3296_4120/800.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen Daldry.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephen Daldry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whether <em>The Crown</em> is the show that changes the game or not, Daldry believes subscription television is the likely future of entertainment: \u201cWho wants to got to the cinema on a Friday night now? You might get certain break-out movies, but online streaming of drama has altered the whole thing. You can subscribe and see 40 TV shows, or go out to the cinema for a night for the same money.\u201d</p> <p>Daldry might seem like a creative nomad, moving on from one medium and from one theme to another, but it is possible to spot the social concerns that crop up in his work. Both Priestley\u2019s morality puzzle and <em>The Crown</em> are rooted in postwar Britain. Although the play is set before the first world war, it was first performed in London at the New Theatre, now the No\u00ebl Coward, at the moment the young Princess Elizabeth was preparing for marriage. It is an era the director says he finds hard to view as a \u201cperiod\u201d setting. Instead, he says that both the venerable stage play and his new television series, written by Peter Morgan, strive to represent the real world we live in, rather than a past where \u201cthey do things differently\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNeither of them are really like costume dramas,\u201d Daldry says. \u201cWith <em>The Crown</em> we are attentive to detail, but it is not one of those dramas where you look at the dresses. I hope it doesn\u2019t feel like one of those.\u201d As with <em>An Inspector Calls</em>, the issues in <em>The Crown</em> feel contemporary, to say nothing of the bad language (the King swears at full throttle in the first five minutes) or of the focus on gritty subjects such as Anthony Eden\u2019s drug addiction.</p> <p>Daldry says he does not watch costume drama. \u201cI don\u2019t know why. I am not knocking it. I haven\u2019t seen ITV\u2019s <em>Victoria</em> yet. I did try to watch <em>Downton</em> on an aeroplane, but it is not really my thing.\u201d</p> <p>What he does find interesting, he says, is the anthropology of class, of royalty and of the church.</p> <p>\u201cPriestley wrote <em>An Inspector Calls</em> as part of that huge shift in postwar consensus, the wakening of a social conscience. He wrote it as political agitation, so people would not go back to Edwardian values, and when we first did it Margaret Thatcher was talking about returning to prewar values. Whenever you watch the play it seems to be politically relevant. It feels urgent in different ways. I first intended the chorus who come on carrying bundles to be the people of 1945, but when we did it in Dartford at the beginning of the year they suddenly looked like dispossessed refugees.\u201d</p> <p>It is odd revisiting a show he directed 24 years ago, Daldry says. \u201cI am now in my late 50s and am wondering whether I would do the audacious risk-taking now.\u201d He wonders if he might have been harder on the royals then: \u201cI have more respect because I know so much more now. Who knew Prince Philip (played by Matt Smith ) was a radical reformer who really did want to modernise them?\u201d</p> <p>Morgan and Daldry\u2019s original idea, born of their work on <em>The Audience</em>, was to \u201ccontinue the study of a family that weren\u2019t born to be the royal family of England and look at all the tensions and trials they go through\u201d. Daldry found it extraordinary just how much of their lives were discussed in cabinet sessions. \u201cOur rule was that the TV show would be about everything that became a constitutional crisis, not just the aborted engagement of Princess Margaret, but it broadened out a bit. We have fantastic researchers on the show, but we have deliberately had no contact with the palace. We always know when we are departing from the absolute truth, and of course no one knows the dialogue, so what you get of course is an imaginative interpretation. Peter describes it as <em>The Sopranos</em> meets <em>The West Wing</em>.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I haven't seen ITV's Victoria yet. I did try to watch Downton, but it is not really my thing</p> <footer> <cite>Stephen Daldry</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Daldry, as may now be evident, is busy. With 10 episodes of the first season of <em>The Crown</em> made, he is working on season two in Hungary, where Budapest will stand in for Germany and viewers will meet Prince Philip\u2019s family (many married to Nazis).</p> <p>Aside from the Young Vic show, and the work with the three new cast members joining <em>An Inspector Calls</em> for the West End run, he is in New York frequently. Not only do his children go to school there, he is working on two high-profile arts building projects, Pier 55 and the new performance centre on the site of Ground Zero. He has also just returned from a UN assembly \u201cglobal exchange\u201d session, which he attended with fellow members of the board of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/19/calais-refugee-camp-theatre-british-playwrights\" title=\"\">Good Chance</a> theatre company, working with people in the Calais refugee camp.</p> <p>Rather than being overstretched, Daldry is, he claims, \u201cthrilled by all the connections\u201d he sees in his varied projects. While the play at the Young Vic deals with the violent reaction to the Somali refugee crisis in South Africa, the director is also working in a climate heavily weighted with reaction to refugees who have flown in the other direction, north to Europe. \u201cAt the moment <em>Billy Elliot</em> is getting an incredible response in Edinburgh when the show talks about the collapse of community or the attack on union rights. People yell out. I love it when <em>An Inspector Calls</em> feels radical too. Sometimes people applaud in unexpected places.\u201d</p> <p>Finding quite such a radical resonance in his next film project, <em>Wicked: The Movie</em>, may be a bigger ask, but Daldry may well try.</p> <h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2> <p><strong>An Inspector Calls 1992</strong><br>Daldry\u2019s production of Priestley\u2019s play for the National Theatre is still going.

  "<p>You draw much-needed attention to the requirement to improve mental health services, especially for younger people (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/01/fund-nhs-child-mental-health-services-to-avoid-crisis\" title=\"\">Act on child mental health or risk adult crisis, says expert</a>\u201d, News). While there are many examples of good care in the UK and elsewhere, the nature and quality of services vary considerably.

The solutions are as much political as medical: if political will exists, mental health services will be improved and discrimination can be addressed.</p> <p>To effect change, it is necessary not only to provide care as best as possible but also to campaign for better services, advocate loudly, register to vote and ensure politicians and decision-makers promote all of the rights of the mentally ill \u2013 the right to treatment as well as the right to liberty, social rights as well as economic ones. Political action is central: <em>aux barricades</em>!<br><strong>Brendan Kelly</strong><br>Professor of psychiatry<br>Trinity College Dublin</p> <h2><strong>Reform of the UN is a priority</strong></h2> <p>You are correct to write about a weakened UN (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/01/observer-view-russian-actions-syria-influence-international-law\" title=\"\">Tyrants exploit enfeebled UN</a>\u201d, editorial) but fail to mention that the UN is also the author for its own weakness. It only works where its member states engage with specifically defined technical tasks, where there is a congruence of interest, such as maritime safety. The UN is largely enfeebled by its delusions of grandeur, such as believing that it can protect \u201cuniversal rights\u201d where most member states have never implemented them and that it can protect states from invasion, such as in Ukraine, Tibet and Georgia, where no protection has ever happened. Its attempts at peacekeeping and peacemaking have frequently involved UN troops engaged in their own human rights abuses such as rape.</p> <p>The UN has to drastically reform, introducing a principle that unless programmes are properly resourced and effectively defined, they will not be implemented. Otherwise, the UN will continue as a vapid, ineffective talking shop, one subject to self-inflicted contempt.<br><strong>Jeremy Ross</strong><br>Ashtead, Surrey</p> <h2><strong>Labour\u2019s forgotten traditions</strong></h2> <p>I was born in 1943, so my early experience of prime ministers featured, for the Conservatives, Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden, Harold Macmillan, Alec Douglas-Home and Ted Heath: for Labour, Clement Attlee, Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan. For the past 36 years, \u2013 more than a generation \u2013 our prime ministers have been centre-right. We\u2019ve forgotten our centre-left politics. And in case you want to call Tony Blair centre-left, remember the senior Tory who, when asked what was Margaret Thatcher\u2019s greatest legacy, replied: New Labour.</p> <p>As prime minister, Jeremy Corbyn would introduce secure jobs with a living wage, the repeal of the Trade Union Act, greater funding for the NHS and public services, the renationalisation of the railways, national and regional investment banks to finance the regeneration of British industry and commerce, action on tax avoidance and evasion and measures to close the gap between rich and poor.</p> <p>The reason the media feel free to demonise Corbyn as extreme left, a view shared by 172 Labour MPs and, according to the polls, the majority of the British electorate, is that we\u2019ve forgotten the postwar Labour tradition. The above policies would have found favour with Attlee, Wilson and Callaghan. Indeed, one of them featured in Mrs May\u2019s acceptance speech.

Slavery was abolished at different times in different countries and, in many cases, subsequently restored. It was abolished in Iceland in 1117 and in Madeira in 1777. In China, the Ming dynasty tried unsuccessfully to abolish all forms of slavery. Following the 1791 slave rebellion in Haiti, the first elected assembly of the First Republic abolished slavery in France and all its colonies in 1794.

  "<p>It gets to the point with Donald Trump where you think: why am I even shocked any more? The non-payment of taxes, the Mexican wall, the endless lies, the relentless sexist and racist torrent\u2026</p> <p>And yet, the latest revelation of his boorishness is shocking, maybe more so, because this time it isn\u2019t just hearsay or \u201che said/she said\u201d. It\u2019s a recording, a recording that is more than a decade old, but a recording nonetheless. Trump is with Billy Bush, a television host (Bush laughing along, it should be noted). As well as talking about a married woman he tried to seduce and commenting on a TV actress\u2019s appearance, Trump talks about how women allow \u201cstars\u201d (like him) to do anything they want. \u201cGrab them by the pussy,\u201d says Trump. \u201cYou can do anything.\u201d</p> <p>Now Trump is claiming that it was locker-room talk, the tape is a decade old and (his clincher) Bill Clinton has said far worse to him on the golf course. It\u2019s the same old squirm/weasel/distract Trump routine, but this time it seems that even Republicans have had enough and who could blame them? \u201cGrab them by the pussy\u201d \u2013 how could <em>that</em> guy become president of the United States?</p> <p>There was a time when I felt slightly conflicted by Trump. I used to watch his US version of <em>The Apprentice</em> and it was notable how much respect he had for a female executive who helped him, and also for his daughter Ivanka.</p> <p>The fact that Trump had daughters also tapped into my notion that, for some men, daughters can be enlightening, an \u201ceducation\u201d if you will \u2013 fast-tracking insights into the female experience. This could also happen via other females (wives, girlfriends, mothers, sisters, friends), but there\u2019s just something about daughters that men have raised and nurtured.</p> <p>While a father can love a boy just as fiercely and completely, with girls, there may be the added sting of knowing what\u2019s in store for them out there in the \u201cman\u2019s world\u201d. How many men have said to grown daughters: \u201cI know how men think\u201d, when what they\u2019re really saying is: \u201cI know how I used to think \u2013 and I want you to be spared that\u201d?</p> <p>However, even if Trump had this education, he failed the test \u2013 flunked it, big time. Donald is a classic compartmentaliser of women, someone for whom the age-old Madonna/whore routine is in full swing. A textbook case of: \u201cWomen I love, like, respect or am related to, up here; the rest of you, down there\u2026 And, If I want to, I\u2019ll grab your pussy.\u201d</p> <p>As if this male entitlement weren\u2019t grotty enough, Trump stirs star-power into the mix. It\u2019s telling and chilling, especially in these post-Savile times, how hyper-aware Trump is of how celebrity gives him levels of leeway, opportunity and access he wouldn\u2019t otherwise enjoy.</p> <p>Trump doesn\u2019t even bother pretending that he can take these liberties because he\u2019s so personable and charismatic. In his mind, his celebrity gives him a free pass to opportunism, lechery and boorishness and he\u2019s going to use it.</p> <p>All this considered, it\u2019s farcical how Trump tries to get himself out of his self-dug hole by dragging Bill Clinton into it. Whatever people think of Clinton\u2019s behaviour, there\u2019s a big difference between a \u201cshagger\u201d (even a lying, cheating, manipulative one) and the near-reptilian, calculated and, above all, dehumanising contempt for women that Trump exhibits on that recording.</p> <p>Even if you think that Bill was just as bad (on the golf course with Trump, and everywhere else), let\u2019s not forget that it\u2019s Hillary, not Bill, who\u2019s running for the presidency now.</p> <p>The fact that Trump still doesn\u2019t seem to comprehend that, to the point of bringing up Clinton\u2019s husband at every opportunity he can, even to create a diversion for his own grubby behaviour, is all anyone needs to know about the deep-rooted misogyny of Republican presidential candidate, Donald John Trump.</p> <h2>It\u2019s my party, I\u2019ll leave if I want to...</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92eaff83abf3afc77d351c9b96f16ba0c3ab32fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92eaff83abf3afc77d351c9b96f16ba0c3ab32fe/328_473_4057_2435/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Please, Jeremy, let me leave Labour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Please, Jeremy, let me leave Labour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew MacColl/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have written before about leaving the Labour party.

Reconsider what?</p> <p>Is the next stage sobbing down the phone at me? It feels as though I\u2019m trying to shake off a bad, clingy boyfriend.</p> <p>Yet this is significant. After Corbyn\u2019s victory, many people revoked their memberships, some posting photos of their cut-up Labour cards on social media.</p> <p>\u201cHow do I leave the Labour party?\u201d was the most popular Labour-related term on Google. I\u2019m now wondering whether everybody who \u201cleft\u201d realised about putting it in writing.</p> <p>I\u2019m also wondering what the true Labour figures are \u2013 whether they\u2019re being artificially inflated by people who, like me, unwittingly remained members.

  "<p>The winner of this year\u2019s Nobel peace prize was, for reasons of time difference, still asleep when the honour was announced on Friday morning \u2013 it was the middle of the night in Colombia, where Juan Manuel Santos is president. According to Norwegian television, his staff are so loyal they refused to awake him.</p> <p>The award to Santos was remarkable, mostly for its timing, in a different way. It came just days after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/02/colombia-referendum-rejects-peace-deal-with-farc\">Colombians had voted to reject a peace deal</a> that his government had secured after four years\u2019 negotiation with the Farc guerrilla group.</p> <p>The Nobel committee made it clear that the award was didactic: given to someone who had failed to secure peace so far, but in the hope that he might succeed. The committee said: \u201cThe referendum was not a vote for or against peace. What the No side rejected was not the desire for peace, but a specific peace agreement.\u201d</p> <p>The plebiscite last Sunday was supposed to bring an end to the world\u2019s longest-running war, between the Colombian military and the Marxist guerrilla insurrection of Farc, the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia. Farc was founded in 1964 in response to an army attack on a rural enclave occupied by armed peasants affiliated to the Communist party. Farc\u2019s protest originated in the systemic concentration of agriculture in the hands of a few landowners which had continued from Spanish colonial rule into independence.</p> <p>The peace deal had been acclaimed by Pope Francis, President Obama and diplomats from around the world. Two weeks ago, it was signed in Cartagena in front of the world\u2019s media and a host of global dignitaries, only for the Colombian people to reject the accord by a margin of 0.4% of the vote.</p> <p>While Santos had received acclaim internationally, as the Nobel prize attests, he faced a much tougher battle at home. There, he had been confronted by the former president \u00c1lvaro Uribe, who <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/the-biggest-obstacle-to-peace-in-colombia-may-not-be-farc-but-an-ex-president/2016/07/06/09834850-3d79-11e6-9e16-4cf01a41decb_story.html\">orchestrated the No campaign</a>. Uribe, whose father was killed by Farc during a kidnap attempt in 1983, was unrelenting in his criticism of a deal he said was too soft on the movement he characterised as \u201cterrorists and narco-traffickers\u201d.</p> <p>Santos now sends his diplomats back to Havana to try to renegotiate peace. If he can manage that he will be a worthy successor to the likes of Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat, Nelson Mandela, Mikhail Gorbachev and Martin Luther King. The prize may yet help revive a stalled process that looked to be unravelling rapidly \u2013 and dangerously.</p> <p>Juan Manuel Santos Calder\u00f3n comes from one of the wealthy and weighty families that constitute a spine of continuity among Colombia\u2019s educated urban elite, <em>Colombia Permanente</em> as people say. From the beginning of the 20th century, the Santos family owned a majority stake in the country\u2019s most influential daily newspaper, <em>El Tiempo</em>, which it maintained until 2007.</p> <p>Juan Manuel was born in 1951 in the capital and family seat, Bogot\u00e1, and, after a brief spell in the navy, studied business and finance at the University of Kansas. While a representative for Colombia\u2019s coffee growers at the International Coffee Federation in London, he completed a master\u2019s at the LSE, then another at Harvard, before returning to become deputy director of the family newspaper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d97d0cd3da79508dedda6266ca188b1a01afeed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d97d0cd3da79508dedda6266ca188b1a01afeed/0_184_4020_2413/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alvaro Uribe leaves a meeting with President Santos after the peace deal, which he had campaigned against, was rejected.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alvaro Uribe leaves a meeting with President Santos after the peace deal, which he had campaigned against, was rejected.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guillermo Legaria/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2005, Santos founded and led the Social Party of National Unity, which sought to fix the old rupture between liberal and conservative parties that had taken Colombia to civil war from 1948 to 1958. The party promised to support Uribe\u2019s presidency, then in the middle of Plan Colombia, the US-backed onslaught against Farc.</p> <p>In 2006, Santos was appointed Uribe\u2019s minister of defence. In May 2009, Santos resigned, only to fight and win the 2010 presidential election. <br></p> <p>It was his dramatic proposal to rewrite and, if necessary, tear up the language and premise of the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d that first catapulted Colombia\u2019s new president on to the world stage.</p> <p>Santos revealed his intention in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/13/colombia-juan-santos-war-on-drugs\">an interview with this newspaper in 2011</a>, saying: \u201cThe world needs to discuss new approaches\u2026 we are basically still thinking within the same framework as we have done for the last 40 years\u2026 A new approach should try and take away the violent profit that comes with drug trafficking\u2026 If that means legalising, and the world thinks that\u2019s the solution, I will welcome it.\u201d</p> <p>Over the next three years, Santos addressed the UN and gathered support from a coalition of South American presidents who agreed that the \u201cproducing countries\u201d \u2013 and not the \u201cconsuming countries\u201d of the west \u2013 were the ones suffering most from the violence and carnage that resulted from the war on drugs.</p> <p>Santos\u2019s intervention was, and remains, the most dramatic in challenging the west to take greater responsibility for the impact of the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d. As he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/16/war-drugs-colombia-un-new-approach\">explained to the <em>Observer</em></a>, for his country, drugs are \u201ca matter of national security\u201d, whereas for other consuming countries, \u201cit is mainly a health and crime issue\u201d. The price of feeding the west\u2019s appetite for drugs, along with the pressures of fighting Farc, threatened to render Colombia a \u201cfailed state\u201d in the 90s. \u201cWe have gone through a tremendous experience \u2013 dramatic and costly for a society to live through. We have lost our best judges, our best politicians, our best journalists, our best policemen in this fight against drugs and the problem\u2019s still there.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One of the best signals that Santos was really heading for peace is that he sent acting military generals</p> <footer> <cite>Timochenko, Farc's supreme commander</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Colombia\u2019s ambassador to London, N\u00e9stor Osorio Londo\u00f1o, explained to the <em>Observer</em> how Santos\u2019s narco-traffic initiative was \u201cinextricably linked to the peace process. The accord requires a major trafficking organisation, Farc, to join the Colombian army to eradicate coca-growing. This is historic, Santos\u2019s way of saying to the world, \u2018We\u2019re doing our bit, now you do yours.\u2019\u201d The history of that peace process has come to define the Santos presidency, lose him the plebiscite, but now win the Nobel prize.</p> <p>It began with Santos instructing his former closest aide at the defence ministry,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/15/colombia-end-in-sight-longest-running-conflict\"> Sergio Jaramillo</a>, to conduct what Jaramillo described to the <em>Observer </em>as \u201csecret talks about talks about talks\u201d, with Farc as far back as 2011.</p> <p>The crucial difference between this and many previously failed attempts at peace was that Santos agreed that senior Colombian military officials would attend the peace negotiations. Farc\u2019s commanders have told the <em>Observer</em> how crucial this was: \u201cOne of the best signals that we received, that Santos was really heading for peace, is that he sent active military generals to talk peace. That was something we had always requested in previous peace talks \u2013 but never got,\u201d said Farc\u2019s supreme commander, Timole\u00f3n Jimenez, known as Timochenko.</p> <p>At the core of the peace deal was a pledge by Farc to surrender their weapons and take part in elective politics and for the government to enact major land reforms. Farc leaders could avoid harsh prison sentences by admitting their guilt and offering compensation to victims. It was a huge gamble and seemed until last weekend to have paid off. But at the heart of the campaign was a personal battle between Santos and his former mentor Uribe.</p> <p>They could not be more different: Santos urban and urbane, Uribe from a cattle-ranching family, flamboyant, with a populist touch. From the start of the peace process, Uribe, mostly through Twitter, had launched a vicious campaign against Santos and the peace process. The great Colombian writer H\u00e9ctor Abad wrote after the vote that between Santos and Uribe there exists \u201ca personal affair, too personal, of pure vanity. Peace, yes, but signed by me\u201d. Abad now tells the <em>Observer</em>, in rage at Uribe\u2019s campaign: \u201cUribe said that \u2018Santos was a Farc infiltrator in my government\u2019. They put his photo on big hoardings all around the country surrounded by Timochenko, [Cuban leader Raul] Castro and [Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s] Maduro. It was awful\u2026 The Nobel prize gives us new life, not only Santos. Now the people will understand the terrible campaign based on fear and lies.\u201d</p> <p>The No campaign manager, Juan Carlos V\u00e9lez, boasted last week, in an extraordinary <a href=\"http://www.larepublica.co/el-no-ha-sido-la-campa%C3%B1a-m%C3%A1s-barata-y-m%C3%A1s-efectiva-de-la-historia_427891\">interview in <em>La Rep\u00fablica</em></a>, that he deliberately set out to inflame public opinion and that the campaign had purposefully avoided telling the public about the real contents of the peace deal. \u201cThere were no winners last Sunday,\u201d one senior official close to the talks said. \u201cSantos lost because he thought a deal with Farc was all he needed and failed to reach other communities in Colombia, not least those who didn\u2019t vote. Farc lost because they weren\u2019t contrite early enough and Uribe lost because his was a campaign of hate and fear based on the past and not the future.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d93f802b61f1aa327f077e2e7e393d7290c6276f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d93f802b61f1aa327f077e2e7e393d7290c6276f/0_196_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators march for peace through the streets of Medellin on the eve of the referendum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators march for peace through the streets of Medellin on the eve of the referendum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luis Eduardo Noriega A./EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Uribe has won a chair at the next round of negotiations, from which he has been hitherto excluded. Quite where a compromise will come from is hard to see. Uribe said the agreement needs to be renegotiated while Timochenko has said Farc will not change \u201cso much as a comma\u201d.</p> <p>However, Farc and the government negotiators did release a joint statement on Friday saying: \u201cProposals for changes and clarifications that result from the process [of talks between the Santos government and so-called Uribista promoters of No] will be discussed by the government and Farc to give everyone guarantees.\u201d</p> <p>A bilateral truce has been extended but only to the end of this month. The biggest prize of all \u2013 peace for Colombia \u2013 remains tantalisingly out of reach, for now. The Nobel peace laureate who has so far taken his country to the brink of peace, but no further, must now try to stop a slide back to war.</p> <h2>THE SANTOS FILE</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> Juan Manuel Santos Calder\u00f3n 10 August 1951 in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, to a political family.

Threaded through the tale of how a blue-collar boy from New Jersey became a global rock star was a searing account of depression \u2013 both his father\u2019s, which governed his childhood, and his own.</p> <p>Admitting that he had struggled with depression for much of his adult life, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/07/bruce-springsteen-depression-crushed-born-to-run\" title=\"\">Springsteen wrote hauntingly</a>: \u201cYou don\u2019t know the illness\u2019s parameters. Can I get sick enough to where I become a lot more like my father than I thought I might?\u201d</p> <p>He is not the only public figure opening up about the effect depression can have on your life. Boxer Tyson Fury <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/sports/tyson-fury-boxing-champ-opens-up-about-drug-use-w443250\" title=\"\">told <em>Rolling Stone</em> magazine</a> that he self-medicated with cocaine and alcohol. \u201cI can\u2019t deal with it and the only thing that helps me is when I get drunk out of my mind,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Novelist Matt Haig detailed his longstanding relationship with anxiety and depression in last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/31/reasons-to-stay-alive-matt-haig-review-depression\" title=\"\"><em>Reasons to Stay Alive</em></a>, noting that \u201cto be calm becomes almost a revolutionary act\u201d, while American comedian Paul Gilmartin has run a <a href=\"http://mentalpod.com/\" title=\"\">hugely successful podcast</a> on the subject, <em>The Mental Illness Happy Hour</em>, since March 2011.</p> <p>Musicians Kendrick Lamar and Frank Ocean have also tackled the illness, in interviews and in their work. Ocean <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/21/frank-ocean-guardian-exclusive-interview\" title=\"\">told the <em>Guardian</em> in 2012</a>: \u201cMy art [is] the one thing that I know will outlive me and outlive my feelings. It will outlive my depressive seasons.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Lamar tackles the illness on his latest album, <em>To Pimp A Butterfly,</em> singing: \u201cI know your secrets&#xa0;\u2026 I know depression is restin\u2019 on your heart for two reasons.\u201d He later told MTV that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu4Pz9PjolI\" title=\"\">he saw <em>To Pimp A Butterfly</em> as a form of therapy</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/01/scientists-discover-17-genetic-variations-that-raise-risk-of-depression\">Scientists discover 17 genetic variations that raise risk of depression</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Martin Daubney, the former editor of <em>Loaded,</em> now campaigns on issues affecting men and boys. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely turning a corner at the moment where talking about men and depression is concerned, and I really do think that\u2019s been facilitated by celebrities leading the way,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Professor Green made the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/27/professor-green-men-suicide-documentary-bbc3\" title=\"\">documentary about his father\u2019s suicide</a> there was a huge response. When Bruce Springsteen, someone so macho that his nickname is the Boss, talks about depression it\u2019s another leap forward. It gives ordinary average Joes like me the permission we need to be vulnerable. The message sticks.\u201d</p> <p>This sense that the conversation about male depression is changing intensified last Wednesday when US rapper Kid Cudi released a bleak and emotional letter noting that he was <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kid-cudi-checks-into-rehab-for-depression-suicidal-urges-w443470\" title=\"\">checking himself into rehab for depression and suicidal thoughts</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult for me to find the words to what I\u2019m about to share with you because I feel so ashamed,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAshamed to be a leader and hero to so many while admitting I\u2019ve been living a lie \u2026 My anxiety and depression have ruled my life for as long as I can remember.\u201d An outpouring of support culminated in a new Twitter hashtag, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23YouGoodMan&amp;src=tyah\" title=\"\">#YouGoodMan</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m shocked at the response to the hashtag, but it is a testament to how many black men are suffering in silence, isolated and feeling afraid,\u201d says Dayna Lynn Nuckolls, a songwriter and artist from Chicago who started the hashtag with fellow Twitter user @TheCosby after reading Cudi\u2019s letter. \u201cIt broke my heart that he was apologetic for being unwell \u2026 but I knew that his vulnerability and authenticity had the potential to open the door for other men.\u201d</p> <p>Alex Lewis, a 22-year-old digital marketing specialist and founder of the art project <a href=\"http://www.carwindowpoetry.com/about/\" title=\"\">Car Window Poetry</a>, was one of those to respond. \u201cI felt it was a conversation that hasn\u2019t happened much because black men aren\u2019t open about their struggles with mental health,\u201d he says. \u201cAs someone who wants to talk more about these things it was great to see.\u201d</p> <p>Yet what is striking about both these statements and the responses to them is the way in which they highlight how little previous conversation there has been around male depression.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"23f4e336d2960dbb07a9681167d004a1b868a6c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23f4e336d2960dbb07a9681167d004a1b868a6c9/492_422_869_1087/799.jpg\" alt=\"Tyson Fury says he self-medicates with cocaine and alcohol as the only way to cope with his illness\" width=\"799\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tyson Fury says he self-medicates with cocaine and alcohol as the only way to cope with his illness.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2016 the charity Men\u2019s Health Forum reported that <a href=\"https://www.menshealthforum.org.uk/key-data-mental-health\" title=\"\">12.5% of men in the UK are affected by mental health disorders</a> and men are nearly three times more likely to self-medicate with alcohol or drugs. They are also less likely to seek therapy than women, Men\u2019s Health said, with fewer than one in five being prepared to see a doctor.</p> <p>That failure to seek help can have terrible consequences. \u201cSuicide is the single biggest killer of men under 45 in the UK \u2013 76% of all suicides are men,\u201d says Jane Powell, CEO of suicide prevention charity Calm (Campaign against Living Miserably). \u201cIt\u2019s taken a long time to get the issue of male suicide talked about properly because we have some very fixed opinions of men. There\u2019s an unspoken discomfort around male suicide, a sense that he clearly wasn\u2019t up to it.\u201d</p> <p>Former rugby league player Paul Highton agrees. \u201cWhen my career ended in rugby league I set up a business and it was doing well but I still felt low and underfulfilled,\u201d he says. \u201cI masked it by drinking more than I\u2019d ever done before and taking painkillers, which I\u2019d been prescribed for an old injury. It got to the point where I was on my knees, which is when I knew something had to change.\u201d</p> <p>Highton, who now works for the RFL as a transition mentor for players about to retire and for the charity Sporting Chance, says that men find it particularly hard to open up because of an unstated sense of machismo. \u201cEspecially in sport there\u2019s a sense that because you\u2019re physically strong you should be mentally strong too,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want the coach thinking that your head\u2019s not in it so it becomes this stigma you can\u2019t talk about.\u201d</p> <p>There is an unspoken taboo surrounding male depression, a feeling that if you were to admit that you felt anxious or blue you would be judged and found wanting. This is particularly exacerbated in certain sections of the black community.&#xa0;</p> <p>\u201cBlack men are stuck between the rock of toxic masculinity and the hard place of systematic racial bias that often prevents them from getting effective help even if they tried. It\u2019s a vicious cycle,\u201d says Nuckolls.</p> <p>Last week BBC3 aired <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2016/39/being-black-going-crazy\" title=\"\"><em>Being Black, Going Crazy</em></a>, a documentary about black people\u2019s experiences of mental health issues. Presenter Keith Dube has himself had depression and says the environment he grew up in exacerbated his illness. \u201cIf you showed weakness you\u2019d get eaten alive,\u201d he says. \u201cI think men in general grow up being told that you have to be tough, that to show emotion is a sign of weakness.\u201d</p> <p>Dube adds that the feeling of shame is particularly pronounced in immigrant communities where people struggle with a sense of failure and of letting their families down. \u201cLots of us grow up with parents who just got on with things. They came over to the UK, worked crazy long hours and didn\u2019t complain, so to say \u2018I feel this way and I don\u2019t know why\u2019 just feels wrong.\u201d</p> <p>For Daubney, the key to breaking long-entrenched attitudes lies in acknowledging them. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in trying to help by telling men to talk more like women,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to acknowledge that men will take longer to let their guard down. You have to challenge the generations of notions about having a stiff upper lip and promote the message that strong men talk, they don\u2019t suffer in silence.\u201d</p> <p>In these circumstances the openness of those in the spotlight such as Springsteen and Cudi is a gift. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d says Lewis. \u201cThe more conversations that occur about this subject, both public and personal, the more it helps people to speak out.\u201d</p> <p><em>For help with male depression, go to:</em><br>\u25a0<em> Time To Change, </em><a href=\"http://www.time-to-change.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>www.time-to-change.org.uk</em></a><br>\u25a0<em> Calm, </em><a href=\"http://www.thecalmzone.net.gridhosted.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>www.thecalmzone.net.gridhosted.co.uk</em></a><br>\u25a0<em> The Samaritans, telephone 116 123</em></p>",
  "<p>Backers of an ambitious proposal to transform the UK\u2019s power supply will learn in the next few weeks if they are to be given the go-ahead to build tidal lagoons to generate electricity. The green light could see a series of major lagoon projects costing more than \u00a315bn being constructed around the coast of Britain.</p> <p>A tidal lagoon generates electricity from the natural rise and fall of the tides. Rising water flows into dams many miles in length, driving turbines. It is then held back behind walls as the tide recedes before being released to drive the turbines again, generating thousands of megawatts of power.</p> <p>A prototype is set for construction in Swansea Bay in the next few years \u2013 but only if it is given the go-ahead by <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/review-of-tidal-lagoons\">a government review of tidal lagoon technology</a>, chaired by the former energy minister Charles Hendry, which is scheduled to release its recommendation early next month.</p> <p>Green energy experts believe Hendry will give approval, although it remains to be seen if tidal lagoon technology \u2013 which was backed strongly by the former chancellor George Osborne in the last Conservative manifesto \u2013 finds favour with Theresa May\u2019s administration.</p> <p>Mark Shorrock, chief executive of Tidal Power Lagoon, the backer of the Swansea Bay prototype lagoon, said the technology could be an important zero-carbon source of electricity generation for the UK. \u201cIn addition, the money to build tidal lagoons will come from British investors and the expertise and technology we develop could be sold around the world,\u201d he said. Tidal lagoons could also provide much of the power needed to make up for the predicted shortfall in UK energy that will be caused by the phasing out of coal plants and ageing nuclear reactors over the next decade, he added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f7df90e873685b3f6bbaae5b14e30383c4b96e2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7df90e873685b3f6bbaae5b14e30383c4b96e2a/120_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"How the Swansea Bay visitor centre might look.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">How the Swansea Bay visitor centre might look.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Six major projects have been earmarked for construction: a prototype at Swansea Bay; and then full-size lagoons at Cardiff, Newport, Colwyn Bay, Bridgwater Bay and west Cumbria. \u201cThe crucial point about tidal lagoons is that their power generation is not subject to the vagaries of the weather. It is predictable. We know exactly when every high tide will be for years ahead. In addition, the lagoons will be built to last \u2013 for about 120 years,\u201d Shorrock said.</p> <p>The \u00a31.3bn Swansea Bay prototype has been designed to generate 350 megawatts of power \u2013 enough to supply 150,000 homes with electricity \u2013 and could be in operation by 2019. About 11 square kilometres of the bay would be surrounded by a 9km wall. Cycle paths would be built on the walls and a sailing and canoeing centre would be set up inside the lagoon.</p> <p>Tides would sweep water into the lagoon and drive an array of 16 turbines, generating electricity. Then, after high tide has passed, the stored water would be released to pour back out of the lagoon to drive the turbines in the opposite direction \u2013 and generate more electricity. Shorrock claims the lagoon would be able to produce power for about 14 hours a day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/power-ofthesea/giv-1406p1v7TsSfN2MS\" data-alt=\"Power of the sea\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/power-ofthesea/giv-1406p1v7TsSfN2MS\">Power of the sea</a> </figure>  <p>Swansea Bay electricity would cost around \u00a389.90 per megawatt hour, he added, compared with the \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour price predicted for electricity from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/hinkley-point-c\">Hinkley Point C</a> nuclear plant. \u201cHowever, when we scale up operations with the Cardiff lagoon \u2013 which will have 10 times the generating capacity of Swansea \u2013 we will be able to produce power for \u00a365 a megawatt hour,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The Cardiff lagoon would cost \u00a39bn to construct and contain 65 square kilometres of water within a 20km wall. It would have a capacity of 3,000 megawatts of electricity \u2013 compared with the proposed 3,200 megawatts from Hinkley Point C.</p> <p>A request for planning approval for the Cardiff lagoon is to be made by 2018 with the aim of establishing a manufacturing industry for lagoon components in the UK.</p> <p>However, it is the speed of this follow-up that worries many green campaigners. Most back the idea of the Swansea Bay test project but some fear that construction of much larger follow-up schemes \u2013 starting in Cardiff Bay but going on to Colwyn and Bridgwater shortly after \u2013 could begin too soon to adopt any lessons that will be learned from construction of the prototype lagoon.</p> <p>This point was stressed by Mark Robins, of the RSPB. \u201cThe Swansea tidal lagoon could prove to be very useful but we will have to monitor how the first prototype affects the movement of silt in the estuary, disrupts bird populations and impacts on fish stocks before we scale up. This is a completely new technology and it is going to be built in a very complicated natural site \u2013 the Severn estuary. We need to be very careful how we go.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6908984ee94dad86cb3de27be857a7240650b392\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6908984ee94dad86cb3de27be857a7240650b392/0_291_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Shorrock of Tidal Lagoon Power, which is proposing the Swansea Bay project.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Shorrock of Tidal Lagoon Power, which is proposing the Swansea Bay project.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Richard Benwell, of the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, agreed. \u201cWe are cautiously welcoming,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, we would want the scheme\u2019s impact to be very carefully monitored before building started on the next-generation lagoon at Cardiff.\u201d</p> <p>However, there is strong pressure from the scheme\u2019s backers to instigate a speedy follow-up of the Swansea lagoon. They want to establish a supply chain for generators, turbines and other components to kick-start tidal technology in the UK, establish a series of major lagoon generators and eventually become the world leader in the field.</p> <p>Some worry about the environmental dangers. Others stress the advantages for local economies around Wales and Liverpool where tidal lagoons are likely to be clustered.</p> <p>\u201cThis could become a global industry that started in the UK yet was not linked to the EU,\u201d said Jane Davidson, pro vice-chancellor at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David and a former Welsh Assembly minister. \u201cThis could play a major role in subsidising low-income, lower-skills areas. It is something that, locally, we can pick up and run with.\u201d</p> <p>For its part, the UK climate change committee counselled caution in its report on renewable energy last year. \u201cThere may be a role for tidal lagoon power in providing predictable low-carbon electricity in the UK if projects can be delivered at acceptable cost. However, it is important that these proposals proceed with careful assessment of the potential environment impacts,\u201d it warned.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump is offering himself as president of a country whose federal income taxes he gives every appearance of dodging. He says he is fit to be commander in chief, after avoiding giving a cent more than he could towards the wages of the troops who must fight for him. He <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/full-transcript-donald-trump-nomination-acceptance-speech-at-rnc-225974#ixzz4MOJB7oDa\">laments</a> an America where \u201cour roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are in third world condition and 43 million Americans are on food stamps\u201d, while striving tirelessly to avoid paying for one pothole to be mended or mouth to be filled.</p> <p>Men\u2019s lies reveal more about them than their truths. For years, Trump promoted the bald, racist lie that Barack Obama was born in Kenya and, as an unAmerican, was disqualified from holding the presidency. We should have guessed then. We should have known that Trump\u2019s subconscious was trying to hide the fact that he was barely an American citizen at all.</p> <p>He would not contribute to his country or play his part in its collective endeavours. Like a guest in a hotel who runs off leaving the bill, Trump wanted to enjoy the room service without paying for the room. You should never lose your capacity to be shocked, especially in 2016 when the shocking has become commonplace. The <em>New York Times</em> published a joint <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/07/opinion/the-white-house-rule-no-tax-returns-no-job.html\">piece</a> last week by former White House ethics advisers \u2013 one to George W Bush and one to Barack Obama, so no one could accuse the paper of bias. They were stunned.</p> <p>No president would have nominated Trump for public office, they said. If one had, \u201cexplaining to the senate and to the American people how a billionaire could have a $916m \u2018loss carry-forward\u2019 that potentially allowed him to not pay taxes for perhaps as long as 18 years would have been far too difficult for the White House when many hard-working Americans turn a third or more of their earnings over to the government\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s bragging about the humiliations he inflicts on women is shocking. Trump\u2019s oxymoronic excuses about his \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d to his businesses to pay as little personal tax as he could are shocking. (No businessman has a corporate \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d to enrich himself rather than his company.) Never let familiarity dilute your contempt.</p> <p>And yet looked at from another angle, Trump is not so shocking. You may be reading this piece online after clicking on a Facebook link. If you are in Britain, the profits from the adverts Facebook hits you with will be logged in Ireland, which required <a href=\"http://www.irishexaminer.com/business/facebook-ireland-pays-34m-corporatetax-on-48bn-of-sales-370278.html\">Facebook to pay a mere \u20ac3.4m in corporate taxes last year on revenues of \u20ac4.83bn</a> . If you are reading on an Apple device, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/apple-boss-tim-cook-repatriate-billions-to-us-treasury-next-year\">Apple has booked $214.9bn offshore to avoid $65.4bn in US taxes</a>. They are hardly alone. One recent American <a href=\"http://ctj.org/pdf/offshoreshellgames2016.pdf.\">study</a> found that 367 of the Fortune 500 operate one or more subsidiaries in tax havens.</p> <p>Trump may seem a grotesque and alien figure, but his values are all around you. The Pepsi in your hand, the iPhone in your pocket, the Google search engine you load and the Nike trainers you put on your feet come from a tax-exempt economy, which expects you to pick up the bills.</p> <p>The short answer to Conservatives who say \u201ctheir behaviour is legal\u201d is that it is a scandal that it is legal. The long answer is to invite them to look at the state of societies where Trumpian economics have taken hold. If they live in Britain or America, they should not have to look far.</p> <p>The story liberal capitalism tells itself is heroic. Bloated incumbent businesses are overthrown by daring entrepreneurs. They outwit the complacent and blundering old firms and throw them from their pinnacles. They let creative destruction rip through the economy and bring new products and jobs with it.</p> <p>If that justification for free-market capitalism was ever true, it is not true now. The free market in tax, it turns out, allows firms to move offshore and leave stagnant economies behind. Giant companies are no longer threatened by buccaneering entrepreneurs and innovative small businesses. Indeed, they don\u2019t appear to be threatened by anyone.</p> <p>The share of nominal GDP generated by the Fortune 100 biggest American companies rose from 33% of GDP in 1994 to 46% in 2013, the <em>Economis</em>t <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21707048-small-group-giant-companiessome-old-some-neware-once-again-dominating-global\">reported</a>. Despite all the fuss about tech entrepreneurship, the number of startups is lower than at any time since the late 1970s. More US companies now die than are born.</p> <p>For how can small firms, which have to pay tax, challenge established giants that move their money offshore? They don\u2019t have lobbyists. They can\u2019t use a small part of their untaxed profits to make the campaign donations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/18/google-political-donations-congress\">Google and the other monopolistic firms </a>give to keep the politicians onside.</p> <p>John Lewis has asked our government repeatedly how it can be fair to charge the partnership tax while allowing its rival <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/2016-01-06/john-lewis-concerned-amazon-tax-problem-is-creating-an-unfair-fight/\">Amazon</a> to run its business through Luxembourg. A more pertinent question is why any government desperate for revenue would want a system that gave tax dodgers a competitive advantage.</p> <p>What applies to businesses applies to individuals. The tax take depends as much on national culture as the threat of punishment, on what economists call \u201ctax morale\u201d.</p> <p>No one likes paying taxes, but in northern European and North American countries most thought that they should pay them. Maybe I have lived a sheltered life, but I have no more heard friends discuss how they cheat the taxman than I have heard them discuss how they masturbate. If they cheat, they keep their dirty secrets to themselves. Let tax morale collapse, let belief in the integrity of the system waver, however, and states become like Greece, where everyone who can evade tax does.</p> <p>The surest way to destroy morale is to make the people who pay taxes believe that the government is taking them for fools by penalising them while sparing the wealthy.</p> <p>Theresa May <a href=\"https://www.moneymarketing.co.uk/may-coming-tax-advisers/\">promised</a> at the Conservative party conference that \u201chowever rich or powerful \u2013 you have a duty to pay your tax\u201d.</p> <p>I would have been more inclined to believe her if she had promised, at this moment of asserting sovereignty, to close the British sovereign tax havens of the Channel Islands, Isle of Man, Bermuda and the British Virgin and Cayman Islands.</p> <p>But let us give the new PM time to prove herself. If she falters, she should consider this. Revenue &amp; Customs can only check 4% of self-assessment tax returns. If the remaining 96% decide that if Trump and his kind can cheat, they can cheat too, she would not be able to stop them.</p>",

Warwick University professor Nigel Driffield says: \u201cIf they all win concessions, we won\u2019t really be leaving the single market.\u201d</p> <p>International trade secretary Liam Fox, foreign secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit minister David Davis are readying themselves for a long game of poker. Each is convinced they have a strong hand.</p> <p>Davis has recruited civil servants from across Whitehall and handed them large files of documents relating to around 50 sectors. He convened meetings with business leaders soon after the 23 June vote to leave the EU to discuss their concerns about Brexit. But these talks served only to highlight the mammoth nature of the task ahead, as, sector by sector, they forecast the potential impact of leaving the single market \u2013 not just increased tariffs, but extra bureaucracy, too.</p> <p>At this stage, the government hinted at a delay in triggering article 50 \u2013 which will kickstart Brexit talks \u2013 possibly of more than a year, to allow time to formulate a negotiating strategy. Then it became clear that all the information-gathering was going to take too long and there was a change of heart. The prime minister told the Tory conference that article 50 would be triggered by the end of March at the latest. Officials agreed that negotiations would need to be an iterative process, with civil servants learning as they go.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a7df4320c53b6cd35d3f5c41bbecf951c1c4191\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a7df4320c53b6cd35d3f5c41bbecf951c1c4191/0_376_5644_3387/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liam Fox wants to walk away from the European single market altogether.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liam Fox wants to walk away from the European single market altogether.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The game plan, version 2</strong></h2> <p>Fox has put together a parallel team to Davis\u2019s that insiders say assumes negotiations with the EU about staying in the single market will end in failure. He favours walking away from the single market and embracing the World Trade Organisation. Currently, Britain\u2019s relationship with the WTO is based on its membership of the EU. Operating solo will mean agreeing new tariffs, in particular for agriculture and most manufactured goods. (The WTO has struggled to agree terms for services.)</p> <p>Fox, who recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/09/fat-and-lazy-britain-is-ill-prepared-to-secure-future-outside-eu-says-fox\" title=\"\">accused British business leaders of being fat and lazy</a>, is expected to favour cutting tariffs to zero, whatever the EU decides. This free-market option, which has the approval of many Brexit-supporting economists, would end tariffs on things like South African beef and Australian wine, boosting disposable incomes in the UK. The tariff on beef from non-EU countries is a hefty 12.8%, plus between \u20ac1,414 and \u20ac3,041 per tonne. The tariff on wine from outside the EU is 30%. How Fox will secure reciprocal deals across the world to protect or boost UK exports is not known.</p> <h2><strong>Single market versus the customs union</strong></h2> <p>Some pro-Brexit campaigners are confident the Brussels elite will wake up to the damage that playing hardball over access to the single market will cause to their own industries.</p> <p>The car industry is often cited as the key to unlocking EU resistance. German carmakers and their workers are hardly likely to support Angela Merkel if the German premier\u2019s bargaining tactics result in Audi and BMW cars costing UK consumers more than they do now.</p> <p>The German view is important, but maybe not as important as the stance taken by Slovakia. This country of 5.4&#xa0;million people is busy building a sleek, modern car industry and doing very well. It is now the largest per capita producer of cars in the world and looking to extend its lead.</p> <p>It sells few cars in the UK, so high tariff barriers would not lead to a significant loss of trade. But Slovakia could only benefit should the extra costs faced by UK exporters encourage the likes of Nissan to shift production from Sunderland.</p> <p>It is easily forgotten that a Brexit agreement must be signed by the remaining 27 EU members states and in most cases ratified by domestic parliaments. This was underlined in Hollande\u2019s speech last week when he said that the EU, to save itself from breaking apart, must block any move towards concessions for the UK without free movement of labour.</p> <p>As an alternative to being in the single market \u2013 or joining Norway in the European Free Trade Area (Efta), which also involves free movement of labour \u2013 the UK could opt for the same status as Turkey and remain a member of the EU customs union. Turkey was rewarded with access to the EU 28, and through that a separate deal with Efta, after it said full membership of the EU was its goal. That may rule Britain out from the start.</p> <p>But membership of the customs union achieves only a one-dimensional relationship, with agreed tariffs that are possibly lower than those for outsider countries. There is still a hefty amount of bureaucracy, and it doesn\u2019t cover the services sector. Given that the UK has a \u00a316bn surplus with the EU in financial services and a \u00a33bn surplus in business services, maintaining these links will be crucial.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4196376d3503a3bf98abd3745a1b35b6bc62a2ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4196376d3503a3bf98abd3745a1b35b6bc62a2ae/0_178_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nissan has asked the UK government to offer compensation for any new tariffs it might have to face.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nissan has asked the UK government to offer compensation for any new tariffs it might have to face.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Compensation payments for tariffs</strong></h2> <p>The EU imposes tariffs on imports from outside the single market. Chinese steel is subject to a 22% tariff while Russian steel costs 36.1% more. Steel from Port Talbot destined for the EU could face a similar surcharge, which would price it out of vital markets. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/30/nissan-hard-brexit-compensation-new-uk-investment-tariffs\" title=\"\">Nissan has asked for the government to offer compensation for tariffs</a>, whatever they turn out to be.</p> <p>So far ministers have argued that the fall in the pound is compensation enough. But with import prices soaring, the gains for carmakers, which buy 50% of the components in an assembled car from abroad, are limited.</p> <h2><strong>Transitional arrangements</strong></h2> <p>If compensation is ruled out, businesses are keen for ministers to declare that the impact of whatever is agreed will be delayed by a transitional arrangement. This would mean that any deal that, for argument\u2019s sake, leads to a full exit from the single market, is delayed for a transitional period of five of 10 years.</p> <p>Even a deal that offers major British exporters access to the single market will come at a cost, which business leaders say will require a long period of adjustment.</p> <p>And it is the costs in lost business and higher bills for controlling immigration that business leaders want politicians to understand. They complain that the rivalry inside Whitehall means there is no mechanism at the moment to judge the pros and cons of a hard Brexit because the information is sketchy at best.</p> <p>Some businesses complain that they have sat through five or six meetings since July with no idea where the government is going and little feedback. Without some clear guidance by Christmas, investment decisions that have been waiting for a green light since the beginning of the year could be scrapped. The risk is that the much-predicted post-Brexit vote recession is only delayed until 2017.</p>",
  "<p>For the umpteenth international break since last appearing for his country during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, Mario Balotelli is doing his own thing as his compatriots pull on the <em>Azzurri </em>jersey. Yet, unlike most of these weeks spent kicking around in the international wilderness, widely regarded as an outlier incapable of fulfilling his potential, this time the Balotelli question feels sharply pertinent. Italy\u2019s forward options are not the most inspiring, and a few miles along from the coast of Liguria, in the south of France, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/21/mario-balotelli-scores-twice-again-nice-monaco\" title=\"\">Balotelli\u2019s goal blaze</a> is firing the imagination.</p> <p>This complex, sometimes maddening, spark of powerful attacking talent has been reignited at Nice. After a couple of fruitless seasons where his career stalled at Liverpool and on loan at Milan, Balotelli has been busy reminding critics why, on ability alone, he should be towards the front of any queues for an attacking berth for his country. It is early days, and the debate still needs to tilt further in his favour, but if his eye-catching start to life in Nice goes on, Giampiero Ventura may have to open the door to a recall for the kid who had it all but somehow lost it along the way.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/11/football-mario-balotelli-liverpool-nice-marseille-jurgen-klopp\">Mario Balotelli bags double and says he can still win Ballon d'Or</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Balotelli made positive noises in an interview where he said he understood why he was omitted from the current Italy squad and felt it was deserved. \u201cI hope to return very soon, but only at my best,\u201d he insisted.</p> <p>Ventura\u2019s reaction followed the pattern of managers who have felt compelled to be cautious when it came to the matter of trusting an unpredictable player. \u201cThese remain words,\u201d said Ventura. \u201cAnd I am accustomed to seeing facts. He has a lot of quality, but needs to prove he can play for the team and make the difference within a squad dynamic.\u201d</p> <p>The wily old coach expects high standards when it comes to conduct. Graziano Pell\u00e8 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/07/graziano-pelle-italy-sent-home-shake-hands-coach\" title=\"\">was sent home</a> from this World Cup qualification double header after refusing to shake his manager\u2019s hand when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/06/world-cup-qualifying-roundup-de-rossi-draw-italy-spain-iceland-finland\" title=\"\">he was substituted against Spain</a>, and so left Italy a striker short for Sunday\u2019s game in Macedonia.</p> <p>Balotelli\u2019s first few weeks in Nice have gone better than almost anyone could have expected. The club had been an excellent choice for Hatem Ben Arfa, another tricky customer who had trouble finding the right environment to express his talent, to relaunch himself. Balotelli flew into Cote d\u2019Azur with his enormous baggage. Was it reasonable to expect another success story in Nice? Not a lot conforms to sound judgment in the world of Balotelli, but he has unpacked, lightened his load, and looks happy again on the field. A goal rush of six from five games has everyone gushing.</p> <p>If Balotelli\u2019s arrival on transfer deadline day felt like a marriage of convenience, pretty quickly both sides are looking extremely happy with one another. A club on the rise under new ownership have an exciting prize who is headline news. Balotelli is finding his form, behaving well, and ready to challenge deep-set opinions. \u201cHe can get back on top of the world,\u201d said the club\u2019s manager, Lucien Favre. \u201cYou have to be blind not to see how good he is in front of goal.\u201d There has been variety to his goals too \u2013 the trademark cool penalty, a close-range header, the long-range screamer, a powerful run and clinical finish.</p> <p>Together Nice and Balotelli are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ligue1football/table\" title=\"\">top of the table</a>. The club are benefitting not only from his presence on the field, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/11/football-mario-balotelli-liverpool-nice-marseille-jurgen-klopp\" title=\"\">also from the attention</a>. Their man is a cover story every day. They boast a charismatic personality capable of at least trying to saunter into the Zlatan Ibrahimovic-shaped hole. Publicity-wise, as far as the French league is concerned, what Zlatan taketh away, Super Mario giveth. Balotelli is a big part of the show.</p> <p>That was crystallised by the reaction to his unfortunate red card having scored a scorching winner against Lorient. A second booking was harsh and the media circus cranked up. Before long the referee released a statement to say he had made a mistake, and even the president of Lyon, who would have benefitted from a banned Balotelli since they meet after the international break, spoke out on the player\u2019s behalf. Balotelli has now had the red card overturned.</p> <p>It is interesting that, in an echo of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/13/mario-balotelli-no-future-liverpool-jurgen-klopp\" title=\"\">ill-starred move to Liverpool</a>, Balotelli was courted by the men upstairs rather than the head coach. Favre at first seemed as dubious as Brendan Rodgers was when the Italian was delivered to him at Anfield in 2014. Favre\u2019s message was plain at the start: play well and act professional and you can be part of the squad. Play badly and act up and it will not be indulged.</p> <p>Having had so many false restarts, many were doubtful that this Balotelli would be any different from the player who has drifted to frustrating fringes recently. But so far his attitude has been as impressive as his displays. He is not yet fully fit or fully sharp. Favre hopes there is more to come, with the extra training sessions paying off to make him more rounded than a spearhead who is in the right place to bang in goals right now. \u201cHe will get back to his best if he is professional from head to toe,\u201d says the manager.</p> <p>Italy play Liechtenstein and Germany next month. Balotelli once again has something to aim for.</p>",

  "<p>One year ago this week, I was sitting in a cramped hotel room with 15 other staffers in Las Vegas for Bernie Sanders\u2019 first debate for the presidential nomination. The question came from CNN: \u201cWhat is the greatest national security threat?\u201d Pundits <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2015/11/sanders-on-climate-link-to-terrorism/\">criticized and mocked</a> him for weeks after he answered \u201cclimate change\u201d. But he was right.</p> <p>And it\u2019s not just Sanders pointing out the imminent threat posed by climate change to global and national security. CIA analysts and our nation\u2019s military strategists are rightfully naming it as a contributor to refugee flows, the spread of disease, and conflicts over basic resources like food and water.</p> <p>In 2014, <a href=\"http://www.ips-dc.org/report-combat-vs-climate/\">17.5 million people were displaced</a> by climate-related disasters. Those numbers will continue to rise dramatically in the coming decades, according to climate displacement program manager Alice Thomas of Refugees International.</p> <p>Our nation\u2019s defense officials know <a href=\"http://www.acq.osd.mil/ie/download/CCARprint_wForeword_c.pdf\">global warming\u2019s destructive forces could undermine fragile governments</a> in unstable regions of the world where extremist ideologies can take root. Yet mainstream Republican avoidance of reality on the science of climate change impedes the necessary reassignment of resources to meet the challenges posed.</p> <p>Now <a href=\"http://www.ips-dc.org/report-combat-vs-climate/\">a new report from the Institute of Policy Studies</a> provides the most accurate calculation of government spending on climate security to date. The picture isn\u2019t pretty. We\u2019re spending 28 times as much on military security than climate security. A public sector investment of $55bn per year is required to meet the challenge, according to the study. With $21bn in the 2017 budget, a shortfall of $34bn is left.</p> <p>That may seem like an insurmountable hill to climb. It\u2019s not! As the IPS report points out, plenty of money lies untouched in the nation\u2019s bloated military budget.</p> <p>The F-35 fighter plane program is a prime candidate for big cuts. It\u2019s the most expensive weapon ever designed, complete with massive cost overruns. The sad cherry on top: the military admits that <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/17/military-admits-billion-dollar-war-toy-f-35-is-f-ked.html\">this plane just doesn\u2019t work</a>. If we turned back now, IPS says we could build enough offshore wind farms to power 320,000 homes for millions of people.</p> <p>Savings from gutting a Navy program designed to build close-to-shore combat ships would provide enough funds to retrain more than 150,000 coal industry workers. The ships have been <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/12/politics/us-navy-littoral-combat-ship-overhaul/\">plagued with mechanical errors</a>. Our own Government Accountability Office says the \u201cactual lethality and survivability performance of LCS is still largely unproven through realistic testing\u201d. <a href=\"http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/22/Has-Navy-Wasted-Billions-Its-New-Combat-Ship\">Others have called</a> the ships an outright \u201cwaste\u201d. Retraining and redistributing our fossil-fuel workforce to green jobs would be a welcome reprioritization.</p> <p>Congress could harness additional savings by reducing service contracting and canceling other wasteful or unnecessary weapons programs. But one party largely stands in the way. Republicans are hell-bent on leading our country down an unforgivable road with grave consequences. Their party\u2019s nominee for president <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/09/trump-global-warming-hoax\">believes</a> that global warming is a hoax engineered by the Chinese. That would be comical if it weren\u2019t so dangerous.</p> <p>Rich Americans justify inaction by dismissing climate change as a far off problem that will affect others. But climate change is here and now. And while the sharpest edge of its destructive forces will sadly hurt people of color and lower-income the hardest, we\u2019re all in deep trouble.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://theweek.com/speedreads/653587/hurricane-matthew-kill-weather-channel-warns-unusually-blunt-psa\">unusually forceful public service announcement</a>, The Weather Channel this week warned Floridians that Hurricane Matthew would lead to a heartbreaking loss of life. Florida governor Rick Scott said: \u201cThis storm will kill you.\u201d These un-natural weather occurrences are becoming more and more frequent.</p> <p>My home state of California <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/09/doing-something-about-the-drought_n_7000126.html\">faces its worst drought in 1,200 years</a>. When I traveled home for the holidays two years ago, I saw the devastating impact of climate change firsthand. Where boats once sat docked in my hometown marina, <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2014/12/05/Californias-drought-worst-in-1200-years/7271417805105/\">only dust remained</a>. Climate scientists are telling us that the United States is not immune to the instability and infighting that will occur when populations are forced to fight over food and water. They need only look to California for confirmation, where northerners and southerners <a href=\"http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2015/07/28/is-southern-california-sucking-northern-water-supply-dry-during-drought/\">argue fiercely over water access</a>.</p> <p>The only practical solution to curb unrest, suffering and death here and abroad is a massive redistribution of government money. This week\u2019s new report from IPS serves as a thoughtful blueprint.</p> <p>Republicans should take heed of former GOP President Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s words of wisdom:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.</p> </blockquote> <p>Let\u2019s steward our resources wisely. Let\u2019s choose climate over combat.</p>",
  "<p>I left my wife for the last time in the summer resort community of Fire Island, New York. Instead of saving the marriage, our charming little beach house had been its killing floor. I still loved her, but I couldn\u2019t stand the fighting any more, or see a way through it.</p> <p>As the ferry crossed the water to return me to Long Island, I sensed a huge, dark territory ahead. Getting through it would require all my strength and patience, and most of my money, although there wasn\u2019t much of that. I was a struggling freelance journalist. She was a bartender who published the occasional short story. We owned almost nothing, and thankfully had no children. Even so, I worried the end of my marriage would be the end of me. But it wasn\u2019t. </p> <p>My truck was parked near the ferry terminal. It felt good to get behind the wheel. The farther away I could drive, the safer I would be, because I craved her like an addict. I thanked America for its size. I could keep driving away from her for days on end.</p> <p>But I also needed a place to hole up and lick my wounds. My friend Bruce from Fat Possum Records offered me a trailer in the small town of Water Valley, Mississippi. In his studio next door, he was recording the last of the real-deal Mississippi bluesmen, who had lived the rough, violent lives they sang about. </p> <p>\u201cYou can stay there for free, but you\u2019re going to have these guys staying with you from time to time,\u201d said Bruce. \u201cIt might get rowdy.\u201d </p> <p>James \u201cT-Model\u201d Ford, who was in his early 80s, and his drummer Spam, were the most frequent guests. They would pull up outside in T-Model\u2019s 1979 powder-blue Lincoln Continental, and unload guitar equipment, bottles of whiskey, boxes of fried chicken. </p> <p>T-Model had worked most of his life in logging and sawmill operations, but one day a record executive had heard him playing a rough exuberant blues in a bar in Mississippi, and signed him up. Now T-Model was an international recording artist, flying off to perform in Japan, Canada, England, Germany.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The bluesmen hated to see a man brought down so low by a woman.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>T-Model had been through more heartache and horror than I could possibly imagine. His father beat him so brutally as a child that he lost a testicle. Later on, his father stole T-Model\u2019s first wife, and what really hurt was how willingly she went. T-Model watched another wife die on the kitchen floor after drinking poison to induce a miscarriage. He had been shot, stabbed, pinned under a fallen tree, beaten senseless with a chair by one of his sons, poisoned by the woman he had loved the most.</p> <p>I was a sorry, heartbroken wreck that summer, and the bluesmen hated to see a man brought down so low by a woman. They would open the whiskey bottle, and give me their best advice. I liked the idea of this \u2013 getting divorce counseling from heartbreak specialists \u2013 but I found their recommendations hard to use. </p> <p>Paul \u201cWine\u201d Jones advised going to a whorehouse in Memphis where the women could do tricks with ping-pong balls and shoot them through miniature basketball hoops. \u201cIf you got money, that place will fix any man\u2019s blues,\u201d he said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2015/oct/07/blues-hands-joseph-rosen-the-hands-that-play-the-blues-in-pictures-buddy-guy-al-green\">The hands that play the blues \u2013\u00a0in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Spam, who was setting out on a tour of Europe with one pair of boxer shorts and a can of Vienna sausages, warned me to be careful of sporting women.

A prostitute named Francine had sliced them off with a box-cutter. \u201cAnd you still ain\u2019t broke up with her!\u201d yelled an incensed T-Model Ford. Spam and Francine, it turned out, were in the worst co-dependent relationship I had ever heard of.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t let nothing get me down,\u201d he said, and it was amazingly true. T-Model had strange, violent tendencies, but most of the time, he was full of charm and good humor, flashing his gold-toothed grin, and achieving extraordinary success with the ladies for a man in his 80s.<br></p> <p>\u201cYou need to be like the tree,\u201d he told me. \u201cA tree just keep on growing and growing.

'A tree just keep on growing and growing'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It all helped to put my own blues into perspective. I lived in a kinder, gentler world, with an invisible safety net of money and privilege \u2013 I had left my wife in a beach house at a fashionable resort. Nonetheless, the pain in my heart was real, and the legal paperwork was making it worse.</p> <p>In the midst of the filing, and counter-filing, I went to Oregon to climb a mountain and write about it. Afterwards, in Portland, I looked up a friend called Sabrina, and we went out for drinks. She listened to my tale of woe, and then took me into her bed. </p> <p>I was awkward and unsure of myself. My marriage had also been a 10-year sexual obsession, and it felt so strange to be with someone else. With kindness, grace and tenderness, Sabrina gave me what I can best describe as sexual healing. We carried on seeing each other on a long-distance basis for a year afterwards, and I still feel incredibly grateful. </p> <p>Since then, I\u2019ve seen other male friends go through divorce. Some have rebounded into torrid affairs, or sunk into long stretches of debauchery. Others have sat depressed in the house for months, or turned to meditation, yoga, reckless adventures in distant lands. My female friends, on the whole, have done far better at calling it quits and getting on with their lives. </p> <p>For me, it took about three years to get over it. I wonder now if my cautious, sensible approach made any difference, because three years seems to be fairly standard, no matter how you approach it. Maybe I should have run wild. </p> <p>Predictably enough, falling in love again, at a time when I was healed enough not to screw things up, made the biggest difference of all. But I still remained very touchy and hostile on the question of getting married. I had bitterly resented having the state and its legal apparatus tangled up in my affairs of the heart, and vowed never again. But the years rolled on, and the bitterness slowly faded. I\u2019m married again now, and raising a daughter in Mississippi. The ring on my finger is a symbol of hope.</p>",
  "<p>India\u2019s supreme court has granted a divorce to a man on the grounds of \u201ccruelty\u201d after his wife refused to share a home with her in-laws, effectively ruling that a married woman must live with her husband\u2019s family.</p> <p>Justice Anil R Dave, one of the the most senior judges in India, said the wife\u2019s desire to leave her in-laws\u2019 home was inspired by \u201cwestern thought\u201d and violated traditional values of Indian Hindus.</p> <p>\u201cIn normal circumstances, a wife is expected to be with the family of the husband after the marriage,\u201d stated the <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/multimedia/archive/03037/Hindu_son_can_divo_3037056a.pdf\">supreme court ruling</a>, which also dismissed the wife\u2019s attempt to kill herself as a plot to \u201ctorture\u201d her husband and his relatives.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/10/india-all-female-newspaper-khabar-lahariya-gender-taboos-old-news\">India\u2019s all-female paper goes digital to make gender taboos old news</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is no legal obligation for men to live with their parents, so the ruling still allows couples to live independently if men choose to set up a separate home. But the case had been seen as a test, pitting the rights of women against traditional Hindu values.</p> <p>Activists said the ruling left millions of women who were in unhappy marriages or with abusive husbands even more vulnerable.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at the language the court has used, it\u2019s very regressive,\u201d said Tenzing Chusang, from the <a href=\"http://www.lawyerscollective.org/wri\">Women\u2019s Rights Initiative</a>, a lawyers\u2019 collective. \u201cIf you make the grounds of divorce very lenient for men, it makes the woman very vulnerable.\u201d</p> <p>Divorce in India carries a huge stigma: there are few financial provisions for divorced women, and little legal support.</p> <p>Chusang said: \u201cIn India there\u2019s no such thing as shared matrimonial property or equal division of assets. All she gets if the husband divorces her, and that too after years of litigation, is a minimal maintenance payment. What can she do? She has to stay.\u201d</p> <p>The judge said the wife\u2019s claims that her husband was having an affair were fabricated, and that her suicide attempt was a devious attempt to manipulate her husband\u2019s family.</p> <p>He focused on the \u201ctremendous stress\u201d the husband might have faced if she had succeeded in killing herself. \u201cOne can imagine how a poor husband would get entangled into the clutches of law [after a suicide], which would virtually ruin his sanity, peace of mind, career and probably his entire life,\u201d the judgment said. <br></p> <p>It said a suicide attempt alone was grounds for ending a marriage. \u201cIn our opinion, only this one event was sufficient for the appellant husband to get a decree of divorce on the ground of cruelty,\u201d it said.</p> <p>The case, which has been moving through the glacially slow Indian justice system for more than two decades, was brought by a man from the southern Indian state of Karnataka. He wanted to divorce his wife after she insisted on leaving her in-laws\u2019 home, but had been denied a divorce by the high court.</p> <p>In India, women are expected to move in with the relatives of their husbands, follow the rules and customs of their home, and ideally, blend in seamlessly as a new daughter. <br></p> <p>But in reality forced or quickly arranged marriages mean many young women marry into a life of near slavery, being responsible for all household chores and expected to obey their in-laws\u2019 every demand. Often, they are barred from taking paid work, and have little control of the family purse. In rural areas, many women are prohibited from wearing western clothing, meeting friends after dark or leaving the house.</p> <p>Some women have been pushing back against these restrictions, as the wife in this case tried to do. But the judge ruled that the \u201cpious obligation\u201d of Hindu men to look after their parents took precedence over her wishes.</p> <p> \u201cIt is not a common practice or desirable culture for a Hindu son in India to get separated from his parents on getting married at the instance of the wife, especially when the son is the only earning member in the family,\u201d the ruling said.</p> <p>It is the latest blow for women\u2019s rights in a country where sexual violence and trafficking is common, marital rape is not a crime, and discrimination is endemic.</p> <p>In a 2012 poll of gender specialists around the world, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/23/why-india-bad-for-women\">India was voted the worst G20 country in which to be a woman</a>. It was ranked worse than Saudi Arabia, where women can\u2019t legally drive and were only allowed to vote for the first time in 2015. <br></p> <p>The ruling also risks entrenching a dangerously imbalanced sex ratio, by endorsing parental preference for sons, who are seen as being more likely to support their parents in old age. The 2011 census found that for every 1,000 boys, there were only 918 girls. Sex-selective abortion was believed to account for much of the gap.</p> <p>\u201cThe court is emphasising that it\u2019s the son\u2019s duty to look after his parents,\u201d said Chusang. \u201cSo basically it\u2019s saying that [a daughter] is not really part of the family. She\u2019s going to leave, she\u2019s never going to look after her parents in old age, and therefore she has no value.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 In India, suicide hotlines <a href=\"http://www.suicide.org/hotlines/international/india-suicide-hotlines.html\">can be found here</a>.

We said it was nicely poised at half-time but I don\u2019t know that many saw that second half coming.</p> <p>Sydney arguably shaded the first half, but the Wanderers were not without their chances.

It\u2019s a result that sends shudders across the league \u2013 teams will need to watch the tape closely to find cracks in this XI, they were reliable at the back, tenacious in midfield and dangerous up front.</p> <p>For Tony Popovic some very early headaches \u2013 for the second time this season his side have looked decidedly off the pace of key league rivals.</p> <p>Jumpei was a rare bright spot, and Martinez showed his potential in a brief cameo. But this looks a side still struggling to replace that host of quality players they lost in the off-season. Hamill tried hard but the loss of Scott Jamieson was keenly felt, and whereas Nichols and Bulut combined well in patches, you\u2019d imagine the Wanderers will need far more creativity in the front third if they\u2019re to pick apart rival defences.</p> <p>All in all though, a stunning display of attacking football in front of a giant crowd of 61,880.

There\u2019s talk of a record regular season crowd coming through the turnstiles at ANZ Stadium (with Wanderers\u2019 normal home ground at Parramatta currently under renovation). And if that wasn\u2019t enough motivation, Sydney FC captain Alex Brosque lit the touch paper with some, well, frankly over the top comments midweek, in which he stated of the Wanderers players: \u201cWe hate every single one of them\u201d.</p> <p>Both the Wanderers and Sydney FC have had a huge turnover during the off-season. Graham Arnold presumably due to the incredibly disappointing season his chargers had last year. He\u2019d never coached a team that didn\u2019t make the finals; until then. In comes a raft of experienced faces, Socceroos Alex Wilkinson and Michael Zullo, as well as veteran shot-shopper Danny Vukovic to sure up defence. Their problems were up front though with last season\u2019s goal return a whopping goal-a-game less than Melbourne City across the regular season.</p> <p>In comes the delightfully named Bobo, who will be expected to lead the line, as well as re-engage the at times disappointing Filip Holosko.</p> <p>For Tony Popovic it was perhaps a case of being victims of their own success \u2013 key first team players Scott Jamieson, Mark Bridge and Dario Vidosic all saw moves overseas, while Spanish duo Andreu and Alberto as well as livewire winger Romeo Castelen presumably wanted too much more coin to stick around. It\u2019s a host of new faces therefore for the Wanderers, and while players like Jumpei Kusukami and Nicholas Martinez could prove tremendous players it\u2019s made for a disjointed pre-season for Western Sydney; no more evident then during their 4-1 FFA Cup mauling at the hands (or feet) of Melbourne City.</p> <p>Incidentally, no Nikolai Topor-Stanley for this key clash \u2013 he pays a heavy price for his needless dismissal in that game.</p> <p>History suggests Sydney FC have the wood over Wanderers in recent seasons, but you\u2019d imagine with so many new faces that\u2019s essentially moot. It could turn into a goal-laden end-to-end thriller, or a turgid, badly-natured arm-wrestle.</p> <p>Guess you\u2019ll just have to stick around to see which!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f89cb4e4b03258bcac58dd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-08T07:15:45.194Z\">8.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Richard will be here shortly to take you through the eagerly anticipated first Sydney derby of 2016-17, but in the interim here\u2019s David Squires\u2019 A-League season preview.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/picture/2016/oct/06/david-squires-on-the-beginning-of-the-2016-17-a-league-season\">David Squires on ... the beginning of the 2016-17 A-League season</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>",

Because the clown doesn\u2019t belong there. Because the clown is out of context. Because there\u2019s a clown panic going on and the clown\u2019s only reason for existing is spreading fear and dread. </p> <p>But what do the creepy clowns <em>mean</em>, wring a million hands. Perhaps it\u2019s just for fun. Perhaps it\u2019s anxiety over \u2026 the economy? Global warming? Social media?</p> <p>Bear with me \u2013 this is kind of a stretch \u2013 but could it be that a very big creepy clown is actually showing up and menacing us in our streets, woods and schools? That the fear he inspires is spreading, and it\u2019s unclear what is true and what is not? This clown\u2019s mask is a horror show in itself, he wears a terrible wig and, although it is said that he kids a lot, is never funny. </p> <p>One of the reasons that people cite for disliking clowns is the notion of the \u201cnearly human\u201d or uncanny valley, where you will find chill-inducing things like clowns, marionettes, monkeys, masks, mannequins, certain robots, scarecrows. In the 1980s, a time when nuclear war was very much on the minds of the people, we had a president who was uncanny, too. I remember getting a bag of Republican jellybeans with an elephant on the package when trick-or-treating on 31 October 1980. Reagan was famously fond of them. And holding the bag and thinking \u201cthis elephant is cute but I heard someone say he didn\u2019t want to die if Reagan was elected, because Reagan was going to start a nuclear war.\u201d </p> <p>Ronald Reagan, with his strange, molded, too-dark hair and rouged cheeks and permanent smile, was everything horrifying about the phrase \u201cAll-American\u201d. So twinkly and grandfatherly he was, but he also scared the hell out of many children who feared that nuking the Russians was going to happen if you said the wrong thing in front of Grandpa. And then the Russians would nuke back and next thing you know the skies are gray with fallout.</p> <p>Americans bought Reagan\u2019s act, though he was as creepy as they come, a poor simulation of humanity, a bona fide authoritarian wrapped in the cozy trappings of grandpa, sort of like the sadistic child-stalking Santa Claus. </p> <p>Of course, Reagan is the very soul of humanity compared with Great Killer Clown Donald J Trump, but most people are. I\u2019ve heard a few people say, \u201cHe makes me nostalgic for George Bush.\u201d </p> <p>I think this \u201cclown epidemic\u201d is a form of real-time trauma play. Right now, in this nation, on this planet, a bona fide human-like sociopath is very close to grabbing the One Ring of Power. Or the Former One Ring of Power that is Still Pretty Powerful. </p> <p>China may be the Coke of today and we may just be the Pepsi, which may partially explain the second-rate, rinky-dink two-bit hustler who has fooled millions of people into thinking he somehow cares about them, courting steelworkers as he loads his buildings with Chinese steel, pretending to care about small business owners while notoriously stiffing them for decades. </p> <p>Somewhere in their heads they must understand that they are not acting in their best interest, and this gigantic killer clown is using their despair and hopelessness against them by masterfully pulling their anger strings, turning them, too into ugly, disjointed residents of his angry uncanny valley. </p> <p>And Trump\u2019s dark undertow is pulling other killer clowns out of the shadows. Emboldened, they walk the streets, bearing the possibility that we, as a nation, may be stepping off a cliff of denial into a valley of hatred, fear and fascism.</p> <p>Obviously, it\u2019s time to panic over imaginary clowns.</p>",
  "<p>For humanities dons grumpily watching their scientific counterparts becoming instant millionaires and global celebrities in the current Nobel prize season while they go unhonoured, there was one reason to rejoice this week: a philosopher securing a prize worth $1m (\u00a3810,000) more than the current value (about $930,000, or \u00a3750,000) of each Nobel.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/live/2016/oct/03/nobel-prize-in-medicine-2016-to-be-announced-live\">Yoshinori Ohsumi wins Nobel prize in medicine \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Charles Taylor, a Canadian in his 80s (now at McGill University, formerly at Oxford) perhaps best known for <em>Sources of the Self</em> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/08/society1\"><em>A Secular Age</em></a>, was awarded the inaugural Berggruen prize, for ideas \u201cshaping human self-understanding and the advancement of humanity\u201d; and just as eye-popping as its value were the previous Taylor laurels offhandedly listed at the end of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/books/canadian-philosopher-wins-1-million-prize.html\">the New York Times\u2019s report</a>, adding up to lifetime earnings of around $4.5m just from awards. This a figure would only put him 292nd if transposed to the current golf rankings, but still shakes up one\u2019s ideas of a profession traditionally associated with an austere devotion to thought alone.</p> <p>When Alfred Nobel, a chemical engineer and businessman, established his prizes in his will, no humanities disciplines were included. Fields beyond science were only reflected in the anomalous non-academic awards for literature \u2013 announced for 2016 next week \u2013 and peace (the prize for economics was not introduced until the 1960s). This denied all kinds of non-fiction authors the chance to win humongous sums and be crowned world No 1, but it also left gaps that other foundations and philanthropists have since moved to fill, making possible spectacular paydays for intellectual galacticos such as Taylor.</p> <p>Among his other trophies, for example, are the thought and ethics category of Japan\u2019s 50m-yen (about $480,000) Kyoto prize, won this year by Martha Nussbaum and previously by J\u00fcrgen Habermas and Paul Ricoeur; and Britain\u2019s \u00a31,200,000, pointedly Nobel-rivalling Templeton prize for \u201caffirming life\u2019s spiritual dimension\u201d, recently also claimed by Martin Rees and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathan-sacks\">Jonathan Sacks</a>. (He hasn\u2019t got an Erasmus prize or a Rolf Shock prize, won respectively by fellow philosophy giants Daniel Dennett and Derek Parfit, but may well feel that at $170,000 and $280,000 they\u2019re small beer).</p> <p>Other lifetime awards open up lucrative opportunities for authors in further fields such as history, sociology, anthropology, cultural studies and even literary scholarship; such as Norway\u2019s annual Holberg prize (worth about $560,000), chiefly for the arts and humanities, won by Michael Cook in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/marina-warner\">Marina Warner </a>in 2015 and Stephen Greenblatt in 2016. Or the $1.5m Kluge prize for the humanities and social sciences, which Taylor and Habermas shared last year.</p> <p>While these names might suggest that anyone under 70 is ineligible for Nobel-size purses, agreeable cheques have also gone to mid-career dons; notably via the Mellon awards (worth $1.5m over three years and often dubbed the \u201crichest prize in the humanities\u201d), whose winners have included Judith Butler and literature professor Eric Sundquist. And comparative youth is positively favoured in the MacArthur \u201cgenius\u201d awards ($625,000 over five years), which are usually seen as enabling creative types to stay in their garrets but included 14 recipients with academic posts (a linguist and an art historian among them) in this year\u2019s 30-strong squad. Like older non-fiction stars deprived of a chance to be feted and enriched in Stockholm, they\u2019re entitled to ask: who needs a Nobel?</p>",

The city is now in a position to capitalize on the infrastructure of the past in ways that could not have been anticipated at the depths of its post-industrial depression two decades ago, when the city\u2019s population was half its industry peak and the unemployment rate was worse than in Detroit.</p> <p>Last week, the city hosted Thrival, a three-day showcase of panel discussions and exhibitions designed to show off the city\u2019s post-industrial charms. From robotics to biotech, performing arts to healthcare, the city\u2019s premier boosters \u2013 many locals or returning natives \u2013 sought to describe the city\u2019s upswing. </p> <p>The twin keys to the city\u2019s current success, says the festival\u2019s executive producer, Dan Law, are education and medicine \u2013 eds and meds \u2013 that helped bridge the gap between old industrial Pittsburgh and a new Pittsburgh that\u2019s about innovation and technology. Now, instead of leaving, students from Pittsburgh\u2019s tech university departments have more options to stay.</p> <p>\u201cEds and meds are the bedrock of the economic transition,\u201d says Law. \u201cUPMC \u2013 University of Pittsburgh Medical Center \u2013 alone is a $13bn health system and there are dozens of ancillary industries that began to innovate. So young people started to get jobs here and economic growing around the core economic pillars.\u201d</p> <p>Correspondingly, the city\u2019s arts and culture are thriving. \u201cThe City of Bridges is in the throes of a full-on nose-to-tail, barrel-aged, small-plates culinary renaissance,\u201d according to <a href=\"http://www.bonappetit.com/restaurants-travel/navigator/article/pittsburgh-navigator\">Bon Appetit </a>magazine.

The hurricane smashed through Haiti\u2019s western peninsula on Tuesday with 145 mile-per-hour (233 kph) winds and torrential rain. At least three towns in the hills and coast of Haiti\u2019s fertile western tip reported dozens of people killed, including the farming village of Chantal where the mayor said 86 people died, mostly when trees crushed houses. Food was scarce in Haiti and at least seven people died of cholera, likely because of flood water mixing with sewage. The Mesa Verde, a US Navy amphibious transport dock ship, was heading for Haiti to support relief efforts. </p> <p>Matthew has also triggered mass evacuations along the US coast from Florida through Georgia and into South Carolina and North Carolina. It is forecast to move near or over the South Carolina coast Saturday morning, the National Hurricane Center reports, and it will near North Carolina\u2019s southern coast by Saturday night. </p> <p>The hurricane sideswiped Florida\u2019s coast with winds of up to 120 mph (195 kph) but did not make landfall in the state. There were at least four storm-related deaths in Florida but no immediate reports of significant damage in cities and towns where the storm swamped streets, toppled trees and knocked out power to more than 1 million people. Two people were killed by falling trees, according to Florida officials, and an elderly couple died of carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator while sheltering from the storm inside a garage. </p> <p>The hurricane raked the Georgia coast, including some of the state\u2019s islands such as St. Simons and Tybee. </p> <p>At 2 a.m. EDT, Matthew had sustained winds of 105 mph (165 kph), and was centered 45 miles (70 kilometers) south of Hilton Head, South Carolina.

It is moving north as the nearby coastline bends to the northwest, so the storm is getting farther from the coast. The geometry changes over the next 24h (beginning Friday evening) because the coastline of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina bends back to the northeast. </p> <p>Although the storm may also start bending more to the northeast, that probably won\u2019t happen until the storm center draws nearer to the coastline. The storm may actually make a brief landfall in South Carolina on Friday as a category 1 or 2 hurricane. The storm did not make landfall in Florida which was a great relief because that kept the strongest winds just offshore.</p> <p>Although the most intense winds stayed offshore, bands of moderately strong winds and intense rains are hundreds of miles across and have produced heavy rain and large storm surges along the coast. That will continue into Georgia and the Carolinas tonight and tomorrow. <br></p> <p>So Georgia, South Carolina, and maybe southeastern North Carolina are likely to see some coastal flooding.

In a category 3 hurricane, winds of up to 129mph are expected, homes are likely to be damaged, and trees will be uprooted, blocking roads. Power and water outages are also likely and could last \u201cseveral days to weeks after the storm passes\u201d.</p> <p>Pretty much the only comfort to be had is the fact that Matthew is no longer expected to be a category 4 hurricane \u2013 these are classed as causing \u201ccatastrophic\u201d damage, with roofs ripped off houses and walls blown down in winds of up to 156mph, leaving residential areas cut off by fallen trees and power poles, and the area \u201cuninhabitable for weeks or months\u201d.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T09:03:38.057Z\">at 10.03am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f745cee4b05c2f1e952ead\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T07:07:53.799Z\">8.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If you\u2019re in the region, you can share your experiences of what it\u2019s like where you are by filling in the form below, or by clicking on the blue \u2018Contribute\u2019 button at the top of this article.

And as many Floridians heeded calls to evacuate, both candidates began the delicate and difficult task of pursuing votes during a crisis. </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s campaign asked the state for more time to register voters a request Florida governor Rick Scott rejected and the Trump team pulled its negative TV ads. </p> <p>\u201cIt looks like it\u2019s a big one and it\u2019s going to be a bad one,\u201d said Trump at a town hall in New Hampshire. \u201cPlease know that we are praying for you and everyone in the path: You\u2019ve got to take care of yourself, you\u2019ve got to get out of the area, you\u2019ve got to listen.\u201d </p> <p>The hurricane is expected to hit Trump\u2019s prized Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach. Campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said, \u201cMr. Trump spoke with employees yesterday to ensure they are safe and following instructions from local officials.\u201d </p> <p>Clinton tweeted: \u201cHurricane Matthew is a major storm. ... Stay safe Florida.\u201d </p> <p>Both stayed far away, preparing for their second debate, a town hall-style faceoff on Sunday in St. Louis. Trump was holding a dry run town hall in Sandown, New Hampshire, while Clinton was speaking at fundraisers in New York. </p> <p>Along the Southeast coast, Matthew was expected to bring dangerous conditions to Georgia, South Carolina and, possibly, North Carolina. But it was the impact on vote-rich Florida, a must-win state for Trump, that had the campaigns on high alert. The hurricane closed in just as both sides ramped up their early-vote push and just days before a voter registration deadline. </p> <p>Vote-by-mail ballots are being sent to voters across the state this week, leaving the potential for ballots to arrive just as voters temporarily abandon their homes. So far, a record 2.5 million people nearly one-third of those who voted in 2012 have made requests for the early ballots. </p> <p><strong>Scott said Thursday evening that he would not consider extending the 11 October voter registration deadline. </strong></p> <p>\u201cEveryone has had a lot of time to register,\u201d Scott said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t intend to make any changes.\u201d </p> <p>Scott, a Republican, is a strong supporter of GOP nominee Donald Trump and chairman of a Super PAC running Clinton-bashing television ads. </p> <p>Disruptions in Florida campaigning were immediate. In Palm Beach County, local Republican Chairman Michael Barnett said Matthew already had forced cancellations, including phone-banking operations and an event where Ivanka Trump was the headliner. Local GOP officials also will miss an opportunity for outreach to Latino leaders, because an annual gala of a local Hispanic civic group was canceled. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T02:34:18.757Z\">at 3.34am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f6fc1de4b0e4aaeaa8cc50\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T01:37:26.547Z\">2.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some more dramatic video of the storm\u2019s impact as it blew through Haiti and the Bahamas:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ABC/status/784201198538600450\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">New video released by US Coast Guard captures bird&#39;s-eye view of staggering damage in Haiti after Hurricane <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Matthew?src=hash\">#Matthew</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/6rOrfC9sBH\">https://t.co/6rOrfC9sBH</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/PLVLdY9dNO\">pic.twitter.com/PLVLdY9dNO</a></p>&mdash; ABC News (@ABC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ABC/status/784201198538600450\">October 7, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ABC/status/784195710853840897\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dramatic video shows Hurricane <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Matthew?src=hash\">#Matthew</a> blow roof off house in the Bahamas; storm hours away from Florida landfall. <a href=\"https://t.co/b0fVGGm4kI\">https://t.co/b0fVGGm4kI</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/tXU9IRB7Ws\">pic.twitter.com/tXU9IRB7Ws</a></p>&mdash; ABC News (@ABC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ABC/status/784195710853840897\">October 7, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f6f4d0e4b0e4aaeaa8cc43\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T01:26:42.064Z\">2.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Florida governor Rick Scott maintains that state and local officials are prepared for Hurricane Matthew, even as he called the storm bearing down on the state a \u201cmonster,\u201d <strong>reports the Associated Press.</strong><br></p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cMatthew is likely to produce devastating impacts,\u201d Scott says. </p> <p>Scott says people in the northeast part of the state still have time to evacuate and residents could still choose to go to a shelter. </p> <p>Authorities have told roughly 1.5 million people across the state to evacuate.

  "<p>I am sneaking food to the chicken under our kitchen table. It is hunched by my chair leg, a ragged bundle of brown feathers. Mum is too ill and Dad too busy feeding her to notice, and my brother doesn\u2019t mind. Besides, who could begrudge it my leftover welsh rarebit when it is so miserable? I know it is miserable, because I am fluent in chicken.</p> <p>Chicken is a subtle dialect. The \u201ccluck, cluck, cluck\u201d mimicked by humans everywhere is the vocalisation of a contented bird, but is just one of many. When disgruntled, a chicken sounds closer to a flustered WI member who has dropped a trifle. We all know their warning call and, on hearing it, run to chase off lurking foxes. This is not to be confused with the screeching that signals aerial predators or, more likely, hot air balloons. None of these threats is what has driven the chicken under our table, however. It is there because it is an outcast. I can empathise: talking chicken has always come easily to me, but communicating with my own kind is another matter.</p> <p>It is the late 90s and I live in the Somerset countryside with my mother, father, brother and other animals. Town dwellers sometimes confuse our home for a farm, but the truth is my family just loves animals. My mother has adored ducks since she used to de-stress from her doctor\u2019s training by feeding them at Regent\u2019s Park in London, and my father, an engineer, shares her passion. Our neighbours have a smallholding and wildlife frequents our garden. Cats, rats, ducks, bats, chickens, badgers, horses, hamsters. I can\u2019t imagine a childhood without them. Do other children really not throw leftovers out the window, where some small stomach will take care of them? Have other children not sheltered a hedgehog over winter; nor cried bitterly when, on the night it was released, a badger left its gutted hide, like an abandoned hand puppet, on the lawn? Do other children not own a misogynistic cockerel that attacks women 20 times its size? One day, my aunt tries to defend herself with colourful scraps of fabric tied to a bamboo pole, thinking that a good shake of this will frighten the cockerel away. The attempt fails, but I shall never forget the sublime beauty of my aunt morris dancing with a chicken.</p> <p>The only creatures missing from my youth are other children. I wonder if this is for the best, as my experiences at secondary school have led me to believe I must be a species apart from the gaggles of other girls, some of whom can henpeck just as sharply as our chickens. I\u2019m not without friends entirely, but am confined to the outskirts. It is easier to vanish into books and the countryside.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Socialisation wasn\u2019t always this hard. In primary school, I was the bossy queen of pretend. Friends often came over for tea, and to feed our ducks. Once, my eight-year-old self took charge after a breakout of goats from a petting zoo, leading the panicking adults carrying the bleating creatures back to their enclosure. Then, I wasn\u2019t afraid of anything. That time was the \u201cbefore\u201d, followed by the \u201cafter\u201d; the dividing line the fuzzy border of my mother\u2019s progressive multiple sclerosis, diagnosed when she was 38 and I was nine.</p> <p>The horror of multiple sclerosis is that it can steal everything from a person. In my mother\u2019s case, it ate at her mobility until it had all but locked her within her own flesh, and slowly, insidiously, corroded her mind. The changes it wrought were so radical that I can only think of my childhood as being populated by two mothers, two families, two mes. In the face of my mother\u2019s illness, we must have become unrecognisable. In the space of a few years, our house no longer rang with the laughter of friends, but a heavy silence. Though we weren\u2019t alone, not quite; the animals remained.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I felt lonely I\u2019d lie on my bed and watch the rats huddle. I hungered for the intimacy they shared</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If anything, they were more present than ever. The ducks rapped on the french windows to beg for spaghetti and the chickens snuck in to steal cat food or, better still, whatever was on the table. More than once, we watched as our lunch retreated at great speed as a fluffy chicken bum disappeared into the distance. When they fell sick, pets came to live in a corner of my bedroom, the sad patter of their feet stirring against newspaper during the night, often to be found cold and stiff in the morning. One chick spent months recovering from an operation in our bathroom, so that I sat, covered in bubbles, as a bullet of cream feathers flew about my head.</p> <p>In the absence of other children, the animals became my friends and teachers. From our ducks and chickens, I learned to be close to the ground and grub about in the vast and small tangibility of life. Our cats showed me how to find ease in my own body and never mind the odd looks I got for kicking off my shoes to curl up in public spaces. Human priorities seemed skewed; animals taught me that following your instincts and finding a comfortable way of being in the world was far more important than appearances. And all our pets taught me the meaning of birth, life and death.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23731ac92fdeec3d8ce72ca24bf1fa3fdb4c9801\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23731ac92fdeec3d8ce72ca24bf1fa3fdb4c9801/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Novelist Emma Geen with chickens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018From our chickens, I learned to grub about in the vast and small tangibility of life.\u2019 Photograph: Jon Tonks for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Tonks/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the late noughties, I left home for university, choosing one because I\u2019d heard the psychology department kept puppies to herd the lab rats. I was extremely gullible at this age. Keeping my own pet rats was compensation. When I felt lonely, which was often, I\u2019d lie on my bed and watch them huddle, so close one normally sat on the other\u2019s head. I hungered for the intimacy they shared.</p> <p>I made some friends. These connections never ran as deep as I\u2019d have liked, but they were people with whom to act out the obligatory student experiences. It turned out not everything I learned from my pets was helpful. The primal noise and dark of clubs triggered an animal panic in me. I danced with my eyes on the floor, too scared to meet the eyes of people I fancied; after all, staring is considered a threat by most animals. When friends approached to hug me, I drew back. Our chickens and ducks always hated being held. I practised the art of camouflage, blending into my environment. My favourite part of nights out was the walk back in the quiet before dawn, when even the streets seemed to sigh at the respite from humans. To see a fox or badger flash past set my body afire.</p> <p>When I returned home, I found that my mother\u2019s closest companions were animals, too. She loved nothing more than to be wheeled on to the patio to watch poultry bustle about the garden and, when it was too cold to venture out, she lost whole days in front of the bird feeder. Her paralysis offered the tiny mercy that such stillness allows wild birds to feed freely, barely an arm\u2019s length away. It also meant the cats adored her \u2013 at last, an eternal lap.</p> <p>I also noticed there was something increasingly animal about my mother herself. Her keen intellect had long since crumbled and the diseased tension of her muscles had taken on a predatory coil. Social inhibitions meant little to her any more. She considered it appropriate to yell out in the cinema for the villains to \u201cbugger off\u201d and loved to remark if someone\u2019s bum was particularly fine or fat. Much of the time, she didn\u2019t have the capacity to do even this and lay in her recliner, groaning. Worst of all was when she parroted, repeating one word over and over and over, tasting its shape on her tongue long beyond the point of meaning. To listen to this was like water torture, but must have been far worse to live. Even in the depths of her illness, she was always loving.</p> <p>I wouldn\u2019t realise how precious this was until it was too late but, in her last years, we learned to relate in a quiet, animal fashion. Though neither of us had the words to reach the other, I gave her hugs or held her hand. Sometimes, I brought her favourite treats of chocolate or coconut mushrooms, offering love in the form of food from my hand to her mouth, as I did with our chickens.</p> <p>One day, nearly 15 years after my mother\u2019s diagnosis, I visited her in hospital. It was not uncommon for her to be rushed in with infections. She had pulled out her drip by mistake and, as it was the weekend, I sat with her for hours, waiting for a doctor to put it back in. She was beyond speech and seemed unaware of her surroundings, but when I held her hand, she squeezed back. As I left, the nurse remarked that my mother\u2019s forehead felt warm, but I thought little of it. The phone call came just after I got home. By the time I\u2019d rushed back, she was gone.</p> <p>We had spent so many years watching her die, a little each day, that it was hard to believe she had died completely. For a year, my nights were haunted by dreams in which I carried my mother on my back as she swung between life and death, or was trapped in a mysterious in-between state. It always took a few seconds on waking to remember that she was gone.</p> <p>***</p> <p>It is a few years later, and I am sitting in a cafe with friends. Or, at least, they are sitting; I am curled up, feline. It strikes me that I have finally found my own breed, good people who indulge my strange animal ways. We might not huddle like my rats did, but the same intimacy is there.</p> <p>A weight has lifted, hand-in-hand with the awareness that my difference from other people is more a product of anxiety than taxonomy, and it\u2019s common to feel disconnected from the human race. I can embrace the lessons I learned from animals but also be close to humans. My mother is the quiet tragedy I wear beneath my skin, but how many can honestly claim to be free of scars?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When the sorrow comes, I go in search of animals. It takes only my crouching for the birds to gather</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is a gap in my life where animals should be; the uncertainty of lodging in a city means I am hesitant to bring one into my life, but they are never far away. Seagulls raise their young on the rooftops of my street, and last year an abandoned chick made its way in to live under my bed. Some nights, wild creatures screech and scamper through my garden. The sounds both terrify and thrill, because I know only a wall lies between me and an existence that is utterly alien. I enjoy watching rats along the riverside, and if I eat my lunch outside, it is certain a beady pigeon eye will fix upon me, hungry, hopeful, questioning. A writer, I write my way into the bodies of foxes, octopuses, tigers and other animals, to try to grasp how fantastically different the world is to their senses.</p> <p>When the sorrow comes, I go in search of animals. I do this on the fifth anniversary of my mother\u2019s death. The pond is quiet in the thin morning light, but it takes only my crouching for the birds to gather, and I think of my mother doing the same thing all those years ago in Regent\u2019s Park. Ducks, pigeons, seagulls, all jostling to be fed. There is wonder in a pigeon landing on my hand. There is a weightlessness to a seagull snatching bread from its upward arc, joy in wet beaks nibbling at my fingertips. I am fluent in duck, which is how I know their quacks are happy.</p> <p>\u2022 Emma Geen\u2019s debut novel, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/many-selves-of-katherine-north.html\">The Many Selves Of Katherine North</a>, is published by Bloomsbury Circus at \u00a314.99.</p>",
  "<p>On a cold winter\u2019s morning last November, Michelle James bent over a bulky grey package on her patio. Wrapped in plastic, it lay lengthways on the ground beneath a wooden plant holder. She was with her friend Rhian, and they were about to find out what was inside.</p> <p>A month earlier, James\u2019s friend and upstairs neighbour, Lee Sabine, had died at the age of 74. In the late stages of cancer, Sabine told James about an old medical skeleton she kept in the house: wouldn\u2019t it be funny, Sabine said, if James got it out after she\u2019d gone and put it up in the attic, to scare the people who moved in after her?</p> <p>Armed with kitchen knives, James and Rhian set about cutting through the thick layers of plastic, 41 in all, thinking about the laugh they would have when they sat the skeleton on the couch; the two women wanted to play a joke on their friend, Gareth. But as the final layer gave way, James began to scream. There was an unmistakable stench of decay; this was no student prop, but something much more sinister.</p> <p>James ran inside, telling Rhian to call the police.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The former mining village of Beddau sits in the Rhondda valley, surrounded by lush hills in every shade of green. On a warm late summer evening, children gather in its many playing fields, flying kites and kicking balls between discarded clothes doubling as goalposts; doors are left ajar to let in a breath of air. In its industrial heyday, Beddau was dominated by social housing estates, built to support the colliery and coking plant; more recently, tiers of new estates with smarter cars parked outside have sprung up to accommodate the Cardiff commuters, attracted by low house prices and the proximity to the M4. Newcomers have loosened the stitches of this tight-knit community, where a third of the children attend a Welsh-speaking primary school. Even so, it is a place where generations of families have grown up together, where neighbours still look out for each other and secrets are hard to keep.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"18b866d84a639172048a5d3399db817fbfff7f2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18b866d84a639172048a5d3399db817fbfff7f2d/0_0_771_463/500.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Sabine.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Sabine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Media Wales Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the police arrived at James\u2019s flat in the Trem-y-Cwm block on 24 November 2015, they found human remains on the patio she had shared with Sabine; although partially decomposed, the skull had been well-preserved. A pathologist identified evidence of foul play \u2013 a blow to the back of the head \u2013 and a murder inquiry was launched.</p> <p>That a body had been found in their midst came as a shock to the villagers: there is little serious crime in Beddau. South Wales police had no recent missing persons reports, no assaults, no 999 calls. Initially, they considered the possibility that the corpse had been dumped on the patio by someone who had travelled there from outside the area; but the patio was accessible only via the flats, putting the spotlight on its residents.</p> <p>James was the first to find herself under suspicion. Within hours of calling the police, she was arrested and taken into custody. But as the police looked into James\u2019s account of her neighbour, Lee Sabine, they discovered that a John Sabine \u2013 an accountant and a veteran of the Korean war \u2013 had once been registered at the same address. No one remembered seeing him, and there was no record of his death. The couple had signed a joint tenancy agreement in February 1997; it turned out that John had registered with the local GP that year, and ordered a repeat prescription in April \u2013 but it was never picked up. The body was still clothed in pyjamas with a St Michael label, last used by Marks &amp; Spencer in the year 2000. Detectives identified dental records and a hip replacement serial number, and set about trying to match them with local surgeries or hospitals. They found nothing useful. After 48 hours in custody, James was released.</p> <p>Finally, on 11 December, three weeks after the body was discovered, police got the breakthrough they were looking for. A relative of John Sabine came forward to provide them with a DNA sample: it matched the remains found at Trem-y-Cwm. A postmortem confirmed that Sabine had died as a result of \u201cblunt trauma\u201d to the head. His wife, Lee, was named as the main suspect.</p> <p>The friends who had gathered at Lee\u2019s funeral just a month earlier were stunned. How could the woman they knew, a former nightclub singer and Beddau resident for 18 years, be a murderer? How could her neighbours, who had enjoyed Sabine\u2019s summer barbecues, her tarot card readings and invitations to tea (which often turned into something stronger), not have noticed anything was amiss? With her bleached blond hair and theatrical antipodean accent (she had come to Wales from New Zealand), Sabine could hardly be accused of keeping a low profile. But the more they thought about it, the more they realised the clues had been staring them in the face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"806328eb47a3d11620bcb031f52ff7061ba0b7ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/806328eb47a3d11620bcb031f52ff7061ba0b7ae/0_333_5722_3433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neighbour Michelle James opened the package left lying on their shared patio; she was accused of murder.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neighbour Michelle James opened the package left lying on their shared patio; she was accused of murder.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Jones for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mary Gardner, a former foster carer who lives in a bungalow with her partner, Ralph, and their teacup Yorkshire terriers Coco and Trixie, still laughs at the memory of the first time she met Lee. \u201cShe was bent over in the street, looking at the ground. I thought she\u2019d lost something, so I went over.\u201d Mimicking Lee\u2019s accent, Gardner continues: \u201cShe said, \u2018Oh I\u2019m all right, darling, I\u2019m just looking for pretty stones.\u2019 I said to her: \u2018You\u2019re not going to find them there.\u2019 She laughed and said: \u2018Take no notice of me, I like to do mysterious things.\u2019<br></p> <p>\u201cShe was a bit of an eccentric. I would always say she was as mad as a box of frogs. But she said it with a smile, and she was always fizzy and bubbly. We hit it off. She made me laugh.\u201d</p> <p>Back then, Gardner lived in a house next to Sabine\u2019s flats; it has since been demolished. Over the years, the pair would often sit together in Sabine\u2019s garden and talk. Sabine, who was 56 when they met, would tell her what she got up to with her male admirers, and Gardner, half scandalised, half intrigued, would never know whether to believe her or not.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was terrified I would go to prison for a crime someone else committed. Lee knew she was dying. Why didn't she confess?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cShe used to wear this wide leather belt and leather gloves,\u201d says Gardner. Standing up, she swishes her arms around in imitation of Sabine\u2019s flamboyant gestures. \u201cShe was always, darling this, darling that. She liked male attention \u2013 any attention. Her bedroom was all silks and satins, with a silk canopy on the ceiling. There were different coloured drapes and cushions over the bed, and the headboard was all gold. I told her her bedroom was like a tart\u2019s boudoir. I\u2019d never seen anything like it. But I liked her: she was a character.\u201d</p> <p>Even so, Gardner had a nagging suspicion that her friend was not all she seemed. She felt Sabine was familiar from somewhere, but couldn\u2019t put her finger on where. And while she liked to talk, Sabine could be mysterious about her own past, retreating from anyone who got too close. Her house was devoid of any photographs, save one black and white shot of her during her days as a nightclub singer in Australia.</p> <p>\u201cI always thought: \u2018Lee, what are you hiding?\u2019 I\u2019d say: \u2018Haven\u2019t you got someone?\u2019 She\u2019d say, \u2018No, I\u2019m better off on my own.\u2019 I asked about kids and she said, \u2018God, no.\u2019 I always thought I had met her previously, but she would say, \u2018No, I\u2019m from New Zealand.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee4accf0b335651c26d39df2748c771d904dbac7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee4accf0b335651c26d39df2748c771d904dbac7/0_182_5716_3430/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Gardner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sabine told her friend Mary Gardner she had a grandson who had killed himself, which turned out to be a half-truth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Jones for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once, after Gardner\u2019s only daughter, Adele, died in 2006, Sabine told her she had a grandson, who she said had killed himself. Gardner was stunned. \u201cI said: \u2018I thought you didn\u2019t have kids?\u2019 She said, \u2018Oh no, he\u2019s not mine, I just refer to him like that. We were close.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The truth was, the stories Sabine told about her past depended on her audience. She told some people she had been married a long time ago, and that her husband had been violent and unfaithful; she had left him in New Zealand before emigrating to Wales, where she was rehoused by a women\u2019s charity. But she told others that he had left her.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Lynne Williams, a 54-year-old, gently spoken mother of two from Pontyclun, 10 minutes from Beddau, met a frailer, softer version of Sabine. Sitting in her freshly decorated living room, with a new wooden floor and sparkly silver wallpaper, Williams recalls meeting Sabine at the Royal Glamorgan hospital in Talbot Green; Williams was visiting a relative, and Sabine was then a patient.</p> <p>Over cups of tea made by her daughter, Williams smiles as she recalls the summer of last year. Her heart went out to Sabine, she says, who had been diagnosed with brain cancer after a fall. She had no visitors, and there was nothing on her bedside table to suggest anyone who cared for her. \u201cIt was pitiful, really, she had no one,\u201d she says, her Welsh lilt pausing over the consonants. \u201cShe was suffering, she had ulcers all over her legs. But she was a bubbly person and hid her pain so as not to worry anyone. And that\u2019s what I would do.\u201d</p> <p>Williams, who runs her own cleaning business, took Sabine under her wing, visiting her daily along with the relative she already cared for. She was touched by the older woman\u2019s gratitude. \u201cI would take her out for a fag. It was little things that meant a lot to her. I\u2019m not the most well off, but I\u2019d take her a packet of cigarettes, or I\u2019d make her a hot meal. She would go, \u2018Oh, why did you do that?\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Her bedroom was all silks and satins, with a silk canopy on the ceiling. The headboard was gold</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They became close, which was when Williams started to notice that not everything added up. \u201cThere was always a sticky silence when she talked about the past. But she opened up a bit about her children.\u201d Sabine told her she had five children, three girls and two boys, all of whom she and her then husband had abandoned in New Zealand, when she was 28. If Williams probed further, she changed the subject.</p> <p>\u201cShe said they didn\u2019t want to know her, but her stories were changing all the time. I could see there was a hell of a dark side there.\u201d</p> <p>Pulling her curtains against the low evening sun, Williams takes out her phone to pull up pictures of Sabine in the last months of her life. Dressed in a crushed velvet dressing gown, she is frail, although smiling, and her makeup is immaculate. It always was, William says, even at the end.</p> <p>Several times in those final weeks, Sabine seemed ready to open up, she adds. \u201cShe once said: \u2018I\u2019ve got a secret\u2019 but then changed the subject.\u201d Later, she asked Williams for her address, saying she wanted to write her a letter. But after she died, no letter was found.</p> <p>One night, after Sabine had been allowed home from hospital, Williams and Michelle James were sitting at her kitchen table, when she asked her friends for help. \u201cHer words were, \u2018I need you to do me a favour,\u2019\u201d Williams says. \u201c\u2018There\u2019s a skeleton in the shed and I need you to move it to the attic to scare the people who move in.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI turned around and said: \u2018I hope it\u2019s not a bloody real one.\u2019 She pointed her finger at me with those big orange nails \u2013 she always painted her nails orange \u2013 and said, \u2018You never know.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bff978619965da024cc786acce05259d47077da9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bff978619965da024cc786acce05259d47077da9/0_0_2448_3264/750.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Sabine in the 70s.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Sabine in the 70s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Jones for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By that point, Sabine knew she was dying. To this day, Williams isn\u2019t sure whether she meant them to open the package before or after her death.Had she not been so busy with her cleaning business, she would have moved the package up to the attic, she says. It could have been her, not James, who found John Sabine.</p> <p>After Lee died, Williams cleared out her cluttered two-bedroomed flat, along with other friends and neighbours. She was disturbed by what she describes as a number of \u201cnasty\u201d letters she found, written by Sabine to people in Beddau. They were unkind, full of bile, and seemed at odds with the community-loving woman she knew.</p> <p>Then came James\u2019s macabre discovery on 24 November. \u201cFor a long time I couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d Williams says. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she say something? She knew she was going to die \u2013 why didn\u2019t she tell us? Sometimes I would say that I was used. Other times, I remember the way she thanked me every night before she went to sleep. I am a good dealer with things. I can\u2019t be bitter.\u201d</p> <p>It was a mystery to her, and to the police: how had Sabine managed to conceal her husband\u2019s body for so long? Apart from the attic, there was simply no room: a double divan took up most of the space in one bedroom, and there was a single bed in the other. \u201cOne of the drawers was half the length of the divan,\u201d Williams remembers. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t put a body in it.\u201d</p> <p>She is convinced that the fall Sabine suffered just before her cancer diagnosis came as she was moving the heavy body down from the attic. (As for how a frail 74-year-old woman managed to do this alone, nobody can say, but the police are not looking for an accomplice.) Williams wondered why, as soon as Sabine got home from hospital, she was so keen to get her carpets professionally cleaned. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even look dirty,\u201d she remembers. \u201cThe machine broke down and she demanded they come the following day to finish it.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>By mistake or design, in her dying days Sabine let her guard down, although she never went as far as a confession. As the police investigated, they found she had gone further in the past, and on more than one occasion. In early 2000, while carrying out a tarot card reading, she blurted out a confession to Bernadette Adamiec, a Beddau hairdresser. Adamiec, who did not take her seriously, told police that Sabine had told her she was going to be \u201cfamous... because of the body in the bag\u201d. The police still consider this evidence vital, but Adamiec tells me she thinks that as a confession it has become overblown; she no longer wants to talk to journalists.</p> <p>Sabine was hiding in plain sight: a relative newcomer in a Welsh village where she could construct whatever version of herself she wanted. As for her husband, no one missed him, because no one had ever met him. But, as the murder investigation progressed, it turned out that little in Sabine\u2019s carefully constructed story, or series of stories, was true.</p> <p>Detective chief inspector Gareth Morgan of South Wales police led the inquiry. His team traced the Sabines back to the 50s, when they first met in London, where Lee was training as a nurse. The couple had four children together in Britain, before emigrating to New Zealand where they had a fifth. Then, in 1969, they abandoned their children in an Auckland nursery: two boys, Steve and Martin, and three girls, Susan, Jane and Lee-Ann, aged between two and 11 years old.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ff37c319ac9a903c0539c4c80bf4c6a6e901524\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ff37c319ac9a903c0539c4c80bf4c6a6e901524/0_0_808_1045/773.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Sabine in the gardens of the Royal Glamorgan hospital before she died last year.\" width=\"773\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Sabine in the gardens of the Royal Glamorgan hospital before she died last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Jones for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThat was an incredible story in itself,\u201d Morgan says. \u201cWe made contact with the children, and the whole story started unravelling.\u201d The couple had fled to Perth in Western Australia, where they went by the names Lee and John Martin, and where Lee tried to build a career as a singer. In 1984, they returned to New Zealand and made contact with their children in an apparent change of heart. But after their daughters brought a TV reporter to the house, the couple quickly disappeared again. During the investigation, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-35104524\">heartbreaking film footage emerged</a> from New Zealand, of Jane and Lee-Ann, then teenagers, confronting the parents who had abandoned them.</p> <p>As more details emerged, Sabine\u2019s neighbours were forced to adjust their memories of her. Gardner learned that the \u201cgrandson\u201d Sabine had referred to was in fact her son, Martin, who killed himself in 2000. She was not from New Zealand, as she had claimed, but the daughter of a Welsh miner and a mother who abandoned her when she was a toddler. She was born 11 miles from Beddau, in the village of Gelli. \u201cYou know, like her, I was in and out of care,\u201d Gardner says. \u201cSo it\u2019s possible we had met before. She was a Rhondda girl. We saw a Lee and it wasn\u2019t a Lee.\u201d Her real name was Ann.</p> <p>***</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until a BBC news report screened footage of that family confrontation in New Zealand that Morgan found the final piece of the jigsaw: the murder weapon. A friend who had known the couple when they lived in Reading in the 90s came forward and told the detective about a call she received from Sabine, \u201cout of the blue\u201d, in 1997. Valerie Chalkley asked her friend, who had just moved to Beddau, whether she was still with John, joking that she thought they might have killed each other by now. Sabine said: \u201cI have killed him. I hit him over the head with a stone frog.\u201d</p> <p>Chalkley laughed it off as a typical exaggeration, but was rattled enough to call her back a couple of days later to ask how John was.</p> <p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s all right, just the same,\u201d came the reply. It was as if the previous conversation hadn\u2019t happened, but it stayed with Chalkley.</p> <p>Morgan remembered Michelle James telling him that Lee had told her to take what she wanted from the flat after she died. He asked her: \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have a stone frog?\u201d She had, stored in a shoebox alongside other items she had yet to sort through; Sabine had kept the frog by the side of her bed. When pathologists matched it against the cluster of injuries and skull fractures on John Sabine\u2019s head, they found the distinctive shape of its leg and eye fitted exactly.</p> <p>On the wall of Morgan\u2019s office at Bridgend police station is a picture of his prime suspect, taken from an interview about her garden in a local magazine \u2013 his trophy of a two decade old murder that has now been solved. \u201cI do really love living in Beddau and feel part of the community,\u201d Sabine says in the article. \u201cIt\u2019s a special place.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4f32d294e7d9aed46c0b010386e15fd32057289b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f32d294e7d9aed46c0b010386e15fd32057289b/0_0_808_457/500.jpg\" alt=\"Lee and John Sabine abandoned children Jane, Steve, Susan, Martin and Lee-Ann in 1984.\" width=\"500\" height=\"283\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee and John Sabine abandoned children Jane, Steve, Susan, Martin and Lee-Ann in 1984.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Media Wales</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Morgan believes Lee may have killed her husband during one of their heated arguments, and that she kept her husband hidden in the flat for 18 years; but he has found no evidence of the attack site, and no clue as to where the body was stored. \u201cWe did meticulous forensic work,\u201d he says, \u201cbut nothing. It was an immaculate house. She had steam cleaners in over the years.\u201d</p> <p>Morgan believes she wrapped the body intermittently over the years, using Tesco bags, plastic sheeting and bungee cords. \u201cWhen it started to smell, she would add another layer.\u201d (Ironically, it was this process, wrapping the body so tightly it was effectively mummified, that preserved the evidence; had she not been so careful, James might have uncovered something that looked like a medical skeleton \u2013 as Sabine must have expected.)</p> <p>With every year that passed, Sabine had grown bolder. She removed John\u2019s name from the tenancy in 1998, enabling her to have a single occupancy council tax discount and improve her benefits. She continued to receive his army pension. In August 2005, when he would have been 75 and eligible for a free TV licence, she transferred it to his name.</p> <p>If she ever felt remorse for her crime, Sabine never expressed it. But in her final months, there were signs that, even as a staunch atheist, she had begun to dwell on whether she might be judged after her death.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Mary West, a street pastor who became the executor of Sabine\u2019s will, recalls an intelligent woman, an avid Radio 4 fan who loved to argue and discuss issues, including God. Sabine would look in on West\u2019s sick mother, who lived in a downstairs flat at Trem-y-Cwm.</p> <p>\u201cI remember her coming down one day and saying, \u2018There\u2019s so much love here,\u2019\u201d West says. \u201cI think she began to reflect on what she\u2019d given up.\u201d</p> <p>If she did, it did not extend to contact with the children she had left behind. When it became clear Sabine did not have long to live, West got in touch with her neighbour\u2019s children on Facebook. Her youngest daughter, Lee-Ann, called West.</p> <p>\u201cThe first thing she asked me was, \u2018How\u2019s my father?\u2019 I said I didn\u2019t know. I asked Lee and she said: \u2018Darling, he left me.\u2019 Lee-Ann was in straitened circumstances herself, but said she was prepared to come over and see her.\u201d</p> <p>West recalls Sabine\u2019s reaction: \u201cLee was horrified. She was losing her voice then and she said: \u2018I don\u2019t want them to see me in this state.\u2019\u201d Then, presumably referring to the reunion that had gone so badly wrong in 1984, she worried that her daughter would bring the press with her.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In 1969, the couple abandoned their five children in an Auckland nursery; she said she had a singing contract</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>West still struggles with Sabine\u2019s abandonment of her children when they were so young. \u201cI can\u2019t get my head round that. I asked her about it and she said: \u2018Well, I had a singing contract in Australia. I left them in the care of social services.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cTowards the end, she said to me: \u2018You know, don\u2019t you?\u2019 I said, \u2018I know you have cancer.\u2019 She said to me: \u2018You are close to God. He sent you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>With hindsight, West believes this was the closest Sabine got to expressing some kind of remorse.</p> <p>In the eulogy she gave at Sabine\u2019s funeral, at Glyntaff crematorium on 10 November 2015, West told the 40-strong congregation, all of whom seemed to know a different side of her: \u201cThe only person who knows the true story of Lee\u2019s life was Lee.\u201d She paid tribute to the caring side that many in Beddau had seen. She told the gathering of friends and neighbours: \u201cWe do not know the difficulties she had in her life \u2013 only she and God know that. But we do know that she was an immensely loving person.\u201d</p> <p>While West and, to a lesser extent, Williams have come to terms with the lies and half-truths Sabine told them, others have found her betrayal harder to deal with. As West explains, \u201cThe sad thing is, it touched a community, a caring community. There is a level of hurt still there.\u201d</p> <p>James, 45, remains haunted by her ordeal. A mother of three and grandmother of five, she suffered the trauma not only of finding the body, but then being arrested and put in custody. She was taunted by locals who called her a murderer, and subsequently rehoused by the council; she now feels isolated and misses her old friends in the village. Already fragile, she has recently been diagnosed with PTSD as a consequence of what happened that November morning last year.</p> <p>\u201cShe has messed me up,\u201d she says of Sabine. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep properly. When I close my eyes, it\u2019s all there. That poor man, left out there. I can\u2019t look after my grandchildren. I can\u2019t watch the programmes I used to watch. When I was at the police station, I thought I would never see my kids or grandkids ever again. I was terrified I was going to prison for a crime someone else committed. They were saying to me \u2018Who is it?\u2019 and I said, \u2018I promise, I don\u2019t know.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI used to go around almost every day and help her,\u201d she continues, wiping away tears. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she confess? She knew she was dying. She knew what she was doing to me. She is still doing it to me. Why?\u201d</p> <p>On the other side of the world, Sabine\u2019s children have struggled to come to terms with the revelations of the past year, too. A year before their mother died, her daughter Jane \u2013 prompted by her own daughter, Nicole \u2013 decided to write Sabine a letter. The response was a card bearing an image of a phoenix rising from the ashes. Inside was a note, handwritten and in capitals: \u201cLike the phoenix, I will arise from the ashes and sleep will obey me and visit thee never. For my eyes are upon thee, forever and ever. I have served my life sentence of shame and blame. Now it is your turn to do the same.\u201d She signed it: \u201cYour nemesis, Ann Lee Sabine.\u201d It was the last contact they had.</p> <p>Since their mother\u2019s death, amid the resurfacing of painful memories, the children have discovered something else: family members they did not know existed. They had no idea they had two half-siblings (their father\u2019s two children from a previous relationship), and that their mother had a cousin who still lives in Wales. Jane, now 50, says these new connections have given them a glimmer of hope. Next year, she says, talking to me on Facebook, she plans to travel to the UK with her sister, to meet the family she never thought she\u2019d see.</p>",
  "<p>A number of competing bars have been built into the outer bulwark of the National Theatre in London, and when she emerges from rehearsals one night in September the Australian actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/elizabeth-debicki\">Elizabeth Debicki</a> \u2013 animated, adamant, 6ft 3in \u2013 hesitates.

She chews gum and fiddles constantly with her short, bleached hair, now tugging it upright, now flattening it sideways. Her exuberance might be amplified by the fact that she\u2019s only just been let loose from a rehearsal room after nine hours\u2019 work on a new play, but Debicki says she\u2019s always had \u201can ingrained intensity, a little bit of madness\u201d, and she puts this down to her ancestry: Polish on her father\u2019s side, Irish on her mother\u2019s.

It was probably the beginning of my acting career.\u201d She spoke fluent French. \u201cBut kids are sensitive, right? I decided I wanted to fit in and I wouldn\u2019t speak the language any more. My parents were appalled. Can you imagine? You have a little child who\u2019s bilingual and then one day goes, \u2018Nope.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da52e9534e685e25395589278d9f10599dd017e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da52e9534e685e25395589278d9f10599dd017e6/0_106_6300_3780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Debicki\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jumper, by Dion Lee, from netaporter.com.

When her parents\u2019 dancing careers timed out, Debicki\u2019s father took a job working backstage at a theatre. She remembers \u201cit was all a big relief\u201d when she won a scholarship to an otherwise pricey school. Somewhere under Debicki\u2019s quippy top layer there\u2019s something firmer, and I get a sense of this when I ask an incautious question about how she won her scholarship: a recital, a dance? \u201cSat an exam,\u201d she says, flatly. \u201cI can write, too.\u201d Debicki explains: \u201cWhen your parents are ballet dancers, they teach you to be really fucking tough.\u201d Physically? \u201cThey deal with a lot of physical pain, but no. Dancers are the toughest people I\u2019ve met on a psychological level. It is so much more brutal than acting. Your expiration date is more definite, you work so much harder for your place along that barre or in that chorus line or whatever. My parents \u2013 who were very good at what they did, and had a sneaking suspicion early on that they were going to raise at least one child who would turn out to be a thespian \u2013 they really instilled a lot of toughness in us.\u201d She remembers being told, often: chin up.</p> <p>But she ever so slightly broke their hearts, Debicki says, when at the age of 17 she got into law school (\u201cThey were overjoyed\u201d) and chose instead to take up a place to study drama. At the University of Melbourne, Debicki\u2019s training was almost exclusively theatrical. \u201cWe had one week of film and TV classes. I remember having to hold up fake bottles and say: \u2018Buy this Coke!\u2019 I never expected to work on screen.\u201d Her first job as a graduate was on the stage, playing a bereaved mother in a drama with <a href=\"http://www.mtc.com.au\">the Melbourne Theatre Company</a>: \u201cI had to cry a lot.\u201d</p> <p>This was an odd time in her life. Just as the weepy play was about to start rehearsing, Debicki went to a screen test in a Melbourne hotel, where an agent was assembling tapes of unknown Australian actors for <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0525303/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm\">Baz Luhrmann\u2019s</a> perusal, on the off-chance the director might want them in his new adaptation of The Great Gatsby. Debicki\u2019s tape caught Luhrmann\u2019s eye. \u201cI got an email that said, \u2018Baz liked your test.\u2019 It was incomprehensible.\u201d She was flown to Los Angeles, a 36-hour trip, where she did another test. Back in Melbourne, she didn\u2019t hear anything for a month. \u201cI started to assume I\u2019d been hit by a bus and dreamed the whole thing.\u201d Then she was walking to rehearsals one day when Luhrmann called her mobile and said, \u201cWould you like to be part of our little play?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People often say I seem very confident. I wonder if it\u2019s from having been different from a young age</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In Gatsby, which was filmed in Sydney in late 2011, Debicki played Jordan Baker, a glamorous society cynic, vaguely catalytic in the doomed affair between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/leonardodicaprio\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>\u2019s Jay Gatsby and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/carey-mulligan\">Carey Mulligan</a>\u2019s Daisy Buchanan. Of her state of mind during the shoot, Debicki says, \u201cI had just finished school. I felt about 12 years old.\u201d She was good in the movie, though: lofty, composed, holding her own as the notably unfamous one in a cast composed of established or rising stars. Debicki knows that Luhrmann (\u201cmy fairy godmother\u201d) took a chance on her. \u201cHe casts on instinct. And I guess with this he decided, \u2018I have big actors in it already.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She was working in another play by the time Gatsby premiered at Cannes in 2013. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/australia-culture-blog/2013/jun/09/the-maids-review-stc-blanchett\">The Maids</a>, starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/cate-blanchett\">Cate Blanchett</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/isabelle-huppert\">Isabelle Huppert</a>, had Debicki as a wealthy woman who visits her frustrations on her servants. After a run in Melbourne, the play transferred to Broadway, where Debicki was singled out for praise (<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/theater/cate-blanchett-and-isabelle-huppert-in-the-maids.html?_r=0\">the New York Times called her \u201csmashing\u201d</a>; <a href=\"http://time.com/3111617/the-maids-review-cate-blanchett/\">Time magazine found her \u201ctall and delicious\u201d</a>). Between the Melbourne and Broadway runs, Guy Ritchie cast her as a baddie in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/11/the-man-from-uncle-review-style-paired-with-deathly-boring-substance\">Man From UNCLE movie</a>, and Justin Kurzel, who\u2019d seen The Maids, made Debicki his Lady Macduff in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/01/macbeth-review-shakespeare-michael-fassbender-marion-cotillard\">big-screen Macbeth with Michael Fassbender</a>. By the time these films were on release, Debicki had already lobby-hopped through posh hotels in Switzerland, Marrakech and Mallorca, filming The Night Manager.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5947ae939aa65159b9811f2273a54874f5545a2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5947ae939aa65159b9811f2273a54874f5545a2b/35_63_3263_4078/800.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Debicki\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Silk shirt, by Equipment, from netaporter.com.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gustavo Papaleo/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Which brings us to what might be called her non-disclosure period. After the David Hare thriller at the National, Debicki will appear in a mysterious space drama called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cl2MyJchPCI\">The God Particle</a>, playing an astronaut, and then in the Guardians Of The Galaxy sequel, playing a \u201cfabulous\u201d alien about whom she can say very little. I ask her to give me something about the Marvel Studios film \u2013 anything \u2013 and she says there was lots of green-screen work. Anything else? She leans forward and seizes my knee: \u201cThere is probably someone from Marvel \u2013 wearing a tweed cap \u2013 pretending to be an audience member at the National \u2013 spying on me <em>right now</em>.\u201d</p> <p>She adopts a roughly similar policy of banterish deflection when prodded, mildly, to talk about her romantic life. \u201cHave I got a boyfriend-slash-girlfriend? That\u2019s very liberal of you. I don\u2019t want to say anything. I\u2019m really private.\u201d What she will say is that it can be unnerving, hopping from job to job, rental to rental, and that she\u2019s glad her parents trained her in the tradition of iron, ballet-dancer toughness. \u201cAs an actor, you\u2019re nomadic. You never settle. And that can be very trying on the sense of self, when who you feel you are shifts all the time. It drove me nuts as a kid, all that \u2018Chin up\u2019 stuff, but now I\u2019m grateful for it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd8e2796679ea32859f9c5a661b078869a498a28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd8e2796679ea32859f9c5a661b078869a498a28/10_70_3281_4101/800.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Debicki\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacket, by Valentino, from harrods.com.

On the set of The Night Manager, she\u2019s reminded, Hiddleston used to quiz her about the meaning of Australian slang words such as \u201cdag\u201d and \u201cdaggy\u201d; she points a thumb at her backpack, a cumbersome, canvas thing: \u201cThis is daggy.\u201d</p> <p>We set off together, heading for the same station. Like Debicki, I\u2019m tall (I have a couple of inches on her 6ft 3in) and we probably make a bit of a sight, striding along the river. Oncomers take a good look, then look away. I know from experience that it\u2019s hard, if not impossible, to engage someone in interesting conversation about being tall, though every day people try. I\u2019m not eager to bring up the subject unless she does.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time I met someone who was taller than me,\u201d she says.</p> <p>We compare notes. Has she had that one where an old lady in the supermarket asks for something off the top shelf? (Yes.) The one where an overwhelmed young child bursts out crying, spontaneously, at the sight of her? (Not yet.) Debicki says she\u2019s come to think her height might be the source of some of her unusual energy. \u201cPeople often say I seem very confident. If I have to present an award, or it\u2019s the first day of work somewhere, I have this veneer of being totally au fait. I wonder if it\u2019s from having been different from a young age. I was always aware that people were aware of me. Maybe I tried to overcompensate.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s too sarky and self-aware not to point out, while saying this, that nobody is about to start \u201cplaying the violin\u201d for a \u201ctall-y\u201d. And she can hardly blame strangers for being attentive to physical distinction, because \u201crare\u2019s rare, you know?\u201d Even so, height is something you don\u2019t get any choice about and can\u2019t switch off; it\u2019s a strange and unrepresentative thing to be defined by. So don\u2019t make the whole article about me being tall, Debicki suggests, before we shake hands goodbye.

  "<p>Throughout history, people have always worried about new technologies. The fear that the human brain cannot cope with the onslaught of information made possible by the latest development was <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2010/02/dont_touch_that_dial.html\">first voiced in response to the printing press,</a> back in the sixteenth century. Swap \u201cprinting press\u201d for \u201cinternet\u201d and you have the exact same concerns today, regularly voiced in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2012/sep/10/children-brains-damage-susan-greenfield\">mainstream media</a>, and usually focused on children. </p> <p>But is there any legitimacy to these claims? Or are they just needless scaremongering? There are several things to bear in mind when considering how our brains deal with the internet.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The human brain is always dealing with a constant stream of rich information - that\u2019s what the real world is</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>First, don\u2019t forget that \u201cthe internet\u201d is a very vague term, given that it contains so many things across so many formats. You could, for instance, develop <a href=\"http://www.helpguide.org/articles/addiction/gambling-addiction-and-problem-gambling.htm\">a gambling addiction</a> via online casinos or poker sites. This is an example of someone\u2019s brain being negatively affected via the internet, but it would be difficult to argue that the internet is the main culprit, any more than a gambling addiction obtained via a real world casino can be blamed on \u201cbuildings\u201d; it\u2019s just the context in which the problem occurred. However, the internet does give us a far more direct, constant and wide ranging access to information than pretty much anything else in human history. So how could, or does, this affect us and our brains?</p> <p><strong>Information overload</strong><br>It\u2019s important to remember that the human brain is always dealing with a constant stream of rich information; that\u2019s what the real world is, as far as our senses are concerned. Whether staring at a video being played on a small screen or watching people playing in a park, the brain and visual system still has to do the same amount of work as both provide detailed sensory information. </p> <p>It\u2019s too detailed, if anything. The brain doesn\u2019t actually process every single thing our senses present to it; for all its power and complexity, it just doesn\u2019t have the capacity for that. <a href=\"https://www.sott.net/article/316892-The-variability-of-perception-The-brain-doesnt-capture-everything-you-see\">So it filters things out and extrapolates what\u2019s important based on experiences, calculation and a sort of \u201cbest guess\u201d system</a>. The point is, the brain is already well adapted to prevent damaging information overload, so it\u2019s unlikely that the internet would be able to cause such a thing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/24/do-our-brains-have-extraordinary-untapped-powers\">Do our brains have extraordinary untapped powers?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Is Google destroying my memory?</strong><br>Another concern is that the constant access to information stored online is atrophying or disrupting our memories. Why bother to remember anything when you can just Google it, right? </p> <p>Memory doesn\u2019t quite work that way. The things we experience that end up as memories do so via unconscious processes. Things that have <a href=\"http://www.memory-key.com/memory/emotion\">emotional resonance</a> or significance in other ways tend to be more easily remembered than abstract information or intangible facts. These things have always <a href=\"http://faculty.washington.edu/gloftus/MiscMissingArticles/Dark.Loftus.1976.pdf\">required more effort to remember</a> in the long term, needing to be rehearsed repeatedly in order to be encoded as memories. Undeniably, the internet often renders this process unnecessary. But whether this is harmful for the development of the brain is another question.</p> <p>Doing something often and becoming good at it is <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v15/n4/abs/nn.3045.html\">reflected in the brain\u2019s structure</a>. For example, the motor cortex of an expert musician, proficient in fine hand movements<a href=\"http://www.jneurosci.org/content/23/27/9240.full\">, differs from that of non-musicians</a>. An argument could be made that constantly committing things to memory rather than just looking them up as and when needed would <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15464402\">enhance the brain\u2019s memory system</a>. On the other hand, some evidence suggests that a <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/brain-changes-in-response-to-experi/\">more stimulating, varied environment aides brain development</a> \u2013 so maybe the constant, interesting information found online is better for you than rehearsing dry facts and figures. <br></p> <p>But, counter to this, other evidence suggests that the detailed presentation of even simple web pages <a href=\"http://www.medicaldaily.com/information-overload-how-internet-inhibits-short-term-memory-257580\">provides too many features for the human brain\u2019s small-capacity short-term memory to handle</a>, which could have knock-on effects for the memory system. It\u2019s a mixed picture overall. </p> <p><strong>What about my attention span? </strong><br>Does the internet impact on our ability to focus on something, or does having 24/7 access to so many things prove too much of a distraction? </p> <p>The human attention system is complicated, and so again, it\u2019s an unclear picture. Our <a href=\"http://nro.sagepub.com/content/20/2/150.full\">two-layer, bottom-up and top-down attention system</a> (meaning there\u2019s a conscious aspect that enables us to direct our attention, and an unconscious aspect that shifts attention towards anything our senses pick up that might be significant) is already something that can make focusing 100% on something quite a challenge. It\u2019s for this reason that a lot of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/20/does-music-really-help-you-concentrate\">people prefer to have music playing while they work:</a> it occupies part of the attention system that would otherwise look for distractions while we\u2019re trying to do something important. </p> <p>The internet, however, provides a very quick and effective distraction. We can be looking at something enjoyable within seconds, which is a problem, given that much work in the modern world is done on the same device we use to access the internet. It is such a concern that <a href=\"http://99u.com/articles/6969/10-online-tools-for-better-attention-focus\">apps and companies have sprung up</a> specifically to address this.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/20/does-music-really-help-you-concentrate\">Does music really help you concentrate?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But it would be unfair to say that the internet is responsible for distracting us from work. The brain\u2019s attention system and <a href=\"http://99u.com/articles/6969/10-online-tools-for-better-attention-focus\">preference for novel experiences</a> existed long before the internet did, the internet is just something that makes these aspects particularly irksome. <br></p> <p><strong>Competing for likes</strong><br>Social interactions with other people are a major factor in how we <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26447580\">develop, learn and grow at the neurological level</a>. Humans are a very social species. But now the internet has allowed social interactions and relationships to occur between vast numbers of people over great distances, and for them to occur all day, every day. </p> <p>This means that everything we do can be shared with others at the press of a button, but this has consequences. The positive feelings gained from social media approval are said to work on the same neurological basis as drugs do; <a href=\"https://www.ama.org/publications/MarketingNews/Pages/feeding-the-addiction.aspx\">providing rewards via the dopamine system</a>. Thus, <a href=\"http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/8/9/3528/htm?hc_location=ufi\">social network addiction is slowly becoming an issue</a>. By creating a situation where we\u2019re constantly trying to impress and being judged by others, perhaps the internet isn\u2019t doing our brains much good after all.</p> <p>But, as with most things, the actual problem comes down to other people, not the net.</p> <p><em>Dean Burnett\u2019s first book, The Idiot Brain, all about the weird and confusing properties of the brain, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/idiot-brain.html\">is available now</a>. </em></p>",
  "<p><strong>Is broadband as bad as Theresa May\u2019s party conference speech implied?</strong></p> <p>Nearly. Her complaint that \u201chalf of people living in rural areas, and so many small businesses, can\u2019t get a decent broadband connection\u201d is probably based on a <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/research-and-data/infrastructure-research/connected-nations-2015\">report produced by the regulator Ofcom</a> last year, which is now a little out of date. Ofcom found 1.5m rural premises \u2013 about half of the total \u2013 could not get the basic speed needed to watch video and support multiple devices such as tablets, phones and smart TVs. The regulator said it would be another three years before all these premises get the 10 megabits per second (Mbps) it considers a minimum for modern users. Things have improved since then, thanks to the taxpayer-funded BDUK scheme to wire up the countryside. The total suffering from slow connections has fallen to 25% across all rural areas, though half of those living in hamlets are still below 10Mbps. Business parks have also complained of being left out. Ofcom said last year that only 68% of small and medium-sized businesses have superfast, with some 400,000 still waiting. The problem is not confined to rural areas. BT\u2019s superfast broadband roll-out, which has now reached 90% of all homes and businesses, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/06/wealthy-stranded-digital-expensive-properties-lack-fast-internet-uk\">bypassing those living in tall buildings</a> \u2013 from council tower blocks to highrise luxury flats.</p> <p><strong>How is the UK doing compared to other countries?</strong></p> <p>Not too badly \u2013 for now. The average customer can download at a rate of 15Mbps, which means the UK ranks 20th in the <a href=\"https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/akamai-state-of-the-internet-connectivity-report-q2-2016.pdf\">global speed league</a>. But much smaller economies such as Bulgaria, Romania and Belgium are already faster. South Korea is at the top of the pile, with 27Mbps, and Norway is in second place with 20Mbps. The concern is that, having finished the bulk of its superfast upgrade, BT does not have sufficiently ambitious plans for the future. Homes are still connected to street cabinets by copper wires. The company plans to extend fibre-optic cables closer to its customers\u2019 doorsteps, using a technology called G.Fast, but copper will still be used for the final stretch. BT claims G.Fast will deliver speeds of up to 300Mbps, which is more than most users need for now. But experts say the only future-proof network is one that uses fibre cables only, all the way from the exchange to the premises. Fibre to the premises, or FTTP in telecoms jargon, is at least three times as fast and would ensure no fall in speeds at peak times. BT and Virgin Media, the two biggest network operators, plan to connect a mere 3m premises between them using FTTP. To be fair, BT says it will fill the gaps in its superfast roll-out by focusing on tall buildings, business parks and high streets. But other countries, including China, France, Portugal and New Zealand, have much bigger plans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71fe59080e0a1418211127212bcc558616bd9327\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71fe59080e0a1418211127212bcc558616bd9327/543_730_3847_2308/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BT boss Gavin Patterson is prepared to take on the government with legal action and a halt to investment if structural separation is forced through.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BT boss Gavin Patterson is prepared to take on the government with legal action and a halt to investment if structural separation is forced through.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michel Euler/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What would improve broadband?</strong></p> <p>Rivals say BT needs to split off its infrastructure division, Openreach, into a separate company. More than 560 TV and broadband resellers, including Sky and TalkTalk, rent their lines from BT. And these resellers say they receive a poor service, with engineers taking too long to fix faults and install new lines. In July, MPs concluded that BT was <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi49_va8MbPAhWJtBoKHXZ9AOAQFggqMAI&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.publications.parliament.uk%2Fpa%2Fcm201617%2Fcmselect%2Fcmcumeds%2F147%2F147.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNGMfAPkfTWe2tGP4_u-IoXd5TnvPg&amp;sig2=Z2N4kpEtqpplLNYKPCbvKA\">\u201csignificantly under-investing\u201d</a> in Openreach, to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds a year. Funds that should be going into broadband were instead being spent on football rights designed to boost the newly launched BT Sports channels. A top-class TV service is part of BT\u2019s strategy to stop its customers defecting to other providers. Since <a href=\"http://%20https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/feb/10/premier-league-tv-rights-sky-bt\">BT started competing with Sky</a> for live football, the amount collected by clubs each season has rocketed from \u00a3594m to \u00a31.7bn. BT counters that it spends less on football than on fibre \u2013 this year it will invest \u00a31.4bn in its network, and last year it spent \u00a3544m on sports rights.</p> <p><strong>What are the practical hurdles?</strong></p> <p>BT chief executive Gavin Patterson has threatened 10 years of litigation and a halt on network investment if the government forces through structural separation. The BT pension scheme is a big obstacle. The largest occupational scheme in the country, its deficit stands at almost \u00a310bn. Splitting the commitment would be a complicated and expensive business. Ofcom is proposing a middle way: legal separation. Openreach would get a board of its own, with control over budget, ownership of the network and a directly employed workforce. If this still doesn\u2019t work, Ofcom boss Sharon White says \u201cwe would return to the option of full separation\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Is Theresa May serious about sorting rural broadband?</strong></p> <p>Time will tell. Ofcom\u2019s proposals for legal separation were published at the end of July, just a couple of weeks after the new Conservative leader moved into 10 Downing Street. The prime minister has not had a chance to put her own stamp on the strategy, but her keynote gave no clue as to whether she will push for a stronger remedy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/bt-willing-to-give-broadband-division-more-independence\">BT willing to give broadband division more independence</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Is infrastructure spending the answer and will it happen?</strong></p> <p>Labour thinks so. It has promised to raise \u00a3500bn for investment in infrastructure, including broadband. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, last week made a more cautious case, for \u201cvery carefully for targeted, high-value investment in our economic infrastructure\u201d. Other governments are spending in this area. Singapore has already connected every home to fibre, although in a 720<sup> sq km</sup> city state, this was a fairly straightforward task.</p> <p>In Australia, the job of wiring vast expanses of outback required special measures. Structural separation was forced on the Telstra network in a negotiation that took five years. The government committed A$30bn to fitting FTTP to 93% of homes. Initiated under a Labour administration, the project has since been scaled back. <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzzoWx8MbPAhVLHxoKHZMYBrsQFggcMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nesta.org.uk%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fexploring_the_costs_and_benefits_of_ftth_in_the_uk_v7.pdf&amp;v6u=https%3A%2F%2Fs-v6exp1-ds.metric.gstatic.com%2Fgen_204%3Fip%3D77.91.250.206%26ts%3D1475780912296952%26auth%3Dndatah6i3624ptoywrzyg3qaupv52oyy%26rndm%3D0.381090010381282&amp;v6s=2&amp;v6t=21359&amp;usg=AFQjCNFtU4LwIlc4wWS5lOYL6owWgOwZZQ&amp;sig2=f4EMJlQFVoceVJ3-_E7s0A&amp;bvm=bv.134495766,d.d2s&amp;cad=rja\">Estimates for the cost of a national all-fibre network</a> in the UK vary from \u00a325bn to more than \u00a350bn. That kind of money could probably not come from the private sector alone. Campaigners argue that splitting BT would not only allow government investment, but could unlock private-sector spending, too. An independent Openreach would be a FTSE 100 company in its own right, with \u00a35bn a year in revenues and plenty of muscle with which to raise funds.</p>",
  "<p>Put \u00a3700 in and get \u00a35,000 out. That\u2019s the deal potentially on offer to thousands of current and former public sector workers who can top up their state pension at \u201cbargain basement\u201d rates, according to former pensions minister Steve Webb.</p> <p>He estimates that more than 500,000 older people \u2013 including many current and newly retired teachers, nurses, civil servants and local government workers \u2013 could benefit over the next five years, as well as thousands of private sector workers. This particularly relates to those entitled to draw their occupational pension at 60, but who won\u2019t receive a state pension until they are 65 or 66.</p> <p>In simple terms, they can potentially cash in by paying heavily subsidised <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/voluntary-national-insurance-contributions/why-pay-voluntary-contributions\">voluntary national insurance contributions</a> for the years between the date when they retire and when they reach state pension age, says Webb, who is now director of policy at life and pensions company Royal London.</p> <p>Of course, you have to have money to be able to afford it. And not everyone will warm to the idea of using today\u2019s cash to buy an income for later when they do not know how long they might live.</p> <p>The deal is linked to the introduction of the flat-rate state pension for everyone reaching state pension age on or after 6 April 2016. The full amount, currently \u00a3155.65 a week, is paid to those who have made 35 \u201cqualifying years\u201d of national insurance contributions (NICs).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Paying voluntary NICs is an attractive proposition because the rate is heavily subsidised by the government</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the vast majority of people who belong(ed) to a public sector pension generally paid national insurance at a lower rate because their scheme was \u201ccontracted out\u201d. To reflect this, they will have a deduction made from their state pension \u2013 which means that most won\u2019t receive the full amount in the early years. But the good news is that by paying voluntary or \u201cclass 3\u201d NICs they can make up some of the shortfall.</p> <p>Webb says this is \u201can attractive proposition\u201d because the rate is heavily subsidised by the government. For example, a single year of contributions can be bought for a lump sum of around \u00a3733. This will boost someone\u2019s state pension entitlement by around \u00a3230 a year for the rest of their life. That \u00a3733 would generate a pretty impressive \u00a34,600 over the course of a 20-year retirement. Someone who bought five \u201cmissing\u201d years could receive an extra \u00a323,000 for an outlay of less than \u00a34,000.</p> <p>This is particularly relevant for many longer-serving teachers, nurses and civil servants etc who are entitled to draw their occupational pension at 60, then face a gap of five or six years before they can receive their state pension. For example, under the rules of the teachers\u2019 pension scheme, those who entered pensionable service before 2007 have a final salary \u201cnormal pension age\u201d of 60, while for more recent arrivals it is 65.</p> <p>Similarly, most members of the \u201c1995 section\u201d of the NHS scheme have a normal pension age of 60 (some nurses, midwives and others have special terms which mean theirs is 55), while members of the \u201c2008 section\u201d must wait until 65. Likewise, members of the classic, classic plus and premium part of the civil service scheme typically have a normal pension age of 60, but for those who joined on or after 30 July 2007 it is typically 65-plus. The 4.6 million member-strong local government pension scheme\u2019s normal pension age is higher at 65, but it is thought that most people take early retirement.</p> <p>Webb explains that if someone in this situation retires at 60, they would not normally pay any further NICs between retirement and state pension age, but they can pay voluntary contributions for each of those years.</p> <p>Incidentally, this scheme is separate to the one that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/20/state-pension-top-up-no-one-wants\">Guardian Money wrote about in August</a> that lets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/20/state-pension-top-up-no-one-wants\">older people buy extra state pension</a> on what experts say are favourable terms.</p> <p>The way the new top-up scheme works is best illustrated with an example, so here is one very closely based on a real person. Georgina was a teacher and retired on her 60th birthday on 6 April, which means she gets the new flat-rate state pension. She can draw her teacher\u2019s pension at 60 but won\u2019t get her state pension until she is 66. She doesn\u2019t intend to work again, and so each of the years from 2016-17 to 2021-22 will have a gap in her national insurance record.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/20/state-pension-top-up-no-one-wants\">The state pension top-up that no one seems to want</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Because she was a member of the teachers\u2019 scheme for most of her working life, Georgina has only built up a small Serps pension of \u00a310 a week on top of her state pension entitlement of \u00a3119.30 (she hasn\u2019t made the full 35 years of contributions), making a total of \u00a3129.30. Georgina decides she can afford to set aside a lump sum of \u00a3733, which will pay for one year of voluntary NICs. As a result her starting amount is increased by 1/35 of the full flat-rate pension, or \u00a34.45 a week, taking her total state pension to \u00a3133.75.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics estimates that a 60-year-old woman will on average live until she is 88, which in Georgina\u2019s case would mean receiving a state pension for 22 years. An extra \u00a34.45 a week, multiplied by 52 weeks, multiplied by 22 years, means an extra \u00a35,090 \u2013 for a lump sum of \u00a3733. And if Georgina has more spare cash she can potentially repeat the exercise for each gap in her NI record.</p> <p>Royal London estimates that well in excess of 500,000 public sector workers could benefit over the next five years, as well as thousands of former private sector workers whose company pension scheme allowed them to draw a pension before state pension age.</p> <p>Jamie Jenkins, head of pensions strategy at Standard Life, says it\u2019s a \u201cvery sensible thing for some people to do\u201d, but he adds that there is \u201ca very big lack of awareness\u201d of this option.</p> <p>\u2022 Royal London\u2019s first Good With Your Money guide, entitled <a href=\"http://www.royallondon.com/Global/documents/GoodWithYourMoney/TOPPING-UP-YOUR-STATE-PENSION-GUIDE.pdf\">Everything you ever wanted to know about topping up your state pension</a>, is published on 8 October.</p>",

Cattle, sheep and poultry are reared; there are well-stocked fishing rivers; good cider and cheese is produced; bees, goats, geese are nurtured.

Agriculture directly employs 78,000 people, over a fifth of all those working in the sector in England. Many thousands more work in jobs that would not exist if farming and food production ceased.</p> \n<p>Now with the Brexit vote, a question mark hangs over this world. Theresa May\u2019s policy adviser <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/03/billions-of-farming-subsidies-could-be-diverted-to-nhs-after-bre/\">suggested this week</a> that some of the billions of pounds paid to British farmers today could be diverted to the NHS as the UK leaves the EU.</p> \n<p>The EU has helped shape this landscape through the payments that farmers receive, the Brussels cash available for stewardship schemes and a swath of regulations, directives, rules. Crediton is a good place to explore what the EU has done for the British countryside, how Brexit may change it and what the hopes and fears of those living here are.</p> \n<h2>The family farmer</h2> \n<p>Jilly Greed is a fourth generation farmer. Her son, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gpjgreed\">George</a>, is the fifth. Greed describes <a href=\"http://www.fortescuefarming.com/ \">Fortescue Farm </a>as \u201cprogressive\u201d \u2013 they are always seeking out ways of improving the land and business, making sure their beef cattle are healthy, finding ways of increasing their arable yield. </p> \n<p>Greed believes the farm \u2013 and the Devon red-land it sits in \u2013 has improved during the EU years. \u201cFarming is not a secure business but the EU has given us some security and also helped us innovate.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd201bec85544d96e033d9860c5beb11c3eb809c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd201bec85544d96e033d9860c5beb11c3eb809c/0_0_7360_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beef and arable farmer Jilly Greed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beef and arable farmer Jilly Greed.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Supported by EU funds, for example, the farm has just <a href=\"http://fortescuefarming.blogspot.co.uk/2016/01/drill-dilemma.html\">invested in a piece of kit called a direct or zero till drill</a>. \u201cIt means the plough has gone after hundreds of years. It\u2019s good for the environment. We\u2019re not burning fuel to plough it and time is saved.\u201d The technique helps reduce soil erosion and encourages the helpful creatures \u2013 worms and other invertebrates.</p> \n<p>Another innovation Greed is keen to talk about is \u201cmob grazing\u201d under which cattle graze an acre plot for a short period before being shifted on to the next. Previously they had roamed 10 acres. Greed says it creates healthier pasture. \u201cYou see the insects being kicked up by the cattle and the birds swooping down on them,\u201d she said. Being part of a Europe-wide community may make farmers like Greed more confident about change. </p> \n<p>But she is also keen to preserve. Greed has just applied for an <a href=\"https://new.devon.gov.uk/fundingnews/fund/countryside-stewardship-2016/ \">EU/Defra [Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] countryside stewardship scheme </a>that will allow her to manage the land in such a way that bronze age and iron age remains will be preserved. </p> \n<p>Future trade deals worry the Greeds. The farm sells oilseed rape to France to be turned into lubricant for the automative industry; its linseed is sent to Germany and ends up as an ingredient in bread. </p> \n<p> Greed is worried that farming may be sacrificed when post-Brexit trade deals are struck with, for example, South America. \u201cI\u2019m concerned they\u2019ll sell British farmers short. Will they say to the Brazilians, \u2018you take our luxury cars and we\u2019ll let your beef come flooding in?\u2019 I\u2019m not optimistic. But I am pragmatic. Farmers are resilient.\u201d</p> \n<h2>The environmentalist</h2> \n<p><a href=\"http:// http://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/politics/staff/dumper/\">Mick Dumper</a> splits his time between lecturing at Exeter University on Middle East politics, and labouring at a riverside smallholding <a href=\"http://www.riversidegoats.co.uk/ \">where a herd of goats is reared</a>. He also speaks for <a href=\"https://sustainablecrediton.org.uk/\">Sustainable Crediton</a>, which campaigns on environmental issues. </p> \n<p>Dumper sees good and bad in Brexit. \u201cI would hope that the burden of regulation on small farmers and producers would be lifted a bit. While I recognise and agree that food production has to be tightly monitored, the amount of regulation is disproportionate for small producers. Whether you have 10 cows or 1,000 cows \u2013 or goats, come to that \u2013 you are subject to the same fees, inspections and bureaucracy as the largest farms in the country, and this is putting small producers out of business.\u201d </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"570fa2f67b44b3123dd9a907b24d9d72c946e136\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/570fa2f67b44b3123dd9a907b24d9d72c946e136/0_0_7360_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"University lecturer and goat farmer Mick Dumper.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">University lecturer and goat farmer Mick Dumper.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Dumper believes the hill farmers who work on Dartmoor and Exmoor \u2013 the great moors that sandwich Crediton \u2013 may survive as they may well be more eligible for environmental and conservation funding. \u201cBut for the rest, the capital costs of running a farm in the face of greater international competition are too great to survive without some subsidy.\u201d </p> \n<p> If farming is no longer viable, Dumper anticipates that \u201curban money\u201d may pounce on pretty country farms. \u201cWhat we will get is the acceleration of the decline in small family farms and local youth still being priced out of the area.\u201d </p> \n<p> Dumper points out an example of <a href=\"http://www.devon.gov.uk/07steepingandcoppicing-3.pdf\">hedge steeping</a>, a local way of managing field and road boundaries. \u201cI would hope that the recent trends in the targeting of the single payment scheme and other subsidies towards incentivising conservation methods continue. This has helped in the revival of skills such as hedge steeping and stonewalling. Grants for tree planning have been important too.\u201d </p> \n<p>Has the EU been good for the rural community? \u201cIn some ways, no \u2013 it has helped globalisation, support for mega-industrial scale farming. But in terms of environmental protection, subsidies for farmers, diversification of diets and foodstuffs, encouragement of amenities and tourism etc, yes.\u201d </p> \n<h2>The beekeeper</h2> \n<p> Ray King has been caring for bees and producing award-winning honey for more than 40 years and currently has 30-odd hives scattered around Crediton. He is stoical about the future of his favourite creature post-Brexit. \u201cBees have been here a long time and I expect they\u2019ll still be here when the EU and all of us have gone.\u201d </p> \n<p>But he does think the EU has been good for the bees. \u201cThe EU, for example, has helped fund the <a href=\"http://www.nationalbeeunit.com/\">National Bee Unit</a>.\u201d </p> \n<p>The unit employs the bee inspectors which look out for diseases such as American and European foulbrood and pests such as the small hive beetle, an invasive species originating from Africa that has proved to be a serious problem in honeybee hives. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea454d879f95d30587b1f375894e8819e1df5edb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea454d879f95d30587b1f375894e8819e1df5edb/0_0_7360_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beekeeper Ray King.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beekeeper Ray King.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Because the diseases and pests do not respect national boundaries a pan-European approach to tackling them has been useful. So, for example, when the small hive beetle became a problem, the European commission ruled that it was \u201cnotifiable\u201d \u2013 in other words must be reported \u2013 just one instance of the hundreds, thousands of decisions that affect so many aspects of rural life. </p> \n<p> King gives another example. When scientific findings suggested some insecticides belonging to the neonicotinoid family appeared to be harmful to bees, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/apr/29/bee-harming-pesticides-banned-europe\">the commission stepped in and restricted the use of three pesticides</a>. \u201cWould that happen post-Brexit?\u201d he asked. The UK opposed the ban.</p> \n<p>More cheerfully, King goes through the flora here that provides a happy hunting ground for the bees from the spring through to the autumn. \u201cThey start with the willow, then it\u2019s the blackthorn, hawthorn, dandelion, beans, raspberries, gooseberries, bramble, ivy. A half-mile radius is the most important but they may go five or six miles for oil seed rape. </p> \n<p>\u201cThe environmental encouragement the EU has offered to farmers has been useful \u2013 it has led to richer hedgerows and field edges. That\u2019s all to be applauded.\u201d </p> \n<h2>The angler</h2> \n<p> This corner of Devon is blessed with wonderful rivers and streams that draw in trout and salmon anglers. The river Creedy (believed to be a Celtic word for winding) flows close to the town before joining the Yeo, which ends up in the Exe. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"67e2f0fe0ecf0591464c1ab75d91a8dbf48a3725\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67e2f0fe0ecf0591464c1ab75d91a8dbf48a3725/0_1592_4912_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Howard Thresher at his fly fishing shop in Crediton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Howard Thresher at his fly fishing shop in Crediton.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> Howard Thresher, the owner of <a href=\"http://www.fly-fishing-tackle.co.uk/ \">Fly Fishing Tackle</a> in the town and a keen angler, is worried about Brexit for two main reasons. Firstly, he sells up to a third of his fishing gear to Europe and is concerned that leaving the EU will make it more difficult to export his rods, reels and flies. </p> \n<p> But another fear is that the good quality of the Creedy and other waterways may be a Brexit casualty. \u201cThe fishing around here is good and the water quality is excellent,\u201d he said. </p> \n<p>The EU\u2019s water framework directive takes in many aspects of the river, from the structure of the bank and river bed to the temperature and maximum concentrations for specific pollutants.</p> \n<p> In addition Europe has helped improve access to the river, providing money through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development to the <a href=\"http://wrt.org.uk/ \">Westcountry Rivers Trust</a>, which runs an angling passport scheme to encourage regulated use of the rivers. \u201cEurope has been good for these rivers. You do worry that things may change,\u201d said Thresher. </p> \n<h2>The NFU leader</h2> \n<p> Jim Stephens, the NFU chair for Devon, believes that farmers are the custodians of the countryside. \u201cIf we don\u2019t look after it, nobody else will. We live in a wonderful, unspoiled landscape. We don\u2019t want Brexit to destroy that. I feel we\u2019re walking into the unknown.\u201d </p> \n<p> His NFU role means he may know more than most how inter-linked the countryside is. \u201cFarming has shaped this landscape and it also shapes local business. We\u2019re a closed community. There are a lot of businesses that rely on us. The CAP [common agricultural policy] payments we get are re-invested into the rural economy, into the shops and businesses in Crediton.\u201d </p> \n<p>Farmers often say that they feel more understood by Brussels than London. \u201cI recently met <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/hogan_en\">Phil Hogan, European commissioner for agriculture</a>, who grew up on a farm in Ireland. He was the first politician I\u2019ve seen in 20 or 30 years that saw the value of farming to the rest of the community, the rest of the rural economy. He had a grasp of the role of the rural economy and in feeding the rest of the population.\u201d </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82da4f0d08ebbd06a3a161926ded06abf12e77f8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82da4f0d08ebbd06a3a161926ded06abf12e77f8/0_199_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sheep and cattle farmer Jim Stephens, who is the NFU county chairman for Devon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sheep and cattle farmer Jim Stephens, who is the NFU county chairman for Devon.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> But Stephens, who farms sheep and cattle with his wife and son, believes he had it best under the deficiency payment scheme, which was brought in after the second world war. If the market price fell, it was topped up with government payments. \u201cFarming is a long-term game. It\u2019s not a business that can be turned around like a speed boat. It\u2019s an ocean liner. We don\u2019t want hand-outs but we do need security.\u201d </p> \n<p> But Stephens believes the mid-Devon landscape has benefited from Europe. \u201cIn the 1950s and 60s hedges were being ripped out. They are protected now and are full of flowers, berries, wildlife. Thanks to Europe we are doing more to look after hedges, protect big trees, improve ponds and water courses. The field margins are better, the rivers and streams healthier.\u201d </p> \n<p> The land Stephens works has been farmed since the Anglo Saxon era. \u201cWe\u2019re a little speck in time \u2013 my aim and the aim of most farmers is simply to leave the land in a better state than we found it. With or without Europe we\u2019ll find a way of doing that.\u201d </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 October 2016.
