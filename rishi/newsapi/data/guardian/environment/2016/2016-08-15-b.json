John Ralfe, a pensions consultant, said: \u201cWhy should pension scheme members lose out when shareholders continue to be paid cash dividends? It can only be fair to members if dividends are stopped and they can only start again once the full RPI lost is paid to pension scheme members.</p> <p>\u201cThe proposal is wrong in principle and is unworkable in practice.

It\u2019s far too soon to be sure about anything. But there have been a couple of indications that normal service has been restored at the top, that Leicester City\u2019s insurrection may well have been a one-off. Yesterday Manchester United won a fixture they lost last season, beating Bournemouth in Jose Mourinho\u2019s first game in charge. Manchester City were promisingly peppy in the first half against Sunderland on Saturday evening and ground out a win. Arsenal ... well, y\u2019know. Moving on, then, Liverpool impressed during that blistering 20-minute spell either side of half-time at the Emirates. Overall it\u2019s been a strong start from the big boys \u2013 and a bad one from Leicester, who lost to a Hull City side that was supposed to be mired in crisis. </p> <p>But perhaps the clearest indication of whether there\u2019s going to be more of last season\u2019s unpredictability will come from this fixture. The Antonio Conte era starts here, with a home game against Slaven Bilic\u2019s refreshingly entertaining West Ham United side, and while the former Juventus manager arrives in London with a strong reputation after his star turn at Euro 2016, no one is quite sure what to expect from the new Chelsea boss. If everything goes to plan from a Chelsea perspective, expect to see invigorated performances from the likes of Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Eden Hazard, whose pungent performances were some of the main causes for the need to fumigate Stamford Bridge this summer. Conte, after all, played a major role in the revival of Juventus, winning three consecutive Serie A titles, and he almost took an underwhelming Italy team to the last four in France. The signs are that Chelsea have found an astute tactician and a manic man manager who will inspire absolute devotion from his players. N\u2019Golo Kante should plug a few gaps in midfield and Michy Batshuayi offers speed and quality up front.</p> <p>Conte\u2019s record inspires optimism \u2013 and yet it is unwise to assume that all of Chelsea\u2019s weaknesses have been eradicated simply because of a managerial change. A dark cloud hovered over Mourinho\u2019s head last season and poured acid rain on anyone who dared stand near him. Yet Chelsea hardly exploded into life after his departure in December, defensive reinforcements are yet to arrive and a mooted move for Romelu Lukaku remains up in the air. West Ham challenged for Champions League qualification last season, finished seventh and were excellent against the top sides, securing several famous wins at home and on their travels. They\u2019ve made some good signings and if they play well against London rivals who have lorded it above them for the best part of 20 years, it will suggest that the Premier League has indeed become more equal. This fixture isn\u2019t the home banker it would have been a two or three seasons ago. </p> <p><strong>Kick-off: </strong>8pm BST.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-15T17:35:43.625Z\">at 6.35pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

  "<p>Lacie Richardson, a poet and Colorado native, first fell in love with Alaska\u2019s waterways as a junior in college. Richardson spent a year studying at the University of Alaska Southeast in Juneau as part of an exchange program. When she wasn\u2019t in class, she was fly fishing. \u201cI kind of became known in the community as this crazy, wild fly-fishing girl who was out on the river every day the second my class was out,\u201d Richardson says. \u201cPeople would see me hiking up some river with my rod, or trying to fly from the side of the beach.\u201d</p> <p>Richardson returned to Colorado for her final semester of college and graduated with a degree in English. The day after graduation, she got a call from the captain of a commercial fishing boat in Alaska. He was looking for crew for his boat, he said, and a mutual friend had told him all about the fly-fishing girl in Juneau \u2013 had Richardson ever considered working in the commercial fishing industry?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/11/seafood-industry-sustainable-fishing-salmon-overfishing\">Reeling it in: global sustainable seafood market hits $11.5bn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI told him the thought had never occurred to me,\u201d Richardson says. \u201cBut it sounded like a blast, and it got me back to Alaska.\u201d Richardson bought a one-way ticket and headed north.</p> <p>Over the next three years, Richardson worked in virtually every sector of the Alaskan commercial fishing industry \u2013 she gill-netted sockeye salmon, long-lined for halibut, seine fished and tendered. Then, she discovered salmon trolling, a fishing technique in which fish are caught one at a time, with one hook and one line. To Richardson, the art and strategy of trolling, as well as the way of life it represented, were irresistible. Salmon trollers like Richardson view themselves as stewards of the region\u2019s waterways, environment, and culture.</p> <p>Today, Richardson is betting that the rest of America, or at least the portion of America that shops at the local farmer\u2019s market and insists on grass-fed beef and organic produce, will find salmon trolling equally irresistible. As the owner of Wild Woman Fish Co, Richardson sells troll-caught Alaskan salmon, as well as other hook-and-line caught fish, directly to customers in the continental US at local farmer\u2019s markets and via mail order. She also sells to specialty grocery stores. </p> <p>Richardson currently ships 3,000 lbs of fish per month, and she expects to ship 5,000 lbs per month in the fourth quarter of 2016. She says her mission is not only to increase the public\u2019s awareness of different fishing methods, but to introduce more people to the hook-and-line fishermen of Alaska and the lives they lead.</p> <p>Richardson is one of only a handful of individual Alaskan fishermen attempting to sell directly to consumers, although she works with a hook-and-line cooperative called the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.spcsales.com/\">Seafood Producers Cooperative</a> (SPC) that has a larger operation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"856cffa293972024b6592217aa5d6d7961b7aac0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/856cffa293972024b6592217aa5d6d7961b7aac0/0_93_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lacie Richardson on her boat in Alaska.

We\u2019re really fishing.\u201d</p> <p>Trolling, also referred to as hook-and-line fishing, produces an unusually high-quality catch and is considered one of the most sustainable methods of fishing. Unlike dredging or trawling methods in which a net or basket is dragged along the seafloor, it doesn\u2019t damage or disturb the habitat of the seafloor, and it\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.seafoodwatch.org/ocean-issues/fishing-and-farming-methods\">one of the few commercial fishing methods</a> that results in virtually no bycatch and carries no risk of entangling other species. \u201cIf you\u2019re out there with a net, you\u2019re catching everything in your path,\u201d explains Ryan Bigelow of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood watch program. \u201cBut as soon as a troller gets a catch, they pull it in, and then throw it back if it\u2019s not what they\u2019re fishing for. If you\u2019re catching something in a net, say a turtle for example, it will drown before you have a chance to throw it back.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/14/us-fishermen-turn-billion-dollar-seafood-waste-into-profitable-products\">Entrepreneurs turn billion dollar seafood waste into profitable products</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In recent years, the market for ethically and sustainably produced food has grown substantially \u2013 in 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/11/seafood-industry-sustainable-fishing-salmon-overfishing\">sustainably sourced seafood constituted 14% of worldwide seafood production</a>, up from only 0.5% in 2005.

Seafood still represents a relatively small proportion of people\u2019s diets, and the conversations around seafood and sustainability are extremely complicated.</p> <p>\u201cPeople understand sustainable farming because it\u2019s part of the ecosystem we inhabit,\u201d Seaver says. \u201cBut when it comes to sustainable fishing, people are not talking about it nearly as much.\u201d</p> <p>Both Bigelow and Seaver suggest that Richardson\u2019s success will hinge on her ability to connect the average consumer in the continental US to Alaska\u2019s hook-and-line fishermen, and the communities they inhabit and protect. \u201cThe story is high-quality product delivered by a passionate, small American business trying to help their community,\u201d Seaver says. \u201cThese are values that we can understand.\u201d</p> <p>Kendall Whitney handles direct-to-consumer marketing for SPC. He believes it\u2019s essential that consumers see the faces, and learn the stories, of the fishermen of the SPC, many of whom are deeply involved in the region\u2019s fisheries management and local environmental causes. In every direct-to-consumer shipment, Whitney includes a booklet with recipes, cooking tips and the stories of one of SPC\u2019s fishermen and deck hands. </p> <p></p> <p>\u201cI want our customers to understand what it\u2019s like to be a fisherman, the connection they have to the water and, if you\u2019re a salmon troller, the forests of Alaska,\u201d Whitney says. </p> <p>Salmon trolling represents only a small percentage of Alaska\u2019s wild-caught salmon market. The lion\u2019s share of the catch (which is dominated by chum and pink salmon) is <a href=\"http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=commercialbyareasoutheast.salmon#harvest\">caught with purse seine nets or gillnets</a>. Bigelow isn\u2019t sure that operations like Richardson\u2019s or the SPC will ever be able to capture a significantly larger market share. \u201cWe eat so much salmon, and there\u2019s such a demand for it, it\u2019ll be difficult to go back,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4d12fb45397e4dfa9dcd1751d42022e933b5a10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4d12fb45397e4dfa9dcd1751d42022e933b5a10/0_414_2880_1728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lacie Richardson on her boat. \u201cShe is building a story on the fish,\u201d says Ryan Bigelow of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood watch program.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lacie Richardson on her boat. \u201cShe is building a story on the fish,\u201d says Ryan Bigelow of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood watch program.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lacie Richardson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Seaver believes that there is room for growth in the demand for hook-and-line caught fish, both among consumers who are deeply committed to sustainable food and among retailers who are focused on quality. \u201cI think that the real growth in this is going to come from chefs and restaurants and retailers who are selling troll, or hook-and-line, as the sex appeal of quality rather than as the marker of sustainability,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Richardson, who has also started leading fishing retreats in Alaska as part of her mission to connect more people to the region\u2019s fishing communities and traditions, is banking on the fact that American consumers are ready to start asking more questions about the fish they\u2019re eating.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s [the] troller\u2019s time to have a voice in the industry,\u201d she says.</p>",

Trilobites patrolled what was then essentially Waterworld. Whatever life clung to the exposed rocks in what geologists call the Ordovician period would have been little more than a fine mat of microbes.</p> <p>Rock-hugging green mosses evolved, and spread over dry land, using photosynthesis to take atmospheric oxygen from perhaps only a quarter of today\u2019s level to the present life-giving lungful.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to get direct evidence of what\u2019s on land, because most stuff is preserved in ocean sediments, so we rely on freaky, unusual terrestrial preservation.

You could think of them as creating thicker, more luscious carpets.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2015/dec/14/climate-change-plants-key-to-ancient-modern-fossil\">Living fossils: the plants holding the key to ancient and modern climate change</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Within 20 to 40 million years, the supercontinent-sized carpet of mosses had begun to fashion the modern world. As carbon dioxide levels fell, global temperatures dropped and the first glaciations began. The rocks weathered to become soils. The first vascular plants of the Silurian period began to take root, to be followed by the ferns and horsetails of the Devonian, still more than 400 million years ago. Creatures began, tentatively, to leave the sea and seek food in the first foliage. </p> <p>\u201cI like to think of things toddling out of the ocean onto the sea shore and then toddling back in again,\u201d said Lenton. \u201cWe might have had a few quirky visitors onto the land in search of food, and once you have established Mossworld, you have a food source. You\u2019d expect animal evolution to take advantage.\u201d</p> <p>By the late Silurian, club mosses as tall as 30 centimetres may have begun to add variety to the scenery. It would have been a landscape familiar to fell-runners on modern Dartmoor. </p> <p>\u201cI spend a lot of time thinking about Mossworld today because I run around as a fell-runner when I am not being a scientist, and Dartmoor nearby is carpeted with sphagnum moss bogs. I often think about what Mossworld or Lichenworld looked like because I see a lot on my fell runs on Dartmoor,\u201d Lenton said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to think that without the evolution of the humble moss, none of us would be here today. Our research suggested that the earliest land plants were surprisingly productive and caused a major rise in the oxygen content of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The feverish acclaim for Usain Bolt\u2019s third Olympic 100m title was still reverberating around the Est\u00e1dio Olimpico Jo\u00e3o Havelange when the Jamaican announced a bold recalibration of his targets for Rio. Not only did he want a historic \u201ctriple triple\u201d of three successive 100m, 200m and 4x100m titles but \u2013 for good measure \u2013 the 200m world record and sporting immortality as well.</p> <p>The first part of Bolt\u2019s grand plan starts on Tuesday with the 200m heats. Four men have run quicker over the distance this year, with the American LaShawn Merritt leading the rankings at 19.74sec, a hundredth of a second faster than Justin Gatlin, the silver medallist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/15/usain-bolt-surges-past-justin-gatlin-to-win-historic-olympic-100m-gold-in-rio\">in Sunday\u2019s 100m</a>.</p> <p>But, as always, Bolt turns up as the prohibitive favourite. He has not lost a major 200m championship final since his victory at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and it would be the most stunning upset of these Games if that pattern were to change.</p> <p>And long past the bewitching hour there was a twinkle in Bolt\u2019s eye as he indulged those asking about his chances of breaking his 200m world record of 19.19, set in Berlin in 2009. \u201cThis is one of the biggest things,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cI really want that record \u2013 and I think if I can get a good night\u2019s rest after the semi-finals, it\u2019s possible.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/15/usain-bolt-the-human-races-ultimate-speed-freak\">Usain Bolt: the human race's ultimate speed freak</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the bald form of Sunday night\u2019s 100m final, such talk appears more foolhardy than bold. Bolt crossed the line in 9.81, his slowest championship winning time \u2013 a far cry from when he raced away from the field to set an Olympic record of 9.63 in London four years ago. Yet there were extenuating circumstances. Usually the gap between the semi-finals and final is at least two hours, allowing sprinters time to rest their bodies and minds. This time they were rushed out and back again in 80 minutes.</p> <p>Something else is worth bearing in mind. Last week Bolt told friends that he felt he was in sub-9.7 shape for the 100m. If true, an assault on the 200m world record perhaps isn\u2019t such a pipe dream, especially if the hot weather holds and ferments with the adrenaline of the crowd as it did on Sunday. The Jamaican knows from watching Wayde Van Niekerk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/14/wayde-van-niekerk-olympic-gold-400m-world-record\">shatter Michael Johnson\u2019s two-decade old 400m record</a> that the electric blue Mondo track in Rio deserves its reputation as the fastest of all time.</p> <p>Before the start of the 100m final, each athlete was introduced one by one to a thudding techno beat. This was the biggest moment in most of their careers. Understandably, most were pensive. Not Bolt, who waved and smiled at his adoring fans. He would probably be relaxed in front of a firing squad. No doubt he would back himself to outrun their bullets. Gatlin, predictably, was booed \u2013 his reputation for failed drugs tests preceding him. Afterwards even Bolt admitted that he found the booing \u201cshocking\u201d.</p> <p>The American heard the screeching catcalls and jeers, but tuned them out. \u201cThey don\u2019t know me, they don\u2019t know Justin,\u201d he pleaded afterwards. \u201cAnd I have the respect of my own competitors in the 100m. That\u2019s all I really care about.\u201d</p> <p>Gatlin quickly sent the boos to the back of his mind. And for a few brief moments after the gun sounded, it appeared as if he might just have the run on the field. Even at 34 the American\u2019s start remains a work of technical beauty: his body perfectly in tune with the starter\u2019s pistol. As usual he was out of his blocks quickest and led by a metre at halfway. Bolt, by contrast, did not so much explode from the blocks as rise stiffly from them: like a man with a slipped disc getting upright after sleeping on a hard mattress.</p> <p>But once he got into his stride it was over. From 60m to 70m Bolt caught up and then catapulted away. As he crossed the line he was slowing down, hand across his chest in salute: mission accomplished. Gatlin found himself in second again, in 9.89, while the Canadian Andre de Grasse took bronze in 9.91.</p> <p>Bolt said: \u201cIt was very hard to run fast because the turnaround time was so short it was ridiculous. I felt so good in the semi-finals but by the time I got back to the warm up area I had to start warming up again. For me it was really stupid. That\u2019s why the race was slow.\u201d</p> <p>Still, victory ensured he was back treading the familiar path of gold and Olympic glory \u2013 and thirsting for more of the same. \u201cSomebody said if I win these three gold medals I would be immortal and I kind of liked it,\u201d he said. \u201cI came here to prove myself as one of the greats, to set myself apart from everyone else, so I\u2019m going to run with that one.\u201d</p> <p>Few would bet against him. Even now, despite all track and field\u2019s scandals and suspicions, being the fastest man on the planet carries enormous bragging rights. And yet again Bolt has the swagger of a king.</p>",
  "<p>Workers for the takeaway delivery firm Deliveroo have staged a sixth day of protests over a new pay deal, saying concessions only apply to those who are willing to work in new areas. </p> <p>Last week, the firm, which sends couriers to restaurants including Pizza Express and Wagamama, told workers in some parts of London that it would be trialling a new pay structure.

Our riders are the lifeblood of our business and without them we are nothing,\u201d he told the Today programme.</p> <p>He said the new pay plan was \u201cin response to our riders\u2019 number-one concern, which is flexibility \u2026 This was a choice for them. If the riders choose to be on a new scheme that\u2019s great \u2026 If riders feel like it\u2019s not for them, they can choose to work on the old scheme as well.\u201d<br></p> <p>Riders, however, said that to opt out they would have to move to a new delivery area, which could mean earning less money through the \u00a31-a-delivery commission. Margaret Dewhurst from the <a href=\"https://iwgb.org.uk/\">Independent Workers Union of Great Britain</a> (IWGB), said: \u201cRiders have spent time building up their patch. They\u2019ve been learning their areas for two or three years. \u201cChanging zone will mean moving somewhere central which they don\u2019t know, so they will end up doing fewer deliveries.\u201d</p> <p>A rider picketing outside the firm\u2019s recruitment office in north London on Monday said that moving riders to zones outside the trial would mean \u201cthose zones are flooded so you will get fewer hours\u201d.</p> <p>David Scott, Deliveroo\u2019s operations manager for the UK and Ireland, said he was confident that the new system was better for riders and confirmed the trial would be going ahead from Wednesday. He said workers would be able to log in whenever they wished for work, and in peak hours could earn more than with the hourly rate.<br></p> <p>\u201cThey can choose to stay on the old rate in a nearby zone,\u201d he said. \u201cThese areas are very small and very local \u2026 We are going to be supporting them if they want to move. The business is growing very fast so we won\u2019t add in any more people than are needed.\u201d</p> <p>Scott said workers were having to sign up to new terms and conditions for the trial partly to show that they knew what they were moving onto, and that he was keen to hear feedback from riders. \u201cA fee structure that doesn\u2019t work for our riders will not work for Deliveroo,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have an open door policy here.

  "<p>You might think that the nation that gave the world the theory of evolution would be a bit better at learning from its mistakes. Not so. Four years ago, the weeks running up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012\" title=\"\">the London Olympic Games</a> generated a carnival of British negativity. Nothing would be ready; it would all cost too much; the VIPs would hog the tickets; Londoners would be fed up; non-Londoners would resent the whole thing; it was all an expensive folly.</p> <p>But then the Games started, and everything changed. Thousands volunteered. Even bigger numbers bought tickets; millions were glued to the coverage; our team did well; the show brought us all together; so did the sport. Everything worked. We found new heroes: Jessica Ennis, Mo Farah, Nicola Adams. Instead of moaning about the games, we found ourselves feeling surprisingly good about ourselves.

Something there may yet go wrong. Yet already a similar about-turn, at least in British attitudes, is in evidence. Before they started, the Rio games were loftily pronounced a disaster from afar.

True, there have been embarrassments such as the diving pool turning green and some dubious plumbing in the Olympic village. True, some events have been played out to at best half-empty stadiums.

The prediction would be based on factors such as distance, the amount of time spent traveling at high speeds on highways, and whether the weather will require a lot of heat or air conditioning.</p> <p>Secondly, Trancik said, a local company or a neighbor might provide easy access to a conventional car. \u201cWe still need a little bit of business model innovation, with community car sharing, or car sharing [businesses] where you could maybe order one the night before on that small number of very high-energy days.\u201d</p> <p>Whether or not drivers ever take that dreamed-of road trip from one end of I-40 to the other, the MIT team admits the limited range of battery-powered electric vehicles is a major barrier to entry. \u201cThe picture I have is of a lot of people owning electric cars but then being able to very conveniently get an internal combustion engine vehicle to take that long road trip,\u201d Trancik said. \u201cThat needs to be as easy as getting an Uber.\u201d</p> <p>But the need for electric cars is urgent, in the estimation of the MIT team, and the majority of the damage to the atmosphere wrought by fossil fuel vehicles isn\u2019t wrought by drag-racing guys in 1964 Mustangs.</p> <p> \u201cTransportation accounts for 28% of US energy use and 34% of US greenhouse gas emissions, the majority coming from light-duty vehicles making personal trips \u2013 people commuting to work, driving to social events, and performing errands in cars and light trucks,\u201d wrote the report\u2019s authors.</p> <p>The infrastructure problems are mostly taken care of already, Trancik said. \u201cWe looked at a case where the grid wouldn\u2019t have to change very much,\u201d she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/21/is-apple-next-product-an-electric-car-telsa\">Is Apple's next product an electric car?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOnce-daily charging at home overnight when many power plants sit idle would be a less invasive charging option for vehicles.

So what next?</p> <p>Halfway through the following Olympic cycle, Burt, along with the team doctor, Richard Freeman, came across their next marginal gain: solving women\u2019s saddle pain.</p> <p>An increasing number of female riders, professional and amateur, were resorting to surgery to correct vulval disfigurement. It was well known that one other national squad was regularly prescribing its riders Emla cream, a local anaesthetic, to soothe chronic pain.</p> <p>Plus Victoria Pendleton had struggled so much to find the right saddle in the run-up to 2012 that British Cycling\u2019s so-called \u201csecret squirrel club\u201d of techies designed her a bespoke model, made out of the same silicone used in breast implants.</p> <p>Together with colleagues, Burt did a survey. It was completed by 18 of the female riders and one man (\u201cMen suffer just as much with this stuff but they just won\u2019t admit it,\u201d reckons Burt). All of the women said that saddle problems were affecting not just their training but their competition.

There were tribologists, who specialise in analysing friction; reconstructive surgeons, who were experts in dealing with pressure sores; and Prof Jane Sterling, a top consultant in vulval health from Cambridge University.</p> <p>This niche symposium made some useful discoveries. Top of the list was the realisation that if riders were allowed to tilt the nose of their saddles downwards, much of the pressure on their delicate soft tissue would be&#xa0;alleviated.</p> <p>In one of its \u201cjust because\u201d rulings, the UCI, cycling\u2019s global governing body, had decreed that saddles were only allowed a tilt of less than 2.5 degrees, with a 0.5 degree margin of error. \u201cWe presented our findings to the UCI and they have since increased the angle of tilt to nine degrees with a tolerance of one degree. This has had a major impact on rider health, for both men and women, across the sport,\u201d said Burt.</p> <p>Then there was the knotty problem of pubic hair removal. \u201cThe world\u2011class expert advice from a professor at Cambridge was that waxing and shaving didn\u2019t help our fight against saddle issues,\u201d says Burt.</p> <p>Pubic hair helps with the transport and evaporation of sweat away from the skin.

One design was supposed to fit all, despite a wide variation in not just thigh circumference but also undercarriage arrangements. \u201cSome of the girls were complaining that their shorts were rucking up, particularly the sprinters, who slam into the saddle at high speed,\u201d says Burt, who once wrote <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com.br/Bike-Fit-Optimise-Performance-Avoidance/dp/1408190303\" title=\"\">a book on the importance of bike fit</a>.</p> <p>Posters were put up in the changing rooms at the velodrome in Manchester, where the GB squad do their training, to remind the cyclists how best to keep their nethers in good order. The effect was immediate. \u201cThe podium squad haven\u2019t had a saddle sore for six months,\u201d said Burt shortly before the Games began. With the women so far winning gold in the team pursuit and silver in the keirin, the project appears to have paid dividends.</p> <p>One of the squad\u2019s stars told Burt recently that she is no longer suffering, in silence or otherwise: \u201cShe says it\u2019s totally changed her life.\u201d</p>",

They use the toilet as the place where they practise their numbers before they do them full-out on the dancefloor, and the dream is that they will get picked up for the band. So in this respect, the toilets have become a place of fantasy and possibility, in a way that the Glasgow toilet is not \u2026 or is it?\u201d She laughs, leaving the denouement unspoiled.</p> <p>But the play also becomes an exploration of Fela\u2019s music from a female point of view. \u201cI love his music, but I have a difficult relationship with how women were portrayed in his politics, and yet they were such a big part of his aesthetic. I think half the reason I grew up loving it was because of the dancers and the singers, but they were in the background and I wanted to bring them to the foreground.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"043a391f0a644ce123342a6b8da88d94e039fa59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/043a391f0a644ce123342a6b8da88d94e039fa59/0_330_3509_2105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fela Kuti on stage in 1983.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fela Kuti on stage in 1983.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Dickson/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the dramatic setting allows Onashile to isolate the way that women regard themselves and each other, the impact of the male gaze is never far away. \u201cWe\u2019ve discussed it in the cast: why do women go to the toilet in pairs? One woman said: \u2018Because you don\u2019t want to be cornered.\u2019 So we\u2019ve always got that sense of being watched, judged, ridiculed.\u201d That gaze can, of course, be a threatening one: \u201cWhen are we not going to worry about sending texts when we come back from a night out so everybody knows we\u2019re safe?

  "<p>The Harry Potter books and movies would not have been quite the same without the boisterous cavalcade of magical creatures with which JK Rowling populated her wild and whimsical wizarding world. Who could forget Goblet of Fire\u2019s majestic dragons, the hippogriffs of Prisoner of Azkaban, Chamber of Secrets\u2019 giant arachnid, Aragog, or the soul-sucking dementors? </p> <p>Now, thanks to the new issue of Entertainment Weekly, we have our first proper look at some of the monstrous entities who look set to escape from the Tardis-like briefcase of Eddie Redmayne\u2019s Newt Scamander in the upcoming prequel Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. </p> <h2>Some could prove almost impossible to catch</h2> <p>We know the basic premise of Fantastic Beasts. Scamander arrives in the Big Apple, suffers a mishap that causes many of his pet monstrosities to escape, and presumably spends the rest of the movie trying to put everything back in the box. But how do you go about re-capturing a Demiguise, <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/gallery/fantastic-beasts-creature-gallery/2707933_demiguise\">described as</a> \u201ca primate-like creature that resembles a silver-haired orangutan with large, doleful black eyes\u201d, when the darned thing has the ability to go invisible at any time and can also use its magical abilities to predict what you\u2019re about to do next? This particular beast could be harder to track down than Pikachu. </p> <h2>Others look more cute than scary</h2> <p>The cheeky little Niffler, <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/gallery/fantastic-beasts-creature-gallery/2707918_fantastic-beasts-and-where-find-them-niffler\">we\u2019re told</a>, resembles a cross between a mole and a duck-billed platypus. But don\u2019t be fooled by its benign countenance, the ferrety little magical marsupial is after your treasures. It will go hunting for precious things \u2013 coins, jewelry or just about anything shiny \u2013 with relentless determination, before carting off any ill-gotten gains in its seemingly bottomless pouch.</p> <h2>Newt might not be the only ones after them</h2> <p>There\u2019s a reason the bumbling magizoologist keeps his magical creatures safely out of sight: some of them are very valuable indeed. The aforementioned Demiguise is sought after for its pelt, which can be made into invisibility coats. And the sinister Occamy, <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/gallery/fantastic-beasts-creature-gallery/2707763_occamy\">described as</a> a \u201cplumed, two-legged, winged creature with a serpentine body ... like a cross between a dragon and a bird\u201d lays eggs of pure silver. It\u2019s also capable of contracting or expanding in size depending on its environment. </p> <h2>Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy has a cute little cousin</h2> <p>As briefly mentioned in Order of the Phoenix, <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/gallery/fantastic-beasts-creature-gallery/2707928_bowtruckle\">the Bowtruckle</a> is a plant-like species that can apparently be used to pick locks. Scamander is said to have several of these as pets, and keeps one named Pickett in his top pocket. It\u2019s not yet known if they are capable of Groot-like speech or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMYt4HvUxIM\">funky disco dancing moves</a>. </p> <h2>Thunderbirds are go</h2> <p>A majestic white bird seen briefly in Fantastic Beasts\u2019 recent trailers, <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/gallery/fantastic-beasts-creature-gallery/2707938_thunderbird\">this creature</a> has the ability to see danger before it happens and can create storms with the beating of its wings, which must be useful when there\u2019s a drought on in its native Arizona. We\u2019re told Scamander promised to return a Thunderbird named Frank to its home after rescuing the creature from traffickers in Egypt, which might just explain what the English wizard is doing in north America in the first place.</p> <p>Regular Rowling watchers might recall that the author-turned-screenwriter was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/09/jk-rowling-under-fire-for-appropriating-navajo-tradition-history-of-magic-in-north-america-pottermore\">accused of appropriating indigenous culture</a> for her debut foray into North American wizarding culture back in March. The Thunderbird is a legendary creature in many Native American cultures, so there could be more trouble brewing here. </p> <h2>Fear now has wings</h2> <p>The freakiest beastie on show, and perhaps the fastest if its fleeting appearance in trailers is anything to go by, looks to be a flying reptile named <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/gallery/fantastic-beasts-creature-gallery/2707923_swooping-evil\">Swooping Evil</a> that might just be Fantastic Beasts\u2019 answer to the terrifying dementors.

It included the now familiar trick of cranking out teaser footage online \u2013 the first in July 2015, just a few weeks after filming began \u2013 to help create a social media buzz around the film among its young target audience long before reviewers could shape perceptions. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/07/suicide-squad-review-bad-film-margot-robbie-jared-leto\">Suicide Squad review \u2013 in dire need of real evil</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The film industry is waiting to see if Suicide Squad goes the same way as its DC Comics stablemate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/27/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-observer-review\">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a>, another Warner Bros title backed by a huge marketing effort. It dipped sharply at the box office after a big opening weekend in March as poor reviews caught up with it, but racked up $873m in sales, the fifth-biggest box office hit of the year so far. </p> <p>Suicide Squad topped the US box office for a second weekend, despite a drop from the $135m for its opening three days, the best ever for an August release. International box office takings fell 56% compared with the opening weekend, when the movie earned nearly $15m in the UK, but still account for just over 50% of total sales. It is already the 11th highest-grossing film worldwide this year. </p> <p>\u201cClearly cinema-goers and film fans have access to a much broader range of opinion than just [traditional] critics,\u201d said Phil Clapp, the chief executive of the UK Cinema Association. </p> <p>\u201cThe growth of [buzz] on social media can counter negative reviews. While it can also go the other way you typically see with franchises, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/superhero-movies\">superhero films</a> or those based around books, is a gathering of a fan base around a film. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/fifty-shades-of-grey\">Fifty Shades of Grey</a> is as good an example of that as any. When that happens a film can take on a life almost impervious of critics.\u201d</p> <p>In January a series of striking, stylised Suicide Squad posters with DayGlo colours followed Warner Bros\u2019 initial teaser, along with the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmRih_VtVAs\">first official trailer featuring Queen\u2019s Bohemian Rhapsody</a>, which has notched up tens of millions of views. Other promotional stunts included setting up themed tattoo parlours at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/08/sxsw-south-by-southwest-insiders-guide-2016\">South by Southwest</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/coachella\">Coachella</a> music festivals.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a7384d03cd67bfe4a81d604e4714fb742807dae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a7384d03cd67bfe4a81d604e4714fb742807dae/0_211_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margot Robbie at the European premiere of Suicide Squad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margot Robbie at the European premiere of Suicide Squad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Ryan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe are in a world now where there are 700 or more feature films launched in the UK each year,\u201d says Mark Batey, the chief executive of the Film Distributors Association. \u201cSupply has literally doubled in the last 10 years. The issue is how do you get cut-through from the pack. Remember audiences also have an unprecedented entertainment choice on-demand [at home] and that is the challenge for film distribution companies and marketing. I think the marketing campaign for Suicide Squad was inspired.\u201d</p> <p>Distributors spent more than \u00a3200m marketing films in the UK alone in the last year, according to WPP\u2019s media buying division Group M. Warner Brothers spends about \u00a325m in the UK annually marketing its films.</p> <p>\u201cSuicide Squad is a big brand and marketing started early with high expectations,\u201d says David Livingstone, a former senior executive at Working Title and Universal, with marketing credits including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/bridget-jones-diary\">Bridget Jones\u2019 Diary</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,530807,00.html\">Trainspotting</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2003/nov/21/comedy\">Love Actually</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jan/04/how-we-made-the-usual-suspects-bryan-singer-gabriel-byrne\">The Usual Suspects</a>. \u201cThey got great cut-through with their materials and you can\u2019t underestimate the great characters that looked cool as fuck. Jared Leto as the joker, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/21/harley-quinn-suicide-squad-margot-robbie-dc-comics\">Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn</a>. The characters looked the sharpest versions from the comics.</p> <p>The film has also been lauded for the diversity of its cast \u2013 black, white, Asian, Hispanic and Native American people are represented \u2013 which also plays well to the widest range of audiences possible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/12/pete-dragon-sausage-party-summer-movie-flops\">Can Pete's Dragon and Sausage Party save a summer of blockbuster failure?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The marketing has been carefully crafted to appeal particularly to younger audiences, vital to keep the film riding high at the box office. It appears to have worked.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of fans were so incensed at the welter of negative reviews that they signed an online petition calling for the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes to be shut. Among those under 35 who saw Suicide Squad on the opening weekend the film was given an A- on CinemaScore.</p> <p>\u201cYounger people, the market that Suicide Squad is most likely after, are not in thrall to traditional media to the same extent as their elders,\u201d says Laurence Thomson, the chief creative officer at the ad agency McCann London. </p> <p>\u201cThere are lots of different interconnected elements to marketing a film, from the poster right through to Tarantino\u2019s preferred method of making as much noise in the media as possible. If one of these elements fails, such as the reviews, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean box office disaster. A better decider of success can be the story you are telling and the channels you are using.\u201d</p> <h2>Other critic-proof blockbusters </h2> <p>Suicide Squad may have received an especially savage critical mauling, but two big budget franchises show why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/25/dc-comics-reboot-batman-superman-wonder-woman\">DC Comics</a> is so keen to turn its stable of superheroes into a box office steamroller, whatever the critics think.</p> <p>In 2003, the first Pirates of the Caribbean film was well received by critics. The reviews <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/22/pirates-stranger-tides-johnny-depp\">became less positive with each subsequent instalment</a>, and the most recent, On Stranger Tides is rated just 32% on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/11/mad-max-fury-road-wins-rotten-tomatoes-best-reviewed-film-2015\">Rotten Tomatoes</a>. Despite that, both the second and fourth films took more than $1bn at the box office worldwide, and the third came close with $963m. All three are in the top 30 top grossing films of all time.</p> <p>The other blockbuster franchise seemingly immune to negative reviews is Transformers, which even with its first instalment in 2007 failed to charm critics. Again subsequent releases have been increasingly poorly received by people paid to write about film, but they still pulled in the punters. The two most recent, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/jul/04/transformers-dark-moon\">Dark of the Moon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/transformers-age-of-extinction\">Age of Extinction</a>, were ranked at a lowly 35% and 18% respectively by Rotten Tomatoes, but both made more than $1bn at the box office.</p> <p>It is little surprise that both Transformers and Pirates of the Caribbean are returning to cinemas in 2017. <strong>Jasper Jackson</strong></p>",
  "<p>Fourteen salvage experts have boarded the drilling rig that ran aground on the coast of the Isle of Lewis in Scotland last week, as the official overseeing the operation confirmed it could take weeks before the stricken oil platform can be moved. </p> <p>The 17,000-tonne semi-submersible rig, Transocean Winner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/11/thousands-litres-diesel-spilled-grounded-rig-transocean-winner\">ran aground</a> close to Dalmore beach last Monday as it was being towed from Norway to Malta and its towline snapped in heavy seas.</p> <p>Hugh Shaw, the secretary of state\u2019s representative for maritime salvage and intervention, told BBC Alba that any attempt to refloat the rig was still weeks away.</p> <p>The platform was carrying 280 tonnes of diesel, and specialists believe two of the four storage tanks were damaged when it hit rocks near Carloway, with a potential loss of 53 tonnes of fuel. But there has been no sign so far of an oil slick or reports of pollution. </p> <p>Smit Salvage confirmed on Monday that the remaining two diesel oil tanks in the hull were intact and plans were now under way to transfer their contents \u2013 a total of 137 tonnes \u2013 using onboard pumping systems to other tanks above the water line.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the salvage team, which includes staff from the rig\u2019s owner, Transocean, will continue their damage assessment and preparations for the eventual refloat. A wire will be run between the shore and the rig to enable supplies and equipment to be delivered to those working onboard. </p> <p>The Maritime and Coastguard Agency is continuing to impose a 300-metre exclusion zone around the popular surfing spot covering sea and air, to prevent onlookers hampering the salvage teams and to prevent drones being used in the area. The Scottish operational environment group is closely monitoring the incident.</p>",
  "<p>Walking through the gates of Gothenburg\u2019s Way Out West festival, the first thing you notice are hashtags. There are hashtags #everywhere. In fact, in between all the #fun #brand #activities, whether it\u2019s posing in an ASOS photobooth, trying out Samsung VR, drinking dairy-free milk samples, or getting a Maybelline makeover, it can sometimes feel as if you won\u2019t see any music at all. On the main thoroughfare, a smiling woman hands out branded transfer tattoos, turning people\u2019s forearms into roaming adverts. Next to a main stage, packets of crisps regularly fly through the air, fired from a nearby Doritos cannon \u2013 a spectacle that, at one point during the weekend, draws a bigger crowd than Julia Holter.</p> <p>This is one grim version of the future of music festivals, as independent and sponsorship-free events become a dying breed. Way Out West, held in the city that dubs itself Sweden\u2019s music capital, boasts an eye-wateringly good lineup. Morrissey\u2019s only festival appearance, Massive Attack, Sia, Anohni, PJ Harvey, Skepta, Grace Jones, De La Soul \u2013 the list goes on and on. Yet these are expensive names and, surveying the site, the volume of deals struck with the corporate devil to pay their fees and get them to Gothenburg is jarring.</p> <p>Yet once you\u2019ve navigated your way through the corporate quagmire, this is also a weekend of stellar shows \u2013 albeit ones often scheduled at strange times. On Thursday, no one is surprised when the Libertines postpone their set (their first in Sweden since 2004), having been a last-minute booking to replace Avalanches. So it is left to Morrissey to pick up the mood as the first drops of the weekend\u2019s unrelenting rain begin to fall. He is in his element here; Way Out West is a purely vegetarian \u2013 and save for a bit of halloumi, mostly vegan \u2013 festival. \u201cIt\u2019s a great delight to be at a festival which is vegan,\u201d Morrissey tells the sodden crowds. \u201cThe rest of the world take note. No death for sale, no pain for sale, no torture for sale.\u201d He pauses. \u201cExcept for me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0a4e283aee911251f36cfc4502968db9d253384e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a4e283aee911251f36cfc4502968db9d253384e/0_226_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stormzy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grime going global \u2026 Stormzy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olle Kirchmeier</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whether it\u2019s middle age, or the lack of dairy and meat in a five-mile radius, Morrissey\u2019s voice is better than ever, and he seems in exceptionally good spirits. The set opens with a faultless rendition of Suedehead, and goes from strength to strength, peaking in energy with last year\u2019s single Kiss Me a Lot. Morrissey reaches up to the heavens as he wails the chorus of You Have Killed Me and even plays Ouija Board, a live rarity. When someone from the crowd leaps on to the stage, he clutches them in a lengthy tender embrace.</p> <p>In these turbulent times, Morrissey\u2019s set feels more pointedly political than ever. He dedicates Throwing My Arms Around Paris to the victims of the attacks in Nice and Paris and screens footage of US police shootings as he sings World Peace Is None of Your Business. Yet 2016\u2019s tragedies have taken their toll even on misery-monger Morrissey. \u201cDon\u2019t you find that the television news drags you down and pressurises and tries to kill you and drag you down?,\u201d he asks dramatically. \u201cWell STOP watching.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cby night\u201d part of the festival, which happens across four venues in the city from midnight till 4am, is also a curious beast, mainly due to programming that seems to have no coherent vision driving it. Post-midnight, Thursday\u2019s best offering is jazz virtuoso and Kendrick collaborator Thundercat, but his set, filled more with lengthy improvised jams than his upbeat, funk-infused tracks, feels like hard work at this hour.</p> <p>It\u2019s also hard to understand why artists such as Paula Temple are put on during the afternoon, her brutal but brilliant techno set wasted on a crowd of 20 people looking confused, while bands Whitney and Fidlar are among those playing in the early hours of the morning. The Internet are given a 3am slot on Saturday night and, though starting out electric, by the end are evidently knackered. \u201cThis is way past our bedtime,\u201d says frontwoman Syd sweetly.</p> <p>Over the weekend there are, however, some moments of late-night brilliance. Julianna Barwick\u2019s set in a Gothenburg church elevates her vocals to new angelic levels, and Peaches\u2019s gorgeously ostentatious show features at least 16 costume changes and sees her get into a giant inflatable penis.</p> <p>Friday brings an indisputable weekend highlight in the form of rapper Anderson Paak, who sprints across the sodden stage with a magnetic energy. Mainly featuring songs from his recent release Malibu, it\u2019s a soulful set that proves comparisons to Kendrick Lamar are much deserved. Equally soulful is Kamasi Washington, who, resplendent in red robes, weaves musical magic with his saxophone, while Jessy Lanza and Grace Jones both provide joyous escapism in the midst of hour 10 of non-stop rain.</p> <p>The afternoon brings the news that Ahnoni has cancelled due to illness, and she is replaced by the Libertines, who \u2013 after finally showing up \u2013 play an evening set that is as shambolic as it is depressing. The much-mythologised chemistry between Pete and Carl has long dissolved. Far from being the antithesis to the hashtag mentality of Way Out West, the Libertines just become a part of it \u2013 they\u2019re here for the money, and it\u2019s never been more evident.</p> <p>Surprisingly, the most raw and energised moment of the whole festival comes mid-afternoon on Saturday with Stormzy\u2019s set. Grime has apparently gripped Sweden in a big way, and he draws the biggest crowd of the weekend who are chanting \u201cMerky 2016\u201d before he comes on stage (though who knows how that translates into Swedish?). No one is more surprised than Stormzy \u2013 last time he played in Sweden it was to a crowd of just a few hundred.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79ae49ae9ef768d698f3a06754237e378f502762\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79ae49ae9ef768d698f3a06754237e378f502762/0_209_3312_1987/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Secretive songstress \u2026 Sia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IBL/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stormzy is so enthralled that he chooses to debut his new track Cold, and by the end of the sweaty set, has the 3,000-strong crowd attempting a record-breaking moshpit. If ever there was a sign that grime is going global, this is it.</p> <p>Massive Attack play a tight, high-octane set, injected with new levels of energy thanks to the presence of Young Fathers with them on stage, but the festival grand finale belongs to secretive songstress Sia. Hidden behind a black and white wig and a giant bow on her head, she treats the crowds to massive hit after massive hit: Elastic Heart, Chandelier, Titanium, then Diamonds, the track she wrote for Rihanna. Her voice is powerful and flawless, and visually the set resembles a piece of performance art \u2013 but, much like the festival atmosphere over the weekend, is a little lacking in soul. </p>",
  "<p>Reports that a quarter of graduates are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/13/quarter-of-graduates-are-low-earners\" title=\"\">low earners</a> 10 years after leaving university bangs another nail in the coffin of the \u201cdegrees for all\u201d project that dates back to Tony Blair\u2019s premiership.</p> <p>This project always depended on the economy being able to provide graduate-level jobs for those who earn the qualifications \u2013 but as we\u2019ve discovered, that doesn\u2019t necessarily happen. Perhaps it might be a good time to stop telling youngsters that higher education and the debt that comes with it are the only way for them to get on.</p> <p>Most people who work in education are familiar with the unhelpful student who thinks they\u2019re cleverer than their teachers and that formal schooling has nothing to offer. Not so many are willing to admit that sometimes those students are right. One mum I bumped into at the weekend was fed up at one time with apologising for her daughter\u2019s lack of interest in college. In her early 20s, that daughter took her chances in a temporary job and is now earning twice what I did when I was a graduate of her age. One of my relatives married into a family where a brother expelled from school at 15 went on to start his own business and become a millionaire.</p> <p>As a former teacher, I\u2019m heavily in favour of an education system that allows everyone to develop their potential to the maximum extent. The key problem now for policymakers is how to create well-paid jobs that allow people to continue to develop after completing their studies. But we should also be considering how we could create an environment where dissident and non-conformist youths could do things differently. And we can start that process by refusing to express horror at youngsters who drop out of school as soon as they can, or show no interest in university league tables.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e79fa20009adf00e2cbab64062e12d8a8f34e3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e79fa20009adf00e2cbab64062e12d8a8f34e3f/0_107_3208_1925/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump: not the Antichrist.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump: not the Antichrist.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michelle Mcloughlin/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Apocalypse soon? </strong></h2> <p>There are no millionaires in my family but I do have one elderly and clever relative who\u2019s famous for responding to reports of wars and disasters in the same way. She nods sagely and warns us that these events were all foretold in the Book of Revelation.</p> <p>They are, in fact, clear signs that the end times are upon us. Given that the whole of recorded history is one long and depressing list of wars and disasters, I\u2019ve always been a bit sceptical myself. It\u2019s also undeniable that end-of-timers have a rather poor track record when it comes to picking a date for the Big One. But just because they\u2019ve always been wrong in the past, does that mean they always will be? And could there be portents in God\u2019s own country?</p> <p>The pundits are making reassuring noises about Donald Trump\u2019s chances of making it to the White House. But even the possibility that this erratic and touchy candidate might have the nuclear codes in his wallet is a cause for serious concern. I\u2019m not going to suggest for a moment that Trump is the Antichrist: that would be ridiculous. But if there is any suggestion in the Book of Revelation that the apocalypse will be presided over by a man who\u2019s big on guns and down on women and minorities, it might be time for all of us to get our affairs in order.</p> <h2><strong>In with the out-laws </strong></h2> <p>I spent Sunday in Norfolk celebrating my in-laws\u2019 diamond wedding anniversary. Actually that\u2019s not true, as my partner and I have never made it legal, so his mum and dad aren\u2019t really my in-laws. It seems odd that there doesn\u2019t seem to be any equivalent to \u201cin-laws\u201d for a non-married partner\u2019s relatives. I would suggest \u201cout-laws\u201d but that might be open to misinterpretation. Or is there another term in use that\u2019s passed me by?</p>",

To increase the international focus, 11 out of 16 awards will now be open to global talent. </p> <p>New awards introduced for 2016 include urban luxury, which focuses on streetwear designers, and creative influencer, for a behind-the-scenes talent such as a stylist or set designer. There is also the Swarovski award for positive change, which will be awarded to a brand or person who used their profile to promote a cause outside the fashion industry. </p> <p>These new awards reveal changes the fashion world wishes to make to become less insular, with catwalk designers no longer the pinnacle.

  "<p>The global economy has expanded greatly since the early 1980s, thanks to technology breakthroughs, the opening of markets and trade being more accessible. Today, trade <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/behold-15-trillion-of-world-trade-in-one-interactive-chart-2015-11-05\" rel=\"nofollow\">generates $15tn annually</a>.

The <a href=\"https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/pres16_e/pr768_e.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">World Trade Organization</a> (WTO) forecasts that in 2016, it will be less than 3% for the fifth straight year. Factors like climate change, booming populations and cybersecurity concerns have left the future uncertain. Meanwhile, some critics believe that trade agreements such as the proposed <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/tpp/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> (TPP) are not fair for everyone.</p> <p>Officials and academics are seeking solutions not only to help businesses, but also for people across the globe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/05/tpp-trade-deal-new-zealand-releases-text-online\">TPP trade deal: text published online</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Pros and cons of TPP</strong></p> <p>Much of the recent conversation about global trade has surrounded the TPP, which is currently awaiting ratification. The TPP covers 12 countries, including the US \u2013 and with them, approximately 800 million people and 40% of the global economy. Its provisions could bring down existing tax barriers to help increase agriculture, manufacturing and services exports among trading partners.</p> <p>Customs agencies in the TPP countries are also working to improve electronic processing of data and advanced screening of packages. This would help reduce time, cost and complexity in trade.</p> <p>Still, the TPP has become highly politicized. Critics say it goes against the interests of US workers who could potentially lose jobs to companies overseas. Proponents counter that the TPP could help trading partners among member nations to develop global supply chains in which their products are designed, sourced and assembled in many different countries \u2013 spreading wealth and making global trade more balanced.</p> <p>\u201cThe notion that one nation\u2019s success at exporting is another\u2019s failure is no longer true,\u201d says Leslie Griffin, senior vice president of international public policy at UPS. \u201cThe Trans-Pacific Partnership will create new opportunities for many players and give a needed boost to global trade.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Bringing nations together</strong></p> <p>Caroline Freund, a senior fellow at the <a href=\"https://piie.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peterson Institute</a>, and other academics suggest a way that governments can soothe those who say they\u2019ve been left behind by globalization: provide aid to workers who lose their jobs because of trade-related reasons. Those workers have legitimate concerns and needs. Still, experts like Freund maintain that trade\u2019s benefits are too important to roll back.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s always been this misconception out there that trade is a zero-sum game, and it\u2019s not,\u201d she says, \u201cAs we trade, the pie just gets bigger. Trade makes everyone better off. So, it\u2019s great \u2013 but it\u2019s not great for everybody all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Freund notes another major benefit: a balanced global trade ecosystem fosters peace. \u201cCountries that trade a lot tend not to go to war [against each other],\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier to get countries to oblige on noneconomic issues when you already have this kind of business community that\u2019s very intertwined.\u201d</p> <p>For proof, see the relationships between the US and many European nations over the past 70 years. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to argue that in Europe but also in the US, the post-World War II era has brought peace, wealth and stability,\u201d says Marietje Schaake, a member of the European Parliament from the Netherlands who\u2019s also a commissioner with the Global Commission on Internet Governance. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t dismiss what we have built together.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/fairtrade-partner-zone/2016/mar/10/global-trade-still-sees-millions-living-in-poverty-its-time-for-that-to-change\">Global trade still sees millions living in poverty -  it's time for that to change</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Level the playing field in the digital age</strong></p> <p>One major argument is that global trade agreements focus only on helping big businesses. That could change as e-commerce continues to evolve, creating an environment in which small- and medium-sized companies can go global immediately \u2013 and thus compete head-to-head with major corporations. </p> <p>\u201cThis is enabling the \u2018entrepreneurial economy\u2019, where large businesses face new competition and where small businesses see huge opportunities,\u201d Griffin says.</p> <p>For the first time in any trade agreement, the TPP includes language focused on helping small and medium-sized businesses. It addresses trade barriers that disproportionately challenge small businesses, including opaque customs regulations, complex trade paperwork and slow delivery of small courier shipments.</p> <p><strong>Making trade work for the environment</strong></p> <p>As the quantity of goods shipped worldwide increases, there\u2019s an urgency to make trade more environmentally friendly.</p> <p>\u201cTrade is essential for global social and economic sustainability, but making these compatible with environmental sustainability is arguably the hardest challenge of all,\u201d says Harris. \u201cWe will need dramatic improvements in technology to contain emissions as trade \u2013 and therefore goods movement \u2013 expands.\u201d</p> <p>Take the shift to \u201cslow steaming\u201d of ocean cargo, whereby ships deliberately go slower than their top speeds. This has had \u201ca very significant reduction on carbon emissions,\u201d according to Sean Doherty, head of international trade and investment at the <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">World Economic Forum</a>.</p> <p>Trade agreements and technology will continue to evolve, and there will be even greater attention on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the manufacture and delivery of goods worldwide. Governments and businesses alike will have to ensure these processes are effective as policies and protocols change in the years ahead.</p> <p>\u201cThe key responsibility for lawmakers like myself is to look at how we can frame global trade in a rules-based system to ensure standards safeguarding the environment,\u201d Schaake says. \u201cThat workers and peoples\u2019 fundamental human rights are strengthened by agreements that provide a frame or embedding for global trade.\u201d</p> <p><em>To read more about these issues and see some of the solutions that have emerged, see the </em><em><a href=\"http://www.ups.com/sustainability\" rel=\"nofollow\">2015 UPS corporate sustainability report</a>.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is paid for by UPS</strong></p>",
  "<p><strong>2.50pm, 12 August</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>Sheraton Hotel, Amsterdam Airport </strong><strong>Schiphol. Netherlands.</strong></p> <p>Hello. My name is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/henry-rollins\">Henry Rollins</a>. I am 55.5 years of age, from the USA and on my way to Edinburgh for four nights at the fringe. I have a show tonight, about 90 minutes from here in Eindhoven. Post show, I am back and then off, bright and early in the morning, to Sweden for a festival date and then on to Edinburgh. It will be my sixth time at the fringe \u2013 the first was 2007. The last time was in 2012, when I was basically told I was appearing too often and to give it a rest. What I do really doesn\u2019t seem to fit at the fringe. I am very happy but quite surprised to be back. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At night, Edinburgh lights up beautifully. Everyone passing by me seems so happy. I don\u2019t understand it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is a run of shows I look forward to from the time they are booked to when I am walking onstage. When the shows are done and I am heading back to the airport, I become depressed and only wish I could have somehow been able to perform every single night of the festival. </p> <p>One of the things I like most about the fringe is walking around post-show among all the people. The quality of air reminds me of autumn in Washington, DC, where I come from. At night, Edinburgh lights up beautifully. Everyone passing by me seems so happy. I don\u2019t understand it. Somehow, a little of it seems to rub off on me. It belongs to someone else, but for a little while, it\u2019s mine too. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/26/henry-rollins-environment-he-never-died\">Henry Rollins: \u2018Our species is a ruinous pain in the ass\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>11.38pm, 12 August. </strong><strong>Landvetter Airport Hotel. </strong><strong>Gothenburg, Sweden. </strong></p> <p>It has been raining almost nonstop since I arrived 11 hours ago. It\u2019s Friday and a night off, strange on my schedule. I am 46 shows and 15 countries into a 160-some show/19-country run that started in early January and will end in early 2017. It\u2019s about 40 shows fewer than I wanted but I\u2019m grateful for what I got.<br></p> <p>On my way out of the airport, I was met by a few people who wanted me to sign things and take photos with them. I always forget that most of the time, no matter where I land, they will be there. I comply with their requests but for some reason, I become almost unable to speak. I think it\u2019s the strangeness of it that causes me to become so wooden. They must think I am trying to affect some kind of distant cool. It\u2019s social paralysis. I\u2019ve had it all my life.</p> <p>On tour, I am allowed the chance to go on a stage \u2013 almost completely grotesque when you think about it \u2013 and try to make what I say mean as much to the audience as it does to me. Every performance is an effort to fend off tragedy, to obliterate despair. I go to it with grim seriousness. The objective is the same but every night is different. It is only when I am out here in the world that I feel alive. When I am off the road in Los Angeles, I feel like I\u2019m in storage, a piece of fruit, inert, suspended in a can of syrup in complete darkness. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"895d4890ff8be607cbabcde391386e70343facbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/895d4890ff8be607cbabcde391386e70343facbd/817_0_1170_1813/645.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It is only when I am out here in the world that I feel alive\u2019 \u2026 Rollins onstage.\" width=\"645\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It is only when I am out here in the world that I feel alive\u2019 \u2026 Rollins onstage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas M Jackson/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is something completely unique about going to the same stage every night.

That is the most appealing part of the fringe for me. </p> <p><strong>9.05pm, 13 August. </strong><strong>Gothenburg, Sweden</strong><strong>.</strong></p> <p>In a small house behind the stage at the <a href=\"http://www.wayoutwest.se/\">Way Out West festival</a>. I will be on at 10pm. It has been raining all day but people are hanging in there. </p> <p>Festivals are much more than just a bunch of people showing up to see some acts. The festival is a chance for people to be \u201cculturalised\u201d, to be among others who they might have something in common with. Every festival is a blow to brutality, ignorance and mediocrity. I know that sounds a bit high-minded but I truly believe this. Every now and then, people should be in situations where they have the opportunity to hit their distortion pedal among others who are doing the same. Festivals are perfect for this.

  "<p>After being detained for 50 days, World Vision\u2019s operations manager in the Gaza Strip, Mohammad Halabi, has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/04/israel-world-visions-gaza-director-diverting-cash-hamas-mohammed-el-halabi\">charged by the Israeli authorities</a> with channelling millions of dollars of charitable funds to Hamas. Some will argue that this as an example of civil society organisations (CSOs) being vulnerable to corruption and political capture. But I see it as yet another example of states cracking down on civic space.</p> <p>In this case, World Vision says they <a href=\"http://www.wvi.org/jerusalem-west-bank-gaza/pressrelease/statement-world-vision-staff-arrest\">are yet to see any evidence</a> of Halabi\u2019s alleged wrongdoing and <a href=\"https://stream.org/world-vision-huge-gap-israeli-charges-actual-budget/\">have pointed out discrepancies</a> between the amount of funds he is accused of channeling to Hamas and the charity\u2019s actual budget year on year. More generally, I have seen first-hand through initiatives like the <a href=\"http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/\">INGO Accountability Charter</a> the effort that organisations like World Vision take to demonstrate their accountability. The <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/04/the-efficiency-trap-of-global\">evidence suggests</a> that INGOs spend nearly 80% more to track their finances and employ nearly twice as many finance staff as comparable for-profit multinationals. One could argue that the accountability burden is too high. </p> <p> Even more troubling are the <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/christian-charity-top-israel-target-list-160809083841824.html\">systematic efforts</a> by Israeli authorities to intimidate and undermine civil society. Halabi\u2019s arrest \u2013 and another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/israel-second-palestinian-undp-aid-official-gaza-charged-assisting-hamas\">arrest of a UN development programme staff member</a> on similar charges \u2013 comes against a backdrop of ongoing intimidation by the Israeli state of international NGOs and UN agencies working in Palestine. In July this year, the Israeli parliament (the Knesset) passed a so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/11/israel-some-ngos-are-seen-as-the-enemy-from-the-inside\">transparency law</a> restricting the activities of all CSOs that receive more than 50% of their funding from international sources. Many see the law, which largely affects organisations most likely to be vocal critics of the Israeli government, as a blatant attempt to target CSOs uncovering human rights violations committed by the authorities. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/11/israel-some-ngos-are-seen-as-the-enemy-from-the-inside\">Israel: 'Some NGOs are seen as the enemy from the inside'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This, along with other wide-ranging strategies employed by the Israeli state to de-legitimise and discredit NGOs as the enemy within, forms part of a much wider global pattern. Last year, my colleagues at <a href=\"http://www.civicus.org/index.php/en/\">CIVICUS</a> recorded <a href=\"http://www.civicus.org/images/documents/SOCS2016/summaries/State-of-Civil-Society-Report-2016_Exec-Summary.pdf\">serious violations of civic space in 109 countries</a>. Those organisations and activists working to question the power of political and economic elites, to expose poor governance or to advocate for the rights of excluded groups, are facing the most severe restrictions. Whether under the guise of combatting terrorism, protecting state secrets, or tackling suspicious foreign interference in their country, governments are employing a range of dubious measures to limit free speech, association and assembly. </p> <p>The result is that even those NGOs claiming to offer impartial humanitarian aid, like World Vision, that work in highly politicised environments \u2013 and there can be few more highly-charged than Israel \u2013 now find themselves treading the finest of lines. </p> <p>I have no idea whether Mohammad Halabi is innocent or guilty as charged, and of course, the Israeli government has the right to hold to account any individual or organisation found guilty of corruption. What I do know is that this is about more than one person. His story forms part of a much more complex ongoing narrative, in which civil society activists are routinely being cast as terrorists, traitors, foreign puppets or members of a disconnected elite. Until we begin to sit up and take notice of this narrative, until we start to fight back in defence of our rights, the increasingly forceful suppression of civil society around the world is only going to get worse. </p> <ul> <li><em>Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah is the secretary general and CEO of CIVICUS</em></li> </ul> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

It saw the city demarcate some 60 blocks of Manhattan\u2019s oldest neighbourhood as part of an urban geographical experiment meant to alter the often-fractious dynamic between motorists and pedestrians that is the unwritten law of the concrete jungle. </p> <p>Police officers stood with signs announcing <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/summerstreets/html/sharedstreets/shared-streets.shtml\">Shared Streets</a> at various checkpoints along the border of the Financial District, east to west from Broadway to Water Street, and north to south from the Brooklyn Bridge to the Battery.</p> <p>Within that area, pedestrians were encouraged to treat the roads like pavements, and cars were told to keep their speeds at 5mph or below. Mixed in along the way were city-sponsored garden games, outdoor vendor booths at various locations, and recommended city tours.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"29098895a417468bcd890a037ff1107329e0dd15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29098895a417468bcd890a037ff1107329e0dd15/0_4_668_812/411.jpg\" alt=\"Shared Streets New York map\" width=\"411\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 60 Shared Streets blocks</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shared Streets</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Officials with the New York City Department of Transportation based the event in part on recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/sep/27/all-blue-skies-in-paris-as-city-centre-goes-car-free-for-first-time\">car-free days held in Paris</a> and Bogot\u00e1, as well as the most recent Earth Day when New York restricted car use in three Manhattan neighbourhoods and encouraged citizens to ditch driving.</p> <p>The initiative played heavily on the Financial District\u2019s history and urban geography. In front of small crowd of assembled onlookers in front of the historic Fraunces Tavern and accompanied by a fife-and-drum quartet decked out in full colonial regalia, city officials ushered in the event with a brief set of remarks.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the first time that we think something of this scale and size certainly has been done in New York or any other American city,\u201d said New York City Department of Transportation commissioner, Polly Trottenberg, announcing the event.</p> <p>\u201cOur streets are for everyone,\u201d said public advocate Letitia James. \u201cAnd before there were cars we were all cyclists and pedestrians, commuters and explorers, in this infinitely marvellous city. And today we try to return to that period.\u201d</p> <p>Hamburg, Helsinki, Madrid and Oslo have also recently pushed for sizeable car-free zones in their city centres. </p> <p>Advocates argue that restricting car usage in cities is not only important in the broader fight to curb carbon emissions and greenhouses gases, but as an important mechanism to take the load off overstretched public transport systems.</p> <p>New York is particularly at risk on that front, with its subway systems adversely impacted by record usage rates, desperately needed infrastructure updates, and the looming close of the L Train from Brooklyn to Manhattan, which will impact the commutes of thousands of New Yorkers. </p> <p>Judging by the results of Saturday\u2019s event, it\u2019s an idea that is likely to find many supporters, but whose specific scheme is likely to be an evolving process of in terms of how the city tries embrace car-free solutions. </p> <p>For those expecting a replay of Times Square, which has been blocked off for cars since 2009, there was little similarity to that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/01/new-york-taskforce-topless-times-square-performers\">bastion of tourist-inundated cacophony</a>, which has been praised by advocates for its embrace of pedestrianism, but criticised by others, including mayor Bill de Blasio, for its carnival atmosphere. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"acb0e9987a32854aa3a8296ee235d3e522bee34d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acb0e9987a32854aa3a8296ee235d3e522bee34d/0_34_5315_3189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Times Square has been blocked to cars since 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Times Square has been blocked to cars since 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Siegfried Layda/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For one, there were fewer people at Shared Streets, a fact the might be partially explained by the weather, as the heat index exceeded 100 degrees.</p> <p>But the streets were far from empty.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s really cool to have time where you can just be on a bike and not worry about cars,\u201d said Eve Wool, a city resident who works for a mental health initiative. \u201cEven if it\u2019s just for the whole idea that a lot of folks who bike in New York City I feel like are always so cramped.\u201d</p> <p>But she also said the she didn\u2019t know if the new initiative would be totally utilised. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how many people know about Shared Streets, it\u2019s newer so it\u2019s still gaining popularity,\u201d she added, after saying she was more aware of the related Citi Summer Streets initiative.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/summerstreets/html/home/home.shtml\">Citi Summer Streets</a>, which is happening on three consecutive Saturdays in August, is the hugely popular event that the city first began nine years ago.

According to the independent Turkish press organisation Bianet, <a href=\"http://bianet.org/english/women/172165-men-kill-over-284-women-in-2015\">284 women were killed in Turkey</a> in 2015. In 77% of cases, the murderer was the victim\u2019s husband or partner, or a male relative. At least 133 women were raped, and 42% of the victims were under the age of 18.</p> <p>\u201cCrimes related to sex offending have much more to do with power and domination than with sex and the sexual drive of the offender. And there are many different ways of physical and psychological abuse,\u201d Kaptan said.</p> <p>Chemical castration involves the administration of libido-reducing drugs and, unlike physical castration, the effects are reversible. However, health experts have pointed out that the long-term use of some drugs used in chemical castration may lead to serious and permanent side-effects, including an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. </p> <p>Turkey joins a small group of countries that have legalised the punishment, including most recently Indonesia, as well as Poland, Russia and some states in the US. Germany, France, Sweden and Denmark have introduced voluntary use of the measure. According to research from Scandinavia, reoffending rates have dropped from 40% to between zero and 5%. </p> <p>However, the new Turkish law does not seek the consent of the offender. Instead, the decision to administer treatment will be made by a court. An offender risks greater punishment should he fail to continue the treatment.</p> <p>Kaptan argued that mandatory chemical castration was an inhumane punishment comparable to the death penalty.</p> <p>\u201cViolence will create only more violence. In that sense it should be talked about in the same way as we talk about the death penalty,\u201d she said. \u201cWe oppose all corporal punishment, because it violates the bodily integrity and the human rights of a person.\u201d</p> <p>The controversial move came during Turkey\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/20/erdogan-bans-academics-from-travel-holds-first-post-coup-security-meeting-ankara-turkey\"> three-month state of emergency</a>, which allows the government to bypass parliament and pass laws and regulations virtually unopposed.

Sexuality and male-female relationships in Turkey are not healthy.\u201d</p> <p>Referring to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s 2014 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/24/turkeys-president-recep-tayyip-erdogan-women-not-equal-men\">comments that men and women could not be equal</a> because such a notion would \u201cgo against the laws of nature\u201d, Ar\u0131n asked: \u201cIf the government propagates such views, how are things supposed to change for the better?\u201d</p> <p>Both Kaptan and Ar\u0131n underlined that Turkey\u2019s existing laws were sufficient to deal with violence against women. In 2012, after the government enacted <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/turkey-parliament-adopts-law-on-prevention-of-domestic-violence/\">new legislation to prevent domestic violence</a>, Turkey became the first country <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://europa.eu/epic/news/2012/20121010_convention_on_preventing_and_combating_violence_against_women_and_domestic_violence_en.htm\">to ratify a Council of Europe treaty on violence against women</a>, and the AKP government has promised to intensify its fight against rape and sexual assault.</p> <p>But so far, little has changed. Women\u2019s rights groups point out that legal measures have repeatedly fallen short, and that convicted sex offenders and those guilty of abuse and violence against women still benefit from courts reducing sentences for \u201cgood behaviour\u201d, encouraging the public to see their offences as trivial. Ar\u0131n also said that women who flagged up potential offenders to the police often did not receive the necessary protection.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be enough if the police and the courts would do their jobs properly,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cThe existing legislation would be enough to deal with offenders, but these laws are often simply not being applied.\u201d </p> <p>There have not yet been any convictions on the basis of the new regulation, but Kaptan feared that once it happens, women will again be the ones to suffer.</p> <p>\u201cWe fear that the victims will be blamed as being responsible for such an \u201cattempt\u201d on masculinity. Instead of bringing a solution, this new law will only further increase violence against women.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Swimming in the river Waveney on a sunny afternoon last weekend, it was difficult not to think of my good friend and neighbour Roger Deakin who died 10 years ago next Friday.</p> <p>Roger was an unusual man \u2013 wild, strong, uncompromising in the way he lived his life, with a sharp curiosity about nature and people. He was terrific, funny company and a loyal friend. With his first book, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/waterlog-2.html\"><em>Waterlog</em></a>, subtitled \u201cA swimmer\u2019s journey through Britain\u201d, he found the perfect form for his view of the world: clear-eyed; subversive; informed; full of a sense of wonder but with a tug of melancholy beneath the surface of the prose.</p> <p>The book\u2019s originality and charm found many readers, and Roger, who was never a vain man, reacted to its success with startled pleasure, rather as if an otter had made a surprise appearance at his moat.</p> <p>It seemed that a great, late-blooming literary career lay ahead of him, but he died from a brain tumour before his second book, <em>Wildwood</em>, was published. A book based on his notebooks, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/notes-from-walnut-tree-farm.html\"><em>Notes from Walnut Tree Farm</em></a>, was brought out in 2008.</p> <p>Soon after his death, it became clear that it was not just Roger\u2019s writing that appealed to readers across the world; it was his character, his attitude to the environment, the way he lived, what he was thought to represent.</p> <p>Essays and editorials were published in praise of him. He was said to be a pioneer of something called \u201cnew nature writing\u201d. A one-man play about him was written. There was talk of a book \u2013 \u201cnot so much a biography as a celebration\u201d.</p> <p>Then there was the backlash. There have been brutally funny parodies of the style of writing Roger is thought to have influenced. New nature has been dismissed as a marketing wheeze.</p> <p>Maybe this grim process of chatter and myth-making is inevitable when a distinctive writer dies before his or her time. It must have happened with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/sylviaplath\">Plath</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/bruce-chatwin\">Chatwin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/david-foster-wallace\">Foster Wallace</a> and others. But the effect it has is to smooth off the interesting rough corners of a life, replacing a real, complicated person with a shiny icon. It is my small personal wish that Roger\u2019s books will be read by even more people over the next decade, but without the attendant noise and silliness of literary celebrity.</p>",
  "<p>While most people accept the reality of human-caused global warming, we tend not to view it as an urgent issue or high priority. That lack of immediate concern may in part stem from a lack of understanding that today\u2019s pollution will heat the planet for centuries to come, as explained in this <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/making-sense-climate-science-denial-uqx-denial101x-1\">Denial101x</a> lecture:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R4YavfQ7jk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8R4YavfQ7jk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Denial101x carbon cycle lecture by Gavin Cawley.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>So far humans have caused about 1\u00b0C warming of global surface temperatures, but if we were to freeze the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide at today\u2019s levels, the planet would continue warming. Over the coming decades, we\u2019d see about another 0.5\u00b0C warming, largely due to what\u2019s called the <a href=\"https://ourchangingclimate.wordpress.com/2016/08/09/climate-inertia/\">\u201cthermal inertia\u201d of the oceans</a> (think of the long amount of time it takes to boil a kettle of water). The Earth\u2019s surface <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/hansen-and-sato-2012-climate-sensitivity.html\">would keep warming about another 1.5\u00b0C over the ensuing centuries</a> as ice continued to melt, decreasing the planet\u2019s reflectivity.</p> <p>To put this in context, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/dec/14/the-paris-agreement-signals-that-deniers-have-lost-the-climate-wars\">the international community agreed</a> in last year\u2019s Paris climate accords that we should limit climate change risks by keeping global warming below 2\u00b0C, and preferably closer to 1.5\u00b0C. Yet from the carbon pollution we\u2019ve already put into the atmosphere, we\u2019re committed to 1.5\u20133\u00b0C warming over the coming decades and centuries, and we continue to pump out over 30 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year.</p> <h2><strong>The importance of reaching zero or negative emissions</strong></h2> <p>We can solve this problem if, rather than holding the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide steady, it falls over time. As discussed in the above video, Earth naturally absorbs more carbon than it releases, so if we reduce human emissions to zero, the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide will slowly decline. Humans can also help the process by finding ways to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-capture-and-storage\">pull carbon out of the atmosphere and sequester it</a>. </p> <p>Scientists are researching various technologies to accomplish this, but we\u2019ve already put over 500 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Pulling a significant amount of that carbon out of the atmosphere and storing it safely will be a tremendous challenge, and we won\u2019t be able to reduce the amount in the atmosphere until we first get our emissions close to zero.</p> <p>There are an infinite number of potential carbon emissions pathways, but the 2014 IPCC report considered four possible paths that they called RCPs. In one of these (called RCP 2.6 or RCP3-PD), we take immediate, aggressive, global action to cut carbon pollution, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels peak at 443 ppm in 2050, and by 2100 they\u2019ve fallen back down to today\u2019s level of 400 ppm. In two others (RCPs 4.5 and 6.0) we act more slowly, and atmospheric levels don\u2019t peak until the year 2150, then they remain steady, and in the last (RCP8.5) carbon dioxide levels keep rising until 2250.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0dc4f6dcf39736cdc4a8b60ad863f34fba3ec131\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dc4f6dcf39736cdc4a8b60ad863f34fba3ec131/0_0_677_461/500.jpg\" alt=\"Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels in the four IPCC RCP scenarios.\" width=\"500\" height=\"340\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels in the four IPCC RCP scenarios.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Dana Nuccitelli</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the figure below shows, in the first scenario, global warming peaks at 2\u00b0C and then temperatures start to fall toward the 1.5\u00b0C level, meeting our Paris climate targets.

  "<p>Most of the world will have air conditioning in their homes, workplaces and cars within 20 years, requiring thousands of power stations to be built and potentially accelerating climate change, energy experts say.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.climatecentral.org/news/first-half-of-2016-record-hot-by-far-20540\">temperatures shatter records </a>worldwide in 2016 and Britain anticipates its second heatwave of the summer, demand for the technology is exploding.</p> <p>\u201cGlobally, 2016 is poised to be another record-breaking year for temperatures. This means more air conditioning. Much more. It is becoming an air-conditioned world,\u201d says Lucas Davis, an energy economist at the University of California in Berkeley.</p> <p>\u201cThe growth in air conditioning has been staggering. China is the sweet spot. The number of households that have it has doubled in five years. Every year, 60 million more units are being sold there, eight times as many as are sold annually in the United States.\u201d</p> <p>As large developing countries such as India, Mexico, Indonesia and Brazil grow richer, staying cool may come to be seen as a necessity and not a luxury, leading to severe energy shortages and major environmental stress, says Davis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a62a621df37506eacba79c949db77e9899d4a14b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a62a621df37506eacba79c949db77e9899d4a14b/0_181_3684_2210/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People relax in the sunshine in St James\u2019s park in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People relax in the sunshine in St James\u2019s park in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAir conditioning is wonderful. As people are coming out of poverty, they buy a TV, then a fridge, then a car and air conditioning. There are a lot of hot places where people are getting richer. As average temperatures increase, the reach of air conditioning will be extended, even to the relatively cool areas of the world where saturation is currently low,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But Davis, who expects nearly all households in warm countries to have air conditioning within 20 to 30 years, warns that the extra energy needed will be dramatic and could have huge consequences for global warming. \u201cWe are talking about hundreds of new power stations having to be built in China alone over the next 20 or 30 years,\u201d he says.</p> <p>His research is backed by the US government\u2019s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where researchers have calculated that 700 million air-conditioning units are likely to be installed worldwide by 2030 and 1.6 billion by 2050.

In addition, she says, better insulation in new buildings traps heat and it is too noisy in cities to have windows open: \u201cThe way we live now increases the need for air conditioning.\u201d</p> <p>Cooling systems may already account for about 10% of total electricity consumption in the UK , says the UK Building Research Establishment. It estimates that 65% of UK office space and 30% of UK retail space was air conditioned in 2012.</p> <p>The UN\u2019s climate change body, the IPCC, has projected that global air-conditioning energy demand will grow 33-fold from 300 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2000 to more than 10,000TWh in 2100, with most of the growth coming in developing economies.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are talking about hundreds of new power stations having to be built in China alone over the next 20 or 30 years</p> <footer> <cite>Lucas Davis, energy economist</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201c10,000TWh is roughly half the total electricity generated worldwide in 2010,\u201d says Martin Freer, director of Birmingham university\u2019s Energy Institute. In a recent report, which he co-authored, Freer says: \u201cWorldwide energy demand for space cooling will overtake space heating by 2060, and outstrip it by 60% at the end of the century, as cooling demand in the developing countries of the global south grows faster than heating demand in the developed northern economies.\u201d</p> <p>But in a world already warming because of fossil fuel emissions from oil, gas and coal, demand for air conditioning and refrigeration is seen as one of the greatest accelerants of climate change.</p> <p>\u201cIf nothing is done, within 15 years cooling will require an additional 139 GW \u2013 more than the generating capacity of Canada \u2013 and raise greenhouse gas emissions by over 1.5 billion tonnes of CO2 per year, three times the current energy emissions of Britain,\u201d says Freer.</p> <p>Concern is also mounting over a class of chemicals widely used in refrigerants and air-conditioning units. Hydrofluorocarbons, which have largely replaced CFCs, which were found to damage the ozone layer, are potent greenhouse gases. Although they are far less significant today than CO2 for global warming, if the numbers of refrigeration and air-conditioning units explode as expected, they could add to the problem.</p> <p>\u201cThe data is poor, but one estimate suggests that refrigeration and air conditioning cause 10% of global CO2 emissions \u2013 three times more than is attributed to aviation and shipping combined, through energy consumption and leaks of HFC refrigerants that are themselves highly potent greenhouse gases,\u201d says Freer.</p> <p>\u201cAs climate change increases outdoor temperatures, air conditioning will more often be used to maintain comfortable indoor conditions. Climate change is expected to stimulate installation of air conditioning in some buildings that would otherwise not need air conditioning.\u201d</p> <p>Policymakers from across the world met recently in Vienna to agree to phase out HFCs but some countries are nervous about the extra cost of changing to alternative refrigerants. Researchers in India have estimated it could cost the country tens of billions of dollars.</p>",
  "<p>Leading press freedom groups have sent a letter to foreign secretary Boris Johnson raising concerns about the human rights record of Bahrain\u2019s ambassador to the UK.</p> <p>They urge Johnson to take up the matter with the ambassador, Sheikh Fawaz bin Mohammad Al-Khalifa, a member of Bahrain\u2019s royal family.</p> <p>He was formerly president of Bahrain\u2019s information affairs authority (IAA), the state\u2019s media regulator and operator of Bahrain TV and the state\u2019s news agency. It also issues licences to journalists.</p> <p>The letter argues that while he was chief of the IAA presidency during the Arab Spring period, between 2010-12, Fawaz used his power to restrict press freedom. At the same time, the Bahraini government \u201csystematically cracked down on political and civil freedoms.\u201d</p> <p>It points to the IAA\u2019s suspension in April 2011 of Al Wasat, the country\u2019s only independent newspaper, and the authority\u2019s involvement in the detention of an Iraqi journalist<a href=\"http://www.bici.org.bh/BICIreportEN.pdf\"> who was beaten and deported</a>.</p> <p>The letter - signed by Reporters Without Borders (RSB), Index on Censorship and the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) - also highlights the case of Nazeeha Saeed, a Bahraini journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/jul/18/bahrain-prosecutes-journalist-in-renewed-crackdown-on-the-media\">who was prosecuted for \u201cillegal reporting\u201d after her licence renewal was refused</a>.</p> <p>She cannot leave Bahrain because she is subject to a travel ban. For 12 years, she worked as a foreign correspondent for French news agencies, plus France24 and Radio Monte Carlo Doualiya. Fawaz\u2019s embassy, says the letter, has publicly supported her prosecution and it accuses Fawaz of acting against her interests.</p> <p>The letter says of Fawaz: \u201cHis continued public attempts to mislead on the cases of journalists like Ms Saeed are indications that neither he, nor the country he represents, share the key British values of the right to free speech and individual liberty... </p> <p>\u201cThe kingdom of Bahrain\u2019s choice of a person with a key role in repressing freedom of speech as their ambassador to the United Kingdom reflects Bahrain\u2019s unchanged, poor attitudes towards freedom of speech and human rights more generally.\u201d</p> <p>It urges Johnson to \u201craise these issues surrounding Sheikh Fawaz\u2019s past and current involvement in the violations of press freedom with the government of Bahrain.\u201d</p> <p>The letter cites Bahrain\u2019s fall in RSB\u2019s press freedom index ranking during Fawaz\u2019s IAA presidency. In 2009, the year before he took over, it was 119th. By the time he left, in 2012, it was 165th.<br></p> <p>When Fawaz presented his ambassadorial credentials to the Queen in December 2015 he spoke of <a href=\"http://www.mofa.gov.bh/Default.aspx?tabid=3182&amp;ItemId=5762\">the shared commitment of the two governments in fighting the global scourge of terrorism</a>. </p> <p>Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, BIRD\u2019s director of advocacy, said: \u201cThe role of this ambassador in actively repressing free journalists and media... must be investigated... If the UK is serious about supporting free press globally, they must address this with their ally, Bahrain.\u201d</p> <p><em>Updated at 5.30pm:</em> The Bahraini embassy issued a statement at 5pm in which it said that the letter sent by the press freedom groups was \u201clittered with clear fabrications, inaccuracies and innuendo.\u201d</p> <p>It stated: \u201cThe claim that Sheikh Fawaz bin Mohamed Al-Khalifa, as the president of the IAA, was involved in abusing a journalist is ludicrous.\u201d</p> <p>The newspaper Al Wasat \u201cwas indeed suspended in 2011, for a single day, following allegations it had attempted to mislead readers by passing off unrelated local footage as current local events - a point the paper\u2019s own board accepted.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe case of Nazeeha Saeed - which appears to have resulted from her own failure to renew the appropriate credentials as a foreign correspondent - is very recent, and well after the time that the ambassador was at the IAA.\u201d</p> <p>The embassy\u2019s response continued: \u201cWhat is clear, however, is that the IAA never attempted to \u2018crack down\u2019 on media freedoms. Indeed, Bahrain\u2019s government is committed to a diverse and vibrant media sector in which all parts of society can make their voice heard, even in the face of the current international challenges, and efforts by certain regional actors to stoke sectarian tensions.\u201d</p> <p>And it concluded: \u201cBahrain\u2019s commitment to media freedom is fully consistent with the values we share with the United Kingdom, and indeed with the ambassador\u2019s own views on the issue... During the ambassador\u2019s time at the IAA he actually abolished the department responsible for media censorship.\u201d</p>",

But when my results came through, they weren\u2019t quite up to scratch. I had a B in psychology, a C in English literature and a D in history, and I needed the equivalent points to two Bs and a C. So I rang the university straight away and asked what my options were. They said I could have a place to study psychology and educational studies. </p> <p>I could have asked if they had another combination that I was actually interested in \u2013 such as psychology and sociology \u2013 as I really didn\u2019t want to do educational studies. But it had been very hard to get through and I felt that their attitude was: \u201cHere\u2019s the offer, tough luck.\u201d So I didn\u2019t ask \u2013 I took the hard route and rejected the offer.</p> <p>After that, I curled up on the sofa with a blanket for a while. I felt like I needed to process everything. I did feel really stressed, but I shook it off and started researching on the internet. I used found out which universities had psychology places, and the University of Northampton popped up.</p> <p>I rang the university straight away to see if they still had places. I didn\u2019t have any questions about the course as the information was all online, and I was familiar with the area, as it\u2019s near where I lived, in Corby. They asked me what my grades were, then said I had a place to study psychology. I was expecting to be asked a bit more, so I was surprised at how quick the process was. I was ready to sell myself, but I didn\u2019t need to. </p> <p>It\u2019s turned out to be a really good move for me. It\u2019s nearer my parents\u2019 home, which I like, as it turns out that I do get quite homesick. I\u2019m really happy with the course and all my lecturers. I\u2019m also getting above-average grades on the work I\u2019ve done so far.</p> <p>At the time, I felt a lot of shame at being in Clearing. I worked so hard at my A-levels and it was hard to deal with the fact that I hadn\u2019t got the grades and I couldn\u2019t go where I wanted. But now I know there\u2019s no shame in it at all.

But things could have easily been so different for Okoro, who is from north London. In the summer of 2012 she received her A-level results and was devastated \u2013 she had missed the grades she needed to get into her universities of choice. <br></p> <p>\u201cI really felt like it was the end of the world. I just sat down and cried. My older brother, who had got a basketball scholarship to go to university in Loughborough, decided to look at Clearing for me, as he could see how upset I was. He started calling universities that he knew were near Loughborough. </p> <p>\u201cI had completely given up and thought I would never get to go to university. When my brother called DMU, they said they would give me a phone interview \u2013 and I got in. I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p> <p>Okoro, who had never set foot in Leicester, let alone on the campus, before moving there, now believes it was the best thing that ever happened to her. \u201cI had been so distraught, then there was this comeback and I had to grab the opportunity. I really feel I was meant to go to De Montfort and I\u2019m over the moon that I came here because of the opportunities I\u2019ve been given.\u201d</p> <p>She was diagnosed with dyslexia while at DMU, something she had gone all the way through school not realising she had. The university also supported her entrepreneurial side. Okoro\u2019s business, BeScience Stem, gives people in the community a fun and engaging look into science, technology, engineering and mathematics, through innovative workshops delivered in public places, such as shopping centres and libraries, by volunteers who are passionate about the subjects. </p> <p>\u201cDMU really supports entrepreneurs and uniqueness and innovation, so I feel like coming to university here helped cultivate that side of me. And I really like Leicester \u2013 it\u2019s a friendly city.\u201d</p> <p>Asked what her advice would be for any students who find themselves facing a similar predicament, she is positive: \u201cGoing through Clearing is not the end of the world.

Talking to my teachers was the most valuable thing I did that day. Not only were they able to reassure me I had actually done very well in my A-levels (ABB), but they were also able to advise me which universities to look at during Clearing.

  "<p>It took hundreds of skilled negotiators, dozens of videoconferences and seemingly endless days in Brussels to produce the 1,600-page text. Some seven years after Canada and the EU began negotiating a trade deal, the future of the agreement remains shrouded in doubt.<br></p> <p>But that hasn\u2019t stopped the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, or Ceta, as Canada\u2019s deal with the EU is known, from being held up as the preferred model for Britain to follow in the wake of the Brexit vote.</p> <p>David Davis, the new minister for Brexit, has called it the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/14/global-bilateral-trade-deals-bigger-eu-single-market-david-davis\">\u201cperfect starting point for our discussions with the commission\u201d</a>.

They point to the years of complex negotiations demanded by the deal and the persistent uncertainty that continues to dog its implementation \u2013 and they question whether the agreement\u2019s framework is far-reaching enough to allow the UK to replicate its current level of access to the single market. </p> <p>\u201cHow they think Ceta is the panacea, I\u2019m confused,\u201d said one senior Canadian government official who was deeply involved with the negotiations. \u201cWe still don\u2019t get complete access to the EU market the way the Brits currently have as a member state. So I don\u2019t understand this looking towards Ceta as the answer to Brexit when they will be taking a 43-year step backwards in terms of the current access they have to the European Union.\u201d </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/ceta-aecg/index.aspx?lang=eng\">The agreement</a> \u2013 which has yet to be ratified \u2013 promises that around 98.6% of goods traded between Canada and the EU will be free of duty, paves the way for access to public procurement between the two markets and empowers regulatory bodies to accept the standards and tests carried out in each other\u2019s jurisdictions. The trade deal doesn\u2019t heighten access to sensitive agricultural products such as eggs or poultry and keeps quotas \u2013 albeit boosting them \u2013 in place for tariff-free imports of products such as beef and cheese. While the trade deal aims to liberalise services, hundreds of exceptions are listed. </p> <p>Under Ceta, Canada will have no hand in setting EU regulations or formulating product standards and no access to the banking passport system that would have allowed its banks and financial services to trade freely. The freedom of movement clauses are primarily focused on businesspeople. </p> <p>Negotiations between Canada and the EU dragged on for years, despite early expectations that they would be completed by 2012. The extended timeline was a reflection of the sheer complexity of the issues being addressed and helped produce a document described by Canada\u2019s trade minister as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/15/uk-canada-advice-post-brexit-trade-deals-eu-ceta\">a \u201cgold standard\u201d deal with the EU.</a> </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised we pulled it off,\u201d said the government source, crediting the political will that came from both sides.</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether the same spirit of collaboration will colour negotiations between the UK and the EU. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know how it can be exactly replicated,\u201d said Sylvain Charlebois, a professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax. \u201cGains are going to be different, stakes are going to be different. And therefore the deal has to be different.\u201d </p> <p>Some of this lies in the scale of Canada\u2019s trade with the EU. Canada\u2019s largest trading partner is the United States, accounting for more than 60% of its total global trade in 2014. The EU is Canada\u2019s second trading partner, representing around 10% of its external trade. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6a53103e820631699af2f0422dc38273bc9fc52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6a53103e820631699af2f0422dc38273bc9fc52/0_68_3894_2337/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters in Hannover at a march against the TTIP and CETA free trade agreements on the eve of a visit by Barack Obama\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters at a march against the TTIP and CETA free trade agreements on the eve of a visit by Barack Obama in Hannover</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In contrast, the EU is the UK\u2019s biggest trading partner, <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/international-transactions/outward-foreign-affiliates-statistics/how-important-is-the-european-union-to-uk-trade-and-investment-/sty-eu.html\">accounting for 45% of UK exports of goods and services</a> in 2014 and 53% of imports. As Pierre Pettigrew, a former trade minister for Canada, <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/thunderer/article4719293.ece\">wrote in March in the Times</a>: \u201cIt is fatuous to think there is a real comparison between Canada\u2019s relationship with the EU and the UK\u2019s with the bloc. Indeed, were Canada to trade as much with the EU as we do with the US we would want a much deeper relationship than Ceta.\u201d</p> <p>Pettigrew pointed to the seven years of negotiation that went into Canada\u2019s deal. \u201cWhen you can rely on trade with the world\u2019s largest economy, as is the case for Canada, you can afford the luxury of time. That will not be the UK\u2019s position.\u201d He estimated it could take up to 10 years for the UK and EU to reach agreements on various arrangements. </p> <p>The time would likely be spent attempting to reach compromises on the many areas not covered or minimised by Ceta. Canadian exports to the UK and EU are dominated by gold, precious stones and other metals \u2013 all products that aren\u2019t produced in large quantities in Europe, Fredrik Erixon of the European Centre for International Political Economy <a href=\"http://capx.co/the-canada-eu-trade-deal-is-no-model-for-brexit/\">noted in a recent article on Ceta</a>. \u201cFor the UK, whose trade with the EU are in sectors highly exposed to regulatory protection (finance, nuclear power equipment, pharmaceuticals, et cetera) it would lead to a serious loss of market access and commercial integration,\u201d he wrote. </p> <p>The task of reaching a compromise within these sectors would fall to the UK\u2019s team of negotiators \u2013 many of whom have yet to be hired. The UK government has said it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/08/business-minister-sajid-javid-opens-preliminary-trade-talks-with-india\">plans to hire up to 300 people</a> after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/28/uk-lacks-expertise-for-trade-talks-with-europe-says-top-civil-servant\">an initial government review</a> turned up just 20 \u201cactive hands-on\u201d trade negotiators.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I honestly don\u2019t know how it can be exactly replicated</p> <footer> <cite>Sylvain Charlebois, a professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These negotiators will also have to decide whether to push forward with some of Ceta\u2019s more thorny clauses, such as that which allows corporations to launch legal challenges against governments perceived to block them. \u201cThat\u2019s a real threat,\u201d said Andreas Schotter, a professor at Western University\u2019s Ivey School of Business in southern Ontario. \u201cThat\u2019s what the person in the street doesn\u2019t understand, that with the legislation that is behind these trade deals, corporations become powerful enough to sue governments.\u201d</p> <p>The clause could leave the UK fending off the same sort of challenge to its sovereignty that many in the Leave camp had hoped to avoid by leaving the EU, he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to have German corporations start suing the UK government for not giving access to certain areas in the market or not giving certain incentives or certain aids.\u201d </p> <p>Ironically, the same voices which laud Ceta as a model to be followed have helped cast doubt on when \u2013 and whether \u2013 the trade deal between Canada and the EU will come into force. Recently, the European Commission backed away from a plan that would have sped up the adoption of the deal, saying it would instead send the text to the EU\u2019s 28 national parliaments, as well as some regional parliaments, to be ratified. </p> <p>The Canadian government hopes to have the agreement in force by early 2017, said Greg Tereposky of Borden Ladner Gervais, a law firm that represented various private sector companies during the negotiations. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible \u2026 We don\u2019t know how the UK will fit into this puzzle, ultimately.\u201d </p> <p>He pointed to the annual quota set for tariff-free cheese laid out in the trade deal, rising to 18,000 tonnes over a period of six years. \u201cClearly some of that should be allocated to British blue cheese. The question is, how do you divide that?\u201d </p> <p>Discussions such as these will probably force officials to push back the date of Canada\u2019s trade deal with the EU to the second half of 2017 at the earliest, he said. \u201cThese are very complex and potentially contentious negotiations.\u201d </p>",

Set in the French countryside in 1918, The Childhood of a Leader introduces us to Prescott, an unruly, effeminate nine-year-old boy (Tom Sweet) whose father is an American diplomat (Game of Thrones\u2019s Liam Cunningham) for Woodrow Wilson, working on the Treaty of Versailles. In a perpetual power struggle with his parents and shaped by the political tumult around him, the boy\u2019s troubling behaviour in these early years hints at the dictatorial figure he will later become. B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo plays the boy\u2019s mother, Nymphomaniac\u2019s Stacy Martin his teacher, and Robert Pattinson pops up as an associate of his father. At last year\u2019s Venice film festival it won best debut film and best debut director. Before presenting Corbet an award, director Jonathan Demme told the audience the film brought to mind the work of the young Orson Welles, thanks to its \u201cthrilling and unbridled cinematics\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjYv5U3cOh8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rjYv5U3cOh8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Like Welles, Corbet is also an actor. He doesn\u2019t appear in his own movie but has spent more than a decade acting in films for celebrated auteurs: Michael Haneke (Funny Games), Gregg Araki (Mysterious Skin), Lars von Trier (Melancholia). Corbet, who grew up in Arizona, got into arthouse cinema early and never looked back. \u201cI try to keep my record clean,\u201d he says over coffee in Covent Garden, referring to his rejection of more commercial opportunities. \u201cSince I was young I took pride in my work. I wanted the majority of things I did to reflect my interests.\u201d</p> <p>The Childhood of a Leader was inspired by Margaret MacMillan\u2019s book Paris 1919: Six Months That Changed The World, about the Paris peace conference, which, as Corbet says, set modern fascism in motion. He read it more than a decade ago in the midst of the Iraq conflict and, struck by its contemporary parallels, began writing a story about a young boy\u2019s formative experiences to paint a big picture of political sickness. It was an ambitious project \u2013 a first-time American film-maker directing a European film, starring a child, is a big ask of financiers. But, after encouragement from his wife, film-maker Mona Fastvold, Corbet eventually got funding and shot it for $5m at a chateau in Budapest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e11ba28d1d0d997374e801a59360445f0af37417\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e11ba28d1d0d997374e801a59360445f0af37417/0_35_4940_2963/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left: Liam Cunningham, Tom Sweet, Berenice B\u00e9jo and Robert Pattinson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: Liam Cunningham, Tom Sweet, Berenice B\u00e9jo and Robert Pattinson in The Childhood of a Leader.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/IFC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the film studies the child and his confrontations, it\u2019s not a matter of simple cause and effect, says Corbet. \u201cMy idea was that we would talk about how the era shapes the man, and for the film to occasionally leave the character and look at other hierarchies and abuse of power that exist in tiny ways and tiny gestures. The film is supposed to demonstrate these subtle shifts in the power dynamic depending on someone\u2019s socioeconomic status or position or belief system. It\u2019s really about how the depression of the period created a severity of character.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s unavoidable, he says, that despite writing it years ago, it\u2019s reflective of the times, but he didn\u2019t expect Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty wild, I gotta say,\u201d he responds to the fact that it\u2019s coming out in the midst of Trumpmania. Regardless of whether Trump gets elected, he says, \u201cthe damage is already done. You have so many disenfranchised young, poor people that were just starting to feel like they were about to get a leg up in the world, and then all of a sudden they have this silly showman attacking their communities. It\u2019s devastating.\u201d</p> <p>He lambasts the left-wing media as well as the right for all the Trump image-building, and his views on cinema are just as principled \u2013 Corbet is all but dismissive of mainstream entertainment. If it\u2019s not art, he\u2019s not interested. \u201cIn America, I find it disappointing that a lot of our biggest talents are not devoting their talents to slightly more radical material,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m yearning for people to push the medium forward.\u201d The Childhood of a Leader isn\u2019t one for the multiplexes, but it\u2019s a beautifully studied, arresting couple of hours that feels at times like 1970s Kubrick. Corbet certainly puts his money where his mouth is. Just watch out for that volume.</p> <p>\u2022The Childhood of a Leader is in selected cinemas from 19 August.</p>",

I could even track spending and create a budget for someone whose poor organisation tumbles out of their wallet.</p> <p>I have always been highly organised, even as a child. I heard about organising as a career in a magazine and pursued it, not knowing how to translate my skill set into consulting with clients.

I don\u2019t turn down any jobs, unless the person involved is showing signs of hoarding behaviour; I have no mental health training, so I don\u2019t really feel I can help.</p> <p>I love big jobs when I can transform an entire home or workspace, but that\u2019s a big commitment from a client and they must trust and like you for it to work.</p> <p>Most people outside of the organising industry think we \u201ctidy up\u201d, but tidying is only a visual thing. What a good organiser does is help with the functionality of a space \u2013 for example, making sure that frequently used items are in prime storage areas. Or maybe having a system in place to manage bills that arrive on email. Whatever it is I am helping with, I also want to teach my client how to tackle other areas of their space or life when I\u2019m not there.</p> <p>About 90% of my work is hands on \u2013 going through what is owned, reordering what is kept, and taking away items for charity or recycling. If I had once piece of advice for people it would be that 80% of the items you think you need are only fit for the tip, recycling or donation. Want to save some time? Use the bin, my friend.</p> <p>Sometimes prospective clients break down on the phone before I\u2019ve even met them. They are so overwhelmed with stuff, so overcome with shame at the mess they have created. For them I have nothing but compassion. There are so many factors that can impact a client\u2019s ability to stay on top of things: illness, change in circumstances, relationship troubles, relocation to a new home, poor time management. Most often it\u2019s washing dishes and doing the laundry that people struggle with. I don\u2019t mind mucking in to get a backlog under control, and advise clients of methods to stay in control, particularly getting all members of the household to contribute.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To take an unusable space and make it usable again, or to empower someone to take charge of their life, is satisfying</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Clients often cry with gratitude at my results. I often cry, too. It\u2019s thoroughly rewarding to help people on such a practical and emotional level. To take an unusable space and make it usable again, or to empower someone to take charge of an aspect of their life that is not working for them is incredibly satisfying.</p> <p>I encourage clients to make sound choices about what to do with their overwhelming belongings: the things weighing them down that are not contributing in a positive way. But I\u2019ll never to force them to discard even the smallest item; the choice always needs to be theirs. Some people are very easily lost in the minutiae of their possessions and can\u2019t see the forest for the trees. I bring perspective.</p> <p>What makes my job so satisfying is hearing people\u2019s stories. Am I a voyeur? Perhaps a little, but I have had ample opportunities to read things like personal letters and I\u2019ve always turned my head. Discretion is very important and I have never taken advantage of the trust placed in me.</p> <p>Surprisingly I\u2019ve had very few clients I didn\u2019t warm to, but the rude ones stand out. One in particular springs to mind because she didn\u2019t want to get her hands dirty and sadly you can\u2019t make decisions about the many things in someone\u2019s domain without their input. At times like these I try not to judge. I didn\u2019t know her full story and what caused her discomfort with me trying to help her.</p> <p>On the flipside, a good number of clients have become close friends. I am lucky that I\u2019m able to separate the people I enjoy working for from their sometimes unsettling behaviour. A family I adored had cats and dogs that they allowed to go to the toilet inside \u2013 and no one would attend to it promptly. Urine would soak into the floorboards and faeces got mushed into whatever was left on the floor. When you are constantly in an environment that is chaotic and smells, you become desensitised. So while it may seem extreme to you or I, the owner of the clutter barely notices it.</p> <p>Of course you see all sorts of things and luckily it doesn\u2019t bother me in the slightest. I thought it was funny when a client saw me spot lube in her bathroom and she said: \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry you had to see that.\u201d Do they think I don\u2019t have lube at my house?</p> <p>Being at the coalface of unwanted belongings has changed my relationship with stuff. I rarely shop, I encourage friends and family not to give me gifts and I easily discard unwanted items. I\u2019m a sucker, however, for saving things from clients \u2013 like plastic bags they put in the bin, which I find wasteful.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/08/secret-life-trade-union-employee-work-benefits-workers-rights\">The secret life of a trade union employee: I do little but the benefits are incredible | Anonymous</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I often come home from work and feel that my small apartment is like a five-star hotel: clean lines, most of the washing put away, and I know exactly what is in the fridge. I highly value that my down time is truly my own with nothing to do after hours. So many clients I see are playing catch up, with paper, belongings, information. When you simplify and let go, life has so much more grace.</p> <p>Organising is very physical work, mentally demanding at times as you are constantly problem solving \u2013 and sometimes an emotional journey when the client is struggling. The hardest is when a client has a difficult life or if they are in denial about the cluttered and unhealthy environment they are forcing their family to live in.

To put it crudely \u2013 it was a bunch of white men up against Australia\u2019s multi-ethnic communities. </p> <p>While attorney general George Brandis, and the new IPA-trained Liberal parliamentarians, Senator James Paterson and Tim Wilson, are undoubtedly well-versed in theories of liberalism and free speech; and despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/23/morrison-and-bernardis-claims-of-victimhood-are-clever-but-theyre-dishonest\">Scott Morrison\u2019s claims</a> that he\u2019s suffered from <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2016/06/21/scott-morrison-straight-white-man-says-he-has-experienced-bigo/\">\u201chatred and bigotry\u201d</a> for his views on marriage equality; they\u2019re hardly a cast of characters aware of the deep pains of racism.</p> <p>What better way to demonstrate that than Liberal Democrat Senator David <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/15/david-leyonhjelm-racial-discrimination-complaint-angry-white-male-fairfax-18c\">Leyonhjelm making a complaint to the RDA</a> against Fairfax for a satirical depiction of him by Mark Kenny as a \u201cboorish, supercilious know-all with the empathy of a besser block\u201d and an \u201cangry white male\u201d. Leyonhjelm, claiming it is likely to be offensive to white men, in a seemingly confused attempt to highlight either the double standards of the law and of race theory, or the breadth of the law, will likely fail on both accounts, but it demonstrates how out of touch he and the free speech brigade are with the genuine harms of racism and bigotry, and the contempt they have for real victims of it.</p> <p> The overhaul of 18C wasn\u2019t abandoned for lack of ideological will. Most of the campaign\u2019s ideologues in the government admit it is regretfully off the table for now.

It is not up to any one person to say, \u201cI am offended\u201d. Nor should we dismiss or sneer at the kind of concerns that have led to the rise of Hansonist populism in July\u2019s election. But let\u2019s get real \u2013 there is scant evidence to suggest 18C is censoring or constraining public debate on anything. Kruger and Hanson\u2019s antics surely show we have plenty of space for racist inanity free of any legal recourse.</p> <p>We needn\u2019t have to endure howls of free speech every time someone who exercises a bigoted opinion faces pressure for their views.

It typically forces conciliation, not litigation. It gives power to the voiceless. It recognises, fundamentally, that there is real, calculable damage when racial vilification is allowed to fester in the public domain. It feeds the worst kind of movements capable of growing into hate that can do more than just offend \u2013 it can put racial and ethnic minorities in physical and mental harm\u2019s way.</p> <p>As minorities of all backgrounds justifiably fear what the revival of Pauline Hanson and One Nation will mean for racism in this country, 18C\u2019s repeal would send all the wrong signals that the rivers of hate are starting to break through. I don\u2019t believe most Australians want that by any means. But sometimes, the loudest and angriest voices penetrate far beyond their mandate, and cause the deepest kind of personal and societal damage. </p> <p>People don\u2019t need to have the right to be bigots \u2013 we can be better than that. We can have serious, mature debates about issues of significance without racial discrimination and vilification. 18C won\u2019t prevent us from doing so \u2013 only small-mindedness and arrogance will. What 18C does \u2013 providing respite to victims of racism and bigotry \u2013 is too important for that. Now is exactly the worst time to repeal it.</p>",

A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance\">nuclear magnetic resonance</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetometer\">magnetometer</a>, which can detect localised anomalies in the earth\u2019s magnetic fields, was then used to identify geological faultlines caused by the weight of long-submerged buildings pressing down upon and fracturing layers of sediment, and to pinpoint the presence of large objects.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0db669ef2a2755f1b1a2c2f345a6629486b9b2c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0db669ef2a2755f1b1a2c2f345a6629486b9b2c6/0_195_5392_6736/800.jpg\" alt=\"Colossal statue of god Hapy, Thonis-Heracleion\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 5.4 metres tall statue of the god Hapy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christoph Gerigk/Franck Goddio/Hilti Foundation</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the most promising excavation spots now fixed, scuba divers were sent in. They carried water-dredges: huge underwater vacuum-cleaners that hoover away overlying blankets of sand and expose the archaeological layers beneath. The biggest items, such as building fragments and colossal statues \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/mar/26/egyptian-statues-lost-city-tall-order-british-museum\">Ptolemaic king and queen</a>, each five metres high, among them \u2013 were the easiest to find and resurrect from the seabed, but smaller and more eclectic gems soon followed, including goblets, figurines, ritual pails, and 13 limestone animal sarcophagi. <br></p> <p>One by one, each artefact was catalogued, <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/sunken_cities/underwater_filming.aspx\">photographed</a>, and then \u2013 if safe to do so \u2013 winched up to the deck of the Princess Duda research boat before being subjected to further analysis back on land. Together, they have transformed our understanding not just of Thonis-Heracleion, but of the nature of Egypt and its interactions with the Hellenic world at the time. \u201cSome of these objects are completely unique, of great historical or artistic importance,\u201d Masson-Berghoff told the Guardian. \u201cThey push us to think anew.\u201d<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decree_of_Nectanebo_I\">Decree of Sais</a>, for example \u2013 a magnificent black stele that stands two metres high and is carved with perfectly preserved hieroglyphics from the early fourth century BC \u2013 was unearthed on the site of a temple to supreme god of the Egyptians, Amun-Gereb, at Thonis-Heracleion. The stele reveals some of the intricacies of contemporary taxation in Egypt: \u201cHis Majesty [Pharaoh Nectanebo I] decreed: Let there be given one-tenth of the gold, of the silver, of the timber, of the processed wood and of all things coming from the sea of the Hau-Nebut [the Mediterranean] \u2026 to become divine offerings to my mother Neith,\u201d reads its edict.</p> <p>But the stele has done more than flesh out our understanding of ancient Egyptian tariffs. Its discovery has also helped solve a long-running mystery: by comparing it to other inscribed monuments, experts were able to determine that Thonis and Heracleion were not, as previously believed, two different towns, but rather one single city known by both its Egyptian and Greek name respectively.</p> <p>The interplay between Pharaonic and Greek societies in Thonis-Heracleion is a constant feature of the city\u2019s remnants: Hellenic helmets were nestled in the seabed alongside their Egyptian counterparts, as were Cypriot statuettes and incense burners, Athenian perfume bottles, and ancient anchors from Greek ships.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3e3960e1779d4fdb05deb2d9d2108665e49e4f50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e3960e1779d4fdb05deb2d9d2108665e49e4f50/0_169_5906_3545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Decree of Sais stele under water.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This stele reveals that Thonis (Egyptian) and Heracleion (Greek) were the same city.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christoph Gerigk/Franck Goddio/Hilti Foundation</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nowhere was this cross-cultural pollination more evident than in the realm of religion, particularly during the rise of the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt, where a succession of foreign-born rulers sought to justify their power in the eyes of the Egyptian people by demonstrating their affinity with Pharaonic traditions. </p> <p>One object recovered from the water is a 2,000-year-old stone figurine of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra_III_of_Egypt\">Cleopatra III</a>: a Ptolemaic queen, but depicted as the Egyptian goddess <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Isis-Egyptian-goddess\">Isis</a> and sculpted in a style that combines both local and Hellenic aesthetics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/15/drowned-worlds-egypts-sunken-cities\">Drowned worlds: Egypt's lost cities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Among the most beguiling of Thonis-Heracleion\u2019s remains are the artefacts associated with the city at play. The annual celebration of the Mysteries of Osiris, marked all over ancient Egypt, involved the preparation \u2013 in the secrecy of the temples \u2013 of two figures of Osiris, god of the underworld and resurrection: one made of soil and barley, the other of expensive materials including ground-up semi-precious stones.</p> <p>In Thonis-Heracleion, the former was placed in a granite tank and nurtured with Nile water until it germinated<strong>. </strong>It was then placed in a papyrus barge alongside 33 other vessels; the whole flotilla was illuminated by 365 oil lamps \u2013 one for each day of the year \u2013 and eventually sailed down to the nearby settlement of Canopus. As well as an 11-metre sycamore vessel that would have been used in this procession, archaeologists have unearthed several small lead replicas of the papyrus boats, thrown into the water as votive offerings by onlookers.<br></p> <p>These finds offer a rare glimpse into the practice of ancient ritual, rather than just the liturgical representation of it. In Masson-Berghoff\u2019s words, they provide a connection to the \u201cmateriality\u201d of religion in Thonis-Heracleion. That\u2019s important because, while the items dredged up so far from the bottom of Abu Qir bay tell a remarkable story of a city that could have vanished completely from our consciousness, it is, for now at least, very much a selective story. Those working on it today are well aware of its holes.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"263abca10bb3877191573df0b675049eb10dac3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/263abca10bb3877191573df0b675049eb10dac3d/0_491_7368_4421/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Artefact Thonis-Heracleion under water.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Archaeologists have so far only discovered a fraction of the city.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christoph Gerigk \u00a9 Franck Goddio / Hilti Foundation</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMy hope is that future discoveries will enable us to shed more light on the lives of ordinary people,\u201d says Masson-Berghoff, who points out that while we know more than ever about Thonis-Heracleion\u2019s rulers and priests, it is much harder to picture the mudbrick homes and daily lives of those who served them and kept the busy port operating smoothly.</p> <p>Today, 95% of the area\u2019s urban footprint remains to be explored; perhaps there are objects yet to be found that can enrich our understanding of how cargo unloaders, cleaners and cloth-sewers experienced their city. \u201cWhat we know now is just a fraction,\u201d observes <a href=\"http://www.franckgoddio.org/projects/sunken-civilizations/heracleion.html\">Franck Goddio</a>, director of the ongoing excavations. \u201cWe are still at the very beginning of our search.\u201d<br></p> <p>By the second century BC, Thonis-Heracleion\u2019s era of pomp and prestige was already fading. Further along the coast, the new metropolis of Alexandria was rapidly establishing itself as Egypt\u2019s preeminent port, while the hybrid foundation of land and water upon which Thonis-Heracleion was built had begun to feel less secure. It wasn\u2019t a single natural disaster \u2013 an earthquake, tsunami, rising sea levels, or subsidence \u2013 that doomed the city, but rather a combination of them all.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/16/lost-cities-6-angkor-wat-nasa-technology-khmer-megacity\">Lost cities #7: how Nasa technology uncovered the 'megacity' of Angkor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the end of the century, probably after a severe flood, the central island \u2013 already sagging under the weight of the main temple buildings \u2013 succumbed to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_liquefaction\">liquefaction</a>.

When I got my result, I felt so happy and relieved that I could go to a good school where I could learn to my full potential.</p> <p>I do think it\u2019s a bit unfair. One of my friends didn\u2019t pass, and he is really a bright boy. He was cleverer than me at primary school, and he\u2019s in top sets in his secondary school. Sometimes people are not suited to doing tests, and express themselves through classwork.

I think the test is a good idea \u2013 it\u2019s just saying that you have to really want to get into this school and that you\u2019re going to work really hard at it. The downside is it puts a lot of pressure on some people who want to go to the school but don\u2019t want to do the test. A couple of my friends don\u2019t want to go [to grammar school] for that reason.

Quite a few of my friends have taken it, so there was a bit of pressure because if I didn\u2019t pass, I might not get into the same school as them. I think the&#xa0;11-plus widens opportunities and ensures more people get their first choice of school. Ultimately, it doesn\u2019t make a big difference because the&#xa0;schools are pretty much the same quality \u2013 they\u2019re better and worse in their own way.

I&#xa0;don\u2019t like the way the test divides children into those who are good at tests and those who aren\u2019t, and puts those who aren\u2019t in schools that are supposedly not as good.

The 11-plus didn\u2019t really affect me, and I\u2019m planning to stay on at school and do A-levels. But I agree with the 11-plus. To&#xa0;pass and get into grammar school, you do have to apply yourself \u2013 it\u2019s quite a difficult test.

  "<p> The New Forest national park is being destroyed by overgrazing by its ponies, driven in part by taxpayer subsidies, according to Chris Packham.</p> <p>The naturalist and broadcaster claims that overgrazing by the ponies, as well as cattle and deer, is causing loss of woodland and threatening species in one of the UK\u2019s most important biodiversity hotspots.</p> <p>\u201cIn simplistic terms, we have a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2005/mar/01/conservationandendangeredspecies.uknews\">New Forest now</a> but we won\u2019t have a New Forest tomorrow because there is simply no regeneration taking place,\u201d said Packham, who has lived in the forest for 12 years.</p> <p>Packham and other campaigners blame the biodiversity losses on pony numbers which have increased steeply in the last 50 years from around 2,000 in 1960 to around 5,000 today. This has coincided with a loss of woodland and subsequent biodiversity. </p> <p>\u201cWe know that an estimated 170 species have been lost over recent decades and that can be partially attributed to overgrazing,\u201d said Sam Manning, an ecologist and founder of conservation campaign group, Wilder. \u201cNow 68% of the New Forest is in unfavourable or unfavourable recovering condition which, considering it\u2019s supposed to be one of the most well-managed biodiverse areas in the country, is frankly unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Elena Cantarello, a scientist at Bournemouth University who has studied the New Forest, confirmed that overgrazing was one factor leading to biodiversity loss. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve started to see is that when overgrazing interacts with climate change the resilience of the forest and the biodiversity declines a lot more rapidly,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The New Forest is a unique form of habitat encompassing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/27/unfettered-heathlands-of-the-new-forest\">ancient woodland and open heath</a> and is home to 92% of all reptile and amphibian species in Britain. Its distinct character comes from hundreds of years of the traditional practice of \u2018commoning\u2019, allowing members of the public to graze livestock on the land. </p> <p>However, whereas numbers of ponies were traditionally low compared to other stock, today their numbers are higher than ever. Now, with a foraging intake twice that of cattle and three times that of deer, the number of ponies seems to be taking its toll. </p> <p>According to Packham, the pressure of overgrazing is even leading ponies to strip the bark from ancient holly and beech trees. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d said Packham. \u201cThese trees are 300-450 years old and they\u2019re being killed by ponies which are starving because there are too many of them.

It has a cap of \u00a36,000 per commoner and a minimum requirement of three years\u2019 experience. </p> <p>Clerk to the Verderers, Sue Westwood, also points to a new influence which could be making numbers of ponies and cattle soar even higher. This is the EU-funded Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) introduced last year to help farmers. Under the BPS commoners can receive around \u00a3448 per cow and \u00a3269 per pony with no cap on payments.</p> <p>Westwood said in an email: \u201cIt is unfortunate that some commoners have exploited the new BPS by significantly increasing their cattle herds. The majority of commoners have not done so, and the Verderers, and indeed the majority of commoners, are concerned that there will be adverse publicity affecting all commoners when in fact it is just a small minority who have sought to overexploit the EU subsidy system and the forest itself.\u201d</p> <p>Packham doesn\u2019t blame the commoners but the system itself. He wants to see ponies and cattle taken off the forest in a phased manner in conjunction with a total limit on livestock encouraged by a reform of the payments system.</p> <p>\u201cI want to work alongside the commoners in terms of conservation,\u201d said Packham, \u201cbut please pay them to take the animals off now and keep them at the right level otherwise there won\u2019t be a New Forest tomorrow.\u201d</p>",

But in the aftermath of the most recent clashes, which echoed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/23/south-sudan-state-that-fell-apart-in-a-week\">beginning of the conflict in 2013</a>, few families were able to collect the bodies of loved ones and observe these customs.</p> <p>In the days following the violence, aid workers and volunteers from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the South Sudan Red Cross stepped in to collect hundreds of bodies of soldiers and civilians that had been left in the streets. </p> <p>The vast majority of the victims couldn\u2019t be identified. \u201cBy the time it was safe enough for our teams to start collecting human remains, precious time had passed. Bodies change shape quickly in this climate. At this stage, it is no longer possible to identify a person through facial recognition,\u201d said Gregor Mueller, deputy head of the ICRC\u2019s delegation in South Sudan. \u201cBut we feel that we owe it to the dead, to their families \u2026 to ensure that they are collected and buried in a dignified way.\u201d</p> <p>In an effort to \u2013 one day \u2013 give families the chance to find the remains of missing relatives, the ICRC has been recording the circumstances of their deaths and the GPS coordinates of the site where each body was found and buried.</p> <p>The traditions of Sebit\u2019s Bari tribe dictate that dead bodies are washed, dressed in white and buried the same day. Male relatives must dig a deep grave and place the body sideways in an even deeper, narrow slit at the bottom. Some Bari say that if anyone is accused of having killed the deceased, that person must either be held accountable, or swear their innocence by drinking water mixed with a pinch of the soil dug up from the deepest part of the grave.</p> <p>But none of these rituals were observed following Sebit\u2019s death. He was buried more than a week after he had been killed. Neighbours helped Dahia bury the body in a hastily dug and relatively shallow grave, which already contained the remains of another brother and an uncle who had been killed in the violence and buried two days earlier.</p> <p>Still, this was more than many other families managed. Just a couple of kilometres down the road, dozens of unidentified bodies wrapped in body bags were lowered into a mass grave. \u201cCivilian, Male, Checkpoint #24, 08/07/2016\u201d was scribbled on one bag. \u201cCivilian, Male, Eye Radio, 08/07/2016,\u201d on another.</p> <p>Aid workers arranged the bodies next to one another. They noted GPS coordinates of the burial site, which could later be passed on to relatives who wished to mourn at the site or exhume remains.</p> <p>The body of journalist <a href=\"https://radiotamazuj.org/en/article/huge-loss-south-sudans-press-journalist-killed-juba\">John Gatluak</a> was placed in an adjacent grave. A Nuer, he was reportedly shot dead by soldiers in what many called an ethnically motivated killing. His family and friends, some abroad and some in hiding, were unable to take custody of the body.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/29/women-south-sudan-raped-un-compound-juba-kill-me-instead\">'I begged them to kill me instead': women in South Sudan raped under nose of UN | Simona Foltyn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf the situation becomes normal, maybe the family will take the body up to our village,\u201d said Chuol Deng, a friend and colleague from the same Nuer community in Leer town. \u201cJohn was a very important person. For someone like that, people usually build a large tomb near the family home.\u201d </p> <p>In both Bari and Nuer tradition, justice for those killed is an important part of burial rites, with elders often negotiating a settlement for the family of the victim. But few thought those responsible for the deaths of their loved ones would be held accountable.</p> <p>As Dahia buried the last of her three relatives killed in the violence, she found comfort in the idea that the family had at least taken possession of the remains. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be comfortable knowing he was buried in that big grave together with the others,\u201d she said. </p> <p>She planted a wooden pole in lieu of a cross and lined the edges of the grave with grass and pink flowers. She hoped that one day, when things were more stable and the family had saved up some money, they could hold a proper funeral service.</p>",

The Athlete challenged the decision rendered by the IAAF Doping Review Board (IAAF DRB) on 12 August 2016, which revoked its previous decision declaring her exceptionally eligible to compete in international competitions, including the athletics competition at the Olympic Games 2016.</p> <p>Such decision, declaring her ineligible to compete, was based on new factual elements concerning the Athlete presented by Prof. Richard McLaren in addition to his report delivered on 18 July 2016.</p> <p>On that basis, the IAAF DRB determined that the Athlete was directly affected and tainted by State-organized doping scheme described in the McLaren Report. Furthermore, the IAAF DRB noted that the results management in respect of certain of the Athlete\u2019s samples has been subject to tampering and manipulation during the \u201crelevant period\u201d (i.e. starting on 1 January 2014).</p> <p>The CAS Panel in charge of this matter heard the parties and their representatives today between 11am and 3pm. At 1:00am today, the parties were informed that the application was upheld and that the Athlete remained eligible to compete in the Olympic Games in Rio. The CAS Panel applied the IAAF Competition Rules to conclude that the previous decision of the IAAF DRB, that the Athlete complied with the relevant criteria because of her permanent residence outside Russia, still applied despite the additional information provided by Prof. McLaren. Relevantly, the Athlete established that she was subject to fully compliant drug-testing in- and out-of-competition outside of Russia for the \u201crelevant period\u201d.</p> <p>The full award with the grounds will be published on the CAS website as soon as it will be available.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06bc7c7874458795e92ffab23d1d52a37d141090\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06bc7c7874458795e92ffab23d1d52a37d141090/0_131_3585_2151/1000.jpg\" alt=\"15th IAAF World Athletics Championships Beijing 2015 - Day SevenBEIJING, CHINA - AUGUST 28: Darya Klishina of Russia competes in the Women\u2019s Long Jump final during day seven of the 15th IAAF World Athletics Championships Beijing 2015 at Beijing National Stadium on August 28, 2015 in Beijing, China.

Making the final here aged 23 is a bonus for the new British record holder, who went sub-Holmes just a month ago. She will run without pressure in the final. It\u2019s not impossible you know. And while we\u2019re on just a word on Caterine Ibraguen in the triple jump. What an athlete! The stadium on that side is full of Colombian fans, flags draped over the rails, and she\u2019s putting on a real show. Ibarguen is the favourite and now the leader having just jumped 15.18. above all she is just a genuinely compelling spectacle, all bounding muscle and grace, plus a real performer too. In slow mo you can see her grinning even as she flies through the air. If she wins this (part of) the roof (by the Colombians) will come off.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>[This post was edited to change Columbia to Colombia because it\u2019s Colombia.]</em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-15T02:46:24.810Z\">at 3.46am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b1154ee4b062ce4d22363d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-15T01:05:35.371Z\">2.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Men\u2019s Water Polo</strong>: Hungary ended up beating Brazil by the final score of 10-6.

This is of course good news for the assembled media, who can now complain instead about the terrible crush, too many people coming in, not enough empty seats etc. It\u2019s a muggy, hot night in the old Nilton Santos. The people in blue blazers are mithering about fiddling with the fixings, photographers are bustling about, the stage being set. The idea of a lightning quick track in Rio De Janeiro seems something of a stretch given the rest of these Games, which have involved for most on the periphery an endless stream of delays and interminable journeys. Who knows, perhaps Bolt will win in 24 seconds tonight having got lost three times long the way. Either way this really is the ultimate test of how well Brazil has managed to stage and sell and fluff the Olympics.

Apparently there are one or two things happening in Rio today, as you\u2019ll have gleaned. Most notably, perhaps, Usain Bolt\u2019s bid for a triple-treble of Olympic golds, which starts in earnest with the men\u2019s 100m sprint semi-finals and \u2013 should he make it (it couldn\u2019t happen, could it?) \u2013 final. Still, as a grey dawn breaks over London, that seems a very long way off right now. And you know what? It is. It\u2019s just coming up to 4am in Rio, and Usain will no doubt be tucked up in bed dreaming of Justin Gatlin and rear-view mirrors. With the Games\u2019 blue riband event not taking place until late evening, it falls to the golfers to get us underway. Erstwhile Ryder Cup partners Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson, respectively placed in the gold and silver medal positions heading into the final round, tee off in just over three hours. They do like their early starts, the golfing fraternity. I\u2019m Les Roopanarine, by the way, and I\u2019ll be guiding you through the day nine build-up until lunchtime UK time. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-14T06:57:54.720Z\">at 7.57am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57aecca3e4b0178756b5c3dc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/russell-jackson\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-14T05:23:54.683Z\">6.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Day nine briefing</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Welcome back for day nine at Rio, where we\u2019ve witnessed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/14/he-gets-knocked-down-but-mo-farah-gets-back-up-to-win-10000m-gold\"><strong>Mo Farah</strong> quite literally picking himself up off the ground</a> to take back-to-back golds with a rousing win in the men\u2019s 10,000m final, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/michael-phelps-olympic-career-swimming-gold\"><strong>Michael Phelps</strong> signed off on his Olympic career with his 23<sup>rd</sup> gold medal</a> \u2013 and his fifth at these Games \u2013 in the 4x100 medley relay. </p> <h2>The big picture</h2> <p>Day eight quite simply belonged to two phenomenal athletes: Phelps having finished his Olympic career with 23 gold medals in a Rio campaign whose statistical complexity staggers us all anew, while Farah\u2019s brave and brilliant gold medal run to defend his 10,000m title after stumbling onto the track early served as a reminder of how singularly monumental each and every gold medal is at Olympic level.</p> <p> There was also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/elaine-thompson-womens-100m-gold-jamaica\">gold for Jamaica\u2019s <strong>Elaine Thompson</strong> in the women\u2019s 100m dash</a>, which thwarted her compatriot Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce\u2019s attempt at a third successive Olympic crown, though the latter still took home bronze. \u201cThere is a big screen back home in my community in Jamaica,\u201d Thompson said afterwards. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what is happening there right now.\u201d A decent old party, one would suspect.</p> <p> <strong><strong>You should also know:</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/north-korean-weightlifter-says-olympic-gold-will-make-beloved-kim-jong-un-happy\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/rio-olympics-logistics-ioc-gunfire\">Despite gunfire, green pools and logistical chaos, Rio\u2019s efforts have actually been pretty decent so far</a> </li> <li> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/ibtihaj-muhammad-fencing-olympics-2016-bronze\">Ibtihaj Muhammad\u2019s bronze medal is a vital one in this US summer of Trump</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/russian-whistleblower-yuliya-stepanova-hacked-wada\">Russian whistleblower Yuliya Stepanova\u2019s data has been hacked, says Wada</a></li> </ul> <h2> Team GB roundup</h2> <p> It was a day dominated by Farah\u2019s remarkable efforts across at the Olympic stadium, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/britain-women-gold-olympic-team-pursuit-rio-2016\">but </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/britain-women-gold-olympic-team-pursuit-rio-2016\">Team GB\u2019s golden run at the velodrome also continued today</a> with <strong>Laura Trott</strong>, <strong>Joanna Rowsell-Shand</strong>, <strong>Katie Archibald </strong>and <strong>Elinor Baker</strong> taking gold in the women\u2019s team pursuit.

Ennis-Hill couldn\u2019t beat Thiam by the 9.47 second margin she needed at the end, missing out by a couple of seconds.</p> <p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/justin-rose-henrik-stenson-rio-2016-olympics-golf-third-round\">Great Britain also might be looking at a medal in the golf</a>, where <strong>Justin Rose</strong> has moved ahead of Australian <strong>Marcus Fraser</strong> and Swede <strong>Henrik Stenson</strong> for the overall lead with a single round left. The 36-year-old began the day four shots off Fraser\u2019s lead but stormed back to take a one stroke lead by the end of the day. <strong>Andy Murray </strong>will also be playing for gold in the men\u2019s tennis singles when he takes on Argentina\u2019s <strong>Jua</strong><strong>n Martin Del Potro</strong>. The swimming is now done and dusted, but with silver in the men\u2019s 4x100 medley relay, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/britishswimming/status/764649621377388544\">Team GB has had its best Olympics in the pool since 1908</a> with one gold and five silvers.</p> <p> The unhappiest medalist of the day was Team GB\u2019s reigning long jump champion <strong>Greg Rutherford</strong>, who scraped into the final with his last attempt of the heats and was then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/greg-rutherford-olympic-long-jump-rio-2016\">beaten into third place by American <strong>Jeff Henderson</strong> and South African <strong>Luvo Manyonga</strong> in a dramatic final.</a> But at least he put the disappointment in perspective: \u201cIt\u2019s a very hard bronze medal to take. If you\u2019d told me 10 years ago I would be gutted with an Olympic bronze, I\u2019d have told you not to be so stupid,\u201d Rutherford said afterwards.</p> <h2> Team USA roundup</h2> <p> What you are reading now is not template text, it\u2019s just that <strong>Michael Phelps</strong> keep winning gold medals.

You might not have heard of Leonidas of Rhodes, who dominated the Games between 164 and 152 BC (I think NBC might be showing his events on a tape delay sometime in the next few days) but we assure you, Phelps is now better than him. His team-mates who took gold in the men\u2019s 4x100 medley relay don\u2019t go too badly either.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TODAYshow/status/764655964628852737\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So many emotions! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Rio2016?src=hash\">#Rio2016</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/N5NYojqWHk\">pic.twitter.com/N5NYojqWHk</a></p>&mdash; TODAY (@TODAYshow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TODAYshow/status/764655964628852737\">August 14, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p> Elsewhere <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/jeff-henderson-usa-long-jump-gold\"><strong>Jeff Henderson</strong> jumped to gold in the that men\u2019s long jump</a> final, though his winning leap of 8.38 metres really does remind you of how insane Mike Powell\u2019s 1991 world record of 8.95 metres really is.

On Thursday, there were more reports of children and medical workers killed in renewed attacks. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/14/syria-public-outrage-horrors\" title=\"\">Jan Egeland</a>, the head of the UN humanitarian task force on Syria, concluded that the west\u2019s inaction in the face of these attacks and others on hospitals, doctors, nurses and civilians means \u201cerasing a century of progress for humanity\u201d.</p> <p>Aleppo continues to face the risk of starvation. Meanwhile, the rebel coalition has evolved. In July, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/28/al-qaida-syria-nusra-split-terror-network\" title=\"\">al-Nusra</a>, one of the dominant jihadi groups fighting Assad, formally split from al-Qaida in a rebranding exercise. The jihadi agenda remains the same, but the new group, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, wants to distance itself from al-Qaida in the event that the Russian-American anti-terrorist cooperation targeting the al-Nusra Front \u2013 a diplomatic initiative that the US secretary of state, John Kerry, has been pushing \u2013 actually happens.</p> <p>According to Aron Lund from the Carnegie Institute, the rebel alliance fighting in Aleppo includes \u201clots of little Free Syrian Army-branded brigades \u2026 Dozens all in all, counting the smaller factions that arrive in tow of the big ones.\u201d But, he says, \u201cNusra and Ahrar al-Sham are the alpha factions in many of those areas\u201d. If they succeed in breaking the siege, it will bring a huge boost in popularity for Fateh al-Sham.</p> <p>The situation on the ground is desperate. In rebel-held eastern neighbourhoods, Unicef said that children make up a third of the 300,000 trapped residents. Some of those children are burning tyres to create a makeshift \u201cno-fly zone\u201d so that the bombers can\u2019t drop their payloads accurately. A Russian-backed plan to open \u201chumanitarian corridors\u201d only succeeded in frightening people who saw it as ethnic cleansing \u2013 a ploy \u201cnot for getting aid in, but driving people out,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/24/syria-peace-talks-vladimir-putin-influence-bashar-al-assad-bassma-kodmani\" title=\"\">Bassma Kodmani</a> of the Syrian opposition group HNC.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In rebel-held eastern neighbourhoods, Unicef said that children make up a third of the 300,000 trapped residents</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Medical facilities are in tatters. There are only 34 doctors left. Physicians for Human Rights said that government forces launched deadly airstrikes against six hospitals in and around Aleppo over recent days, the worst in the region since the civil war began in 2011.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in the western, government-controlled areas, 25,000 displaced people are sheltering from the intense fighting in mosques, university buildings and public gardens, according to Unicef. Food supply routes from the countryside have been cut off.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/frederic-hof\" title=\"\">Fred Hof</a>, a former ambassador for transition in Syria, says that \u201csaving Aleppo\u201d at this point may boil down to merely trying to minimise the humanitarian disaster. \u201cNationalist, non-jihadist rebels are outgunned,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve not been as lucky as Assad in the quality of their external supporters. Clearly, for example, these rebels need air defence weaponry to counter Russian and regime attacks calculated to cause maximum civilian casualties.\u201d</p> <p>Hof suggests that there might be another UN security council resolution demanding access to Aleppo for UN humanitarian relief convoys. But he is sceptical: \u201cIf past is prologue, the Assad regime \u2013 with full Russian and Iranian support \u2013 will defy it, if it survives Russian veto; and the hollowed-out west will wring its hands.\u201d</p> <p>Given what happened in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/04/how-britain-and-us-abandoned-srebrenica-massacre-1995\" title=\"\">Srebrenica during the Bosnian war</a> because of global inaction, it seems inconceivable that western countries could stand back and let the ancient city of Aleppo be destroyed. So what has happened to the responsibility to protect, the global political commitment endorsed by UN member states in 2005 to prevent genocide and crimes against humanity? Dr Hatem, a senior doctor in Aleppo\u2019s children\u2019s hospital, argues that \u201cevery country has a responsibility to stop the bombs and prevent genocide\u201d.</p> <p>In Geneva, the UN envoy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/09/syria-aid-drops-need-blessing-of-syrian-government-says-staffan-de-mistura-un\" title=\"\">Staffan de Mistura</a> persists in trying to restore talks between the parties and their proxies by the end of this month, but so far has been unable to do so. Diplomacy has failed, and De Mistura too seems a hostage to Russia\u2019s demands.</p> <p>A starting point would be to stop letting Russia dictate the agenda. The lack of a more robust US response, allowing Russia to take the lead in Syria, has been disastrous. Hof has favoured greater military aid and even direct, targeted intervention since 2012. \u201cI\u2019d not rule out [surface-to-air missiles] for defenders of our choice,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d not rule out cruise missile strikes on regime airbases.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/01/syria-us-russia-cooperate-fight-islamic-extremists-united-nations\">US ready to work with Russia to fight Syria's Islamic extremists</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/on-the-middle-east/2015/jun/26/from-deep-state-to-islamic-state-by-jean-pierre-filiu-review\" title=\"\">Jean-Pierre Filiu</a>, professor of Middle East studies at the Paris School of International Affairs, says the bloodbath in Aleppo is a result of America\u2019s tacit endorsement of Russian war objectives, \u201cwhich means liquidating any third way between the Assad regime and the jihadi groups, under the pretence of fighting those groups, whether Isis or Nusra\u201d. For the US, he says, this is \u201ca self-defeating policy \u2013 since the revolutionary forces were the ones who expelled Isis from Aleppo in January 2014\u201d.</p> <p>But there are difficulties associated with a military intervention. In the short run, action against the regime might empower whichever armed groups are currently strongest. In the Aleppo area these are the jihadis. But, says Faysal Itani from the Rafik Hariri Center at the Atlantic Council, the equation is more complex than that: \u201cRestraining the regime also takes pressure off more moderate groups, allowing them to compete more effectively with hardliners for influence in the insurgency, especially if they also receive greater US support.\u201d In any case, non-intervention must be weighed against the clearly calamitous cost of continuing the status quo.</p> <p>On the wall of a building in Aleppo, one local photographer captured an image of graffiti that encapsulated the exhausted yet indomitable spirit of the Syrian people. \u201c<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/Fouadhallak89/status/760960218058649600\" title=\"\">You\u2019re not besieged</a>,\u201d it read. \u201cAs long as you keep resisting.\u201d</p> <p>The revolution started as a peaceful one and continued even after Assad shot down his people. The rebels will not give up, nor will they surrender. In that case, unless there is intervention, this will become a decades-long war, like the one that scarred Lebanon.</p> <p>The war in the former Yugoslavia was finally brought to an end with a negotiated peace agreement after Nato, in concert with the UN, intervened with air strikes to protect civilians threatened by Bosnian Serb forces \u2013 despite Russia\u2019s support for its Serbian ally. Yes, there are crucial differences between the wars, but at this stage we must realise the importance of action. As Egeland, who was in Bosnia in the mid-90s, grimly concludes, we can no longer turn away. \u201cAleppo is a test for humanity. There has to be relief,\u201d he says. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t happen, it will be a black stain.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>What can be done to redress the horrible mistreatment of people held in offshore detention? Can Peter Dutton or any of his servants or agents be dragged into court and punished? Can\u2019t international law come to the rescue of tortured asylum seekers and refugees? Are other civil or criminal remedies and responses available? </p> <p>Big questions with interesting possibilities but much as many would like to see a punitive response dished out to those who implement this abuse, the pathway is relatively untrod and uncertain. </p> <p>Australia is a party to the Rome statute that established the international criminal court, which can prosecute crimes against humanity \u2013 and that includes \u201cinhumane acts ... intentionally causing great suffering or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health\u201d. The first trials for crimes against humanity took place at Nuremberg after the second world war. </p> <p>Some years ago the federal MP <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/will-the-international-criminal-court-prosecute-australia-for-crimes-against-humanity-33363\">Andrew Wilkie wrote to the ICC prosecutor in The Hague</a> requesting an investigation and prosecution of the then prime minister, Tony Abbott, and 19 of his cabinet ministers in relation to the mistreatment of asylum seekers. </p> <p>Not much more was heard about this submission other than outrage from Andrew Nikolic, now an ex-MP, who said the accusations were \u201cvague and embarrassing\u201d, and the then immigration minister, Scott Morrision, who said he would keep on doing what he was doing and would not be intimidated. </p> <p>As a condition to becoming a party to Rome statute and agreeing to the jurisdiction of the ICC, Australia introduced to the <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cca1995115/sch1.html\">commonwealth criminal code</a> provisions relating to crimes against humanity, providing for a penalty of imprisonment of 25 years (see: 268.12 and 268.13). This adds a frisson of excitement to the prospect of getting some really nasty types charged up and in court. </p> <p>The provision in the code mirrors the relevant part of the <a href=\"http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm\">statute of Rome</a>, so our domestic law provides for such a crime with elements, such as: infliction of severe physical or mental pain or suffering which are not incidental to lawful sanctions; and the conduct is committed knowingly as part of a systemic attack on civilians. There are also provisions dealing with \u201cimprisonment or other severe deprivation of liberty\u201d. </p> <p>Domestically, the commonwealth director of public prosecutions would be the prosecutor but only if the attorney general agreed and any offences would have to be prosecuted in the name of the AG. On the face of it there is plenty of evidence of conduct that fits the ingredients prescribed in the criminal code. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/14/nauru-inquiry-should-look-at-whether-abuse-reports-were-investigated-labor\">Nauru inquiry should look at whether abuse reports were investigated \u2013 Labor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But can you see the attorney general, George Brandis, going completely off-piste and prosecuting Peter Dutton, a man who displays such a lack of human empathy? </p> <p>Because the relevant bit of the Rome statute is part of Australian domestic law, the ICC itself has stronger and more plausible arguments should it be inspired to look into what\u2019s going on down here. </p> <p>It\u2019s hard to imagine Malcolm Turnbull, Dutton and other ministers in the same Hague dock as Congolese warlords who conscript child soldiers. Yet, it is quite plausible that the ICC could mount a preliminary examination into Australia\u2019s shocking treatment of offshore detainees who sought our protection under the Refugee convention. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=160704-otp-stat\">ICC is undertaking the same process in relation to the Iraq war</a> and in doing so will consider the findings of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/iraq-war-inquiry\">Chilcot report</a>. After a preliminary examination the next step would be an investigation and if all the dots lines up, a prosecution. <br>Even a preliminary examination by the ICC would be a major embarrassment for Australia which, so far, has been beyond embarrassment in the ruthless implementation of \u201cborder protection\u201d. It would flag internationally a pariah status for a country that wantonly abuses human rights, particularly as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/28/there-are-policy-alternatives-to-locking-up-refugees-in-pacific-gulags\">there are policy options</a> far more humane than the one preferred by successive governments. </p> <p>Comparisons have been made with mistreatment of <a href=\"http:// https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/11/comparing-nauru-to-guantanamo-bay-is-ridiculous-says-australian-immigration-minister\">detainees at Abu Ghraib</a>, where <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2006/03/14/prosecutions_convictions/\">US military personnel have been tried and convicted</a> by courts martial. Dutton dismissed as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/11/comparing-nauru-to-guantanamo-bay-is-ridiculous-says-australian-immigration-minister\">\u201cridiculous\u201d</a> other comparisons with Nauru and Guant\u00e1namo Bay. The barrister and refugee advocate Julian Burnside QC told Guardian Australia that Dutton is right, but not in the way he imagines.</p> <p>\u201cGuant\u00e1namo Bay holds people who are thought to be dangerous terrorists, whereas Nauru holds people who have been assessed as refugees, people fleeing terrorism, people who are not thought to be a risk to anyone at all.\u201d </p> <p>Dutton also said the mistreatment was out of Australian hands and was a problem for Nauru. He may not have caught up with the <a href=\"http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2016/hca-1-2016-02-03.pdf\">findings of the high court in February this year</a>, in the M68 case, where even though, by a majority, the judges found that detaining people on Nauru was not unlawful, nonetheless <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/04/the-high-court-despite-the-law-at-its-disposal-has-let-them-get-away-with-it\">Australia\u2019s involvement in the regional \u201cprocessing\u201d centre was found to be \u201cindisputable\u201d</a>. You might think that would put an end to the fiction that it has nothing to do with us.</p> <p>There\u2019s another aspect to the high court\u2019s Nauru decision that puts the government on notice. The offshore regime is only lawful if it is \u201cproportionate\u201d to the requirement of processing refugees and not a system of permanent detention. The fact that there has been precious little resettlement puts the commonwealth on shaky ground. The longer refugees are held, the more unlawful the Nauru regional processing centre becomes.</p> <p>There have also been calls by the Australian Lawyers Alliance to have <a href=\"https://www.lawyersalliance.com.au/news/comcare-must-prosecute-for-nauru-abuses\">Comcare prosecute relevant offenders under the Work Health and Safety Act</a>. The alliance says the act applies to Australian activities on Nauru and makes liable people who are responsible in a workplace for the health and safety of others. An offence is committed where those with a duty to protect the health and safety of people in their care fail to do so, thereby exposing \u201can individual to a risk of death or serious injury or illness\u201d. </p> <p>Liability also arises for breaches of a civil duty of care and a couple of high-profile class actions have been launched on behalf of detainees. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.mauriceblackburn.com.au/current-class-actions/people-detained-on-christmas-island/\">Maurice Blackburn has a case under way</a> in relation to Christmas Island \u201cfor people who sought asylum and were injured or pregnant while in detention and suffered physical or psychological injury or the exacerbation of an injury due to the failure of the commonwealth to provide adequate medical care\u201d. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/05/want-to-know-about-immigration-detention-then-sue-for-negligence\">Slater &amp; Gordon is also running a class action in Victoria</a> on behalf of people detained on Manus Island. The defendants are the commonwealth, Transfield (now Broadspectrum and part of the Spanish Ferrovial group) and the former contractor G4S. The claim relates to the provision of substandard food, water, shelter and medical care. </p> <p>Civil actions are slow, arduous and expensive. The remedy is in damages which is not much of a sanction to large global corporations or the commonwealth. History shows that, if the evidence looks like it might be too embarrassing for the defendants, they settle and the unsightly conduct stays buried. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/10/australia-fails-the-same-lesson-every-time-the-nauru-files-show-how-secrecy-hides-abuse\">Australia fails the same lesson every time.
