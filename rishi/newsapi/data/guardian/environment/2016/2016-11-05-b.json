  "<p>Men are far less likely to seek medical support for a mental health problem than women, new figures reveal.</p> <p>A survey commissioned by the <a href=\"http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Mental Health Foundation</a> found that not only are men far less likely than women to seek professional support, they are also less likely to disclose a mental health problem to friends and family.</p> <p>The YouGov survey, the largest of its kind, polling more than 2,500 people who have had mental health problems, showed 28% of men admitted that they had not sought medical help, compared with 19% of women.</p> <p>The survey found that a third of women, compared with a quarter of men, had told friends or family about their mental health problem within a month of it arising. More than a third of men, compared with a quarter of women, either waited more than two years or chose never to tell friends or family about their problem.</p> <p>Mark Rowland, director at the Mental Health Foundation, said the findings showed that there needed to be a cultural shift in the approach to the issue. \u201cMental health is so central to our experience of being alive that if we\u2019re ever to rise to the challenge of preventing mental health problems, it will be because men feel more able to share when they are vulnerable,\u201d Rowland said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not about being more of a man but being more in touch with our humanity.</p> <p>\u201cIt takes courage to be open and honest about mental health, but when suicide is the leading cause of death for young men, we all have a responsibility to push for cultural change.\u201d</p> <p>Dave Chawner, 27, a comedian who lived with anorexia and depression for 10 years before seeking support, backed the findings.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to talk about gender when we talk about mental health. It is more accepted for men to deal with stress, emotions and situations with anger. Anything else is interpreted as vulnerability and shut down.\u201d</p> <p>In the past year a number of campaigns have been launched to encourage men to talk about their mental health problems. Documentaries by the rapper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/professor-green\" title=\"\">Professor Green</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/stephen-fry\" title=\"\">Stephen Fry</a> and the Bafta-award-winning actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/21/adam-deacon-sectioned-mental-health-act-kidulthood-babylon\" title=\"\">Adam Deacon</a> have all helped to draw attention&#xa0;to the issue as have the #RUOKM8 and #BoysDoCry social media campaigns.</p>",

  "<p>Origami \u2013 the traditional Japanese art of paper folding \u2013 is enjoying a huge surge in popularity, say retailers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/28/pass-the-scalpel-lessons-in-horrorgami-mark-hagan-guirey-paper-dandy\">Pass the scalpel: lessons in horrorgami</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/05/colouring-books-for-adults-top-amazon-bestseller-list\">In 2015 sales of adult colouring books soared</a> by nearly 1,000% as crafts were seen to promote emotional wellbeing. Origami, with its Zen-like calming qualities, appears to be building on that, presenting a practical challenge for adults seeking a break from technology.</p> <p>Hobbycraft, the UK\u2019s largest craft retailer, said sales of origami kits and papers are up 20% compared with last year, and predicts that it could be one of the top trends of this year. At John Lewis, sales of origami books have increased by 58% week on week, while at Paperchase products have sold out.</p> <p>Origami originated in Japan in the 17th century, although China has also long had a flourishing paper folding tradition. The word is derived from the Japanese \u201cori\u201d meaning \u201cfold\u201d and \u201ckami\u201d meaning \u201cpaper.\u201d It involves creating paper forms entirely by folding \u2013 typically animals and geometric shapes, puppets, masks and boxes.</p> <p>Experts say benefits include developing hand-eye co-ordination, sequencing skills, attention skills, patience, temporal and spatial skills, and maths reasoning.</p> <p>\u201cAdult colouring was a real phenomenon in 2015 and while people are still picking up their pencils \u2026 origami is definitely becoming the new adult colouring as fans look for new and more intricate challenges,\u201d said Katherine Paterson, customer development director of Hobbycraft, which has UK stores as well as an online ordering service.</p> <p>\u201cWe have the wider wellbeing trend to thank for encouraging people to spend time away from technology and be more creative, which is why the craft industry is booming. Adult colouring and origami are very therapeutic and we have recently relaunched our origami range to support the demand.\u201d</p> <p>At John Lewis, Lisa Rutherford, buyer for stationery and seasonal events, said adult colouring books were still being snapped up, with sales up 10% week on week. \u201cHowever, the latest trend is for origami books, which we are seeing fly off the shelves, with sales increasing by 58% week on week.\u201d Sales of colouring pens and pencils were up 52% week on week, she added.</p> <p>Elsewhere on the high street, stationery chain Paperchase has recently launched origami workshops in its larger stores, where customers can learn how to make intricate flowers and gift boxes in a fun and sociable environment. And for those keen to share their completed colourful creations via social media, they are inherently Instagram-friendly.</p> <p>\u201cEarly indications are that origami could be a very popular trend following hot on the heels of the colouring book phenomenon\u201d said a spokesperson for Paperchase. \u201cWe recently offered an origami kit and it sold out incredibly quickly. We know our customers love to be creative and origami obviously allows customers to express themselves. We expect our new workshops to be very popular and to further build the category.\u201d</p> <p>Origami is also influencing fashion as Spring/Summer 17 shows by Carolina Herrera and Bea Szenfeld featured many origami-style folds and pleats and geometric designs.</p> <p>And a TED talk \u2013 \u201cThe Math and Magic of Origami\u201d by US physicist Robert Lang, a pioneer of the newest kind of origami \u2014 which claims to use maths and engineering principles to fold \u201cmind-blowingly intricate designs that are beautiful and, sometimes, very useful\u201d \u2013 has been watched more than 2 million times.</p>",
  "<p>Twickenham has not been kind to Jonny May on his most recent visits but there is nowhere the Gloucester wing would rather be on Saturday when South Africa open the autumn international series there. Defeats by Wales and Australia last year led to England being dumped out of their own World Cup and, when he returned to the ground at the end of 2015 with his club to take on Harlequins, he suffered knee ligament damage that kept him out of action for 10 months.</p> <p>The 26-year old was named in the England squad a few weeks after making his comeback and spent last week with the squad in Portugal. The 19-cap old boy found himself a new boy, introduced to the ways of Eddie Jones, who replaced Stuart Lancaster as head coach not long before the wing was injured.</p> <p>\u201cIt is different,\u201d said May. \u201cThe way Eddie coaches is awesome and after just a day\u2019s training it was pretty clear to me what he wanted to get out of it. There is purpose behind everything, pace and a real intent; it brings the best out of you. I\u2019m not saying it wasn\u2019t like that when Stuart was there but this group of players has come a long way. Eddie\u2019s been a huge part of that.</p> <p>\u201cThe World Cup was tough but the same group, fundamentally, has bounced back and I just want to do Eddie and my team-mates proud if I am given the chance.\u201d</p> <p>May has taken the long road back, travelling to the United States during his rehabilitation where he spent time at the performance centre of the former sprinter Michael Johnson in Houston. He admits to having an obsessive, compulsive personality and drew himself into the recovery process by brushing his teeth standing on one leg and hopping up the stairs.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a tough time but I don\u2019t want to talk about just how tough it was. It is done now and I\u2019ve made a good recovery. I\u2019ve still got to look after myself. I have some decent scars from the surgery: I did my anterior cruciate ligament against Harlequins but some other ligaments were not right so I had them fixed and my ACL reconstructed. It was a fair bit of work but the surgeons say everything has gone well and, as the knee gets better every week, so I trust it a bit more.\u201d</p> <p>May, who was named in a 45-man England squad last August before his comeback date had been fixed, is set to start against the Springboks because Anthony Watson and Jack Nowell are both injured. Jones kept in touch with May during his recovery and talked last week about the potential impact of a wing with so much pace, mindful of the try he scored to stun New Zealand in 2014.</p> <p>\u201cEddie took the time to speak to me and send texts during my rehab and I am very grateful to him,\u201d said May. \u201cTo be so far away from playing but in his thoughts was huge for me and gave me something to focus on. I play rugby to play for England and I wanted to get back into the side. His staying in contact gave me great motivation, although it did surprise me because I was not going to be playing for a while.\u201d</p> <p>England have not beaten South Africa since 2006. May was in school then and Bryan Habana is the only player on either side that November day in Twickenham, when England were on a long run of defeats rather than victories, who will, if selected, be involved on Saturday. The veteran Springbok scored the first of his 66 international tries at Twickenham in 2004.</p> <p>\u201cHe is a role model to me,\u201d said May. \u201cPlaying for England again would be a huge opportunity: if it happens you just focus on yourself and what you can do for the team. No one in our group has beaten South Africa and it is 10 years since we did so as a side. They have had a disappointing time this year and lost a few games they won\u2019t be happy about, so there is a lot on the line for both teams.</p> <p>\u201cYou think of them as the most physical side in world rugby. They have a pack in which everyone can carry the ball and they have smart, fast backs.</p> <p>\u201cThey are stereotyped for their physicality but they are a world-class team who put opponents under pressure. They know that beating us would turn things around for them and we have spoken about ending our run of defeats against them.\u201d</p> <p>Jones is likely to turn to the West Country for both his wings with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/30/exeter-bath-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">Bath\u2019s Semesa Rokoduguni in prime form</a>, as he showed last weekend by scoring the match-winning try against Exeter. \u201cI roomed with him in Portugal and he had some funny stories,\u201d said May. \u201cHe is on fire, definitely the in-form winger. Going away as a group gives you an opportunity to come together and bond. You build relationships, get closer and there are no distractions.</p> <p>\u201cIt was my first time in the camp but I\u2019ve got some good friends in the squad and, when I was injured, I checked out what it was like. They all said it was a good environment, one where players could improve and have confidence. It is all positive.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>As the Chicago Cubs finally won the baseball World Series, Twitter was awash with comments on things that had happened since 1908 \u2013 the last time the Cubs won.

The same period in 1908 was 0.42C <em>below</em> the average.</p> <p>So things have changed.</p> <p>Back in 1908 there was also a US presidential election. There were no debates then but, ironically, the same number of questions on climate change were asked in this year\u2019s debates as back then \u2013 zero.</p> <p>We now have the prospect of a US president who either believes climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, or at best believes it\u2019s just a hoax perpetrated by some vague group because \u201c<a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2016/11/the-candidates-on-climate-change/\">it\u2019s a money-making industry</a>\u201d.

Climate change at least was the topic of one question in the leaders\u2019 debate but it hardly dominated the election. And, like the US, we also have multiple politicians who fall at the first hurdle when it comes to intelligence by professing that climate change is a con.</p> <p>Mostly here, the topic comes up as the cause of blame \u2013 such as renewable energy being cited as the cause for the blackout in South Australia or even again this week with the announcement of the Hazelwood power station closing.</p> <p>As such, the discussion revolves around the negative aspect of the cost of policies that will reduce carbon emissions. It\u2019s a framing that has the underlying foundation that not pursing policies to reduce carbon emissions is a credible alternative.</p> <p>It is rather similar to businesses complaining of the cost of introducing domestic violence leave rather than worrying about the horrific fact that there is actually a need for such a type of leave.</p> <p>As Gay Alcorn noted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/04/hazelwoods-closure-was-inevitable-so-where-was-the-transition-plan?CMP=share_btn_tw\">on Friday</a> \u2013 the closure of the Hazelwood power station was inevitable \u2013 and yet the sense is that both state and federal governments were caught flat footed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/04/hazelwoods-closure-was-inevitable-so-where-was-the-transition-plan\">Hazelwood's closure was inevitable.

But there is a lack of any sense of governments accepting this is just the first of such closures and that plans and responses for them should be well in place by now.</p> <p>As the Climate Council <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/03/climate-change-australia-falling-behind-rest-of-world-on-emissions-cuts-says-report\">noted this week</a>, Australia\u2019s climate change policy is mired in a valley of uncertainty, where our emissions reductions target for 2030 are based on measures that have been yet to be brought into force.</p> <p>We don\u2019t have a gibbering fool like Trump for a leader who screams about China and international hoaxes on climate change but Turnbull has long shed the leather jacket persona of his Q&amp;A days when he took pride in his then principled stand on climate change policy.</p> <p>Now more likely we\u2019ll hear him talk of the great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/coal-will-be-important-for-many-many-decades-to-come-says-turnbull\">future for coal</a> and rush to blame renewable energy rather than to push it as a solution. No, he\u2019s not the gibbering fool; he is just the appeaser of those fools within his government. And that is no less damaging.</p> <p>It is not a strategy that can last, because while it might help to keep the issue off the political agenda, and keep his leadership somewhat more safe, the months keep passing and the temperature keeps rising.</p> <p>Because of its size, age and dirtiness, Hazelwood carries with it greater significance than do other coal-fired power stations. Perhaps its closure \u2013 regardless of the reasons for it \u2013 will force both federal and state governments to acknowledge that the future is here already.</p>",
  "<p>UK households should brace themselves for a combination of rising inflation, low pay and increased debt that will squeeze living standards next year and push more people into financial difficulty, experts have warned.</p> <p>Higher inflation, weak wage growth and rising levels of consumer debt are expected to weigh on households next year as the economy adjusts to the post-referendum environment.</p> <p>Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs National Debtline, said: \u201cThe spectre of significantly higher inflation is a real concern. Many households have still not recovered from the last big squeeze on incomes in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The risk is that this new pressure on household budgets could tip many more people into financial difficulty.</p> <p>\u201cAs a society we need to prepare for what could be a significant increase in problem debt in the years ahead.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/02/brexit-vote-disposable-incomes-gdp-niesr\" title=\"\">Economists at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research are predicting inflation will rise</a> from a current rate of 1% to almost 4% in 2017, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/11/pound-completes-worst-four-day-performance-since-brexit-vote\" title=\"\">the sharp fall in the value of the pound</a> since the Brexit vote makes imports more expensive.</p> <p>Wage growth on the other hand is expected to be weaker, as firms seek to control costs amid slowing economic growth and heightened uncertainty.</p> <p>There are also signs that household debt is returning to highs not seen since the financial crisis. The British Bankers\u2019 Association has said that consumer credit is growing at the fastest rate in almost a decade, as record low interest rates fuel demand for personal loans and credit cards.</p> <p>Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the rise in borrowing could lead to difficulties. \u201cMore people are turning to credit \u2026 While this borrowing might be manageable now, a sudden change in circumstances could lead to debt problems.\u201d</p> <p>Peter Tutton, head of policy at debt charity StepChange, said many people were only just getting over the last period of falling real wages, when inflation outpaced pay growth following the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>He said: \u201cA further squeeze on household incomes, made worse by the freeze on benefit uprating, will leave even more households struggling. With over seven million people already using credit to pay for everyday essentials, there is a real danger of more falling into severe problem debt.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/01/extended-benefit-cap-hit-116000-families-housing-experts\">Benefit cap will hit 116,000 of poorest families, say experts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Attention is now turning to Philip Hammond\u2019s maiden autumn statement on 23 November. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/03/philip-hammond-to-set-out-his-stall-for-balanced-budget-at-tory-conference\" title=\"\">The chancellor has already signalled that he will ease the pace of austerity set in motion by his predecessor, George Osborne</a>.</p> <p>Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: \u201cOur research found that the last wage squeeze left more families struggling to make ends meet without turning to borrowing, with over 3 million households facing problem debt.

  "<p>This is a strange week for an Englishman within Scottish football\u2019s corridors of power. Stewart Regan asserts that \u201cbusiness is more important than pleasure\u201d in respect of Friday\u2019s World Cup qualifier at Wembley. The problem is north of the border the two have not met for so long.</p> <p>Whatever criticisms are levelled at Regan \u2013 and plenty are \u2013 he has presided over more change as chief executive of the Scottish FA than his predecessors. A new judicial system, the streamlining of professional and non-professional football and a fresh governance structure have all arrived on Regan\u2019s watch. And yet, as he knows only too well in a nation obsessed with one sport, a stuttering team brings flak by the barrowload.</p> <p>\u201cUltimately when there is someone to blame, it is usually myself,\u201d said Regan. \u201cI don\u2019t mind that, it comes with the territory. It can be wearing personally at times.</p> <p>\u201cThere are enormous highs and huge lows. I think the national manager feels the same emotional rollercoaster. The difference in attitude and opinion towards the same group of players can be vast.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/nov/05/england-v-scotland-auld-rivalry-at-its-fiercest\">England v Scotland: auld enemies may have lost their edge \u2013 but it still matters | Paul Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI still find it an incredibly negative environment at times. I don\u2019t know whether it is part of the Scottish psyche, whether there is so much demand and expectation that when things don\u2019t happen, people feel really negative. I find it very surprising. When I sit at Uefa and talk to colleagues they find it surprising that there is so much negativity in the Scottish media around the national sport.\u201d</p> <p>Regan\u2019s support for Gordon Strachan, the manager to whom he refers, is understandable even if all logic points towards a parting of the ways if the Scots fail in London. Three Group F matches have returned four points, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/slovakia-scotland-world-cup-qualifier-match-report\" title=\"\">the 3-0 reverse in Slovakia last month a particularly disastrous evening</a> for the manager who failed to guide Scotland to Euro 2016.</p> <p>\u201cGordon knows going to Wembley he can be the hero,\u201d Regan said. \u201cThat\u2019s the mindset that we all need to have rather than going in saying \u2018What if it goes wrong?\u2019 Andy Murray wouldn\u2019t go into a grand slam final thinking \u2018What if I get beat here? What will people write about me?\u2019 He is going in there to win the game. In all his preparation and all his pre-match discussion, he will never mention getting beaten. That\u2019s the mindset we need.</p> <p>\u201cAfter Slovakia, Gordon was very disappointed and down. We talked it through. We talked about what had happened over the first three matches of the campaign. We are still in the running. We are not written off.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/15/gordon-strachan-scotland-world-cup-qualifying-england\">Gordon Strachan still bullish for Scotland\u2019s World Cup qualifying hopes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt is really demoralising for all of us when we don\u2019t get the result we want and no more so than the national manager when everyone is calling for his head after a really disappointing performance. We are only three points behind the group leaders and one from second place.\u201d</p> <p>A key foundation of the Scottish FA\u2019s bid to bridge a talent gap, not only to England but other European countries of similar size, relates to their performance strategy. The governing body has bestowed \u00a36m per year both on that \u2013 which now includes dedicated performance schools \u2013 and club academies since 2011. It remains too early in the process to analyse outcomes but at least some form of plan exists.</p> <p>Regan takes the cause seriously, if not personally. He recognises the appearance of 2,500 children in the academy setup across Scotland means a bloated system. \u201cThey were not necessarily being misled but they were chasing a dream that frankly may never happen,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWe have to focus our resources on the very best that we possibly can.\u201d</p> <p>The recent opening of the \u00a333m national performance centre in Edinburgh, it is hoped, will accelerate progress.</p> <p>\u201cI think it is the jewel in the crown of our performance strategy. We have a home and a place to showcase our talent,\u201d said Regan. \u201cWe have seen nine of our current Victory Shield squad coming through our performance schools. We have seen the first player in a first team, Jack Paterson at Kilmarnock.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to work a lot closer with the clubs to recognise that developing young Scottish talent suits everybody. That means coaching support, data sharing, talent identification, investment through measurable performance outcomes and academy infrastructure, proving opportunity for kids to rise up and play for Scotland.</p> <p>\u201cWe are still very old school in how we scout, how we identify talent and how we use data. That\u2019s an area we recognise we have to invest in.\u201d</p> <p>This process hasn\u2019t been entirely smooth. Mark Wotte, Scotland\u2019s first ever performance director, suffered resistance from clubs. Brian McClair, Wotte\u2019s successor, lasted just 17 months. Regan hopes to make another appointment before the turn of the year.</p> <p>\u201cBrian is a fantastic guy but moving into the performance director role was a bigger challenge than he thought it would be,\u201d the chief executive explained. \u201cSome of the skill sets that we thought would naturally come out through being involved in the biggest academy in English football didn\u2019t materialise.</p> <p>\u201cMark set out to make a difference and did in a lot of ways. He initiated a review of academies, set up the performance school structure and the U20 league. By the end of his time with us, he was struggling to bring the clubs with him.</p> <p>\u201cUltimately, we have to recognise that the players are the clubs\u2019 players. We cannot say \u2018this is going to happen\u2019 because the clubs pay these players, they invest a lot of time through their academies.</p> <p>\u201cWe are trying to get buy-in. The results on the pitch speak for themselves. We haven\u2019t qualified for a major tournament for 20 years. The U21s have struggled, they haven\u2019t performed well in their last two campaigns. We do very well up to 17, 19 years of age, then there is this gap. Those players are not getting into first teams. My message has been that we aren\u2019t playing kids who show a lot of promise. They get five minutes, they get in for a game then are dropped. We have to accept that clubs have a different agenda. But we also need a common strategy; that is, if we can produce better young Scottish players, everyone wins.\u201d</p> <p>There are oft-used claims in Scotland regarding precisely where it all went wrong. One relates to the failure of the SFA, when the international going was good, to use major finals revenue to meaningfully invest in facilities.</p> <p>\u201cIndoor football pitches don\u2019t generate world class players,\u201d Regan said. \u201cWe have any amount of grass pitches in Scotland, we have any amount of sports and leisure centres; what we don\u2019t do is actually make them available all the time. There is a lot of responsibility for that. How many schools are locked at quarter to four on a summer afternoon? We don\u2019t use the resources that we\u2019ve got efficiently enough.</p> <p>\u201cI think we have to change our mindset from coach education to coach development. Instead of just giving people a certificate, we should teach them to become better coaches.\u201d</p> <p>Only one will make headlines, regardless of the Wembley result. Regan will not be praised if Scotland upset the odds. The alternative outcome will bring another form of publicity entirely.</p>",
  "<p>Thousands of masked protesters have gathered in central London for the annual Million Mask March. </p> <p>Wearing trademark Guy Fawkes masks, supporters of the hacking collective Anonymous met in Trafalgar Square in Westminster accompanied by scores of police officers. </p> <p>Scotland Yard has imposed stringent restrictions on protesters after clashes with police, incidents of criminal damage and attempts to invade official buildings at previous years\u2019 events.</p> <p>The gathering in protest at austerity economics, official corruption, erosion of civil liberties, surveillance and a litany of other causes, is held annually on 5 November, a date seen as symbolic for its connection with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder_Plot\">the gunpowder plot</a>. </p> <p>This year, with the date falling on a Saturday, the demonstration was expected to be one of the biggest yet.

Several activists, masked and otherwise, argued they should be free to pass on public roads.</p> <p>Ch Supt Pippa Mills said the march\u2019s anarchic nature complicated the policing operation. \u201cThis event is difficult compared with other events that we police because there is no organiser to engage with, so whereas normally we would work with that organiser to facilitate their protest, and they would give us an idea of numbers, we don\u2019t have that with this,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Approximately 2,000 officers would be on the streets, including riot police, Mills said. She disagreed with suggestions that policing at last year\u2019s event was heavy-handed. </p> <p>\u201cOur role is to balance that right to peaceful protest with the right to minimise disruption to the community of people living and working in London. It\u2019s a careful line that we tread when we consider the rights of different people and different groups,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThe public expects us to police these events.

Many of the things he does are not flashy, but like a great point guard in basketball, Silva has a phenomenal talent for distributing the ball, keeping the play moving, and appearing in the right place at the right time.

Wales 8-32 Australia</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A day to forget for Wales and a 12th consecutive loss to Australia</strong>. A bit more fight in the second half and a well-taken try from Scott Williams, but in a cohesive attacking sense, it was dross. Utter dross. Significant backwards steps have been taken since the summer tour in New Zealand. They have a habit of starting autumn campaigns slowly but that\u2019s no excuse for the abject defending, in the first half particularly. Ross Moriarty at least put in a shift and can take a bit of credit, Tipuric too in patches, everyone else \u2026 nope. Not after their heaviest defeat by Australia since 2007 and the heaviest against the Wallabies in Cardiff since 1991.</p> <p><strong>Take nothing away from Australia though</strong>. They were marvellous. They speed, the fluidity with which they attack is a delight to watch. The chasm between the north and south in that sense remains as big as ever. Australia ruled the breakdown and as a result Foley had plenty of front foot ball and he had a field day. That probably doesn\u2019t do him justice \u2013 he was magnificent, at the level he was when ripping England to pieces last year. Outside him Hodge, Kuridrani and Folau also enjoyed themselves and after a difficult year, Australia will be buoyant that their November tour can ensure it finishes on a high.</p> <p><strong>A first Grand Slam since 1984?</strong> That may be getting ahead of ourselves a touch and they did leave plenty of points on the pitch but they will head to Scotland now full of confidence and deservedly so.</p> <p><strong>Next for Wales</strong>, Argentina are the visitors and Howley will hope, pray, that he has Warburton and in particular Liam Williams available. Still, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/05/japan-argentina-international-rugby-union-match-report\">Argentina showed Japan no mercy</a> earlier today and if they are in the mood they can be very difficult to leave with. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ad408fe8a2bb80dc31f2276af944e85e313cf9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ad408fe8a2bb80dc31f2276af944e85e313cf9c/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dejected Wales captain Gethin Jenkins leads his team off the pitch following their 32-8 defeat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dejected Wales captain Gethin Jenkins leads his team off the pitch following their 32-8 defeat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Rogers/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-05T16:41:29.417Z\">at 4.41pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581e05ace4b07ceadb3a2c23\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-05T16:18:03.451Z\">4.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>80 mins:</strong> Quade Cooper is on and flicks an inside pass.

  "<p>The US is not the only western nation to be undergoing political ructions over the faltering post-crisis recovery. New counter-establishment parties have emerged in several countries and, as in the UK, people have voted for dramatic change.

Its unemployment rate is low and youth unemployment is the lowest in EU. But not everyone feels they are getting the benefits of Germany\u2019s stand-out performance. Wage growth has been relatively modest, and anger has intensified recently over meagre returns on savings as the European Central Bank cut key interest rates into negative territory.

But there is a feeling among many workers that their lives have become bleaker as high inflation erodes household incomes, while companies fared better thanks to state support and a weak rouble.</p> <p>This squeeze on the working classes has not manifested itself in the kind of new populist movements seen in EU countries. Russia expert Charles Movit at consultancy IHS Economics says: \u201cThe media is totally controlled by the state in Russia and the tradition of strong leaders is ingrained. [President Vladimir] Putin himself is very popular, the government less so and the opposition is very weak.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The decline of traditional US industries has formed the backdrop to Donald Trump\u2019s central pledge to \u201cmake America great again\u201d. It has also energised the support of a former mainstay of the Democrat vote, the white working class. Five key sectors in particular have suffered since their heydays in the previous century.</p> <h2><strong>Manufacturing</strong></h2> <p>Fewer than one in 10 Americans work in manufacturing, compared to one in four in 1960. While Nafta (the North American Free Trade Agreement) is often blamed for shipping American manufacturing jobs south of the border to Mexico, the number of employees in manufacturing actually increased in the US after it was enacted in 1994. But economists argue that China joining the World Trade Organisation in 2001 has had the biggest impact on American manufacturing jobs by flooding the US with cheap imports that have knocked out homemade goods.</p> <h2><strong>Coal mining</strong><br></h2> <p>Coal has had an ill-fated recent history in the US, as momentum has grown around a push for renewable energy. Employment peaked in the 1920s, when almost half a million people worked in the coal mines. But those jobs were shed over the ensuing decades as improvements in technology made mines more efficient. Nevertheless, US coal production had grown continuously up until its peak in 2008. Since then, production has dropped as the government has steadily phased out more coal energy plants in favour of renewable power such as wind and solar.</p> <h2><strong>Steel</strong></h2> <p>The US industry has collapsed due to competition from cheap overseas steel. Production of American steel peaked in the 1970s, and its decline was accelerated by the 2008 financial crisis. The situation has been made worse by the slowdown of the oil industry \u2013 a heavy user of steel. Automation has been a key driver of job losses, however.</p> <h2><strong>Textiles</strong></h2> <p>America used to make a lot of its own clothes, but the signing of trade deals and much cheaper labour costs overseas have led to the majority of clothing companies sending production offshore. In the 1960s, approximately 95% of clothing worn in the US was made domestically, according to the American Apparel &amp; Footwear Association. Now, 97% of clothing and 98% of shoes sold in the US are made overseas. The trend is set to continue, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics ranks clothing, leather, and allied manufacturing as the most rapidly declining industry in the US. The bureau forecast the industry to decline by -5.9% between 2014 and 2024.</p> <h2><strong>Cars</strong></h2> <p>America was the world\u2019s leading automotive manufacturer in the early 1900s, when technology created the era of mass production. Annual sales of American cars peaked in 1978 at 12.9m but declined to 7m in 1982, as Japan usurped the US as the world\u2019s leading car producer. Car sales were also hit in the 2000s by a sustained increase in petrol prices. This left General Motors and Chrysler poorly positioned to handle the recession in 2008 and needing an $85bn (\u00a368bn) government bailout. Since 2010, the American automotive industry has rebounded, adding jobs consistently.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 7 November 2016 to correct the byline.

  "<p>What is the future of the internet in Africa? How can tech save lives, educate and light homes, in communities where schools and energy suppliers are failing? </p> <p>For the past three days young innovators, entrepreneurs and blockchain experts convened at the inaugural <a href=\"http://africa4tech.org/\">Africa 4 Tech summit</a> to discuss these questions. Here\u2019s what we learned. </p> <h2>Silicon Valley took time to find its roots \u2013 African tech hubs will too</h2> <p>Silicon Valley, which had input from institutions including Nasa and Stanford University, took time to find its feet, and Africa\u2019s tech sector will too.

Perhaps the same logic should be applied to the tech sector.</p> <h2>Disruption in Africa is the opposite to disruption in the west <br tabindex=\"-1\"></h2> <p>Africa is fertile ground for tech disruption, but there\u2019s a fundamental difference to how this happens in the west, where technology attempts to bypass existing systems. In Africa many of these systems don\u2019t exist, so it\u2019s about creating solutions for things like installing formal economies, says St\u00e9phan Elo\u00efse Gras, founder of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://africa4tech.org/\">Africa 4 Tech</a>. </p> <p>Gras cites Uber as the best example of this. In the west the company is said to be disruptive because it provides a taxi service by connecting drivers with passengers without owning any cars \u2013<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/28/uber-awaits-tribunal-ruling-over-drivers-status-as-workers\"> a system heavily criticised for neglecting workers\u2019 rights</a>. But Uber in Lagos actually formalises the economy, giving drivers a way to register their cars, a standardised way to collect money and the ability to track the journeys they\u2019ve been on. \u201cA trend we should all pay attention to,\u201d says Gras. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>Facebook was a solution to Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s immediate needs, African tech start-ups should adopt the same approach</h2> <p>Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/mark-zuckerberg/\">$51.3bn fortune</a> and almost guaranteed audience with any global leader came from one wish: to find out more about the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/jul/25/media.newmedia\">personal status of his classmates</a> at Harvard University.

They cost $6m-$8m each and the company used to make four a year. It shipped two in 2015 and hasn\u2019t made one this year.<br></p> <p>\u201cMy biggest frustration is this: in 2007, before President Obama even became president, he ran on the platform that he was going to bankrupt the coal industry. He had a press conference where he literally declared war on coal. I do not believe in leading through punitive regulations, or punishing an industry into compliance with your agenda,\u201d she says.<br></p> <p>Mitchell believes in climate change and agrees it should be addressed but, she says, business should be incentivized to change. \u201cPunishing an industry into bankruptcy, leaving hundreds of thousands of hard-working Americans out of work. That doesn\u2019t make any sense to me,\u201d she says. Clinton, she fears, will simply continue in Obama\u2019s footsteps.<br></p> <p>At the same time as business has slowed, War Fab\u2019s costs have risen. The company\u2019s healthcare costs increased by 14% following the introduction of Obama\u2019s signature healthcare policy, the Affordable Care Act. A rule that covers the dependent children of insured workers up to the age of 26, touted as a boon for parents of college kids, has also led to the coverage of many of her workers\u2019 adult offspring even though they are not in school. If those legal adults don\u2019t have their own coverage, they turn to their parents\u2019 insurance. The average number of dependents on War Fab\u2019s insurance in 2012 was 2.2; in 2016 it is almost 4.9, and some of the ensuing costs have had to be passed on to workers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/unemployment-obama/\" data-alt=\"unemployment chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/11/unemployment-obama/\">unemployment chart</a> </figure>  <p>The Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to dig its way out of the last recession with record low interest rates has also hurt War Fab.

I used to always win those quotes from Canada. Now all that work is going north,\u201d she says.<br></p> <p>The cost of doing business in the US has become too high even for those who want to, says Mitchell.

  "<p>The morning I head off to meet Amy Adams something happens that is almost too common to be called ironic, so instead let\u2019s call it a typical absurdity arising from being a woman in a world that has not entirely caught up with the 21st century. Adams is in town for the British premiere of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/01/arrival-review-amy-adams-denis-villeneuve-alien-contact\">Arrival</a>, a lyrical sci-fi drama, directed by Denis Villeneuve. She plays a linguist, Louise, summoned by the US government to help them understand two aliens who have just landed in the country (the movie is far less silly than the plot sounds, with more political allegory than sci-fi schlock). She\u2019s also the lead in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/02/nocturnal-animals-review-tom-ford-returns-with-wildly-gripping-revenge-tale\">Nocturnal Animals</a>, Tom Ford\u2019s almost unbearably gripping new film, in which Adams plays an art gallery owner, Susan, stuck in a beautiful house and miserable marriage when her past comes back to unnerve her.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/nov/02/tom-ford-amy-adams-aaron-taylor-johnson-nocturnal-animals-video-interview\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5afdy\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2865342\"            data-video-name=\"Tom Ford on Nocturnal Animals: 'I'm conflicted about what I do' \u2013 video interview\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5819dfabe4b07ceadb3a19ba\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/02/161102NocturnalAnimalsJunket_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/02/161102NocturnalAnimalsJunket.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/02/161102NocturnalAnimalsJunket_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/nov/02/tom-ford-amy-adams-aaron-taylor-johnson-nocturnal-animals-video-interview\">Tom Ford, Amy Adams and Aaron Taylor-Johnson talk about on Nocturnal Animals</a> \u2013 video interview</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Goodness, how cheering, I thought, after seeing these stylish and smart films. Two movies for grownups in which a female character is celebrated for her intelligence instead of her cleavage: go feminism! But, of course, progress never moves in a straight line and, the morning after the premiere, the coverage in the British and American tabloids was all about, well, take a guess:</p> <p>\u201cAmy Adams risks wardrobe malfunction as she goes braless in risqu\u00e9 slashed gown at Arrival premiere in London\u201d, \u201cAmy Adams risks a nip slip in daring white dress\u201d and \u201cAmy Adams\u2019 boobs won the Arrival premiere\u201d were just a selection of the headlines the morning of our interview.</p> <p>When we meet in a central London hotel, she is wearing a simple blue dress and oversized matching cardigan which she hugs around her protectively; only her blow-dried hair and full makeup, still fresh from a photo shoot, suggest a life that involves a little more maintenance than that of your average woman.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to ask about my dress [from the premiere]?\u201d she asks warily, and her shoulders hunch a little as she retreats a few inches back on the sofa.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I hope we can get to a point where a woman can wear a low-cut gown and still have some relevance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>No, I was going to mention the gross reaction to it, I say.</p> <p>\u201cOh right!\u201d she says, moving forward, shoulders relaxing. \u201cYou know, this is something I struggle with because I\u2019m not going to wear turtlenecks for ever. So I hope we can get to a point where a woman can wear a low-cut gown and still have some relevance. It\u2019s disheartening, and having a daughter it\u2019s doubly disheartening, that we\u2019re still here. I was talking about this earlier with my husband: can you imagine a woman saying about a man, \u2018Well, you saw how his pants fit \u2013 you could clearly see the curve of his bottom! And I\u2019m not supposed to touch it? Come on!\u2019\u201d This subject means so much to her that, despite her wholesome Midwestern nature, she dares to say \u2018bottom\u2019 to a stranger \u2013 although she winces a little. Normally, her strongest expressions run the gamut from \u201cgee\u201d to \u201cgosh\u201d. </p> <p>I say that in the current Hollywood climate the fact that the lead character in these two films is a woman clearly over 30 feels like something akin to a miracle. </p> <p>\u201cI mean, right? And both characters are allowed to be that age,\u201d agrees Adams. \u201cThere\u2019s also this really strong intellect with both of them, not in a brash way, but in the way that Louise, in particular, is sure of what she\u2019s saying.\u201d</p> <p>Slavering coverage about Adams\u2019 breasts feels only more inappropriate upon meeting her.</p> <p>\u201cYou can kinda see me as a teacher, right?\u201d she says, when we talk about what else she might have done if the acting hadn\u2019t worked out, and she\u2019s right, I can: she listens intently to each question and her careful, even prim way of responding makes it easy to picture her patiently teaching a room of teenagers about Pip\u2019s great expectations. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63c414d52de25ae29ef9a2b0d49c5acab7bc9b54\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63c414d52de25ae29ef9a2b0d49c5acab7bc9b54/251_126_5367_3221/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Adams in sci-fi drama Arrival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In sci-fi drama Arrival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jan Thijs</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is not something you can say about most actors at Adams\u2019 level. I have a theory that some actors go into the profession because they want to be looked at and some do it because they want to hide inside other characters; I tell Adams that she seems to me like an example of the latter.</p> <p>\u201cMy husband and I are very quiet people. Whereas some people \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jennifer-lawrence\">Jennifer Lawrence</a>, let\u2019s say \u2013 she just has the kind of energy where she walks into a room and everybody notices.

I do. Before I almost felt like it was a deficit, because I thought to be an actress you had to make people pay attention to you, and that\u2019s just not my energy. It took a long time to be OK with that because you would see people receive a lot of opportunities based on something intangible, and it\u2019s frustrating. But during my 20s and early 30s, when I wasn\u2019t really working, I realised, OK, I\u2019ll just focus on my work, I don\u2019t have a thing,\u201d she says, pronouncing \u201cthing\u201d with a capital \u201cT\u201d.</p> <p>Adams\u2019 suggestion that she lacks charisma says more about the expectations on Hollywood celebrities today than it does about her. She is extremely engaging, serious but with a hint of a straight-talking broad once she gets going. Moreover, her focus on her work is probably what has helped her maintain a near spotless acting career. She is a 42-year-old woman whose name can get a movie made \u2013 and pretty much any kind of movie. There have been actresses of this age before her who have hoovered up quality roles like Adams does now, in a way that made their age irrelevant: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/juliaroberts\">Julia Roberts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/nicolekidman\">Nicole Kidman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/cate-blanchett\">Cate Blanchett</a>. But in terms of sheer variety, to find her equal you\u2019d have to look towards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/merylstreep\">Meryl Streep</a>, with whom Adams has co-starred three times.</p> <p>Since seeming to come out of nowhere in 2005 when she was 31, with her performance as the wide-eyed, open-hearted Ashley in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/apr/14/5\">Junebug</a>, for which she was nominated for an Oscar, she has starred in musicals, comedies and dramas. She has been nominated for a further four Oscars (for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/06/doubt-meryl-streep-philip-seymour-hoffman\">Doubt</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/feb/03/the-fighter-review\">The Fighter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/02/the-master-review\">The Master</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/19/american-hustle-review\">American Hustle</a>), and it seems a safe bet she will be again next year. Few actresses working today can slip between playing the brash, Boston girlfriend of a boxer (The Fighter) to a fearsome religious fanatic (The Master), as Adams did.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3bf4746f518be1c9fe2a99c81cb4dc7d0d03518\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3bf4746f518be1c9fe2a99c81cb4dc7d0d03518/45_510_5379_6724/800.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Adams\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Styling: Hew Hood.

In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/26/big-eyes-film-review-tim-burton-art-60s-kitsch-waif-paintings\">Big Eyes</a>, Tim Burton\u2019s film about the artist Margaret Keane, she took a character who could easily have been depicted as a passive victim of a controlling husband and instead gave a skilfully multi-layered performance, conveying Keane\u2019s fear, strength and artistic passion.</p> <p>Adams is certainly a star, but she is not really a celebrity. She has not exploited her personal life for her career, and gives away very little about herself. \u201cI think the more people are concerned with me, the less they can invest in my characters,\u201d she says, and she\u2019s probably right. She and her husband, artist Darren Le Gallo, have been together for 15 years and have a six-year-old daughter, Aviana, or \u201cAhhv\u201d as Adams calls her, who has already made it clear that she has no interest in being a cute accessory to her mother\u2019s celebrity. \u201cI tend to wear very little makeup at home because when my daughter was even younger she saw me putting on makeup and she said, \u2018You look like Amy Adams when you do that \u2013 I just want you to be Mom.\u2019 So I said, \u2018You got it, honey,\u2019\u201d Adams says, with a \u201cso that\u2019s that\u201d nod. </p> <p>She sensed a distinction between your public and private personae?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>David O Russell didn\u2019t make me cry. The experience of playing that character struck me in a strange place</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cShe really did. When I was getting made up, she felt that was somehow attached to another part of my life and she just wanted me. But it got to the point where every time I\u2019d take a shower she\u2019d be like, \u2018Mommy, are you going to work?\u2019 I was like, \u2018I guess I need to shower more often if she thinks I only shower when I\u2019m going to work,\u2019\u201d she laughs.</p> <p>Has becoming a mother changed how she accesses emotion on screen? \u201cI definitely feel more raw and more open to empathy, and that helps. But what\u2019s really changed is how I process work,\u201d she says. \u201cI used to have a dysfunctional relationship with my work, where I was bringing home all my insecurities and expectations, and if I felt a director didn\u2019t love what I did, it would just plague me. That had to change.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47023fb74ea53446e14b437421b2bf1e19139a13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47023fb74ea53446e14b437421b2bf1e19139a13/68_9_2618_1571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"American Hustle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In American Hustle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francois Duhamel/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A big catalyst for that change was making American Hustle with the notoriously temperamental director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/david-o-russell\">David O Russell</a>. The 2014 Sony hack exposed emails about the film; most of the media attention focused on the revelation that the film\u2019s female leads \u2013 Adams and Lawrence \u2013 were paid less than the men. Less notice was given to the email from a journalist to Sony Entertainment\u2019s CEO claiming that Russell \u201cso abused Amy Adams that Christian Bale got in his face and told him to stop acting like an asshole\u201d. Adams later said in <a href=\"http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/amy-adams-pay-gap-jennifer-lawrence-sony\">an interview with GQ</a> that she \u201ccried\u201d during the making of the movie.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s interesting, that particular thing, and I don\u2019t want to acknowledge or not acknowledge anything, because in no way do I feel victimised by my choices so it really was\u2026 [Russell] didn\u2019t necessarily make me cry: I cried,\u201d she says, sitting up a little straighter. \u201cThe experience of playing that character struck me in a strange place, and that\u2019s heightened by David\u2019s energy, yeah. So I couldn\u2019t bring that home.\u201d</p> <p>So you\u2019re saying it was playing the role of the damaged character that upset you, not Russell?</p> <p>\u201cUm, the character definitely, but I think in combination with the heightened environment. I remember looking at my husband and saying, \u2018If I can\u2019t figure this out, I can\u2019t work any more, I\u2019ll have to do something else. I don\u2019t want to be that person, not for my daughter.\u2019 So I figured it out.\u201d</p> <p>How to stop getting so emotionally caught up in your work?</p> <p>\u201cYes. The first couple of years I couldn\u2019t quite figure out the balance, and I didn\u2019t have a clear separation between work and home. But I\u2019m not living in this sort of obsessed space any more. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t find my work important. It\u2019s just that I now know, at the end of the day, I\u2019ll be back home reading stories to my daughter,\u201d she says.</p> <p>One of seven children, Adams was born into an army family, and moved around the world until she was eight, when the family settled in Colorado. How does she think being one of seven affected her as a person?</p> <p>\u201cIt definitely shapes you. It keeps you connected to your past, that\u2019s for sure, at least for me. It\u2019s easy to disappear if you\u2019re one of seven and I liked being under the radar. You could get away with more, and you\u2019d get left behind if you didn\u2019t keep up so it was really easy to disappear,\u201d she says, happily.</p> <p>She was raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, although her parents left the Mormon church when Adams was a child, a move she describes now as like losing \u201ca community\u201d. Her parents divorced when Adams was 11, and her father became a professional singer, which partly inspired her own interest in singing. Her mother became a semi-professional bodybuilder.</p> <p>\u201cMy mother has a really strong sense of self, which is probably more inspiring to me as a grownup than it was to me as a kid. Back then, I was like, \u2018Mom, can you not show up in the cool jumpsuit and the spiky hair?\u2019\u201d she says.</p> <p>Her father is retired now, and her mother works as a massage therapist and enjoys rock climbing. </p> <p>She sounds like an amazing Colorado hippy, I say.</p> <p>\u201cOh she\u2019s not a hippy \u2013 she\u2019s funky. She\u2019s cool,\u201d says Adams.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9d61212adcff0a21c54ec5011435ef4c73d18f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9d61212adcff0a21c54ec5011435ef4c73d18f0/9_217_3722_4649/801.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Adams and Darren Le Gallo\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Adams with her husband, artist Darren Le Gallo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessandra Benedetti/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After school, Adams briefly considered a career as a professional dancer before going into musical theatre, and worked for several years in Minnesota, before a chance audition scored her a small role in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0157503/\">Drop Dead Gorgeous</a> as a dippy beauty pageant contestant. She moved to Los Angeles where for years she was, she says, filled with self-doubt while she hacked it out in projects like <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0196267/\">Cruel Intentions 2</a>.</p> <p>Adams and Le Gallo met in an acting class in 2001, and married last year.

  "<p>When it comes to global warming, we know that the real problem <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jul/15/clean-energy-wont-save-us-economic-system-can\">is not just fossil fuels</a> \u2013 it is the logic of endless growth that is built into our economic system. If we don\u2019t keep the global economy growing by at least 3% per year, it plunges into crisis. That means we have to double the size of the economy every 20 years, just to stay afloat. It doesn\u2019t take much to realise that this imperative for exponential growth makes little sense given the limits of our finite planet. </p> <p>Rapid climate change is the most obvious symptom of this contradiction, but we\u2019re also seeing it in the form of deforestation, desertification and mass extinction, with species dying at <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/06/150623-sixth-extinction-kolbert-animals-conservation-science-world/\">an alarming rate</a> as our consumption of the natural world causes their habitats to collapse. It was unthinkable to say this even 10 years ago, but today, as we become increasingly aware of these crises, it seems all too clear: our economic system is incompatible with life on this planet. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0de09d007fa180dbf8b82dd976d7b21cce2f913\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0de09d007fa180dbf8b82dd976d7b21cce2f913/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Indonesian officials set fire to a stockpile of illegal items made from endangered animals, including tigers, sun bears and the Javan gibbon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Indonesian officials set fire to a stockpile of illegal items made from endangered animals, including tigers, sun bears and the Javan gibbon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jefta Images/Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The question is what to do about it. How can we redesign the global economy to bring it in line with the principles of ecology? The most obvious answer is to stop using GDP to measure economic progress and replace it with a more thoughtful measure \u2013 one that <a href=\"http://rprogress.org/sustainability_indicators/genuine_progress_indicator.htm\">accounts for</a> the ecological and social impact of economic activity. Prominent economists like Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/04/beyond-gdp-is-it-time-to-rethink-the-way-we-measure-growth/\">have been calling</a> for such changes for years and it\u2019s time we listened. </p> <p>But replacing GDP is only a first step. While it might help refocus economic policies on what really matters, it doesn\u2019t address the main driver of growth: debt. Debt is the reason the economy has to grow in the first place. Because debt always comes with interest, it grows exponentially \u2013 so if a person, a business, or a country wants to pay down debt over the long term, they have to grow enough to at least match the growth of their debt. Without growth, debt piles up and eventually triggers an economic crisis. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/sep/10/soil-our-best-shot-at-cooling-the-planet-might-be-right-under-our-feet\">Our best shot at cooling the planet might be right under our feet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One way to relieve the pressure for endless growth might be to cancel some of the debt \u2013 a kind of debt jubilee. But this would only provide a short-term fix; it wouldn\u2019t get to the real root of the problem: that the global economic system runs on money that is itself debt. </p> <p>This might sound a bit odd, but it\u2019s quite simple. When you walk into a bank to take out a loan, you assume that the bank is lending you money it has in reserve \u2013 money that it stores somewhere in a vault, for example, collected from other people\u2019s deposits. But that\u2019s not how it works. Banks only hold reserves worth about 10% of the money they lend out. In other words, banks lend out 10 times more money than they actually have. This is known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking\" draggable=\"true\">fractional reserve banking</a>.</p> <p>So where does all that additional money come from? Banks create it out of thin air when they make loans \u2013 they loan it into existence. This accounts for about 90% of the money circulating in our economy right now. It\u2019s not created by the government, as most people assume: it is created by commercial banks in the form of loans. In other words, almost every dollar that passes through our hands represents somebody\u2019s debt. And every dollar of debt has to be paid back with interest. Because our money system is based on debt, it has a growth imperative baked into it. In other words, our money system is heating up the planet. </p> <p>Once we realise this, the solution comes into view: we need banks to keep a bigger fraction of reserves behind the loans they make. This would go a long way toward diminishing the amount of debt sloshing around in our economy, helping reduce the pressure for economic growth. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But there\u2019s an even more exciting solution we might consider. We could abolish debt-based currency altogether and invent a new money system completely free of intrinsic debt. Instead of letting commercial banks create money by lending it into existence, we could have the state create the money and then spend it into existence. New money would get pumped into the real economy instead of just going straight into financial speculation where it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/10/bank-of-englands-recovery-policies-inequality-standard-and-poors\" draggable=\"true\">inflates huge asset bubbles</a> that only benefit the mega-rich. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Abolishing debt-based currency holds the secret to getting our system off its addiction to growth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The responsibility for money creation would be placed with an independent agency that \u2013 unlike our banks \u2013 would be democratic, accountable, and transparent, so money would become a <a href=\"http://peacenews.info/node/8296/mary-mellor-debt-or-democracy-public-money-sustainability-and-social-justice\">truly public good</a>. Commercial banks would still be able to lend money at interest, but they would have to back it dollar for dollar with their own reserves. In other words, there would be a 100% reserve requirement.</p> <p>This is not a fringe proposal. It has been around since at least the 1930s, when a group of economists in Chicago proposed it as a way of curbing the reckless lending that led to the Great Depression. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_plan\">Chicago Plan</a>, as it was called, made headlines again in 2012 when progressive IMF economists <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=26178.0\">put it forward</a> as a strategy for preventing the global financial crisis from recurring. They pointed out that such a system would dramatically reduce both public and private debt and make the world economy more stable. </p> <p>What they didn\u2019t notice is that abolishing debt-based currency also holds the secret to getting our system off its addiction to growth, and therefore to arresting climate change. As it turns out, reinventing our money system is crucial to our survival in the Anthropocene \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jul/15/clean-energy-wont-save-us-economic-system-can\">at least as important</a> as getting off fossil fuels. And this idea is already beginning to gain traction: in the UK, the campaigning group <a href=\"http://positivemoney.org/\">Positive Money</a> has generated momentum around it, building on a series of excellent explanatory videos.</p> <p>The idea has its enemies, of course. If we shift to a positive money system, big banks will no longer have the power to literally make money out of nothing and the rich will no longer reap millions from asset bubbles. Unsurprisingly, neither of these groups would be pleased by this prospect. But if we want to build a fairer, more ecologically sound economy, that\u2019s a battle that we can\u2019t be afraid to fight. </p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

  "<p>When Jane Goodall observed chimpanzees making tools in 1960, humans lost their self-aggrandizing status as the world\u2019s only tool makers. Now scientists are beginning to realise there may be much more \u2018intelligent life\u2019 in the universe than previously thought, but it\u2019s just here: on our planet. Since Goodall\u2019s discovery, researchers have found numerous other mammals displaying high levels of intelligence, including the great apes, elephants, dolphins, orcas and many canine species. But only in the last couple decades has scientists\u2019 attention turned to intelligence in non-mammals, including birds. </p> <p>\u201cStudies of avian intelligence have been hampered by the old fashioned idea that birds are stupid, and not worth considering in terms of intelligence,\u201d said Nathan Emery, author of the new book, <a href=\"https://www.quartoknows.com/books/9781782403142/Bird-Brain-An-exploration-of-avian-intelligence.html?direct=1\">Bird Brain: An Exploration of Avian Intelligence</a> and senior lecturer at Queen Mary: University of London. </p> <p>An in-depth look at recent research and fascinating lab experiments, the book published by <a href=\"https://www.quartoknows.com/Ivy-Press\">Ivy Press</a> overturns any notion that birds are somehow dumb. Instead, it argues with an overwhelming amount of evidence that a number of bird species should be considered more as \u201cfeathered apes.\u201d </p> <h2>No bird brains here </h2> <p>The idea that birds are unintelligent was initially proposed by looking at the brains of birds. Birds lack a cerebral cortex, which allowed scientists for decades to assume they were incapable of any higher thinking. However, researchers now know that a different part of the bird brain \u2013 the pallium \u2013 has evolved to do many of the same tasks as the cerebral cortex. </p> <p>\u201cAvian and mammalian brains seem to be functioning the same way, but interestingly their hardware is completely different,\u201d said Emery, who noted that bird brains generally have shorter connections between specific parts of their brains than mammals. </p> <p>\u201cThis structure means that birds might make decisions more rapidly then mammals, but we don\u2019t know what implications this might have for their intelligence.\u201d</p> <p>But what is intelligence? It\u2019s a question, really, for philosophy. Researchers rarely agree on an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2015/aug/04/plants-intelligent-sentient-book-brilliant-green-internet\">exact definition</a>. But for his purposes, Emery described intelligence as \u201cthe ability to flexibly solve novel problems using cognition rather than merely instinct or learning.\u201d <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If I told you that day old chicks can count...would you think twice about eating chicken?</p> <footer> <cite>Nathan Emery</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In other words, to Emery intelligence goes beyond rote learning to the ability to tackle a problem never before seen by an individual. This strict definition includes attributes usually connected to humans like plasticity and creativity. Still, Emery said that we need to start thinking of intelligence as species-specific and not compare apples to oranges or humans to crows. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really appropriate to pit one species against another, as each has evolved different skills or ways of thinking that provide them with an advantage in one test, but a disadvantage in another. There isn\u2019t an IQ test for animals to rank their intelligence.\u201d</p> <p>For example, lab tests have shown that rooks and crows are better than eight-year-old children at reaching a treat by making a wire hook, but of course there are many things eight-year-old humans can do that rooks and crows can\u2019t. </p> <h2>Tool-making and other kinds of intelligence</h2> <p>Ever since Jane Goodall\u2019s chimp discovery, tool use has been a gold standard for dubbing a species intelligent. In recent decades, scientists have discovered that a number of bird species employ tools in the wild, usually to get at food they can\u2019t reach with their beaks. <br></p> <p>But for a long time birds had only one known tool-maker: the New Caledonian crow.</p> <p>These island crows have become famous for making a wide variety of hook tools out of twigs and leaves. In the laboratory, they are capable of making tools out of objects they\u2019ve never encountered before and even rival primates in their ability to craft tools. But just this year, scientists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/15/endangered-hawaiian-crows-join-elite-list-of-animals-known-to-use-tools\">discovered</a> that the \u2018alal\u0101, or Hawaiian crow, is also capable of making and using tools. The \u2018alal\u0101 is actually extinct in the wild, but 109 individuals survive in captivity today. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2015/aug/04/plants-intelligent-sentient-book-brilliant-green-internet\">Are plants intelligent? New book says yes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If the \u2018alal\u0101 had gone totally extinct \u2013 at one time there were only 30 or so left \u2013 we would never have known about its remarkable abilities. </p> <p>According to the IUCN Red List, we\u2019ve lost 140 species of birds to extinction since the year 1500 (although more probably vanished without our knowledge) \u2013 and none of these, of course, were ever studied for their intelligence. Today, five additional species are extinct in the wild \u2013 including the \u2018alal\u0101 \u2013 but survive in captivity. Meanwhile, 1,375 birds are currently listed as threatened with extinction (ie vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered) and another 971 species as near threatened. In all, about 14% of the world\u2019s birds are currently threatened with extinction. </p> <p>Worryingly, only a handful of bird species (out of 10,000-plus) have actually been systematically tested on their intelligence. Even whole bird families have never been tested, including most of the world\u2019s raptors.</p> <p>\u201cMy prediction for other families of avian geniuses are the hornbills, woodpeckers, and falcons, based on their relative size of their brains, and what we know about their natural behaviour,\u201d said Emery. \u201cThese are not common birds to keep in the lab or they may be endangered, so the key to success is going to be our creativity in finding populations to be tested in a systematic, controlled manner.\u201d</p> <p>And of course tool-use isn\u2019t everything. Bird song \u2013 and the ability of some birds to even mimic human speech \u2013 lends itself to high levels of intelligence as does the extreme sociability seen in many birds, requiring them to keep track of a complex avian hierarchy. Birds can also do incredible things that humans can\u2019t, such as find their way home after migrating thousands of miles or remembering where they hid thousands of pieces of food even after the landscape has been covered in a metre of snow. </p> <h2>Eating and shooting the intelligent</h2> <p>All this means we need to rethink how we treat birds, according to Emery. </p> <p>\u201cThe domestic chicken is the most populous bird in the world, which we consume in massive numbers. But, if I told you that day old chicks can count or they can tell if two objects are the same or different, a so-called abstract concept, would you think twice about eating chicken?\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8d92de36afa815500276b9a3939bca3910dcee0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d92de36afa815500276b9a3939bca3910dcee0e/0_140_2592_3238/800.jpg\" alt=\"African grey parrots are known for their incredible ability to mimic human speech.

If so chimps, why not crows?\u201d </p> <p>The problem may be one of likeness: we look at chimpanzees and it\u2019s like viewing ourselves in a slightly crooked mirror. But seeing a crow and recognising a fellow clever, sentient and creative being means further diminishing our own superiority and considering life differently. It means recognising that smarts comes in all shapes, sizes and species. </p>",
  "<p>Picture a child entering the world, around the time that a new social networking venture known as thefacebook.com<strong> </strong>is making its own entrance to the world.

My auntie put it\u00a0on Facebook. I was so embarrassed I\u00a0cried</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some parents may shrug off the shaming stories \u2013 and the professionalised sharing of family vloggers such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/SHAYTARDS\">the Shaytards</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUOfKuaLb04\">Brataleys</a>, the<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/BallingersPresent\"> Ballingers</a> \u2013 as beyond the range of their own moderate social media activity. But listen to the children in the Kingsford classroom and it becomes clear how many degrees there are of shame. To these teenagers, even small instances of sharing can be divisive. When I ask if anyone has experienced being overshared themselves, hands shoot up, but the answers are a long way from the public shaming that normally grabs headlines. They are exactly the sort of infringements that many parents will commit without a second thought.</p> <p>\u201cI was eating a Subway. Chicken teriyaki. Eating that and my mum just took the picture and posted it on Facebook,\u201d one pupil says.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was little my parents took a picture of me being potty-trained. Three weeks ago they posted it on Facebook. Me on the toilet. It was really embarrassing,\u201d another adds.</p> <p>\u201cI was with my aunt in the park. I was wearing my scarf but I didn\u2019t have a pin. It flew off and my hair was all raggedy, sticking up all over the place. My auntie put it on Facebook. I was so embarrassed I was crying. I asked her to take it down but she said, \u2018No, it looks cute.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy uncle posted when his daughter had diarrhoea: \u2018Pray for her.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>One girl, 14, raises her hand. \u201cParents love to post things about you, personal information that you might not like,\u201d she says. \u201cWhich kind of affects your relationship with them. Now, when you want to speak to them about certain things, you\u2019re worried they might post it.\u201d</p> <p>Her classmate Erin stands up. Her team supports the motion on the whiteboard \u2013 that parents should be banned from posting \u2013 and they have an idea. \u201cWe want to pass a law that requires open forms of social media to put a consent button on their pages, so a child can report whether their parents have posted about them without consent,\u201d she declares. \u201cIf parents refuse to cooperate, they will be fined the amount of \u00a31,000.\u201d</p> <p>These suggestions may sound excessive and unfeasible; in fact they lie squarely within the recommendations made by a number of adults campaigning in this field. Erin\u2019s idea of a penalty, for instance, echoes the attempts by a Democratic state representative in Illinois, <a href=\"http://www.lashawnkford.com\">La Shawn K Ford</a>, to make the shaming of children on social networking sites an offence. Offending parents should face a penalty, he has argued, which, just like Erin\u2019s, would be a fine paid directly to the child. As for the apparently far-fetched idea of a \u201cconsent button\u201d, this sounds uncannily similar to the \u201cdelete button\u201d proposed by <a href=\"http://5rightsframework.com/\">5Rights</a>, the campaign steered by the peer and film-maker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/beeban-kidron\">Beeban Kidron</a> to protect and empower children online.</p> <p>More generally, the debaters\u2019 irritation chimes with research published in March by a team at the University of Michigan. After interviewing 249 parent-children pairings across 40 US states, the researchers found that children were more than twice as likely as parents to say that adults <a href=\"http://media.wix.com/ugd/a0f093_3ca344c37a2a4271a32a8670eeec5abf.pdf\">should not post information online about them without permission</a>. Would the Kingsford children concur? Class E11 rings with shouts of, \u201cYes!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t going to happen,\u201d their teacher, Miss Alimi, says.</p> <p>\u201cMiss!\u201d one of her students cries. \u201cThere\u2019s a thing called wishful thinking.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Miss Alimi is right: children are unlikely to gain control over their parents\u2019 posting habits. But there is still scope for a conversation about what constitutes fair sharing, and each family will draw its lines differently. Consider the case of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/heatherwhittenphoto/\">Heather Whitten</a>, the Arizona-based photographer and teaching assistant who took the photograph of her husband and son in the shower that Facebook didn\u2019t like. Whitten saw the moment, and the image, as the height of parental care. Their toddler, Fox, had had a temperature for hours. Her husband, Thomas, was trying to cool the child\u2019s fever. For two years, Whitten kept the image private, finally posting it in May after Facebook removed other pictures she had shared of her children. She wanted to take a stand, \u201cto show that it\u2019s just innocent pictures that people are twisting and getting offended by\u201d.</p> <p>She was unprepared for the response \u2013 for the way in which Facebook removed images from her page every time it received sufficient complaints, for the level of disapproval the image provoked, including <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/fatherhood/is-this-image-of-a-man-showering-with-his-severely-ill-son-inapp/\">claims that it was \u201csexual\u201d or \u201cinappropriate\u201d</a>. But Whitten\u2019s stand had one other unexpected consequence. As the interested and the outraged followed the link to her blog, some began to question the legality, as well as the sense, of showing children naked. \u201cI just thought you were free to post what you wanted on the internet,\u201d Whitten says now. But then she discovered that in the state of Arizona, \u201cyou can\u2019t show any naked images of children\u2019s pelvic area or butt, and I realised I was technically breaking a law.\u201d</p> <p>She removed the blog \u2013 \u201ctook everything down\u201d \u2013 but \u201cin the bigger, moral sense, I don\u2019t feel I\u2019ve done anything wrong. I\u2019m not exploiting my children. I\u2019m not abusing my children. I\u2019m just sharing our lives exactly how they are.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She saw how many pictures there were of her and she didn\u2019t like it. Now any time you see Lily, it is with her permission</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Whitten\u2019s experience shows just how nebulous and fraught the territory of sharing can be. Sure, her experience would never befall those for whom posting naked images of children is strictly out of bounds. But the case of Whitten is complicated. She and her partner are raising their children \u201cto not be ashamed or embarrassed of their bodies\u201d. They are living online within the offline boundaries they have set for themselves. \u201cPeople don\u2019t show nudity a lot of times because they think it will have a negative impact on their child. Your footprint is for ever on the internet,\u201d Whitten says. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s absurd. I just hope to combat that a little. Who knows how it will actually turn out, but I hope that my children won\u2019t ever look back and see pictures of themselves as children and feel embarrassed by other people seeing them as well. Because there is nothing to be embarrassed about.\u201d</p> <p>Fox, the toddler in the shower, is still too young to veto or cherish the photograph that caused such controversy, but his older sister Lily, nine, \u201cloves it\u201d, according to her mother. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t really wrap her head around why people would think there was anything wrong with it.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, while Lily was comfortable with the image of her baby brother, she was deeply unhappy with other photographs her mother had uploaded \u2013 the apparently harmless kind that many parents post. One day at around the age of six, Lily began to scroll through her mother\u2019s Instagram. \u201cShe saw how many pictures there were of her and she didn\u2019t like it,\u201d Whitten says. For months, whenever Lily saw Whitten with the camera, she hid. \u201cThat really opened up a conversation about why I take pictures, why I share pictures, who I share pictures with.\u201d Now, Whitten says, \u201cany time you see Lily, it is with her permission\u201d.</p> <p>Alicia Blum-Ross, <a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/parenting4digitalfuture/2016/09/14/where-and-when-does-a-parents-right-to-share-end-online/\">a researcher at the London School of Economics</a>, believes we are entering a crucial moment. \u201cWe are starting to see kids who have grown up, whose parents have shared images, and who are beginning to say: \u2018Wait a minute. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m comfortable with that.\u2019\u201d What families need, she thinks, is a coming-of-age conversation. After all, it was Lily Whitten herself, at six, who instigated the dialogue with her mother that earned her the right to veto content. Does Lily have advice for other children? \u201cThey should say, \u2018Please don\u2019t take any pictures of me \u2013 it makes me uncomfortable,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cAnd \u2018I might change my mind one day, but today I don\u2019t want to have to hide from your camera.\u2019\u201d Soon this \u201cdigital rulebook\u201d chat might become as standard as the one about the birds and the bees. Blum-Ross sees nothing to fear. Both parties, she points out, are united by being the first generation \u2013 of parents and children \u2013 to negotiate this path. \u201cIt can be a really shared experience,\u201d she says enthusiastically. \u201cThe dilemmas are shared dilemmas, the pleasures are shared pleasures. It\u2019s a moment of overlap.\u201d</p> <p>Blum-Ross, who has three-year-old twins, says she is \u201cnot a person who advises total protection. I certainly wouldn\u2019t say, \u2018Don\u2019t share things about your children online.\u2019 It\u2019s important that parents are able to claim their own space about that. It\u2019s OK to say, \u2018I need this community.\u2019\u201d Whitten, too, has always seen her sharing in those terms: \u201cI feel I share everything as my story \u2013 this is my perspective on my life as a mother with these children. I\u2019m not trying to put words in their mouth, or tell the story from their perspective.\u201d</p> <p>It is one of the oldest questions of storytelling: who does the story belong to? Blum-Ross, Whitten and countless others believe they are telling their own stories, and sharing posts about their children where they fit that perspective. But it\u2019s complicated. \u201cI never had a filter before,\u201d says Whitten, sounding forlorn. \u201cI love the idea of having connections with other mothers and people. But I can\u2019t share the way I used to.\u201d After the Facebook furore, she is still fathoming whether to photograph differently or simply stop sharing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2819599aa5bd8855bc23ff24cf7f04fb5d2b70ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2819599aa5bd8855bc23ff24cf7f04fb5d2b70ad/129_191_489_666/367.jpg\" alt=\"Child making a mess with spaghetti in tomato sauce\" width=\"367\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amy Whitt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For other parents, such as the author Amy Webb, who has written about <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/data_mine_1/2013/09/facebook_privacy_and_kids_don_t_post_photos_of_your_kids_online.html\">her commitment to post nothing about her daughter online</a>, the same process of consideration deters them from sharing altogether. They have the big conversation \u2013 with themselves, each other, sometimes their children \u2013 and decide the best answer is silence.</p> <p>When the Guardian asked readers about their experiences, Apricot, who is 30 and lives in the north of England, wrote: \u201cWhen I started to Facebook my own child\u2019s pictures, I began to feel intensely uncomfortable. How could I instil in her a principle of privacy when I had essentially devalued hers from the beginning?\u201d She stopped posting. \u201cWhat we post is facets of ourselves,\u201d said Tamasine Preece, a teacher in Bridgend, whose PhD includes a chapter on oversharing. \u201cI think there is a morality to using children to explore parts of ourselves. My children are not me. They are separate.\u201d</p> <p>Kidron, who says she has never interacted with her children on social networking sites (they are now 19 and 21), thinks that her behaviour reflects the idea that \u201coversharing is inappropriate when the whole point of the journey to adulthood is to self-define \u2013 to work out who you are, what your values are, how you\u2019re going to fit in. I think we have not thought hard enough about what that process might be like, if so much is shared and so much is public.</p> <p>\u201cThere are three issues here,\u201d she says. \u201cOne is the right to a certain sort of privacy. The second is the need of young people to transgress and bump into their edges, and for that to be somewhat safe. The third is the need to break away from the model of your parents.\u201d</p> <p>My own Facebook posts dried up as I researched this article. Of course, I can ask my children for consent, but I am not sure they are ready for a responsibility with permanent consequences. If an eight-year-old consents to a post, is it fair to act upon that consent, or should a parent second-guess how those feelings might evolve? After all, posts are eternal and a child cannot speak for his or her future self.</p> <p>In any case, a child\u2019s consent can be capricious, even within one given day. My daughter, at eight, would prefer her photo not to appear on Facebook, but would be more than happy to see a video of herself playing Swingball on YouTube. My six-year-old, meanwhile, says he is sad that \u201cGoogle doesn\u2019t know me\u201d. Even the teenagers at Kingsford are conflicted. In the end, they vote against Erin\u2019s suggestion of a fine for parents who share without their children\u2019s consent, but they squirm in their seats, clawing the air for a turn to speak when I ask what rules they would lay down for their parents:</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t say embarrassing jokes \u2019cos that\u2019s too much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs far as the world is concerned, we\u2019re not related.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPost pictures of me when I look amazing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t post baby pictures unless I\u2019m happy and fully clothed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever comment on my pictures.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t stalk my profile waiting for me to load pictures.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t follow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t add me. Or my friends.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell dad jokes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t take pictures of me eating food, \u2019cos my friends take it out of context.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t try and use internet slang on our wall. On your friends\u2019 profiles you can embarrass yourselves all you want, but when it\u2019s on our profiles it looks like we\u2019ve taught you to say that. And it makes us look really bad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStay behind the times.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Of course, every family is different. In a quiet cul-de-sac in Newton Abbot, Devon, with sunlight pouring into the lounge, Molly Povey and her 11-year-old son Roman are sitting on the sofa discussing their experience of going viral.</p> <p>In April 2015, with Roman desperately unhappy at school, Molly posted a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/cardsforroman/?hc_ref=PAGES_TIMELINE&amp;fref=nf\">plea on her Facebook page</a> for his classmates\u2019 parents to send her \u201cbeautiful son\u201d birthday cards. \u201cRoman doesn\u2019t have any friends and often cries himself to sleep,\u201d the post began. It was shared around the world. \u201cMaybe 40,000 times,\u201d Molly says. (Interestingly, her post breaks only the second of the Kingsford rules, by disclosing that Molly and Roman are related.)</p> <p>Neither Molly nor Roman, nor his two brothers, nor his dad Ian, who says he hates social media, were prepared for what happened next. Thousands of people left birthday greetings online. At the office of a friend \u2013 whose address was hastily borrowed to protect Roman\u2019s privacy \u2013 cards and gifts began to arrive. Molly formalised the chaos into a Cards For Roman Facebook page.</p> <p>Friendships were made, and some of them have lasted \u2013 to the extent that in April, a year after his mother\u2019s plea for help, Roman celebrated his 12th birthday with 150 friends, strangers and Facebook friends at a Nando\u2019s in Exeter and at a second party in London. They have even met up with well-wishers in Germany.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22ffa6dbd86c634b80ff7290207557fb67e1bb2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22ffa6dbd86c634b80ff7290207557fb67e1bb2a/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Molly Povey and son Roman with cards he was sent by strangers all over the world after she posted on Facebook about his loneliness\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Molly Povey, whose post about her son\u2019s loneliness went viral, with some of the birthday cards he was sent by strangers all over the world.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Rees/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Molly tells this story, talking quickly because there is a lot to fit in, Roman scurries to and fro with his gifts: a Star Wars chess set from someone in the Netherlands, pictures from Brazilian schoolchildren (Molly says he is very big in Brazil), wicker baskets of cards.</p> <p>But sometimes Molly worries. \u201cA bit. I think, what happens in years to come if he Googles himself and finds \u2018Lonely boy with no friends\u2019?\u201d Last year the local paper ran a front-page headline saying just that. \u201cI thought, oh my God, what have I done?\u201d Roman was with her, and comforted her. \u201cBut it is true,\u201d he said. \u201cI am really lonely.\u201d</p> <p>For the Povey family, the benefits of Molly\u2019s post are visible each day. His tearfulness has declined. The whole household is happier. Molly herself has found, in the Facebook page, a community that makes her feel supported and which, in turn, needs her. \u201cAnd now you\u2019ve got a responsibility,\u201d Ian says. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange thing.\u201d He himself has never read the initial post, usually declines to appear in photographs, and thinks that when it comes to sharing, \u201cIt\u2019s best to err on the side of caution.\u201d Occasionally, Molly tells her community that Roman is having a bad day, or that she is: she doesn\u2019t want to pretend to people who know loneliness that loneliness doesn\u2019t happen. And yet, as Ian says, \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to know sometimes what Roman really thinks about it.\u201d</p> <p>Molly leads the way up to Roman\u2019s bedroom, to show more of the gifts people sent. There is James Bond notepaper from the actor Andrew Scott, who played the baddie in Spectre, and a crew T-shirt from Star Wars: Episode III.</p> <p>I wonder if Roman minds thousands of strangers knowing he\u2019s sad. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d Molly asks him. \u201cDo you mind that people know you get really lonely?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Roman replies. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll go yes: I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d Molly repeats, incredulous.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat, that people around the world know you are lonely?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it now?\u201d she asks again.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d Molly says. She sounds deflated.</p> <p>\u201cIt just feels weird, it does,\u201d Roman tells her.</p> <p>Although Molly has publicly revealed aspects of her son\u2019s emotional life that other parents might hesitate to share, she is not incautious. For months she withheld Roman\u2019s full name and has only recently felt comfortable disclosing that he is autistic. Before her heartfelt post, she deleted baby pictures of Roman\u2019s older brother because he was about to start secondary school; surely the Kingsford debaters would approve.</p> <p>Like Alicia Blum-Ross and Heather Whitten, Molly has rules. \u201cThink about whether it\u2019s appropriate \u2013 if in a year or five years your child would be embarrassed by anything you\u2019ve done. And just why are you actually doing it? Is it a positive thing, or is it to give you a social boost as opposed to the children?\u201d Molly might appear to be at the opposite end of the spectrum from Tamasine Preece, who never posts, but the morals that underpin their behaviour are remarkably alike. And while Molly thinks \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t be posting pictures of kids in the bath\u201d, in some ways her posts are as exposing as Whitten\u2019s.</p> <p>Later that evening Molly emails to say that the conversation with Roman had troubled her. After I\u2019d left the house, she offered to take down the page, she says, but Roman said not to. \u201cTurns out he was confused in his room and was talking about not liking being lonely, and not his page.\u201d</p> <p>Or maybe Roman, in that moment, wished no one knew he was lonely. Then, later, when his mother checked, he minded less. Or maybe he understands that the community his mother has created has benefited him and his family. But these are only guesses. It is impossible to know. He is young, and the world changes many times a day. His parents have his best interests at heart, but like any who share news of their children, every time they post, they cross a line between privacy and publicity. Where each parent sees the line is an unsteady, unsettleable question. For Roman, and others like him, the truth may be something they are still working out, or simply prefer not to share.</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019ve gone online after a few glasses of wine and said things I shouldn\u2019t have\u2019: parents and children talk social media </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08a1eceb61b2b567c83fbe784ef07628311a5544\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08a1eceb61b2b567c83fbe784ef07628311a5544/0_0_5305_3537/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elaine Star (on left) and her daughter Sadie in the garden of their home their home in Kemp town, Brighton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Her posts can be really personal\u2019: Sadie Star with her mum, Elaine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Browning/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Elaine Star, 47, a PA and poet, and her youngest daughter Sadie, 17, a student, live in Brighton </strong><em><br></em></p> <p><strong>Elaine </strong>I\u2019ve had a Facebook account for about 10 years, so Sadie was probably seven when I first joined. I use it to keep in touch with different groups of people \u2013 old friends, my poetry group, the puppet show I work with. I\u2019m also friends with a lot of my kids\u2019 friends, because it\u2019s often the best way of locating where mine are. I don\u2019t think it bothers them. All their friends are happy to come to the house and sit around my kitchen table and chat, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s odd. I don\u2019t post on their friends\u2019 pages \u2013 maybe just a \u201cHappy birthday\u201d message. But I\u2019m really impressed by the sorts of things they share about science, politics \u2013 they\u2019re very funny and insightful.</p> <p>I have definitely made mistakes online. I\u2019ve gone on after a few glasses of wine and said things I shouldn\u2019t have. There have been some angry messages about the state my kids and their friends have left the house in. And they have all asked me to take down various photos. I get it: I\u2019m sensitive to the fact that they\u2019re trying to be cool or whatever.</p> <p>I think I\u2019m past the stage of worrying too much about embarrassing my kids. I write poems that are very personal, and I share them on Facebook. But that\u2019s how I express myself. The kids have occasionally said, \u201cStop living your life on Facebook\u201d but I\u2019m an open person.</p> <p>They\u2019re all fairly streetwise. We have a very open dialogue in our house. They have occasionally posted things that I think are a bit questionable \u2013 showing off a bit about drinking with their friends, that sort of thing. I might have said, \u201cHmm, you might want to think about that\u201d but I\u2019ve never said, \u201cTake that down.\u201d I\u2019m glad Facebook wasn\u2019t around to record my teenage years, though. I\u2019d hate it.</p> <p><strong>Sadie</strong> My siblings and I all use Facebook in different ways. Stevie posts a lot of pictures; Maisie likes to talk about stuff. Me and Joe post a lot of news stories, and I like posting videos or songs. I don\u2019t like to put up personal pictures, or get too emotional on Facebook. My mum\u2019s posts can be really personal.</p> <p>At the beginning, I didn\u2019t really want to be friends with her on Facebook. I didn\u2019t really want her seeing pictures of me that my friends had posted. They weren\u2019t anything bad; they just felt like a bit of my life that was separate from her. Now I don\u2019t mind as much \u2013 I\u2019m more open. She\u2019s also friends with a lot of my friends on there. That\u2019s not a problem, except that she\u2019s quite free with what she writes. Something would happen between us, and she\u2019d put it in a poem, and post it to Facebook, and I wondered whether my friends would see her in a different way. I think maybe I felt protective of her. But no one has ever said anything.</p> <p>She has a lot of photos of us when we were little. When I was a bit younger, I hated seeing some of them online. I remember there was one where I was holding my pet hamster and I just thought I looked greasy and rough. And once my room was really messy and my mum said, \u201cI\u2019ll take pictures and put it on Facebook.\u201d I would have hated it if she\u2019d actually done it. Now I\u2019m a bit older, I\u2019ve learned to let go of it all a bit more. I think I\u2019m OK with what\u2019s out there about me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"578f0779fb5404c4cc177d4e36aa289dba7ca232\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/578f0779fb5404c4cc177d4e36aa289dba7ca232/0_730_4725_5176/913.jpg\" alt=\"Nell Redelsperger-Talbot with her mother, Juliet, in their garden in Suffolk\" width=\"913\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I don\u2019t feel like the same person I was when I was little\u2019: Nell Redelsperger-Talbot <strong></strong>with her mother, Juliet.

One of my followers on Instagram, someone I knew, turned on me, then a couple of others who I\u2019d thought were friendly were making comments on my posts. It wasn\u2019t nice, and I wasn\u2019t sure how to handle it. In school they give you lessons about what to do if it happens to you, but when it comes to it, the reality is very different. But the school did deal with it.</p> <p>After that, I became a lot more careful about who I accept as friends, and what people can see. Now I have one account for my photography and a separate one for my closest friends.</p> <p>I have looked briefly at Mum\u2019s Facebook account, but I don\u2019t have a clue about how Facebook works. I don\u2019t think I mind that there are photos of me. If you know the people that can see those photos, then that\u2019s OK. If it\u2019s not private, I\u2019m not so sure about that. But I don\u2019t find it embarrassing. Maybe it\u2019s because I don\u2019t feel like the same person I was when I was little. It doesn\u2019t feel as if those pictures are of me.</p> <p><strong>Juliet</strong> The cyberbullying was a harrowing time for Nell, but what was good was that some of her friends were supportive and took screenshots of the comments as proof of what was happening. Nell was worried I would be angry, so she didn\u2019t come to me until after it was over. It was awful, but in a way, I think it helped her understand what you\u2019re exposed to online.</p> <p>Nell is a great photographer, and she sends me pictures, but I<strong> </strong>check that she is happy before I post anything on Facebook. Your children have every right to veto what you put online, although they have to be a certain age before they understand what it means. Neither of mine have ever had an issue with something I\u2019ve posted, but then they\u2019re the generation that are used to having photos of themselves everywhere. I think it meant something different for my generation. It took so long to get photos developed that seeing yourself was so much more important.</p> <p>The children were very little when I first signed up. I don\u2019t remember thinking much about privacy then. It wasn\u2019t until I read in the paper how posts about your children might be seen by complete strangers that I changed my settings.</p> <p>As time went by, I began to feel uncomfortable about posting. It felt like everything online was becoming more about \u201cLook how wonderful I am\u201d and it made me feel quite down. So I left for a while. Eventually I rejoined because it was hard to keep up with everything. So now I\u2019ve started again but in a very different way.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s been sad and moving, the outpouring of anguish that has greeted an apology from the Catholic church for its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/04/after-a-lifetime-of-loss-church-apology-is-too-little-too-late\" title=\"\">adoption policy</a> during the 1950s, 60s and 70s.

Even a \u201cdivorcee\u201d with children was looked upon with a mixture of pity, disdain and sneaking admiration. So there are many more of these awful tales than we have heard.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t surprising that for so many of the people affected by this policy, the apology means little. It has come in the wake of great societal change. The people taught the church the error of its ways, not the other way round. It\u2019s good that the church acknowledges that what it did, again and again and again, was grotesque. One rather suspects, however, that the apology has been made to allow the church to draw a line under the matter as much as to make amends.</p> <p>It\u2019s astounding, of course, that such moralistic barbarity was occurring on these shores just 40 years ago. In truth, the girls who had their babies taken were simply the most egregious example of general attitudes that insisted not only that the sole fulfilling role for a woman was to be a mother, but also that the context in which motherhood could be attained was narrow, prescriptive and financially dependent. My own mother, who married at 26 and had her first baby within the year, said many times that before she met my father, people feared that she had been \u201cleft on the shelf\u201d. My mother had feared it too. In the early 1960s, a first baby at 27 was considered rather elderly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The idea that a woman has plenty of time to establish her career before starting a family is beloved of feminism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet, even though a revolution in attitudes to women and their babies has been achieved since the last home for morally repugnant teenage sex maniacs closed, the motherhood issue remains fairly fraught.</p> <p>Women have escaped from the ghastly idea that they must find a partner and start a family, strictly in that order, so that they can properly begin their lives. But they haven\u2019t escaped from the uncomfortable fact that in one respect the church was right. Biologically, the perfect time to have babies is when you\u2019re in your 20s. The church didn\u2019t go around controlling the lives and reproduction of women without keeping a shrewd eye on what served it best, in the way of producing a new generation of recruits.</p> <p>The sad stories of reproductive regret and anguish are different now; but they\u2019re still around. This week, the <a href=\"http://www.hfea.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority</a> announced that the number of babies born through IVF in the UK has now passed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/04/more-than-250000-uk-babies-born-ivf\" title=\"\">quarter of a million mark</a>.

The latest figures put the proportion of treatments that result in a live birth at 26%. The procedure leaves a lot of people bitterly disappointed; and the older you get, the more likely you are to suffer. The proportion of successful treatments is 14% for women aged 40-42; just 5% for women aged 43-44; and a crushing 2% for women aged 45 and over.</p> <p>The idea that a woman has plenty of time to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/24/is-it-getting-tougher-for-women-to-have-babies-and-careers\" title=\"\">establish her career</a> before starting a family is beloved of feminism. Biology\u2019s not so keen. In fact, biology is even less keen than these figures let on. We know that female ova are present in the female body from birth. I spent my youth believing that they sat there, undamaged by time and environment until their turn came for a go at fertilisation. But that was just silly.</p> <p>Everyone knows, and has known for years, that the older the mother, the greater the risk of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/downs-syndrome\" title=\"\">Down\u2019s syndrome</a>. But little bits and pieces of research have been floating around for years, warning that the risk of various learning disabilities, including <a href=\"http://drexel.edu/now/archive/2014/April/Autism-Risk-Older-Parents/\" title=\"\">autism</a>, gets higher the older the parents are. It\u2019s not uncommon to see families in which learning and social difficulties become more pronounced in the younger children.</p> <p>None of this is what ambitious young women want to hear. Of course, people like to believe they have many choices in their lives and that starting a family shouldn\u2019t have to be something that\u2019s factored in at an early stage in adulthood, like it was in the days when such preoccupations were considered the absolute centre of female existence.</p> <p>But plenty of women find themselves surveying their years spent putting themselves through a string of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/sep/27/ivf-where-all-grief-going\" title=\"\">unsuccessful IVF treatments</a> and wish someone had told them how things might turn out, back at a time when they still had their choices to make. I wish it wasn\u2019t so. But it is.</p> <p>Of all the testimony from the women whose babies were taken, most touching are the stories of reconciliation. These women didn\u2019t nurture their children as babies and didn\u2019t see them growing up. But they did get to know them and to love them. Which is something.</p> <p>Women fear being put back in their box, treated as reproductive vessels who have to follow strict rules in order to be allowed to achieve their mothering destiny. Sometimes, however, the tendency is to see realism as an attempt to regain control over women, their bodies and their choices. But we retain control over our own bodies by heeding the rules of nature \u2013 not of church, establishment or man.</p>",

Instead, what needs to happen is a small act of corporate generosity \u2013 a token of gratitude to the climate, the landscape and the society that enabled both the picture to be painted and the fortunes of its present owners, the drinks business Diageo, to be made.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/02/scottish-painting-monarch-of-the-glen-edwin-landseer-abroad-auction\">Scottish painting Monarch of the Glen could end up abroad</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Landseer and the modern whisky industry achieved their early success around the same time. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2008/may/21/6\">The painter</a>, the son of an engraver, was a Londoner who made his first visit to Scotland in 1824, aged 22. A year earlier, the British government had <a href=\"http://www.scotch-whisky.org.uk/understanding-scotch/history-of-scotch-whisky/\">passed the Excise Act</a>, which by legalising whisky distilling in exchange for a \u00a310 licence gave the business a respectability that illicit stills and smuggling had denied it. Technical developments in the same decade made production more reliable, with a consistent quality of spirit. Sold now in branded casks and bottles, the sales of Scottish whisky took off in England and then the empire. By the end of the 19th century, after the phylloxera epidemic ruined French vineyards (and consequently the trade in cognac as well as wine), it had become a fashionable drink around the world.</p> <p>What helped sell scotch was the vogue for Scotland and wild Scottish things, which no painter did more to promote than Landseer. In London his pictures of animals had established him as an artistic prodigy. Almost as soon as he could walk, his father had set him to work drawing the cows and sheep that then populated the fields beside what\u2019s now the Finchley Road; aged 13, he had two pictures accepted by the Royal Academy. Pets \u2013 dogs, especially \u2013 were a lucrative subject, and Landseer grew popular with their aristocratic owners. He became the lover of one of them, the voluptuary Georgiana, Duchess of Bedford, and the father of the last two of her 10 children. He set foot in Scotland with no firm purpose \u2013 he went as the companion to a young fellow painter who wanted to paint Sir Walter Scott\u2019s portrait \u2013 but fell in love with the landscape. A mutual love of dogs cemented a valuable friendship with Scott, while the Duchess of Bedford\u2019s Highland estate introduced him to a new enthusiasm among the titled rich for deerstalking.</p> <p>According to his biographer, Campbell Lennie, Landseer had until that point faced a likely future \u201cas a parlour painter of lapdogs\u201d. In Scotland, on rugged and treeless stretches of land mysteriously known as \u201cdeer forests\u201d \u2013 sometimes originally cleared of people in favour of sheep, more recently of sheep in favour of deer \u2013 he found what Lennie says was \u201calmost a reaffirmation of his manhood\u201d in a new lease of art. Landseer moved from his dog phase to his deer phase, and would eventually complete his three-act career with his lion phase, most famously the four in bronze that guard Nelson\u2019s column in Trafalgar Square.</p> <p>His fondness for animals endeared him to the greatest advocate for the Highlands and Highland-ism, Queen Victoria, who appreciated his jokes and anecdotes as well as the blighting sentimentalism of his pictures, though the last came hand-in-hand with a relish for cruelty that was shared by the painter, the queen and her consort. In Germany, Prince Albert had joined \u201cdeer-drives\u201d in which beaters scared herds of deer into enclosures where they were slaughtered by riflemen from a platform, with wives looking on and a small orchestra playing close by to compete with, and with luck to drown out, the squeals of dying animals.</p> <p>Stalking in Scotland gave the deer more of a chance, but the intent to kill was the same. \u201cThere is something in the toil and trouble, the wild heather and the savage scenery, that makes butchers of us all,\u201d Landseer wrote to a friend. \u201cIt was a most exciting sight,\u201d Victoria noted in her diary, after watching her husband stand over a wounded stag with a gun and finish him off.</p> <p>Many Landseer pictures came out of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/may/09/edwin-landseer-otter-speared-exhibition\">these bloody scenes</a> and confused, contradictory moods, but the most famous of them was also the least typical. The Monarch of the Glen is a tranquil picture with no suggestion of violence. The stag stands imperious and alone against a background of peaks and cloud, close-up and, to enhance his majesty, seen slightly from below. Landseer painted it in 1850-51 as part of a commission for a triptych of panels intended to decorate the House of Lords refreshment room in Charles Barry\u2019s new Palace of Westminster, but parliament jibbed at the price of 1000 guineas (\u00a31050) for the three, including The Monarch, and the picture went instead to Lord Londesborough for a few hundred guineas.</p> <p>From his collection it started on its long journey towards Diageo. Londesborough sold it to Lord Fitzgerald, who sold it Lord Cheylesmore, who sold it in 1916 to Thomas Dewar, who adopted the stag as a branding device for the Dewar family\u2019s whisky business in Perthshire. The Distillers company bought Dewar\u2019s in 1925 and was in turn bought by Guinness in 1986, which merged with Grand Metropolitan to become Diageo in 1997. Diageo sold the Dewar\u2019s brand to Bacardi the next year, but retained the Landseer in the deal and soon after gave it on loan to the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh, which has displayed it in the 17 years since.</p> <p>Why does <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/diageo\">Diageo</a> want to sell? The company says its priority is to ensure all its assets \u201care focused on growing our business and delivering value for our employees, shareholders and the communities where we operate\u201d. The painting had \u201cno direct link to our business or brands\u201d.</p> <p>The last statement conflicts with the historical record: the whisky business and stags have gone together ever since men first crawled though the heather with guns and hip flasks, and the painting has been owned by one whisky company or another since 1916 (currently by one that has a 37% share of the global market in scotch, which sells \u2013 to quote from the Diageo website \u2013 25,000 bottles of Johnnie Walker in every hour of every day). But then a lot about Diageo is slightly incredible. We might forgive the name \u2013 it came after all from a marketing consultancy, Wolff Olins \u2013 but the company goes too far when it says it takes this combination of the Latin word for day with the Greek for world \u201cto mean every day, everywhere, people celebrate with our brands\u201d.</p> <p>They do, however, drink a lot of them. In the last financial year, <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjb1ZOPnY_QAhXGuBoKHU9xC-EQFggbMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.diageo.com%2FLists%2FResources%2FAttachments%2F2814%2FDiageo%2520Interactive%2520AR2015.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNHTu4dYLetVEOWirQhUVr9yrwZsjg&amp;bvm=bv.137901846,d.d2s&amp;cad=rja\">Diageo made an operating profit</a> of \u00a33bn on net sales of \u00a310.8bn and paid its chief executive, Ivan Menezes, \u00a34.4m. In other words, if The Monarch of the Glen fetches \u00a310m at Christie\u2019s next month, that sum minus the seller\u2019s premium will be eaten up by Menezes\u2019s remuneration within two years. Feeding old masters into the boilers of luxury liners to keep the steam up is an image that comes to mind.</p> <p>No, any business with a sense of history would give the picture to a public gallery in Scotland, the place without which both the business and the picture would be nothing.

  "<p>Tomorrow morning at about 10am, Ruth Devlin will take her treasured video tape, the Cosmopolitan step aerobic workout, out of its case, slide it into the player and press play. On a freestanding aerobic step in the middle of her living room in Stockport, she will march, lunge and squat her way through the hour, mirroring every move of the woman on the screen, exactly as she has done almost every Sunday morning for the past 23 years.</p> <p>When she started, this was the one pocket of me-time in the busy life of a working mum with two children under six. She decided to do it weekly, and has never stopped. The regime has seen her through the birth of her third child, divorce, an emptying nest, and becoming a grandma. Over the decades, she has bought a second copy of the video and also had it converted to DVD, just in case.</p> <p>Now 57, she looks more like she\u2019s in her early 40s, her cropped blond hair framing a slim, genial, lively face. \u201cI\u2019m a stone over my fighting weight, but I pride myself on being fairly fit \u2013 I can still go for a walk up a hill without passing out with breathlessness,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The woman in the video is the dark-haired, long-legged Gloria Thomas: Cosmo girl, Pirelli calendar girl, and Bond girl (sort of \u2013 she appeared in the opening credits of A View To A Kill). At least, that\u2019s who she was a quarter of a century ago. Devlin found herself wondering what had become of the glamorous instructor whose every step she had loyally mimicked for so many years, and she wrote to the Guardian, describing her routine. Whatever happened to her guru?</p> <p>Thomas has since moved to Australia and changed her name to Glori Gylsson. When the two grandmothers finally meet for the first time over Skype, there is so much giggling and warmth that it feels more like a reunion than an introduction. Devlin says: \u201cYou do feel familiar in a funny kind of way, it\u2019s very odd. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m meeting someone brand new.\u201d She tells Gylsson she looks exactly the same as in the video \u2013 and holds up the box to prove it. Gylsson laughs: \u201cEverything else has gone south, but my legs are still the same!\u201d</p> <p>It was her training as a fitness instructor combined with her experience as a model and TV presenter that meant Gylsson was selected out of the 300 women who auditioned to present the Cosmopolitan workout videos. She is now 55 and an author, living with her third husband and running <a href=\"http://www.glorigylsson.com/\">a health website</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Mr Motivator has me strutting, marching, jumping, squatting. \u2018Don\u2019t give up on me, Moya,\u2019 he shouts</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She asks Devlin why she has kept going with the same video. \u201cIt gives me the kind of workout which gets the endorphins going, which is what I need because I\u2019ve got quite a stressful job in PR,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s intensive \u2013 I\u2019m usually shouting at you \u2013 but I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m going to die and never do it again.\u201d</p> <p>In our age of #fitspiration, yoga poses on surfboards, Fitbits, absurdly expensive gyms and athleisure wear, it can feel like our priority is not so much that exercise is done, but that it is seen to be done. But it was not so long ago that members of the British public would wake up to see fitness stars exercising on their TV screens every morning, following along in the privacy of their front rooms. TV exercise has disappeared (to YouTube and Instagram) and morning TV is now dominated by chefs such as<a href=\"http://www.jamesmartinchef.co.uk/\"> James Martin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/sep/06/ginos-italian-escape-review-gino-d-acampo-chef-florence\">Gino D\u2019Acampo</a>.</p> <p>Fitness today is a tale of two extremes. At one end, the UK exercise industry is <a href=\"http://www.leisuredb.com/blog/2016/5/11/press-release-2016-state-of-the-uk-fitness-industry-report\">worth \u00a34.4bn, with one in every seven people holding a gym membership</a>. At the other end, research shows that 58% of women and 65% of men are overweight or obese. In 2014/15, more than one in three children in Year 6 were overweight or obese.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Getting fit felt very different in 1983, when the elegant, leggy, leotard-clad <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th5m6e1ydSg\">Green Goddess</a> on the BBC became a more accessible, British version of American home fitness superstar <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO5CUVPON1k\">Jane Fonda</a>. Her popularity led the rival TV-am (which broadcast ITV breakfast television from 1983 to 1992, before GMTV) to bring in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vMJMw19iyk\">Mad Lizzie</a>, with her curly blond hair, bright jumpers and very 80s dance routines. Then, in 1993, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glprjNv-r8k\">Mr Motivator</a> arrived, the man in Lycra who made everyone say \u201cYeah!\u201d</p> <p>Sixteen years after he left our screens, Mr Motivator (real name Derrick Evans) continues to have a hold on millennials. He was on TV so regularly, he feels familiar, just like Gylsson is to Devlin. His infectious enthusiasm, his easy-to-follow but unchoreographed workouts, and the trademark multicoloured outfits turned him into a cult figure. His name takes us back to a simpler time. He is our Proust\u2019s madeleine, in Lycra.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9eb64b2f72027ec4991ae6a79ffbc66c008065b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9eb64b2f72027ec4991ae6a79ffbc66c008065b/0_220_3744_3421/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mr Motivator portrait\" width=\"1000\" height=\"914\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mr Motivator was an instant hit. The GMTV phone lines were jammed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ilka &amp; Franz for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We meet in Harrow leisure centre, where Evans\u2019 career in fitness began. He is immediately recognisable in bright blue, patterned, pyjama-style silk trousers and a matching blue kufi-style hat. His white vest shows off his broad, muscular shoulders \u2013 he has an incredible physique for a man in his 40s, but he is 63.</p> <p>We go for a workout in the gym. He turns on the music and starts shouting in my face, \u201cWho do you think I am? Your daddy?\u201d It is surreal. He has me strutting, marching, jumping, squatting, thrusting and moving my behind in a circular motion. \u201cDon\u2019t give up on me, Moya,\u201d he shouts. And I don\u2019t.</p> <p>It was here in 1983 that he was playing badminton with a friend when he heard a noise coming from a sports hall. \u201cI wandered over and there were 200 women all moving to music, copying an instructor, and I stood there transfixed \u2013 it was like, \u2018bing!\u2019, a lightbulb moment.\u201d That sparked a passion for exercising to music. Then one day he found himself on a plane with the presenter Eamonn Holmes and talked himself into becoming his personal trainer \u2013 which later led him to the man who would give him his first break.</p> <p>\u201cI was waiting outside the GMTV studios when I saw a gentleman walking to the door with this big fat belly. I walked over and prodded him right there in his middle. To this day I don\u2019t know what drew me to do it, but I did. He stormed off \u2013 it was only afterwards I found out he was Peter McHugh, the programme controller at GMTV.\u201d The next day, Evans delivered an exercise bike to McHugh\u2019s office, and convinced him to train with him. After about four weeks, McHugh\u2019s fitness had improved so much he was able to continue a conversation while working out, and he told Evans, \u201cAny person who could convince me to start exercising could get the public to do the same. I am going to give you a chance to be on screen.\u201d There were still the advertisers to convince: they said that a black man doing exercise on television would not work.</p> <p>So he waited, and when he finally got a chance to go on air, he was an instant hit. The phone lines were jammed with people calling in to sing his praises. Before long Mr Motivator was so popular with viewers that he was appearing every half hour, not only doing exercise but other things such as reading out birthday messages. A survey at the height of his fame showed that 95% of people in the UK knew who Mr Motivator was and saw him as trustworthy.</p> <p>Derrick Evans\u2019 self-published autobiography, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Warm-Up-behind-televisions-Motivator-ebook/dp/B01BE4Q8T2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1477479266&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+warm+up%3A+the+story+behind+the+lycra\">The Warm Up: The Story Behind The Lycra</a>, tells the story of his life pre-Mr Motivator. Born in Jamaica, he was given away by his mother at three months old to a couple whom he came to see as his true parents. His childhood has moments of joy and of trauma: he walks to school barefoot and content, looks fine in his \u201cSunday best\u201d. He relates being sexually abused by a family friend, and whipped by his adoptive father, whom he later joins for a new life in Leicester, England, leaving his loving adopted mother behind (she didn\u2019t want to move from Jamaica).</p> <p>Evans left GMTV in 2003 because he wanted to move back to Jamaica with his family, but he still performs as Mr Motivator at festivals, as well as running an adventure tourism business in Jamaica, H\u2019Evans Scent, and fronting campaigns such as the public health campaign <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/change4life/Pages/why-change-for-life.aspx\">Change4life</a>. He hasn\u2019t lost his appeal: \u201cAll the decision-makers out there now are the people who grew up with me,\u201d he says. He shows me a video of 30,000 festival-goers cheering his name, one holds a sign that says, \u201cI\u2019m only here for Mr Motivator\u201d. In his memoir, he writes, \u201cThere is a power when you stand in front of an audience and you realise that they will move however you want them to.\u201d He is not ready to give that up, and he believes he still has a crucial role to play in our lives \u2013 now more than ever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8214719ddcfaaf6302ab6e9b18e0c9e0312fc340\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8214719ddcfaaf6302ab6e9b18e0c9e0312fc340/203_625_3092_3864/800.jpg\" alt=\"The Green Goddess\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Green Goddess: \u2018I got Joe Bloggs, children and old people moving.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ilka &amp; Franz for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He argues that while clean-eating, extreme gymming and social-media-friendly fitness fads are popular with a certain sector of society, we\u2019ve lost the idea that exercise can and should be a part of everyone\u2019s day. As Evans puts it, \u201cThere\u2019s a place for the Instagram stars, but what about the 95%? The 95% don\u2019t do it. I want to be the one to create that environment to help them because unless we do, our NHS will not be able to cope.\u201d A <a href=\"http://w3.lesmills.com/in-your-club/west-coast/en/news/fitness-is-the-world%E2%80%99s-biggest-sport/\">recent survey</a> found that millennials make up 48% of all adult regular exercisers, while baby boomers make up 20%.</p> <p>There would have been no Mr Motivator without the Green Goddess, aka Diana Moran. We meet in a cafe in Ashford, Surrey, not far from where she lives. She exudes old-school glamour and speaks softly, so I have to lean in and concentrate on what she\u2019s saying.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The concept took off almost immediately. 'The navy wanted me to come and train \"our boys\", it was extraordinary'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She was a presenter for a regional television station and teaching keep-fit classes in Butlin\u2019s on her days off when she was approached by the BBC with a radical idea. It wanted her to present a seven-minute segment, five times a week, to bring exercise into breakfast television. The concept took off almost immediately: \u201cIt just took the public\u2019s fancy,\u201d she says. \u201cThe navy wanted me to come and train \u2018our boys\u2019, the nurses wanted me to come and train \u2018our girls\u2019, it was extraordinary.\u201d</p> <p>Why does she think she was so successful? \u201cI got Joe Bloggs, children and old people moving. Children were amused by me, and granny and grandad \u2013 the grandads in particular \u2013 were quite happy to sit and watch,\u201d she says, with a conspiratorial smile. She had a particular connection with the mothers who watched her: \u201cThey soon realised I wasn\u2019t a dancer of 22, but a 43-year-old mum with two sons in their 20s, so there was a bit of respect there. I was the start of an awareness of the value of keeping fit, which was really new and exciting \u2013 particularly showing women that they could do it as well as the blokes going to the gym. We really were getting Britain fit.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb8d1a2685eed97c59b3005bf0c7e8b17742306f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb8d1a2685eed97c59b3005bf0c7e8b17742306f/325_162_3132_5233/599.jpg\" alt=\"Green Goddess\" width=\"599\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I wasn\u2019t a dancer of 22, but a 43-year-old mum, so there was respect there.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ilka &amp; Franz for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everything was filmed live, so it didn\u2019t always go smoothly. \u201cOn one occasion, we were filming at an upmarket London tennis club, and I was taking a group of men through a routine on the tennis court. I was performing to camera at the front, with men either side of the net behind me \u2013 I couldn\u2019t see them. They were doing very deep knee bends. I looked up to camera and I said, innocently, \u2018As you can all see we\u2019re having great fun here. It\u2019s not only balls that are bouncing on the court this morning, it\u2019s the members, too.\u2019 Everyone was struggling not to laugh, and I had no idea.\u201d</p> <p>While the Green Goddess was pulling in serious viewing figures, Lizzie Webb was teaching her own style of funky dance at Covent Garden dance centre. She tells me, \u201cAfter one class this girl came up to me and said, \u2018You don\u2019t know who I am, but I\u2019m PA to Greg Dyke, and he\u2019s just taken over at TV-am. The Green Goddess is on the BBC, and he wants somebody totally different. I told him you make exercise and dance fun, and you\u2019re mad.\u2019\u201d And that\u2019s how she became Mad Lizzie.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"642b664b6f998be7cde32c45a70de5b34dbb5503\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/642b664b6f998be7cde32c45a70de5b34dbb5503/357_400_3387_5059/669.jpg\" alt=\"Lizzie Webb has dedicated her life to fitness.\" width=\"669\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lizzie Webb: \u2018After one class this girl came up to me and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know who I am, but I\u2019m PA to Greg Dyke, and he\u2019s just taken over at TV-am.\u201d\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ilka &amp; Franz for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She had the job on TV-am for nearly 10 years (longer than Moran and Evans) and she mixed with famous faces from John Travolta (who did not join in her routine) to prime minister Ted Heath (who sat at the piano and did some hand exercises). She became an influential figure, particularly when it came to musical acts. \u201cSimon Cowell would send me music by his artists, like Sinitta, and if I choreographed the routine right, I could get that music into the charts. Which is what I did with Take That. Not that they admit it.\u201d</p> <p>She choreographed and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulXRS383KWE\">recorded a dance routine with them to their single It Only Takes A Minute</a>, and it was broadcast six times in one week. It became their first hit, reaching number seven in the charts. \u201cI have a fax from their record plugger, Nicki Chapman, saying, \u2018Thank you Lizzie, I know for a fact they have moved up through the charts through being on your show.\u2019 That\u2019s how powerful it was. It\u2019s not actually acknowledged by the band, though.\u201d She\u2019s seen the footage used in various shows as a cheesy, embarrassing moment from the band\u2019s past. \u201cYou can be in fashion and out of fashion.\u201d</p> <p>A successful career in TV was not the path Webb ever expected she would take. Her ambition was to teach disadvantaged children. \u201cWhen I left college I asked the Inner London Education Authority to give me the worst school they could find.\u201d She was sent to a boys\u2019 comprehensive in Clapham Common, where she started a drama and dance club in the lunch hours and evenings. From that school, she says, blushing with pride, one boy went on to become a member of Hot Gossip with Arlene Phillips, another became the first black dancer in the English National Ballet, a third is working on one of the biggest programmes in the US, <a href=\"http://www.fox.com/so-you-think-you-can-dance/\">So You Think You Can Dance</a>, and a fourth became a theatre director in the West End of London.</p> <p>She has dedicated her career to fitness. Now 68, she runs an organisation called <a href=\"http://creativityinsport.com/\">Creativity In Sport</a>, with Debbie Flood, the Olympic rowing silver medallist. They work with disadvantaged young adults who have no academic qualifications, training them to become the teachers of disadvantaged children, using exercise, sport and dance. They also go into schools, using the character Webb created, Joggy Bear, to teach maths and English using exercise.</p> <p>Moran, now 77, is also using exercise to help those less fortunate. After four and a half years as the Green Goddess, there was a change of editors, and Moran lost her regular slot. Soon after that she was diagnosed with breast cancer, at 48. \u201cIt changes your whole life. You throw out the trivia, and you concentrate on what you think is important. For me it was family, and looking after one\u2019s health. You realise you\u2019ve got limitations, and it makes you empathetic to those whose movements aren\u2019t as they would like them to be.\u201d</p> <p>That led her to make exercise videos aimed at people in their 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s, and she is working on a book with the doctor Sir Muir Gray, called Sod Sitting, Get Moving to be published in the new year. She also presents a weekly radio programme on The Wireless, a digital radio station run by Age UK.</p> <p>Evans, too, is a long way from retirement. He feels this is just the beginning \u2013 hence the title of his memoir, The Warm Up. He is waiting for the opportunity to come back on our screens, and wants to lead a more serious fitness and health talkshow. Why hasn\u2019t he? \u201cThere is a stereotypical way people in the industry have placed me: Motivator is the entertainer, he gets people laughing, makes them feel good. They don\u2019t realise that there\u2019s a deeper side to me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2950e11d59391bfa74d77cf399d4b8761ab9cc16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2950e11d59391bfa74d77cf399d4b8761ab9cc16/0_1261_3744_4090/915.jpg\" alt=\"Mad Lizzie\" width=\"915\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Simon Cowell would send me music by his artists.

Look at what happened to Mouhcine.\u201d</p> <p>When Fikri died, parallels were quickly drawn with Mohamed Bouazizi, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/20/tunisian-fruit-seller-mohammed-bouazizi\">Tunisian fruit seller who set himself on fire</a> after the police confiscated his goods, triggering the Arab spring. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19ed3d3682454056f71c02c3501c0369204aa800\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19ed3d3682454056f71c02c3501c0369204aa800/0_0_4096_2727/1000.jpg\" alt=\"COP22\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Climate of protest</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abdelhak Senna/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Yugerten explained that this is not a new movement, or one that is seeking to overthrow the government, but part of an ongoing fight for some semblance of democracy.

  "<p>For the past two months, Sattar, 22, has been living in a ditch 30 miles (48km) inland from Calais, attempting to return to Reading, where he spent nine years of his life, studied for his GCSEs and earned distinctions in a college course in business, travel and tourism.</p> <p>The ditch where he was sheltering last week is so well hidden behind blackberry bushes, in a dip between two fields, that most people in the nearby village are unaware it is home to about 25 Afghans. Most of the refugees are new arrivals in Europe, fleeing instability in Afghanistan in the hope of finding jobs and security in Britain. Some, like Sattar, are making the journey for a second time, caught up in the labyrinthine complexities of the UK immigration system.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/oct/31/what-the-calais-refugees-left-behind-in-pictures\">What the Calais refugees left behind \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With Calais authorities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/02/calais-refugee-children-evacuated-as-camp-clearance-winds-up\">declaring the refugee camp closed</a> this week, and demolition crews bulldozing the remaining shacks on the sandy wasteland, the crisis has not been solved, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/29/wine-village-burgundy-refugees-temporary-home-france-calais\">merely shifted to other locations</a>. Clusters of refugees remain hidden from authorities across northern France, determined to continue their attempts to reach the UK.</p> <p>Sattar arrived in Britain as a 13-year-old refugee sent across Europe by his parents, away from Taliban-related violence in Afghanistan\u2019s Logar province. He was given discretionary leave to remain and settled with a foster family, whom he loved and who supported him through the considerable difficulties of going to secondary school without speaking English. </p> <p>He worked hard at Chiltern Edge school in Oxfordshire, where he says he received extra lessons in English, got through his GCSEs and passed his BTecs with distinction. But when Sattar reached 17-and-a-half, at which age the government routinely reviews longer term applications to remain, officials ruled that since Kabul was relatively safe, he would be fine to return home. </p> <p>\u201cThe judge told me \u2018You have GCSEs, you are educated, you will easily find a job there\u2019,\u201d he said. By the time the decision was made, Sattar had been in the UK for six years, spoke the language flawlessly and felt English. His family in Afghanistan told him it would not be safe to return home, so he appealed the judgment, but was rejected and obliged to leave Britain.</p> <p>He briefly went to Italy, where he was shocked to see refugees sleeping in railway stations, before returning to France, determined to get back to the UK and launch a fresh appeal. He has settled in a tent in this muddy gully in rural France so he can make nightly attempts to get on UK-bound lorries parked next to the motorway nearby.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ec1c478ab24929e0f1f4a3be3ffdd4cc70a9bd8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ec1c478ab24929e0f1f4a3be3ffdd4cc70a9bd8/0_346_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Refugee looks out into a field from a makeshift camp\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A refugee stands in one of many encampments that have sprung up in the countryside around Calais and Dunkirk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite attempts by French and British authorities to resolve the buildup of refugees near the ports of northern France, thousands remain in the area, committed to joining family and friends in Britain. </p> <p>Many are hidden in small camps like Sattar\u2019s, in fields, garages or derelict buildings.

The last days of the Calais refugee camp</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Camp officials would not release the precise number of inhabitants and the formal position is that the site is closed to newcomers. But volunteers distributing food and aid say there has been a sharp rise in the number of people arriving and note that huts designed to accommodate four people are often housing twice as many.</p> <p>Christian Salom\u00e9, the president of refugee charity L\u2019Auberge des Migrants, who has been working on the issue for the past 24 years, said clearing the Calais camp did not mean the crisis was over. \u201cIt will come again. about 97% of the people who come are fleeing war, and those wars continue, particularly in Iraq. Until the demolition, 40 people were arriving every day. They will continue to come,\u201d he said.</p> <p>This week, there was a heavy police presence guarding motorways around Calais, and police in Paris were making checks on people without papers trying to board trains and buses for northern France. But Salom\u00e9 expects a surge in the number of people arriving in Calais a month from now, by which time the 6,000 taken by bus to temporary accommodation last week have been told they must move on, either by claiming asylum or returning home.</p> <p>Although the Calais camp has been demolished, it is not possible to extinguish the desire many refugees have to travel to the UK, Salom\u00e9 said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t want to claim asylum in France, they will have to leave the centres. They can\u2019t be deported back to their countries if there is a war there. There is no possibility for them to work in France. They will continue to come to Calais,\u201d he said.</p> <p>For the moment, refugees who chose not to take buses to French reception centres are at pains to stay hidden from authorities. The camp in the ditch is remote enough to avoid the attention of police. The Afghans who live there have no desire to claim asylum in France.</p> <p>\u201cIn Paris, I saw people who have been given 10 years leave to remain in France, who are still sleeping in the park and sitting outside churches asking for money. That\u2019s not a life,\u201d Sattar said. His belief that he stands a better chance of working in the UK has fuelled his determination to return. So far, he has twice climbed into lorries on the motorway, but was discovered at the port both times.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a2062655de5990971e0b410ac217b472475f862\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a2062655de5990971e0b410ac217b472475f862/0_198_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People play football at a government-approved refugee camp near Dunkirk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People play football at a government-approved refugee camp near Dunkirk. Many choose to hide from authorities.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sattar is very attached to England. \u201cIn Reading, I had the best time of my life. I grew up there,\u201d he said. After college he got a job at a poultry factory in Birmingham. \u201cIt was a very good job,\u201d he said. Sattar has not told his family in Afghanistan that he has had to leave Britain.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt would break their hearts. Whenever I call them, I say I am safe, having a good life,\u201d he said. But living in the ditch could not accurately be described as such. \u201cIt\u2019s not good here. When it rains, your clothes get wet, it\u2019s muddy everywhere,\u201d he said, warming himself against the cold, sitting by a small open fire made of branches collected from nearby woods.</p> <p>He has also not told his foster family or friends where he is. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make them upset. They think I am in Birmingham,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody knows what I went through and what I am going through.\u201d Sattar despairs at the UK asylum system, which first embraced and then expelled him.</p> <p>But his situation is not particularly unusual. Namitullah Echkzei, 23, from Kunduz in Afghanistan, came to Britain as a child refugee and was educated at Waltham Forest college in north-east London. He is also living in the dip between the fields. His brother was granted asylum in the UK, but for reasons he does not fully understand, his application was not accepted.</p> <p>\u201cThe Taliban threatened our family. We faced the same problems. They rejected me, but my brother was accepted,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say it is safe, but Kunduz is not safe.\u201d He is also hoping to return to the UK, to the flat where his brother lives in Walthamstow, to contest the decision.</p> <p>Doctors of the World makes weekly visits to the ditch to see how people are coping. Staff at the charity regularly have to take people from the camp to hospital with broken bones and sprains, particularly ankles and wrists, the result of falls from moving lorries during their night-time attempts to get to the UK.</p> <p>Food is distributed by local volunteers. The men, some of whom have been living here for a year, look unhealthy and exhausted, and complain of brutal treatment at the hands of police whenever they are picked up near the motorway. \u201cWe had our own lives in Afghanistan, we had families, houses, jobs. Now we are in a ditch \u2013 with no future, no job. We want a solution quickly,\u201d said a former baker who left his home in Afghanistan after receiving death threats.</p> <p>Steve Bedlam, one of the founders of Refugee Community Kitchen, which has been providing food in the area for the past year, said volunteers were aware of a few informal camps popping up, but refugees were so anxious to avoid police attention that they usually refused offers of help. \u201cVolunteers are wonderful, but they bring attention and authorities. Mostly they say they don\u2019t want any help, because they don\u2019t want the attention, but some people are taking small food parcels to them,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Volunteers at Grande-Synthe said they had seen a \u201csteady trickle\u201d of arrivals from Calais, Paris and elsewhere. Until recently, the population was mostly Kurdish, with many families, and more than 120 children, living in about 300 wooden shelters on a patch of land sandwiched between a motorway and a railway line. Recently there have been arrivals from Pakistan and Vietnam. Conditions are better than they were in Calais, but there is no electricity and the health of residents, particularly children, is deteriorating as winter arrives.</p> <p>With conflicts continuing in the Middle East and Africa, the flow of people escaping violence is unlikely to let up, said Florence Vanderborght, a field supervisor at Doctors of the World. \u201cLast year, the population of asylum seekers in Dunkirk rose from 300 to 3,000 between August and October. We didn\u2019t see it coming. It can be very quick,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<h2>How do I become an agony aunt? I\u2019ve tried using social media but it hasn\u2019t worked</h2> <p><strong>As you are something of an agony uncle, I am seeking your advice on how to become an agony aunt.</strong></p> <p><strong>All my life I have helped others with their problems. I have tried hard to find out how I can do this publicly. I have started my own Facebook and Twitter pages, but have been unsuccessful so far. Any tips or advice you could offer would be gratefully received.</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>I\u2019d like to know in what way your Facebook and Twitter pages have been unsuccessful \u2013 there\u2019s nearly always something constructive to be learned from failure. But you have more than failure to guide you. You say that all your life you have helped others with their problems, so you must have some fairly clear ideas about the kind of advice that has been most useful. Adapting this experience to your online presence makes obvious sense, but I imagine you\u2019ve done this already.</p> <p>As for the advice itself, a surprising number of people\u2019s problems stem from their failure to see things through the eyes of others. They are genuinely baffled, and often upset, because a friend, partner, boss or colleague doesn\u2019t see things in the same way. Empathy comes naturally to some, but others have to work at it. However, it can solve or ease a great many differences of opinion. As a solver of other people\u2019s problems yourself, some degree of empathy is probably your most valuable talent.</p> <p><strong>Readers say</strong></p> <p>\u2022 As someone who has worked in a counselling-type role my whole life, I would say, don\u2019t. In my experience the people who would actually be the best at this type of thing don\u2019t do it, for a host of rational reasons, or can\u2019t do it, because they\u2019re not journalists or famous. Journalism is probably the more reliable route, because becoming famous is more by happenstance than design. Being a professional counsellor, psychologist, or psychotherapist etc may help you see the issues better, but you simply won\u2019t have enough information to provide anything truly helpful. <strong>momenta</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Consider volunteering with an organisation such as the <a href=\"http://www.samaritans.org/how-we-can-help-you/contact-us?gclid=CI-ql9SmhdACFcLGGwodIkkJbA\" title=\"\">Samaritans</a>, which provides training and support. It responds to people who are struggling, lonely, ill, poor, in jail or at school \u2013 anyone who wants to talk. Being an agony aunt is a niche role and one that is often as much (if not more) about the adviser than the person asking for help. I\u2019d ask why it\u2019s that route in particular that appeals. <strong>pumpkindoge</strong></p> <p>\u2022 It is about having an appropriate background in publishing, a reputation for having a clear-thinking, balanced approach to issues, and a substantial amount of luck. <strong>starterforten</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Train to be a counsellor or, better, a psychotherapist. It\u2019ll take years and money but, most of all, you will be forced to question whether what you do is of any help. <strong>onalongsabbatical</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Write to yourself for advice. If it\u2019s good advice you will reach your goal. If it\u2019s bad advice, maybe choose another path. <strong>iamtherobotman</strong></p> <h2>How can I help my daughter to choose a career after she finishes sitting her A-levels?</h2> <p><strong>My daughter is bright but doesn\u2019t know what degree to take as she has no clear career plan. We have discussed this time and again, but she still can\u2019t decide. She is studying for A-levels in biology, history and psychology, and completed AS-levels in English and law. She enjoys writing and has considered journalism, but she is particularly interested in endangered species and Greenpeace. </strong></p> <p><strong>Any ideas on how, as her mum, I can gently \u2013 and diplomatically \u2013 try and set her on an interesting path?</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>Your concern for her future is understandable and laudable. You just have to be heroically patient. It\u2019s not unusual for those of your daughter\u2019s age and stage of education to be indecisive about what to do next. As the sense of pressure mounts, often compounded by would-be helpful teachers and parents, wrong decisions can be made.</p> <p>Perhaps the most useful discussion should start with the sort of career she might consider. There are some for which a degree in mathematics, for example, is essential. But from the sound of it her interests mean the precise choice of degree course is less crucial. Her interests in journalism, the environment and Greenpeace suggest there is no essential degree subject.</p> <p>The A-levels she is taking are usefully broad, and will provide her with valuable qualifications without being restrictive. By all means continue to discuss her emerging interests, but only if she welcomes such discussions. If she shows curiosity about an occupation, consider buying her books on the subject, but take care she knows they are not intended as a covert form of encouragement. Even if she appeals to you to tell her what you think she should do, resist. It\u2019s important she senses what she wants to do with her life \u2013 and she will. The urgency to do so is not quite as great as it seems.</p> <p><strong>Readers say</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Her college library should have a wide range of resources on choosing a degree course and careers information. She could also take a look at websites such as <a href=\"http://www.prospects.ac.uk\" title=\"\">Prospects.ac.uk</a>, which suggests career paths and gives job profiles. Her mix of A-levels could take her in different directions. <strong>ID5279121</strong></p> <p>\u2022 She sounds like the ideal candidate for a gap year. Not a jaunt to Thailand or Botswana, but time out to try out a few&#xa0;different jobs, possibly to join Greenpeace and see what grabs her in&#xa0;practice. For most people the day-to-day realities of a job affect our enjoyment far more than the title or industry. How much will you need to interact with the public? How do you feel about eight hours a day in front of a computer? How much does money or status matter? These are best learned in practice, and she can use her experiences to guide her choice. <strong>ID0191535</strong></p> <p>\u2022 The pace of technological change is so rapid, and the global environment so unstable, that it\u2019s hard to begin to imagine what work will look like even in 10 years\u2019 time. Your daughter should choose a course that she finds interesting and which suits her abilities. <strong>Regordane</strong></p> <p>\u2022 What would she like to spend three years studying in depth? Worry about the job in three years\u2019 time. Life will probably look and feel a lot different to her then. Your main role should be subtly guiding her away from decisions of the \u201cbut media studies sounds really interesting, and so what if the university comes bottom of all the charts, and anyway that\u2019s where Jack is going and I love him!\u201d variety. <strong>Calley</strong></p> <p><strong>Do you need advice on a work issue?

  "<p>There\u2019s a long flight of steps on our school run. Eighty-five, to be precise. We first walked them with our eldest child, Betsy, in September 2006. Fast forward a hectic decade and Betsy is now in year 10, knee-deep in the onset of GCSEs, while her brother, Frank, is only a year behind at their secondary school.</p> <p>In the intervening years, we\u2019ve traipsed up and down these steps thousands of times, including the countless occasions the children have forgotten their&#xa0;lunch/PE kit/homework and we\u2019ve had to run round with it to save the day. But now we\u2019re left with nine-year-old Cissy, a determined year 5 girl who wants to throw off the stifling shackles of parental protection and walk on her own. No more steps, no more school run.</p> <p>It\u2019s a big decision (for us, not her) but it\u2019s been on the cards for a while. Once upon a time, not so very long ago, Cissy would offer up one of those precious, all-enveloping hugs as we dropped her off at the school gates. Now all we tend to get is a slight upward thrust of her head so we can kiss her goodbye (if we must). It\u2019s a sure sign she just doesn\u2019t want or need us there.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/dec/08/familyandrelationships.family2\">Lisa Bacon on the dilemma of allowing her son to walk to school alone</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s the end of the school run as we know it and, as the least sociable person in the school yard (and some would argue the south-east), I feel fine. Yes, I\u2019m that blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-me-dad at drop-off and the one who stands alone in the corner of the playground pretending to be on his phone until the bell rings at pick-up. For me, the school run is an inconvenience and as I\u2019ve long since exhausted everything I have to say in the playground, so Cissy\u2019s determination to go it alone couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. Besides, I don\u2019t recognise many of the parents any more. They\u2019re young, for a start.</p> <p>But if I\u2019m <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/14/help-children-to-walk-and-cycle-to-school\" title=\"\">OK with Cissy walking to school</a>, my wife, Ann, is still clinging on to the hope that she may just change her mind, at least for another year or 10. Deep down, she knows she\u2019ll be just fine but it\u2019s the very fact that she is our youngest child and that the end of the school run really does mean the end this time. Ann\u2019s already broached the idea of following her up the road, hiding behind parked cars, to see if she\u2019s OK. I think electronic tags may also have been mentioned, as were drones.</p> <p>So what\u2019s the problem?</p> <p>Well, it\u2019s not the route, which is only about a quarter of a mile at most. There are no main roads to cross and there\u2019s usually a lollipop man or woman guiding the kids across the street directly outside her school. Nor is it the threat of stranger-danger, not least because we\u2019ve walked the same route for the past decade and concluded that if there is danger lurking around every corner \u2013 all two of them \u2013 then it\u2019s taking an inordinately long time for it to reveal itself.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Walk to School campaign places the onus on parents to carry out a risk assessment of their route to school</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2012/05/10/unaccompanied-minor/\" title=\"\">According to research by YouGov</a>, most Britons feel that at 10 a child is old enough to walk to school unaccompanied by an adult. Legally, however, there is no minimum age at which children can go it alone. The <a href=\"https://www.livingstreets.org.uk/what-we-do/walk-to-school\" title=\"\">Walk to School campaign</a>, for example,&#xa0;places the onus on parents to carry out a risk assessment of their route to school and judge whether their child has the maturity and confidence to successfully negotiate the journey.</p> <p>When we began discussing Cissy walking to school on her own, we tried to recall precisely when it was that we both began doing it. For me, it was at the age of seven. I was the only English kid in a class in a less than salubrious suburb of Edinburgh and those walks home were always eventful, often threatening and very occasionally violent. Ann was also walking to school by that age, but she was, and still is, considerably tougher than me. Later, when my family moved back to Greater Manchester, I even walked along a train track to take a short cut to school. As far as I\u2019m aware there are no railway lines on Cissy\u2019s school run (and if there are then our risk assessment procedures need revisiting).</p> <p>Yet fewer children are walking to school now than ever and those who do in our area tend to do so later than ever. In 2013, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/only-25-per-cent-of-children-walk-to-school-alone-compared-to-86-per-cent-in-1971-what-went-wrong-8452266.html\" title=\"\">a study by the University of Westminster</a> found that only 25% of primary school children in&#xa0;England now travel home from school independently, compared with 86% in&#xa0;1971 and 35% in 1990. And while safety remains the paramount concern of all parents, the experience of Germany, where 76% of children still&#xa0;go it alone, suggests that the UK is lagging behind in terms of giving children at least some semblance of&#xa0;independence.At the same time that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/dec/08/familyandrelationships.family2\" title=\"\">number of children walking to and from school</a> without their parents has plummeted, so the use of cars to drive children to school has increased to the point where, according to the charity <a href=\"http://www.sustrans.org.uk/what-you-can-do/children-and-families/school-run\" title=\"\">Sustrans, one in five cars on the road during peak hours are now doing the school run</a>. This despite the average primary school journey being just 1.5&#xa0;miles.</p> <p>While that\u2019s never been an issue for us \u2013 we\u2019ve always walked to school \u2013 there\u2019s also evidence to suggest that not walking to school could even affect a child\u2019s academic progress, too. In 2012, a Danish study \u2013 the <a href=\"http://sciencenordic.com/children-who-walk-school-concentrate-better\" title=\"\">Mass Experiment 2012</a> \u2013 surveyed 20,000 Danish schoolchildren aged between five and 19, and set them concentration tests. It found that those children who took the bus or the train, or who were driven to school, performed poorer in the tests than those children who had walked or cycled to school, with the positive impact on concentration levels lasting for up to four hours.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/14/help-children-to-walk-and-cycle-to-school\">Help children to walk and cycle to school | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fact that Cissy has already been walking the route she\u2019ll be taking to school for over four years does allay most of our fears. The local environment is familiar, she recognises&#xa0;the pitfalls and, crucially, she knows most of the other people who walk it, too. Besides, she has grown up alongside an older brother and sister and she\u2019s already more streetwise than they were at her age. In&#xa0;fact, the only thing that\u2019s likely to delay or prevent her getting to school on time is the endless chattering with her friends or stopping every few yards&#xa0;to stroke another neighbourhood&#xa0;cat.</p> <p>I guess we\u2019ve never been the kind of fashionable free-range parents who let their children find their own way, learning about the many dangers of the modern world by leaving them alone in a hotel room while we drink and dance the night away but, equally, we\u2019re not the kind who want, or need, our kids to be within earshot at all times. It\u2019s a difficult balance to strike, but it has to be done.</p> <p>Put simply, it really is time to unwrap the cotton wool.</p> <p>It\u2019s time to let go.</p>",

The latest recipes were released Thursday morning, of course with a twist this year: Since Hillary Clinton is the first female nominee of a major party, it was her husband, Bill, who was asked to furnish a cookie recipe, along with Melania Trump.</p> <p>The Clintons don\u2019t exactly win points for creativity this year. The campaign submitted the \u201cClinton Family\u2019s Chocolate Chip Cookies\u201d \u2014 a reprise of Hillary Clinton\u2019s earlier oatmeal chocolate chip submissions. And Melania Trump\u2019s submission: \u201cMelania Trump\u2019s Star Cookies.\u201d <em>Family Circle</em> readers will <a href=\"http://www.familycircle.com/recipes/desserts/cookies/family-circle-2016-presidential-cookie-poll/\">vote on the recipes</a> in a poll on the magazine\u2019s website.</p> <p>But this isn\u2019t so much a story about cookies as it is a story about Hillary Clinton. Back in 1992, Hillary Clinton was something of an oddity, a political spouse with her own high-powered career, who hadn\u2019t set it aside to stand by her husband when Bill Clinton became governor of Arkansas. Her career became an issue in the Democratic primary. There were questions about whether then-Gov. Bill Clinton had funneled state business into her law firm.</p> <p>When asked about her career in a press gaggle, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EGranwN_uk\">Clinton responded</a>, \u201cYou know, I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession, which I entered before my husband was in public life. And I tried very, very hard to be as careful as possible, and that\u2019s all that I can tell you.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-05T02:20:01.488Z\">at 2.20am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581d3f28e4b07ceadb3a2a40\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-05T02:08:48.725Z\">2.08am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some video of Beyonce\u2019s arrival in Cleveland:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/awzurcher/status/794723013891649536\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The much awaited Beyonc\u00e9 entrance at the Clinton rally <a href=\"https://t.co/UtwwZ6gfau\">pic.twitter.com/UtwwZ6gfau</a></p>&mdash; Anthony Zurcher (@awzurcher) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/awzurcher/status/794723013891649536\">November 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SabrinaSiddiqui/status/794722799642378240\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Beyonce&#39;s backup dancers are wearing &quot;I&#39;m with her&quot; t-shirts.</p>&mdash; Sabrina Siddiqui (@SabrinaSiddiqui) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SabrinaSiddiqui/status/794722799642378240\">November 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-05T02:09:21.992Z\">at 2.09am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581d3d9be4b07ceadb3a2a3e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-05T02:03:12.665Z\">2.03am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cThere was a time a woman\u2019s opinion did not matter,\u201d Beyonce says. \u201cLess than 100 years ago women did not have the right to vote.
