  "<p>Men aged 65 living in metropolitan areas, who have more than \u00a330,000 in savings, are the chief target for investment fraudsters, according to detailed profiling by the City of London police.</p> <p>Most victims are <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2015/aug/01/boiler-room-offices-fraud-addresses\">duped by \u201cboiler rooms\u201d</a>, which use high-pressure tactics to sell shares to people who are persuaded that they are about to soar in value. Only later does the victim find that the shares are worthless and the sellers have disappeared. </p> <p>Figures released by <a href=\"http://www.actionfraud.police.uk/fraud-az-guardians-allowance-fraud\">Action Fraud</a> and the City of London police show that 77% of people reporting investment fraud are men, with an average age of 65. The average loss is more than \u00a332,000 and most victims live in metropolitan areas.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Boiler room operators usually set up sophisticated websites and often rent office space in well-known locations in the City. Servcorp UK and Regus, two serviced office providers, were prosecuted last year, under the 2007 London Local Authorities Act, for allowing suspected boiler room fraudsters to operate on their watch.</p> <p>The police force has raided about 100 offices in the City and Canary Wharf since the start of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.actionfraud.police.uk/operation-broadway\">Operation Broadway</a>, a clampdown on investment fraud. But despite the raids, the problem continues to grow, with reports to Action Fraud rising by 9.5% last year. Many boiler rooms also operate in Spanish coastal resorts, using young English expats to smooth talk people into parting with their money. </p> <p>Some victims have commited suicide after discovering they have lost their life savings. </p> <p>In June, Martin Rhys-Jones from Cardiff <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/briton-faces-us-jail-sentence-after-admitting-boiler-room-fraud-34768338.html\">admitted ripping off</a> 250 investors in a \u00a32m fraud operating from Barcelona between 2006 and 2009. Twelve people were arrested: four Britons, seven Americans and a Kuwaiti. Rhys-Jones, who ran a series of boiler rooms, was extradited to the US, where he was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-37218083\">sentenced to six years</a> in prison. </p> <p>DCI Dave Manley, who leads Operation Broadway, said: \u201cInvestment fraud continues to be a major threat to individuals in this country and statistics show that those who are over 60 are particularly vulnerable to this type of crime.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, once a victim is sucked in by a fraudster, they often end up parting with a significant amount of money and this can have devastating effects on both the individual and their families.\u201d</p> <p>This week, the City of London police, alongside Trading Standards, will launch a series of videos highlighting the impact of investment fraud, with advice on how people can protect themselves. A specialist role is being created to help local authorities across the country take on bogus investment companies operating from serviced offices and using mail forwarding services. </p> <p>Jon Averns, the City of London Corporation\u2019s head of trading standards, said: \u201cWe are creating a hostile environment for fraudsters, who are duping people with the promise of high returns on false investments. </p> <p>\u201cOur message is simple: don\u2019t send your money to someone you don\u2019t know, for a product you haven\u2019t seen.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>Confidence among chief financial officers at large British companies has only partially recovered from a post-referendum plunge and more than half expect to cut investment and hiring over the coming year, as they fret about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/15/brexit-damage-uk-economy-eiu-vote-eu-recession\">long-term consequences of Brexit</a>.</p> <p>A poll taken three months after the vote to leave the EU shows that 88% of finance officers feel their business is facing abnormally high levels of uncertainty.

Fears as to the implications for trade, inward investment and Britain\u2019s standing in global markets have knocked the pound <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/07/theories-emerge-for-pounds-flash-crash-against-dollar\">to new 31-year lows</a> against the dollar.</p> <p>Against this febrile market backdrop, business leaders wrote to the prime minister, Theresa May, warning that a hard Brexit would cause such grievous damage that it should immediately be ruled out as an option.</p> <p>The government will come under further pressure on Monday as the British Chambers of Commerce urges ministers to restore confidence among businesses as the starting date for Brexit negotiations approaches.</p> <p>At the Conservative party conference last week, May said she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws\">will trigger article 50</a> by the end of March 2017, setting in motion the two-year process of leaving the EU. Publishing a survey showing a cautious mood among businesses, the BCC said guidance on the timing of negotiations went only some of the way to helping jittery employers as they make hiring and spending plans.</p> <p>\u201cBoosting business must be a key task for government in the months ahead,\u201d said the BCC\u2019s acting director general, Adam Marshall.</p> <p>\u201cThe prime minister has given businesses some clarity on the timetable for article 50 and on short-term regulatory and legal issues. This is helpful, but needs to be followed up by a firm demonstration that the government has a clear and coherent strategy to defend the UK\u2019s economic and business interests in the negotiations that lie ahead.\u201d<br></p> <p>The BCC\u2019s survey of more than 7,000 companies suggested that they had lowered their expectations for hiring, turnover, and investment in plants, machinery and training.</p> <p>The survey results suggested that the economy had avoided a downturn for now and was still growing, albeit at a slower pace than before the referendum, the BCC said.</p> <p>This conclusion echoes other indications that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/08/uk-consumers-keep-spending-despite-brexit-vote-shock\">consumers continued to spend</a> and business activity held up over the summer, despite warnings before the referendum that a leave vote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/18/imf-says-brexit-would-trigger-uk-recession-eu-referendum\">could cause a recession</a>.</p> <p>There were also signs of a modest recovery from the initial referendum shock in the Deloitte poll of 124 finance officers. In the days after the Brexit vote, 73% of respondents said they had become gloomier about their company\u2019s prospects. Asked again in September, 47% said they were gloomier than three months earlier, 37% said they felt the same and 16% were more optimistic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-09T14:51:33/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Optimism\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-09T14:51:33/embed.html\">Optimism</a> </figure>  <p>The pattern of gloom easing, but remaining widespread, was repeated across other measures. The proportion of finance officers saying now was a bad time to take on risk fell from 95% to 82%. Those planning to cut capital spending in the next 12 months fell from 82% to 58%, with 51% saying hiring would slow, down from 83% in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.<br></p> <p>Ian Stewart, the chief economist at Deloitte, said: \u201cSince our last survey, we\u2019ve seen the appointment of a new prime minister, a strong rally in equity markets and a solid run of UK economic data.</p> <p>\u201cBut chief financial officers continue to see significant risks in the economic environment and perceptions of uncertainty remain elevated.\u201d<br></p> <p>Much of the concern over the economic impact of leaving the EU has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/06/chancellor-to-tell-wall-street-that-city-will-still-be-financial-centre-after-brexit\">focused on Britain\u2019s financial sector</a>, a major source of jobs and tax revenue.

But critics argue that if it has the technology to catch other photographs that cause distress, it should do more to protect users from repeated harassment.</p> <p>\u201cWe often have clients where offensive content is repeatedly posted to a social media platform so the victim has to play an endless game of \u2018whack-a-mole\u2019 to suppress new content,\u201d said Iain Wilson, a solicitor at Brett Wilson who specialises in such cases. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/italy-grapples-with-suicide-of-woman-taunted-over-online-sex-video\">Italy grapples with suicide of woman taunted over online sex video</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fact that Facebook waits until pictures have been reported, unless they are known child abuse images, before taking action was no longer sufficient, according to John Carr, a leading authority on children and the internet. \u201cFacebook is like a public utility for young people, it plays a massive role in their lives,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a widespread feeling that [Facebook] is not doing enough to tackle content that their own terms and conditions forbid,\u201d Carr added. \u201cThey should be more energetically engaged in policing the content.\u201d</p> <p>But there may be another reason Facebook is not removing images before they are reported, in addition to its commitment to \u2013 and commercial reliance on \u2013 \u201cradical transparency\u201d. Under <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.iwf.org.uk/hotline/the-laws/directive-applicable-to-the-liability-of-isps/liability-of-intermediary-service-providers\">current EU law</a> social media sites are immune from liability for content as long as they react quickly to complaints, under a \u201cnotice and takedown\u201d mechanism, said Carr. </p> <p>One reason they could be reluctant to proactively search for all potentially abusive images is that, ironically, by assuming some level of editorial responsibility, in theory they could be held liable for the abuse they miss. \u201cIt\u2019s all a mess,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is why we need a specific law saying that if companies try and prevent bad content, they won\u2019t lose their immunity if they don\u2019t always get it right.\u201d</p> <p>Facebook changed its community standards in 2012 to crack down on revenge pornography and \u201csextortion\u201d, banning nude images when they are reported. It also works with charities to target paedophile networks and on \u201cthink before you share\u201d campaigns, said a Facebook spokeswoman. </p> <p>Reporting links against every bit of content on the site flags potential abuse to a \u201cdedicated teams of reviewers who will promptly review reports and take action if content violates our community standards\u201d, the spokeswoman said. \u201cWe care deeply about protecting people\u2019s safety, and work with charities, academics and experts across the UK and Ireland to develop grassroots education programmes and help create an environment where everyone feels safe.\u201d</p> <p>Even if Facebook and other social media sites started proactively filtering potentially distressing images, by far the greater problem lies in revenge pornography and non-specific pornography sites, according to Laura Higgins, creator of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.revengepornhelpline.org.uk/\">Revenge Porn Hotline</a>. In a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/hacker-leaks-revenge-porn-images-8914551#rlabs=1%20rt$category%20p$1\">recent case in Scotland</a> a hacker uploaded naked photographs of at least 20 victims, leaving one woman feeling \u201ctotally humiliated\u201d. </p> <p>Once images are online, they can be copied and reposted to dozens of other sites, making total removal extremely challenging. The hotline has received more than 5,000 calls since it was launched in February 2015, and just under 23% of them involve Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.</p> <p> \u201cIn my experience Facebook are very quick to react when an image is reported,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cThe real issue is these dedicated revenge porn sites that incite users to download images and send victims hate. If Facebook are to be held responsible, then how can these sites be even allowed to exist?\u201d</p> <p>It will take more than one high profile case to remove other barriers to victims of revenge pornography, whatever their age, receiving justice.

This means the vast majority of victims will never seek justice, said Julie Pinborough, director of the legal advice centre at Queen Mary University, which provides pro bono legal advice for victims. </p> <p>\u201cOften the prospect of going to court for victims is unbearable; they feel they have already been judged and they don\u2019t want to go through the abuse again.\u201d </p>",

With every blow Clinton delivered (discussing Trump\u2019s tax returns, his \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d comments, and so on), and with every one of Trump\u2019s own missed opportunities, the value of those S&amp;P 500 futures contracts rose. Investors clearly decided they would prefer to own US stocks under a President Clinton than a President Trump.</p> <p>In fact, Justin Wolfers, a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, calculated that based on the magnitude of the market movements during that first debate, if Trump wins the election next month, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/upshot/debate-night-message-the-markets-are-afraid-of-donald-trump.html?_r=0\">it could trigger a stock market selloff of between 10% and 12%</a>. </p> <p>It\u2019s not that investors care whether Trump did or didn\u2019t pay taxes, or that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">brags about groping women</a> without their consent. The markets just don\u2019t worry about that kind of stuff.</p> <p>What does matter is whether investors believe Trump will create a stable, predictable, business-friendly environment. For all his claims to be friendly toward business, and despite a platform that offers favorable tax treatment to corporations and the wealthy, clearly investors are bothered about the \u201cstable and predictable\u201d part of the conundrum. </p> <p>Trump has threatened to embark on trade wars \u2013 that\u2019s enough to strike terror into the heart of any investor. Then there are <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/citi-says-donald-trumps-odds-of-winning-in-november-are-increasing-2016-09-19\">some \u201cblack swan\u201d risks</a> to which analysts have begun alerting their clients, such as the potential fallout for financial markets if Trump pulls the US out of multilateral trade and security arrangements, from Nafta to Nato. </p> <p>What happens when Trump insults a foreign leader, or orders a US warship to fire on an Iranian vessel, triggering a war? Or \u2013 God forbid \u2013 decides to use some of the nuclear arsenal to \u201ctake out\u201d Isis? We can all forget about our retirement funds at that point; they\u2019ll vanish in the mushroom cloud. It doesn\u2019t help the market\u2019s confidence that Trump\u2019s team of economic and foreign policy advisers <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/wall-street-starts-to-raise-alarm-bells-over-the-possibility-of-a-trump-presidency-2016-09-26\">don\u2019t seem to have extensive credentials or expertise</a>.</p> <p>Clinton is more of a known quantity. Despite her increasingly populist rhetoric against the financial institutions, the apparent <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37595047\">transcripts of speeches she gave to Goldman Sachs</a> and other banks before casting her hat into the ring suggest that as Bernie Sanders and his supporters had insisted, she was actually much more supportive than she now makes herself out to be. </p> <p>The speeches reveal a candidate who is pro-free trade and who suggested she would be amenable to maintaining the much-criticized \u201crevolving door\u201d between Wall Street and its regulators. \u201cThe people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry,\u201d she said, according to the transcripts.</p> <p>That\u2019s the pragmatic Clinton of before the election, and it suggests that, if anything, her victory next month would at least be good news for those Americans with an interest in a stable economy and stable markets.</p> <p>But if you\u2019re hoping for a \u201cClinton rally\u201d, don\u2019t hold your breath.</p> <p>Especially in the wake of the first debate \u2013 and in light of the bombshell revelations about Trump\u2019s taxes and open mic comments about groping women \u2013 the markets now have largely priced in a Clinton victory. </p> <p>If Clinton wins, we won\u2019t see big changes in economic policies \u2013 she is, more or less, familiar, which is something that markets love, because it gives them something that they adore: \u201ctransparency\u201d or \u201cvisibility\u201d. If traders and big institutional investors, like the mutual fund managers at Fidelity, can look forward and predict, more or less, what is going to happen (or if they think they can), they\u2019ll be more comfortable with the valuations that they\u2019re paying for stocks today. If there are too many wild cards, they\u2019ll take their money off the table.</p> <p>But a Clinton victory, heading toward the eighth anniversary of the start of the current bull market in stocks, wouldn\u2019t give anyone any encouragement to think that this was the start of something dramatically positive either. Should she be elected, stock valuations would still be in nosebleed territory. Interest rates would still be too low, and would be heading upward, putting downward pressure on the prices of stocks and bonds simultaneously. </p> <p>There\u2019s a phenomenon known as the <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/presidentialelectioncycle.asp\">presidential election cycle theory</a>. In brief, it argues that the first year following a presidential election is always bad for markets, regardless of who wins \u2013 Republican or Democrat. Then, stock markets do better in the second year following the election and best of all in the third year, before turning in a lackluster year in the fourth year. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/09/women-share-sexual-assault-stories-on-twitter-after-donald-trump-comments\">Trump's groping boasts inspire millions of women to share sexual assault stories on Twitter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I suspect we\u2019ll see a variant of that this year, if Clinton wins. We might experience a brief \u201cpop\u201d in the immediate aftermath of the election itself, in the form of a kind of relief rally. But once that is over, the grim work of unwinding a big asset bubble built up in the attempt to contain and resolve the financial crisis will have to start, beginning with the Fed raising interest rates. That is going to hurt the already sluggish economy, which has been <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-second-quarter-gdp-revised-up-to-1-4-gain-1475152328\">struggling to turn in an average annual growth rate of 2.1%</a> since the current expansion began. That\u2019s the lowest of any growth period since 1949. </p> <p>Those challenges will all remain in place in the unlikely event that either of the two third-party candidates triumphs on election day. They would be magnified by the fact that neither would have natural allies from their own party in Congress, making it infinitely more difficult to implement even basic economic policy. The predictability and stability factors that are an issue with Trump would exist with Gary Johnson or Jill Stein, albeit for different reasons. </p> <p>There are plenty of compelling reasons to cast a ballot on 8 November, heaven knows, without thinking about which result will be best for your investment portfolio. But if that\u2019s the one that is going to which lever you pull or box you check, well, there\u2019s no perfect solution, only a least worst option. </p> <p>Many of the issues that have the potential to wreak havoc on stocks are out there on the horizon, like an ominous dark cloud.

He was outrageously confident and had a talent for telling vaguely plausible lies \u2013 or rather, plausibly vague lies. Detail was his Kryptonite. But in the end, he would invariably overreach himself and be revealed as a fake. So I consoled myself with the thought that, eventually, this is what always happens to charlatans.<br></p> <p>Until this year. <br></p> <p>Because 2016 is shaping up to be the year that the fantasists get a free pass. It is proving to be the year of what commentators have dubbed \u201cpost-factual politics\u201d. And an environment where facts carry little weight is an ideal habitat for fantasists.<br></p> <p>So what exactly is a fantasist? Well, a fantasist is much more than a liar. We all lie sometimes, to protect ourselves, or gain some advantage, or to spare someone\u2019s feelings, or to get rid of a cold-caller. (I recommend feigning a heart attack.) Liars lie for a purpose, but fantasists just make things up. True, the fiction usually adds to some cathedral of self-aggrandisement that they\u2019re building, but they tend not to plan the lie beforehand. It leaps out of some instinctual lobe of their brain, in a split second. When you watch Donald Trump coming out with that stuff, that is probably the first time he\u2019s heard it.<br></p> <p>Also, the liar <em>knows</em> he is lying, before and after, whereas, for the fantasist, the moment the lie leaves his lips it transforms itself into incontrovertible truth. Fantasists need this alchemy because they are narcissists who can never, <em>never</em> be wrong. When their fragile narrative is challenged they have a tendency to turn nasty. That is the reason they can be so dangerous and why we shouldn\u2019t vote for them.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c57989d314906badff5377c1740cff1f03eb3ec8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c57989d314906badff5377c1740cff1f03eb3ec8/0_116_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside outsider \u2026 Ukip\u2019s Nigel Farage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside outsider \u2026 Ukip\u2019s Nigel Farage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For the fantasist, the moment the lie leaves his lips it transforms itself into incontrovertible truth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If we look at the year so far \u2013 and, God help us, it isn\u2019t over yet \u2013 we can see the emergence of a febrile new world where accuracy and authenticity are seen as irrelevances; a world where being an obvious fake is no longer any kind of impediment. You can mythologise yourself: you can be a billionaire man-of-the-people, you can be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/left-behind-eu-referendum-vote-ukip-revolt-brexit\">a public-school-educated ex-banker who is an \u201cestablishment outsider</a>\u201d, you can invent your own custom-made \u201cfacts\u201d and fire them through the spray gun of social media. You can invoke a golden age without ever specifying which age that was. Basically, you make up whatever irrational tosh you like, preferably tosh that activates the anger that lies dormant inside all those people who believe that their entire life is somebody else\u2019s fault.<br></p> <p>Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of this new atmosphere is that so many people seem to have stopped caring if someone is lying to them. For instance, Donald Trump has repeatedly asserted that, after the attacks of 9/11, 10,000 Muslims were out celebrating on the streets of New Jersey. There were no Muslims celebrating in New Jersey. Or anywhere else. The only place where that happened was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/lyin-trump-a-weekly-fact-check\">inside Donald Trump\u2019s head</a>. Normally, a fantastical invention like that would sound the death-knell for any candidate. But not now. The game\u2019s being played by different rules.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8abaec24ae60aa0e7d5336913d75d371e92e0eeb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8abaec24ae60aa0e7d5336913d75d371e92e0eeb/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Making America great again \u2026 Presidential hopeful Donald Trump.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Making America great again \u2026 Presidential hopeful Donald Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert F.

But those who wanted to believe it believed it, and the rest just gave a resigned shrug. All right, yes, Evan Davis got worked up about it on Newsnight, and various liberal newspapers deplored it. But the lie stayed out there, insidiously going about its business. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/eu-referendum-brexit-vote-leave-iain-duncan-smith-nhs\">Another lie was painted on to the side of a bus and remained there even after it had been exposed</a>. The Electoral Commission should have insisted on a second bus with a correction painted on it.<br></p> <p>Of course, for fantasists to prosper, they need rationalism to be put to flight. In the last few years, we have seen a growing trend to say the word <em>experts</em> in inverted commas. Michael Gove (son of a Scots fisherman and ordinary Joe) declared that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2016/jun/08/experts-eu-referendum-michael-gove\">British people were sick and tired of \u201cexperts\u201d</a>. You just can\u2019t trust them, these people who\u2019ve spent their working lives studying something that anyone can look up for themselves on the internet. By the same illogic, statistics and independent studies are now often greeted with open scorn and, in the US, a lot of the electorate seem to have decided that facts are a form of witchcraft.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df1fbb1b10835f69899f71bccf522ff4013d4f62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df1fbb1b10835f69899f71bccf522ff4013d4f62/208_610_4450_2670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The \u201cVote Leave\u201d battle-bus, and the slogan everyone knew to be untrue, but hey\u2026\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The \u201cVote Leave\u201d battle-bus, and the slogan everyone knew to be untrue, but hey\u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To an extent, we may have brought this on ourselves.

We have been reading pointless books about \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/feb/10/emotional-intelligence-thinking-feeling-job\">emotional intelligence</a>\u201d. We have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/jan/26/why-people-fall-for-pseudoscience-and-how-academics-can-fight-back\">indulging sciences that contain not the slightest particle of science</a>, not even the memory of science. We have been immersing ourselves in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/20/naked-and-afraid-best-reality-show-on-television-discovery\">reality shows that contain no semblance of reality</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/20/brangelina-brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-divorce-love\">We have been obsessing about the love lives of famous composite nouns</a>. We have allowed the 24-hour media to frighten us into a constant state of hysteria, even though our lives are longer, safer and healthier than they have ever been. We have moved into a world where feelings outrank thought, where we share our emotions instantly, incessantly and incontinently with people we\u2019ve never met, as we binge on moral outrage and conspiracy theories. We are losing the faculties we need to spot snake-oil salesmen. Or unhinged demagogues. And as 2016 careers on \u2013 like a stolen car driven by drunk teenagers - it is starting to feel as if the forces of reason are ready to throw in the towel.<br></p> <p>I should declare an interest here. If reason does not prevail, then I am out of a job. Comedy begins from a standpoint of reason, without reason it\u2019s impossible to identify what\u2019s absurd. Jokes are a playful form of reasoning. This is why Nazi Germany produced no great standups. Of course, the atmosphere in Germany during the 1930s was extremely \u201cpost-factual\u201d. And they ended up voting for a ridiculous fantasist as their leader. I\u2019m just saying, that\u2019s all. (I won\u2019t pursue this any further, as I don\u2019t want to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/28/ken-livingstone-suspended-from-labour-after-hitler-remarks\">set Ken Livingstone off</a>.)<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"feb4165d0bc741ec47d6e1000fdb7b922583d1d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/feb4165d0bc741ec47d6e1000fdb7b922583d1d2/0_0_2966_2154/1000.jpg\" alt=\"No great standups \u2026 Nazi Germany.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"726\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No great standups \u2026 \u2018post-factual\u2019 Nazi Germany.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back in the 1990s, the only upside of my experience with the fake Andy Hamilton was that it made me question what I knew. When I shared the story with other people, to my surprise, I discovered quite a few who\u2019d had similar experiences with impostors, and it opened my eyes to how much damage can be caused by a determined fantasist. In time, a story began to form inside my head, which I eventually <a href=\"https://unbound.com/books/star-witness\">turned into a novel</a>. (Just published, since you ask).<br></p> <p>Of course, one of the joys of writing fiction is that you give your story the ending you want. But the potential endings for 2016 look like ones that no one could want. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/far-right\">Demagogues seem to be in the ascendancy all over Europe</a>. While it is quite possible that the American people are about to elect a man who is unhinged. (Many people are saying this, Donald.) <br></p> <p>I should probably stop there, as writing that last paragraph has scared the hell out of me and I need to go and have a calming cup of tea.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Fantasists live in their own brightly coloured distorted world.  Let's hope this isn't the year we all move in with them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One final thought, however. It would be so very easy for us to luxuriate in the belief that a Trump could never happen here, to feel somehow insulated by the British character. Yes, we may have had ridiculous fantasists in our politics, but they\u2019ve all been comic, harmless sideshows, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jul/19/archer.politics2\">Jeffrey Archer</a>. But hold on, Jeffrey wasn\u2019t always seen as a self-deluding loser. In 2000, according to the opinion polls, he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/nov/22/londonmayor.uk12\">on the brink of being elected mayor of London</a>. Then, true to character, he boasted about the wrong thing to the wrong person at a party, and ended up being charged with perjury. His posturing was what undid him, but Londoners had been more than prepared to vote for him. Also, let\u2019s not forget that, as a nation, we did vote, repeatedly, for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/07/tony-blair-political-comeback-labour\">Tony Blair</a>, a man who has a tendency to confuse himself with Jesus. So are we really any more immune to fantasists than the Americans? Why should we be any harder to fool or manipulate?<br></p> <p>\u201cPost-factual\u201d politics \u2013 and the flight from reason that enables it \u2013 is a threat to public discourse everywhere and an open goal for demagogues. As I discovered back in the 1990s, fantasists move among us all the time. They live in their own brightly coloured, distorted world. Let\u2019s hope this isn\u2019t the year when we all go and live there with them.<br></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://unbound.com/books/star-witness\">The Star Witness by Andy Hamilton is out now from Unbound</a>, \u00a312.99 </li> </ul>",
  "<p>As conspicuous displays of wealth go, the mooring of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/russian-billionaires-superyacht-makes-waves-in-london\">Motor Yacht A</a> \u2013 owned by Russian tycoon Andrey Melnichenko \u2013 last month on one of the most striking spots on the Thames, next to D-day warship HMS Belfast by Tower Bridge, was hard to top. One of the world\u2019s largest superyachts, the Philippe Starck-designed, 119-metre (390ft) white vessel \u2013 which features three swimming pools, a helipad and bombproof glass \u2013 embodies an exclusive lifestyle that is highly visible but inaccessible to all but the global financial elite and their entourage.</p> <p>But Melnichenko, who made his \u00a39.2bn fortune in coal and fertilisers, has put the distinctive boat up for sale after upgrading to the \u00a3347m, 143-metre Sailing Yacht A, believed to be similarly named to ensure it is listed first in shipping registers. His new vessel, which features three carbon masts more than 90 metres tall with a sail area greater than a standard football pitch, is the tenth-largest superyacht in the world. It propels him into the premier league of private yacht owners alongside fellow oligarch Roman Abramovich, whose 162.5-metre Eclipse is currently the second-largest.</p> <p>The Chelsea football club owner\u2019s spectacular \u00a3724m vessel, which made headlines last summer when it briefly moored on the river Clyde in Scotland, far from its usual cruising grounds, is believed to feature two swimming pools (one of which has an adjustable depth that allows it to be converted into a dancefloor), an exterior fireplace, a leisure submarine, armour plating, bulletproof windows, a missile defence system and an anti-paparazzi shield designed to dazzle digital cameras.</p> <p>But one British academic has managed to penetrate this elusive milieu. Emma Spence has spent the last six years researching the industry, has crewed on superyachts around the world and shadowed a yacht broker in the tax haven of Monaco, observing how the boats are deployed to establish a pecking order among the super-rich. The researcher is completing a PhD on the superyacht scene and says the vessels are unique among prestige assets: unlike private jets they are not a useful mode of transport; unlike art and property, they always depreciate in value. Instead, as one owner told her, what makes a yacht desirable is that it \u201callows the super-rich to perform their wealth status\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/07/crewing-on-superyachts-wealth-careers\">Sun, sea and silver service: what\u2019s it like crewing on a superyacht?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Superyachts are defined as boats with hulls that measure longer than 24 metres at the waterline and that require a professional crew to operate. With basic annual maintenance and operation costs expected to be 10% of the original purchase price, ownership is the preserve of multi-millionaires and billionaires.</p> <p>In a forthcoming book on the lifestyles of the super-rich, Spence explains how merely possessing these elite craft is not enough to enhance the profile of the super-rich; how and where the yacht is used is equally important. This is why most owners and charterers of the luxury vessels prefer to go to prominent ports with bars and restaurants where they can guarantee an audience of super-rich peers. Her research focused on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, the centre of the superyacht scene, where hundreds of luxury vessels line the docks in Saint-Tropez, Nice, Antibes, Cannes and Monaco, the most prestigious port in the Mediterranean.</p> <p>Among the owners she witnessed projecting their status were billionaire retailer Sir Philip Green, who took delivery of his third superyacht \u2013 the \u00a3100m, 90-metre Lionheart, his second boat to bear that name \u2013 earlier this year. While she was crewing on a yacht belonging to somebody else in Saint-Tropez in 2013, Green came on board without invitation. \u201cHe walked up on the aft deck in board shorts and a T-shirt \u2013 standard super-rich attire, as casual as you can be,\u201d she says. \u201cThe grownup children [of the owner] and friends all immediately stood to attention until he told them it was OK to sit down. I\u2019ve never seen anyone else command that respect on someone else\u2019s yacht.\u201d</p> <p>The perma-tanned Topshop tycoon recently finished a two-month Mediterranean cruise with his wife, Tina, leaving their daughter, Chloe, on board in Monaco, where yacht owners and industry insiders gathered last month at the world\u2019s most prestigious yacht show to size up one another\u2019s nautical assets. \u201cThe family\u2019s got a permanent berth there and I\u2019ve docked alongside him for many years,\u201d says Spence. \u201cOne time, years ago in Monaco, a \u2018rival\u2019 crew climbed on board in the night and changed the boat\u2019s name with tape to Lion Fart.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f4186426207d51dcee32086eea2c02d02a806d95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4186426207d51dcee32086eea2c02d02a806d95/0_54_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Green\u2019s yacht Lionheart.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Green\u2019s yacht Lionheart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: http://livornodailyphoto.blogspot.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some yacht owners are attracted to tourist resorts in the French Riviera because an integral part of their lifestyle is projecting their privilege beyond their elite peer group, Spence adds. \u201cYou have this tension between the privacy that yachts and the sea afford against this desire to see and be seen,\u201d she says. \u201cTourists remind the super-rich of their wealth and their social status. In Saint-Tropez, you have hundreds of people on the docks as the yachts come in. The guests sit there on the aft deck. Most of these people you wouldn\u2019t know if you passed them in the street. They\u2019re not celebrities. But when they finally descend [ashore] there\u2019s still this awe.\u201d</p> <p>Spence saw how a group of young men who were children of superyacht owners often encourage this fascination with their way of life. \u201cEach night, they\u2019d go to big clubs, such as the VIP Rooms in Saint-Tropez or Gotha in Cannes, spend \u00a35,000, \u00a310,000 on a table and buy huge bottles of Dom P\u00e9rignon with sparklers,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s a group of young women that spends the day going from one port to the other, getting entry to these clubs and schmoozing these wealthy young men. The women come on board the boats, go up to the top deck and ask for champagne. They\u2019re all drunk and you\u2019re trying to explain at 3am that they can\u2019t wear stilettos on board.\u201d</p> <p>While in the clubs of the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, uber-wealthy heirs might lavish money on these hangers-on, but back on their parents\u2019 yachts, their attitude changes. \u201cOn board, it\u2019s the parent\u2019s stack of wine \u2013 it\u2019s not something to be given away,\u201d says Spence. \u201cThe older son of one owner came down to check I was serving the cheapest champagne. You downgrade from vintage Dom to Veuve Clicquot \u2013 from 100 euros a bottle to 30 euros.\u201d</p> <p>The super-rich also use their yachts to control the level of access they grant to those outside their wealthy circle, says Spence. For example, some exploited maritime law to get rid of the young women they brought back from the clubs. In the morning, they would go to bed and order the yacht to leave port, knowing the crew would have to remove any stragglers before they set sail. \u201cIf you\u2019re in port then you can have as many people on board as you want but at sea you can only have 12 passengers, unless you have large-yacht certification,\u201d says Spence. \u201cThe owner\u2019s sons would just slink off to their cabins leaving a few random women dotted around the yacht. It\u2019s awkward when these people think they\u2019re going to stay and spend the week partying on a yacht and then they\u2019re unceremoniously kicked off.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/03/super-rich-discover-hidden-risks-instagram-yachts-jets\">Yachts, jets and stacks of cash: super-rich discover risks of Instagram snaps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The symbiotic relationship between superyacht owners and crew is not as one-sided as it might appear. During the Monaco Grand Prix, securing the most prestigious berth on the T-jetty \u2013 the first row of yachts on the race start line \u2013 is reliant on the captain\u2019s contacts, not the owner\u2019s, says Spence. \u201cIt\u2019s knowing who to pay extra to for the privilege. It\u2019s a reflection of the owner\u2019s status, but it\u2019s done via the connections of the crew. If your captain speaks fluent French and has worked in the industry for years, then they\u2019ll have much a better chance of getting into a prominent position in the port.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe whole industry is completely gendered,\u201d says Spence. \u201cThe interior crew are women and the deck crew are male. I\u2019ve come across two female captains in six years of researching the industry, and I know of two chief stewards who are female. The women retire because owners don\u2019t want them in the interior of a boat after a certain age \u2013 late 30s and you\u2019re off.\u201d</p> <p>The majority of owners buy superyachts secondhand via brokers and refit them to their tastes. Camper &amp; Nicholsons put the global number of yachts of at least 30 metres at 4,476, with 268 sold via brokers last year at a total cost of $2.68bn (\u00a32.18bn), or an average of $10m. They estimate that 222 yachts of over 30 metres have been bought worldwide so far this year. The next step up is to buy or commission a \u201cseries yacht\u201d from a shipyard, which will have the same cabin configuration, exterior style and machinery across the line, but the owner will dictate the furniture and furnishings. The top tier are custom-designed by naval architects and can take shipyards several years to complete.</p> <p>Peter Thompson, a broker at Monaco-based Thompson, Westwood and White Yachts, says eastern European oligarchs and Gulf royals dominate the 100-metre-plus superyacht market, also known as gigayachts.</p> <p>The primary factor behind the increasing size of superyachts is the growing wealth of the super-rich. The number of ultra-high-net-worth individuals, with net assets of at least $30m, rose by 61% between 2005 and 2015 to 187,468 worldwide, according to the <a href=\"http://www.knightfrank.com/wealthreport\">latest wealth report by estate agent Knight Frank</a>. Of these, <a href=\"https://www.credit-suisse.com/ch/en/about-us/research/research-institute/global-wealth-report.html\">Credit Suisse calculates that the number worth at least $100m rose from 30,000 in 2010 to 44,900 in 2015</a>, while those with assets above $500m increased from 2,800 to 4,500 in the same period.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d562469780ac3d85f035d0dc49c5cab9df2c771a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d562469780ac3d85f035d0dc49c5cab9df2c771a/90_0_3430_2058/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roman Abramovich\u2019s yacht Eclipse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roman Abramovich\u2019s yacht Eclipse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Broker Simon Goldsworthy, of luxury yachting specialists Camper &amp; Nicholsons, says: \u201cThe client who 15 years ago would have been satisfied with a 40-metre [yacht], which would then have been one of the largest yachts in the bay, is now surrounded by dozens of yachts of 60-70 metres, and this plants the seed that he really ought to upgrade.\u201d</p> <p>Innovative design has also played a part \u2013 there are things you can fit onto a 60-metre yacht that you simply can\u2019t fit on to a 40-metre one, such as infinity pools, helipads, cinemas, dive rooms, and so on. Evan K Marshall, a London-based superyacht designer, says many of his clients\u2019 yachts are more expensive, and far more personalised, than their homes. \u201cWithin the circles of friends who own vessels, there is a healthy competition,\u201d he says. \u201cIf someone says: \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve just ordered an 80-metre,\u2019 his friend\u2019s going to be on the phone to his broker: \u201cListen, I\u2019m thinking of building an 85-metre!\u201d We love that.\u201d</p> <p>Among Marshall\u2019s most prolific clients is the Brooklyn automotive tycoon John Staluppi, who names his boats after James Bond films. Last year, he ordered his 19th superyacht, the 66-metre Spectre, due to be delivered by the Italian Benneti shipyards in 2017. Thompson, who was involved in many of the projects, says Staluppi gets a new superyacht every 18 months to three years, compared with a client average of every five to seven years. \u201cThe first one I did was The World is Not Enough, then he sold that and bought Quantum of Solace, then he sold that and bought Casino Royale, then Diamonds are Forever. Right now we\u2019ve got Skyfall and there\u2019s Spectre on the way. He loves the creation side of it. But he doesn\u2019t travel a lot. He uses them as floating homes.\u201d</p> <p>In the French Riviera, many owners flip between staying on board their yacht or in their luxury villas or mansions, says Spence. \u201cThey would have a fully staffed house and the boat doing exactly the same thing, 20 minutes\u2019 drive away. You\u2019d both be on call, so you wouldn\u2019t know when the owner would turn up at the house or the boat. So you would have a system that the staff at the house would call ahead to the boat, and the owners would appear 10 minutes later and you\u2019d just happen to have fresh towels and scented water waiting for them.\u201d</p> <p>In recent years, a growing number of superyacht owners and charterers, particularly those under 40, have cruised further afield than the \u201cmilk run\u201d of Mediterranean resorts to remote routes, including the Arctic Northwest Passage, fuelling demand for designer icebreakers, such as the SeaExplorer range. William Mathieson, editorial director of the Superyacht Group, says this trend for \u201cexpedition yachts\u201d is due to an emergent younger super-wealthy class \u2013 from heirs to dotcom billionaires \u2013 \u201cwho want to chase an elusive experience\u201d. Although some owners might pursue remote and exotic adventures, he suspects that for others it will become the yachting equivalent of the Chelsea tractor.</p> <p>While Spence says this trend partly reflects that yachting still involves romanticised notions of escape, it is also rooted in owners\u2019 preoccupation with bragging rights.</p> <p>She crewed on one yacht that was sailing around the world; the owners would just fly in when it reached a certain port of call. \u201cThey would leave it in the Med then fly down to Mauritius, then would fly back again when it\u2019s in India,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re really using it as a floating hotel. They would eat meals on board and pop off to do a bit of shopping.</p> <p>\u201cHaving their yacht in far-removed locations is a social statement in itself, even if they do not make it on board themselves. Even mooring your yacht on the Thames is conspicuous in that it is far removed from the south of France where all the other yachts are.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca97e73118ecfdc51436bf140075df0f8438a503\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca97e73118ecfdc51436bf140075df0f8438a503/0_87_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Superyachts in the harbour at Monte Carlo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Superyachts in the harbour at Monte Carlo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Gaillard/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The world\u2019s top five superyachts</h2> <p><strong>1.

  "<p>Cut off Michael Bisping at the neck and you will likely find that he is still goading you to come back for more as his head goes rolling across the floor. He is a man who absolutely will not quit. Which is why, at the age of 37, he has become the first Briton to win a UFC world title and, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/09/bisping-retains-title-in-thriller\" title=\"\">in defending it</a> in the early hours of Sunday, the first person to win 20 fights in their UFC career. Two days before his latest middleweight victory, against Dan Henderson at the Manchester Arena, Bisping was asked why he is still fighting after all this time. The money, he said, and more than that, he just loves the buzz he gets when he wins. \u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling. Anyone that\u2019s ever won a fight knows that.\u201d</p> <p>We can only guess exactly how good Bisping felt after beating Henderson. Nobody got a chance to ask, because he was sent straight to the hospital. He had predicted that there would be \u201ca few sore heads on Sunday morning\u201d, but however much anyone drank, nobody can have had a bigger headache than the one he must have been suffering. Henderson caught him flush, twice, with his lethal overhand right, a punch so famous that it has its own nickname: the H-Bomb. Henderson, 46, retired right after the fight. It possibly was not a personal decision so much as a public demonstration of the USA\u2019s continuing commitment to strategic nuclear&#xa0;disarmament.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/09/bisping-retains-title-in-thriller\">Bisping beats Henderson on points to retain title in thriller</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Henderson did not have to go to the hospital but may have called in at a local stonemasons so they could smooth off the chips Bisping\u2019s kicks left in his granite edges. \u201cHonestly,\u201d Henderson said afterwards, \u201cI didn\u2019t feel hurt once in that whole fight.\u201d He felt like he had won but had the good grace to say: \u201cUnfortunately not everyone saw it that way,\u201d and leave it at that. It is not the damage done that the judges reckon, but the number of clean shots landed. And, just as he did against Anderson Silva in London <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/04/the-fight-game-reloaded-how-mma-conquered-world-ufc\" title=\"\">earlier this year</a>, Bisping won on points because he kept pecking&#xa0;away.</p> <p>Some argue Bisping got the benefit of the doubt because both these close fights were in Britain. If they were home decisions, he certainly earned them. Against Silva, he recovered from being knocked out by a flying knee at the very end of the third round. Against Henderson, the bell was no help and he had to fight his way up off the ground against an opponent who fell on him like a hungry bear on a side of cold salmon. Winning, as all Rocky fans know, is not just about how hard you hit but how hard you can get hit and keep moving&#xa0;forward.</p> <p>By that measure, there are not many tougher athletes than Bisping in Britain right now, nor, perhaps, any who better prove the truth of George MacDonald Fraser\u2019s dictum that what we call bravery is actually \u201chalf panic, half lunacy\u201d. Bisping really deserves to be better known. You could not exactly call him unsung, not after 16,000 fans joined together in one long and raucous chorus of \u201cStand up, if you love Bisping!\u201d at 5am on a Sunday morning, but he has achieved so much that if he lived in another country, or practised another sport, he surely would be a household name, his battered mug splashed across the front pages of Monday\u2019s papers.</p> <p>The British fighters who come after him may achieve exactly that, given that their sport is now being broadcast by BT and covered by the BBC. Over the last 15 years the UFC has been moving inexorably into the mainstream, though its progress in Britain has been slower going than the organisation imagined. In 2001, the two Vegas casino kingpins Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta bought the business for just $2m. This summer, they sold it for $4.2bn, to WME-IMG, the mega-agency that runs, among many other things, Miss Universe, New York Fashion Week and the Professional Bull Riders rodeo. And in November, the UFC will finally hold a fight night in New York, at Madison Square Garden, having recently overturned a longstanding ban in the state.</p> <p>Those who know say WME-IMG is still trying to figure out exactly what <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-06/goldman-sachs-said-to-receive-fed-warning-over-ufc-buyout-debt\" title=\"\">it is it has bought</a>. But it is immediately clear what the UFC has got out of the deal. Just this month, i<a href=\"http://www.espn.co.uk/mma/story/_/id/17674749/ufc-owner-talent-agency-wme-img-enlists-celebrity-group-investors\" title=\"\">t was announced that 23 celebrities</a> had invested in the UFC, for, according to reports, a minimum stake of $250,000 apiece. Among them are the chat show hosts Conan O\u2019Brien and Jimmy Kimmel, a handful of Hollywood celebrities, such as Ben Affleck, Mark Wahlberg, and some sports stars, Tom Brady and the Williams sisters. All, of course, WME\u2011IMG clients.</p> <p>WME-IMG describes itself as \u201cthe nexus of sports, entertainment, and fashion\u201d. A key part of the UFC\u2019s appeal is the way in which it straddles sport and reality TV, which it uses to build emotional ties between the fans and the fighters. Bisping got his break on season three of the UFC show The Ultimate Fighter. And this, his second fight with Henderson, came about because of the rivalry the two men developed during season nine. They coached opposing teams and then fought each other at UFC 100, in 2009. Henderson flattened Bisping with (what else?) that patented punch of his, in one of the most famous, and humiliating, knockouts in UFC&#xa0;history.</p> <p>Seven years later, Henderson is not even among the UFC\u2019s top 10 middleweights. There are higher-ranked fighters who deserved the title shot he just got. But he has the backstory and the UFC decided this was the fight people most wanted to see. It was not just selling the sport but the storyline it had presented on TV. As WME\u2011IMG\u2019s CEO, Ari Emanuel, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/10/fashion/fashion-week-spring-2016-reinvented.html\" title=\"\">told the New York Times</a>: \u201cWhen we look at the world, we see fashion, sports, movies, TV, books: they are all just different aspects of global entertainment consumption.\u201d Some fight fans will hate the fact but the&#xa0;UFC will fit right in. Norman Mailer described boxing as a 20th-century art. The UFC is a very 21st\u2011century concoction.</p>",

At worst, locals fear that the pit and landfill cells will stink and release toxic chemicals into the air and the ground.

With each passing day, the climate challenge grows.</p> <p>\u201cThe longest streak of record-warm months has now reached 16 - such heat has never persisted on the planet for so long.

According to the IMF, global debt has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/world-debt-has-hit-record-high-of-152tn-says-imf\">risen to a record level</a> of $152tn (\u00a3122tn) \u2013 more than double global GDP \u2013 at a time when activity is sluggish. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/10/poorer-countries-commodity-slump-stronger-dollar-debt-payments\">Collapsing commodity prices</a> and weak demand from the west has meant that growth in sub-Saharan Africa is running at half the level of population increases. Companies in the emerging world loaded up on debt during the commodity boom and are vulnerable to rising US interest rates and any softening of the world economy. China is the most egregious example of debt being used to boost activity artificially.</p> <p>The argument that rising debt is fine, because on the other side of ledger is an asset increasing in value, is specious. The only reason the assets are rising in price is because investors are taking on more debt to buy them. At some point, the asset bubble bursts, leaving borrowers with a major problem. This was the lesson of the sub-prime crisis and it is remarkable that memories are so short.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/global-economy-2017-financial-crisis-developing-economies-oecd-unctad-guardian-view\">The next big one</a> could come from anywhere and it is good that the World Bank and IMF are aware of the risks. Even so, there was an air of unreality about the discussions in Washington last week.</p> <p>The reason was simple: there was not the slightest hint from the IMF or World Bank that the policies they advocated during the heyday of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/oct/05/new-washington-consensus-time-fight-inequality\">so-called Washington consensus</a> \u2013 austerity, privatisation and financial liberalisation \u2013 have contributed to weak and unequal growth, with all the political discontent that this has caused.</p> <p>Even worse, Lagarde and Kim seemed oblivious to the fact that the Washington consensus approach is alive and well within their organisations. The IMF\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/imf-watchdog-criticises-handling-eurozone-crisis\">remedy for Greece and Portugal</a> during the eurozone crisis has been straight out of the structural adjustment playbook: reduce public spending, cut salaries and benefits, insist that state-owned enterprises return to the private sector, reduce minimum wages and restrict collective bargaining. Between them, the IMF and the European authorities are turning Greece into a developing country. It would be fascinating to see what sort of response Lagarde would get if she tried talking about inclusive growth to homeless people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2013/jun/12/homelessness-in-greece-in-pictures\">huddled on the streets</a> of Athens. </p> <p>The IMF is effectively two institutions. It has a research department that has broken with the Washington consensus and programme teams that operate in the field as if we were still in the 1990s. Lagarde sides with the research team, but the recent package prepared for Egypt was the familiar mix of subsidy reductions, the introduction of value added tax and cuts to red tape. There is not much evidence that those who put it together are on message.</p> <p>As for the World Bank, <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org/en/research/ifc-and-tax-havens\">research by Oxfam</a> has shown that 51 of the 68 companies lent money in 2015 by its private finance arm, the International Finance Corporation, to fund investments in sub-Saharan Africa, use tax havens. That doesn\u2019t square with the idea of inclusive capitalism. It is not immediately obvious why the World Bank is supporting private schools in low-income countries when the evidence is that they exclude the poorest and, in particular, girls.</p> <p>The Jubilee Debt Campaign (JDC) has been <a href=\"http://jubileedebt.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The-fall-and-rise-of-Ghanas-debt_10.16.pdf\">keeping a close eye </a>on Ghana, which grew strongly after oil was discovered and commodity prices were rising, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/26/ghana-success-gold-oil-cocoa-economic-downturn\">but was left exposed</a> by the subsequent crash. More money was then borrowed to blunt the impact of the commodity price fall, but the halving of the Ghanaian currency, the cedi, meant that debt-servicing costs increased. Almost one-third of Ghana\u2019s budget is spent on external debt servicing.</p> <p>In early 2015, the IMF and World Bank said Ghana was at high risk of being unable to pay its debts. Seven months later, the World Bank guaranteed $400m of repayments on a \u00a31bn bond sold to private investors. It had to waive its rules to do so, because the World Bank is not supposed to guarantee loans to countries at high risk of distress.</p> <p>The World Bank said it was trying to help refinance expensive short-term debt and free up resources that could be used for investment, but the winners of this arrangement are the speculators getting a 10.75% return, who will make money even if Ghana can\u2019t repay the loan, due to the World Bank guarantee. The losers will be the Ghanaian people, who will be subject to austerity under the terms of a new IMF programme. Ghana is planning spending cuts by 2017 of 20% per head on 2012 levels.</p> <p>Sub-Saharan Africa is not a homogeneous region. Some countries are still growing strongly, helped by declining energy prices. But Ghana is not the only country to fall foul of the boom and bust cycle in commodities, and the JDC is highlighting the risk of a fresh debt crisis.</p> <p>Neither the World Bank nor the IMF consider this a serious threat. Kim said last week: \u201cI am not yet concerned that we\u2019re reaching a debt level crisis, certainly not in most of sub-Saharan Africa. But we have to watch it.\u201d</p> <p>The World Bank and IMF also need to be watched. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the rhetoric, but it is the performance that counts. Lagarde and Kim say the world needs to make a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/oct/13/half-world-wealth-in-hands-population-inequality-report\">better fist of tackling inequality</a> \u2013 hooray to that. The work starts with their own institutions.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 9 October. It had incorrectly converted $152tn to \u00a31,223tn. This has been corrected.</li> </ul>",
  "<p>In the midnight hours leading up to the first US presidential debate, I sat up watching a rough cut of Adam Curtis\u2019s new BBC documentary, <em>HyperNormalisation</em>, on my laptop. I thought \u2013 rightly \u2013 that the film would provide a suitable preface to Trump\u2019s global horror show.</p> <p>Like all Curtis\u2019s documentary work, <em>HyperNormalisation</em> exists in a twilight between disturbing truth and restless dream. It charts an eccentric course through the choppier ideological currents of our times: the origins of Syrian apocalypse; the collapse of political middle grounds and the rise of nationalism; the meaning of Putin and Assad and the Donald himself.</p> <p>The film is the most ambitious statement of Curtis\u2019s methods and his message since his 2004 series <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTg4qnyUGxg\" title=\"\"><em>The Power of Nightmares</em></a>, which prophetically examined the ways that western governments exploit fears of terrorism to exert control. It is based on the premise that as a culture, perhaps as a species, \u201cwe have become lost in a fake world and cannot see the reality outside\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/22/adam-curtis-edinburgh-tv-festival\">Adam Curtis argues TV needs 'new tools' to tell its stories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Curtis suggests that the trending opposites of our times \u2013 the chatter of social media and the stricture of Islamic fundamentalism \u2013 represent a retreat from complexity into an existence that constantly reflects our desires and anxieties back to us. Meanwhile, genuine power to change lives becomes more opaque and distant, leaving large parts of the world helpless and desperate. Along the way, this being Curtis, his film offers tragicomic asides on Patti Smith and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/occupy\" title=\"\">Occupy,</a> BlackRock investments and <em>The X-Files</em>.</p> <p>Critics of Curtis\u2019s films say that his jump-cut techniques and abrupt mood changes in some ways cheat on the dogged legwork of documentary journalism. As ever here, shifts in geopolitics are routinely represented by a couple of seconds of arresting footage \u2013 the banality of puppet dictators is illustrated by Colonel Gaddafi checking his hair off camera; the emergence of me-culture becomes Jane Fonda giving up on activism and donning a leotard; to explain the collapse of communism there is a punch-up in a Soviet breadline. Arguments become impressionistic, the criticism goes, an atmosphere of conspiracy is not the same as the exposure of truth.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvKUN1a2AHE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bvKUN1a2AHE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvKUN1a2AHE\">Watch an excerpt from HyperNormalisation.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>This criticism misses the point. Curtis\u2019s films do not pretend to be definitive histories; rather they cast doubt on the possibility of that idea. They announce themselves clearly as subjective essays: \u201cThis is a story about&#xa0;\u2026\u201d is his opening mantra. His method is not only to attempt to understand the world, but to dramatise the ways we might go about understanding it. The films take the attention-deficit patterns of our 24-hour news cycle and try to impose some kind of persuasive narrative order on them \u2013 just as we try to do all the time. It is Curtis\u2019s contention that in the constant distraction of our digital lives, we miss the larger play of ideas that shape them. His aim is to give us some clues about what those forces might look like.</p> <p>The day after I watched the film, still groggy from Trump and his tax returns and Miss Universe, I had lunch with Curtis to talk about <em>HyperNormalisation</em>. As with his most recent documentary, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p02gyz6b/adam-curtis-bitter-lake\" title=\"\"><em>Bitter Lake</em></a>, about the postwar history of the west in Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, this will be launched exclusively on BBC iPlayer. He insists that this apparent demotion is wholly by choice \u2013 the open-ended format gives him licence to experiment and not be constrained by hour-long episodes (the current film is nearly three hours long).</p> <p>\u201cMy editor says theoretically I can have a video that lasts up to 10 hours,\u201d he says, with some boyish excitement about the possibility. \u201cI\u2019ve done this one with chapter headings. What was lurking in the back of my brain was that it is like a novel with lots of characters and you can jump from that part to that part and trust that it is all going to come together at the end.\u201d</p> <p>The model that Curtis\u2019s films have always aspired to, he says, is that of the archetypal great American novelist, John Dos Passos, whose books he describes as \u201cthe most satisfying thing I have ever read\u201d. The novelist pioneered a technique called \u201ccamera eye\u201d which was, as it sounds, a rush of raw experience, and then spliced it with montage from newspapers and the lives of fictional characters.</p> <p>\u201cWhy I love Dos Passos is he tells political stories but at the same time he also lets you know what it feels like to live through them,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cMost journalism does not acknowledge that people live at least as much in their heads as they do in the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdb3326276e182cebde893bbe5abc61d792ae8a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdb3326276e182cebde893bbe5abc61d792ae8a9/12_53_695_417/500.jpg\" alt=\"Footage of Colonel Gaddafi checking his hair is used as an explanation of the banality of dictators in HyperNormalisation.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Footage of Colonel Gaddafi checking his hair is used as an explanation of the banality of dictators in HyperNormalisation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Curtis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is Curtis\u2019s contention that it doesn\u2019t matter if viewers get disoriented by what they see as long as they remain curious. \u201cPeople are used to spending their lives searching for meaning in a completely chaotic way,\u201d he says. \u201cInformation becomes a mosaic of questions on the internet. You search for something about whatever, Goldman Sachs, and five minutes later you are reading about a murder in Florida in the 1950s or something. You are quite happy with that.\u201d</p> <p>His films mirror that digressive quest, but loop continually back to his argument. One part of that argument is that Islamism was the unintended consequence of cold war power struggles. In this case, he traces the conflict in Syria back to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/24/derekbrown\" title=\"\">\u201cshuttle diplomacy\u201d of Henry Kissinger</a> in 1974-75.</p> <p>\u201cKissinger\u2019s theory was that instead of having a comprehensive peace for Palestinians, which would cause specific problems, you split the Middle Eastern world and made everyone dissatisfied,\u201d he argues. In the fallout from that policy no one, his film suggests, was more dissatisfied than Hafez al-Assad of Syria.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to try to explain Syria,\u201d Curtis says. His impression is that when we watch the footage from Aleppo the forces that have created that carnage seem all but unknown to us. This, he suggests, was deliberate. \u201cThe idea was that you couldn\u2019t deal with Assad so you created an alternative reality in which Syria had no place. As a consequence, for example, it was hardly mentioned in the books about the rise of Islamism \u2013 so to our eyes the war seems to come from nowhere.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Politics has become a pantomime in that it creates anger rather than argument\u2026 People like Trump fuel that anger</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You could argue that all historians and journalists are conspiracy theorists of one sort or another, collecting their collages of facts and imposing some narrative sense on them. Curtis\u2019s style makes this process abundantly clear \u2013 but he still invites you to be seduced by the brilliant visual craft of his argument. In his netherworld of shifting certainties, characters \u2013 like, as he says, villains in a novel \u2013 come and go. Putin\u2019s close adviser Vladislav Surkov takes on a kind of Rasputin role in this&#xa0;respect.</p> <p>Surkov, whose previous career was as a director in avant-garde theatre, emerges, like Kissinger, as an arch manipulator of reality. \u201cSurkov will invent dissident groups and fund them,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cHe will fuel conspiracy theories, but that\u2019s not new. His particular genius has been to let people know that is what he is doing. So whatever you see in the news: you just don\u2019t know if it is \u2018true\u2019 or not. I noticed a headline in the <em>Financial Times</em> recently which said \u2018no one understands Russia\u2019s policy in Syria\u2019. I thought: Mr Surkov.\u201d</p> <p>The goal of this manipulation, Curtis suggests, is to spread a state of bewilderment and powerlessness across the globe. A sense that nothing quite makes sense. Technology, in particular social media, becomes the ally of those forces. The global technology companies not only feed a mirror of our obsessions back to us, but increasingly try to normalise our behaviour \u2013 collecting data about our health and our habits and selling us a fixed idea of who we should be and what we should like (\u201cif you liked that, you will like this\u201d). The irony of this feedback is that it is fuels prejudice and is fuelled by anger. The more angry users are, the more extreme their emotional states, the more they click, and the more money rolls into Twitter and Facebook and the rest.</p> <p>Trump is presented in the film as emblematic of this culture, certainly, but how exactly?</p> <p>\u201cMy take on Trump is that he is an inevitable creation of this unreal normal world,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cPolitics has become a pantomime or vaudeville in that it creates waves of anger rather than argument. Maybe people like Trump are successful simply because they fuel that anger, in the echo chambers of the internet.\u201d</p> <p>If Hillary Clinton gets elected next month, Curtis suggests, then the vaudeville will have played its role \u2013 the anger will have been expressed and changed nothing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db13d0feb456115b98abfc6a23277aaf82907f1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db13d0feb456115b98abfc6a23277aaf82907f1a/180_88_1069_641/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump in footage from HyperNormalisation: fuelling anger in the echo chamber of the internet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Curtis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But what if Trump wins? \u201cIt means the pantomime has become reality and starts rampaging around. And then we are fucked.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s the answer to ending or changing that pantomime?</p> <p>\u201cThere has to be a new political vision that takes account of these forces,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that idea is and I don\u2019t see it as my job to provide it. My job description is to make people aware of power. To let them see the forces around them. The things they don\u2019t see.\u201d</p> <p>To this end Curtis has become a kind of heroic one-man depository of BBC memory. For the past few years he has been funding a former BBC cameraman, Phil Goodwin, to travel the world digitising all the unedited material in BBC cupboards and storerooms worldwide, the hours of rushes that got boiled down to a 20-second news report.</p> <p>Goodwin spends weeks with a bank of six laptops and six tape machines collecting it all \u2013 and then brings it back and gives it to Curtis in plastic lunch boxes full of small computer drives. \u201cSo for example I have everything the BBC has ever shot for 60 years in Russia sitting on 58 terabytes of drives,\u201d he says. \u201cPhil is doing China next. Then Egypt. Vietnam. And then we are doing Africa. I aim eventually to have the last 50 years of unedited material. I could do an emotional history of the world.\u201d</p> <p>How does he avoid just being overwhelmed by the material?</p> <p>\u201cSome of it is indexed,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to do a bit of detective work. You just suddenly spot something. You have to intuit what people want. I think they want explanation.\u201d</p> <p>What does the BBC make of his obsessive methods?</p> <p>\u201cI made this film for \u00a330,000,\u201d he says. \u201cSo that\u2019s fine by them.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s his belief that we lack a journalism or art that can dramatise the shape of our globalised and digitalised world. \u201cDickens created these fictions that revealed the consequences of the industrial revolution, showed where the new power lay,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are waiting for new stories to come along, new ways of telling them.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s too modest to say so, but Curtis has himself, for 20-odd years, been feeling his way towards those new ways of telling. If you don\u2019t know his work, <em>HyperNormalisation</em> is a great place to start.</p> <p><em>HyperNormalisation will premiere on BBC iPlayer at 9pm on 16 October</em></p> <h2>Life and times</h2> <p>\u25a0 Born in Dartford in 1955, he is the son of cinematographer Martin Curtis.</p> <p>\u25a0 Taught politics at Oxford University prior to pursuing a career at the BBC.

She was up for the role of the underground musician in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtu6cLtkML8\" title=\"\"><em>Desperately Seeking Susan</em></a>, but lost out to Madonna. She got rejected as a nun in <em>Sister Act</em>, because her audition was \u201ctoo dark\u201d, and nearly played opposite Tom Cruise in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7gmrKAFshE\" title=\"\"><em>The Color of Money</em></a>.</p> <p>She hasn\u2019t yet landed a film role but in recent years she has acted the part of another young woman who found fame early and was hailed as a prodigious talent \u2013 the writer Carson McCullers. Five years ago Vega performed a musical stage piece she had written,<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjwrCJHm4Pw\" title=\"\"><em>Carson McCullers Talks About Love</em></a><em>,</em> portraying the alcoholic, disabled writer with her endlessly complex bisexual romantic interests and embittered literary rivalries. Now she has a new album out, <em>Lover, Beloved: Songs from an Evening With Carson McCullers</em>, based on the songs from that show, which she has rewritten and will be performing this week at <a href=\"http://www.suzannevega.com/tour/\" title=\"\">several venues across the UK</a>. Is it radically different from the original?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>McCullers wrote about her characters with an acute appreciation for human diversity and vulnerability</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe original play was actually done when I was in college. So this is the third version. I ripped it up because I was unhappy with it. I was trying something experimental and I felt it didn\u2019t come off. This new version is more a classic one-woman show.\u201d</p> <p>Vega has been intrigued by McCullers ever since she read the short story Sucker as a teenager. Vega started out as a dancer at New York\u2019s School of Performing Arts (immortalised in <em>Fame</em>) but dropped out to study English and drama at Barnard. One day her drama tutor set a project in which students were asked to come dressed as a real person who was dead, and they had to field questions as though in a TV interview. Vega decided to read a large biography of McCullers overnight.</p> <p>\u201cI really got into it. I could act out all these things I wasn\u2019t inclined to do privately. She drank, she smoked, she apparently had all these affairs with different men and women. So I did my senior thesis on her and then put the project away for 30 years.\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime, of course, she came to prominence as the singer-songwriter of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXb6Lb_h0Oo\" title=\"\">Marlene on the Wall</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZt7J0iaUD0\" title=\"\">Luka</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWyF3iSMzs\" title=\"\">Tom\u2019s Diner</a>. She arrived in the mid-1980s, aged 25, during the height of female flamboyance, when Madonna and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdQY7BusJNU\" title=\"\">Cyndi Lauper</a> were strutting their exhibitionist stuff. By contrast she looked as if she was going for a coffee in the student union. \u201cI always felt that&#xa0;I knew myself pretty well and I&#xa0;didn\u2019t really bother with having an image,\u201d she says.</p> <p>But pop abhors a vacuum, so the image she got lumped with was of an earnest young folk singer who was too po-faced to play the game. In truth she was not immune to the pressures of success. By her third album, <em>Days of Open Hand</em>, released in 1990, she felt trapped by industry expectation.</p> <p>\u201cWe worked for a whole year on that album. In the end I wasn\u2019t really happy with it and there was this palpable sense of disappointment that we\u2019d only sold a million copies. Now that seems really ridiculous.

There is an echo here of McCullers\u2019s career, who also started out with great success, publishing her first novel, <em>The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter</em>, in 1940 at the age of 23. Although she continued to produce acclaimed works like <em>Reflections in a Golden Eye</em> and the collection <em>The Balad of the Sad Cafe</em>, she began to fall out of fashion towards the end of her career, and when she died from a brain haemorrhage at the age of 50, she had been supplanted in the public imagination by other southern writers such as Harper Lee, Truman Capote and Tennessee Williams.</p> <p>Just as Vega had started out as a dancer in New York, McCullers initially set out on a different track, studying piano at Manhattan\u2019s Juilliard School. But after developing rheumatic fever, she took up writing seriously.</p> <p>Often bracketed in the genre of southern gothic, McCullers wrote about her characters with an acute appreciation for human diversity and vulnerability. For Vega, the novelist was decades ahead of her time.</p> <p>\u201cFrom her disabilities to her bisexuality, what she called her dual nature, she was so modern. She was interested in writing from the point of view of black people. And she embodied these things. It wasn\u2019t just \u2018Oh I think I\u2019ll write about civil rights\u2019. She was deep in everything she wrote, and I think she suffered from it too.\u201d</p> <p>Like her heroine, Vega also has a gift for narrative empathy. Her songs often feature characters that feel novelistic in their realisation. After all, Luka was about the abuse of a young boy. At her best she brings to bear formidable powers of writerly observation, which may have something to do with a slight outsider\u2019s perspective developed in her unorthodox cross-cultural upbringing.</p> <p>Vega grew up in the Latino neighbourhood of East Harlem in New York and until she was nine years old, she believed that her stepfather, the Puerto Rican writer Ed Vega, was her father.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know my real father at all,\u201d&#xa0;she says. \u201cIt was a huge shock and&#xa0;very embarrassing. All kinds of issues came up, mostly of identity. Because I was raised to be a proud half-Puerto Rican girl, and I loved my grandmother and aunt and I\u2019d been to Puerto Rico, and I spoke Spanish and ate Puerto Rican food. And suddenly to&#xa0;be told that I was not Puerto Rican at&#xa0;all, that I was white!\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEvjFThqmq0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uEvjFThqmq0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEvjFThqmq0\">Watch the video for <em>99.9</em> F\u00b0 by Suzanne Vega.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In her teens and early 20s, when she was reading a lot of revolutionary writers, she felt uncomfortable with her ethnic status. \u201cIt\u2019s taken me a while to say \u2018You are what you are, it\u2019s fine\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t meet her biological father, Richard Peck, until she was in her late 20s, after she had gained international recognition. She says they have been in each other\u2019s lives ever since and that he\u2019s been very understanding of her sense of dislocation, having been an adopted child himself.</p> <p>For the past 10 years she has been married to a lawyer called Paul Mills, and she has a 22-year-old daughter from a previous marriage to the musician and record producer Mitchell Froom.</p> <p>If her own personal life is pretty stable, that wasn\u2019t the case with McCullers. She married a soldier and wannabe writer, Reeves McCullers, when she was just 20, and thereafter suffered a torturous relationship based on that familiar but unhealthy dynamic of not being able to live together, and not being able to be apart.</p> <p>It ended 16 years later, after various splits and reconciliations, a divorce and remarriage, with Reeves killing himself in what he hoped, mistakenly, would be a double suicide pact with his wife.</p> <p>\u201cThey were almost always out of control,\u201d says Vega, \u201cbut they really sort of needed each other. She took his name, but he kept trying to take bits of her identity, forging her cheques and professing to have all this writing talent himself, though he never put anything on the page.\u201d</p> <p>There were rumours, the kind often associated with successful women, that it was Reeves, who was the real author of the work. Vega knows the syndrome well. Her first husband produced her fourth album, which marked a significant shift towards a more electronic style of music. At the time there were suggestions that Froom drove the change.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a camp of people who said, \u2018Oh she changed her style to suit her husband\u2019, which is nonsense. I hired him to do the thing that he did, and he did it really well, and that\u2019s what I wanted him to do.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>McCullers wrote about police brutality very early. The things that she was thinking of, and embodied, are very current</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But while McCullers was the obvious author of her own work, Vega believes her writing lost something when Reeves died, some of its earlier passion and social vision. What McCullers never lost, and Vega makes gentle fun of in one song entitled Harper Lee, is her competitive spirit. The song runs through McCullers\u2019s opinions of other writers \u2013 \u201cVirginia Woolf/She leaves me cold/I recognise the genius/But I\u2019m twice as bold\u201d \u2013 and boasts the catchy chorus: \u201cOh, Harper, Harper./Lee. Lee. Lee./She only wrote that one book!/I\u2019ve written more than three.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe was trained by her mother to be a genius,\u201d Vega says of McCuller\u2019s motivation. \u201cSo you get the sense if you\u2019re not a great genius maybe your mother won\u2019t love you. She wasn\u2019t going to let that go, and if that wrecked your marriage, well then that\u2019s just too bad.\u201d</p> <p>I ask her if she feels competitive with other musicians.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says without prevarication. \u201cI have a jealous streak. I\u2019m jealous of other people\u2019s success, their acclaim, their recognition I guess. But over the years I\u2019ve had to say, you just have to put that away. What I\u2019m not jealous of is people\u2019s freedoms. Because I\u2019ve done what I\u2019ve wanted. So I don\u2019t begrudge anybody\u2019s art. But sometimes I say, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re not up to much.\u2019 I have to wrestle with that, though, because ultimately it will poison your art.\u201d</p> <p>A former Orange prize judge, she says she doesn\u2019t read much modern fiction, preferring classics like Edith Wharton, Charles Dickens, the Bront\u00ebs, James Joyce and Hemingway. The most up-to-the-moment novel she has read recently is 25 years old \u2013 Brett Easton Ellis\u2019s <em>American Psycho</em>, which she didn\u2019t finish first time round. She appreciated the satire much more this time.</p> <p>But what she really loves are biographies, particularly of creative people. Although she\u2019s very careful about maintaining the privacy of her own life, she\u2019s not one of those artists who argue that it\u2019s all about the work. For her, it\u2019s knowledge of the life that enhances appreciation of the work.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAWGw8meEDE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uAWGw8meEDE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAWGw8meEDE\">Watch the video for Book of Dreams by Suzanne Vega.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cSay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/bacon\" title=\"\">Francis Bacon</a>,\u201d she explains. \u201cYou see his work on the canvas, but it\u2019s so much more enriching when you know some of them are his lovers and this is how he lived. This is what his room looked like.\u201d</p> <p>I say it\u2019s notable that Bacon, like McCullers, led a chaotic, alcoholic life.</p> <p>\u201cI think that\u2019s why you become an artist,\u201d she says, \u201cto clear all that out. You have this troubled life and you figure, where am I going to put all this? And you put it on the canvas or the page as overspill in a way.\u201d</p> <p>What survives from that overspill is entirely unpredictable. I tell her that on the way to the interview, I suddenly found myself humming the insanely catchy melody to Tom\u2019s Diner, and having to remind myself to stop, in case she thought I was mocking her.</p> <p>She laughs, but she\u2019s grown used to its background ubiquity. She wrote the song in 1982 and it lay dormant for five years, before becoming a huge global hit. Since then it has been covered, sampled and resampled by everyone from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ci7NhvYeXEk\" title=\"\">REM</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcKIXpyvTAI\" title=\"\">Snoop Dogg</a>.</p> <p>As for McCullers\u2019s legacy, Vega would like to see her read more widely. Her work, she says, is growing more relevant by the day.</p> <p>\u201cEven in the last five years between the last production [of her McCullers show] and this one, so much has changed. The fact that gay people can marry each other now is an amazing leap forward. And that, sadly, we have to have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/blacklivesmatter?lang=en-gb\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter</a> \u2013 that [campaign] would be shocking to her. She wrote about police brutality very early in her career. The things that she was thinking of, and embodied, are very current. So I think there\u2019s a whole generation of people who might find in her a kindred spirit. They just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps, with Vega\u2019s help, they will soon.</p> <p><em>Suzanne Vega performs Lover, Beloved at the </em><a href=\"http://www.thequeenshall.net/whats-on/shows/suzanne-vega-the-lover-beloved-tour-2016\" title=\"\"><em>Queens Hall Edinburgh</em></a><em> (9 Oct), </em><a href=\"http://www.rncm.ac.uk/performance/suzanne-vega/\" title=\"\"><em>RNCM Manchester</em></a><em> (10 Oct), </em><a href=\"https://www.cadoganhall.com/event/suzanne-vega-161011/\" title=\"\"><em>Cadogan Hall</em></a><em> London (11 Oct) and the </em><a href=\"https://www.thsh.co.uk/event/suzanne-vega-the-lover-beloved-tour\" title=\"\"><em>Town Hall Birmingham</em></a><em> (13 Oct).

  "<p>You wouldn\u2019t necessarily know it, but right now Africa is facing a food crisis. With Brexit, global terror attacks, the war in Syria and the seemingly endless string of sporting fixtures vying for our collective attention in 2016 so far, the fact that up to 50 million people across east and Southern Africa are at risk of hunger seems to have largely escaped mention.</p> <p>The continent has been wracked by drought following one of the strongest ever El Ni\u00f1os. And while a natural phenomenon is the immediate cause, however, Africa\u2019s food security has been undermined over recent decades by the rise of monocropping \u2013 the planting of single-crop tracts across vast swathes of scarce arable land.</p> <p>Starting in the 1960s, the \u201cgreen revolution\u201d saw industrial farming practices transplanted to poorer nations. In the second half of the 20th century, its success seemed unassailable: the global harvest of maize, wheat and rice trebled from 640 million tonnes in 1961 to almost 1.8 billion tonnes by 2000.</p> <p>Africa, in particular, embraced new maize varieties with alacrity. Corn now covers up to 70% of some African nations\u2019 farmland and accounts for about <a href=\"http://ruafrica.rutgers.edu/events/media/0405_media/maize_and_grace_jamesmccann.pdf\">50% of calories</a> consumed by humans. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/sep/10/soil-our-best-shot-at-cooling-the-planet-might-be-right-under-our-feet\">Our best shot at cooling the planet might be right under our feet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the enormous cost to the land and people is now becoming clear. A <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4009e.pdf\">recent report</a> by the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) summed up the problem bluntly, stating: <em>\u201c</em>Past agricultural performance is not indicative of future returns<em>\u201d.</em></p> <p>The meticulously-researched document concludes that the green revolution\u2019s \u201cquantum leap\u201d in cereal production has come at the price of soil degradation, salinisation of irrigated areas, over-extraction of groundwater and the build-up of pest resistance. Add climate change into the mix and you have a recipe for disaster. While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jan/11/population-growth-in-africa-grasping-the-scale-of-the-challenge\">Africa\u2019s population is set to double</a> to 2.4 billion by 2050, the FAO warns that maize yields could fall by nearly 20% over that period.</p> <p>The problem is affecting not just quantity, but quality. Lack of rotation and over-use of phosphates and nitrates has degraded the nutrient content of the soil, leaving 2 billion people globally suffering micronutrient malnutrition, many in sub-Saharan Africa. </p> <p>In fact, soil degradation in Kenya, which I\u2019ve been visiting regularly for more than 35 years, is so severe it\u2019s estimated that the productivity of cropland in the country <a href=\"http://www.grida.no/publications/rr/food-crisis/page/3567.aspx\">declined by 40%</a> between 1981 and 2003 as the population doubled.</p> <p>Productive agriculture isn\u2019t just a nice thing to have.

For economies such as Kenya\u2019s, it\u2019s an essential foundation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Kenya is determined to move its economy away from over-reliance on agriculture by transforming itself into a regional hi-tech hub (dubbed, somewhat inevitably, \u201cSilicon Savannah\u201d) with billion-dollar projects coming down the line. But the context is a country in which up to 4 million people still receive food aid annually. </p> <p>But there is an alternative that more and more farmers are exploring. Agroecology \u2013 an approach which takes into account natural ecosystems and uses local knowledge to plant a diversity of crops that boost the sustainability of the farming system as a whole \u2013 is establishing itself in small pockets across Africa.</p> <p>In east Africa, more than 96,000 farmers have adopted a \u201cpush-pull\u201d system for dealing with problematic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemborer\">stemborer pests</a> and <a href=\"http://striga.aatf-africa.org/\">striga weed</a>. The system plants maize alongside fodders and wild grasses that \u201cpush\u201d pests away, or \u201cpull\u201d them towards decoy plants. Their maize yields have increased from an average of 1 to 3.5 tonnes per hectare without the use of chemical insecticides and with minimal external inputs, according to <a href=\"https://www.oaklandinstitute.org/sites/oaklandinstitute.org/files/Push_Pull_Kenya.pdf\">an evaluation</a> by the Oakland Institute.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Kenyan farmers are showing how adaptation to climate change can benefit them and the wider economy. Numerous initiatives are encouraging a switch from single-crop maize to drought-resistant and nutritious sorghum and millet, intercropped with legumes. One such scheme in Wote, run by the Kenyan government and crop research body <a href=\"http://www.icrisat.org/\">ICRISAT</a>, has seen nearly 400 farmers switch, boosting yields and fetching a better price for their crops.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/mar/10/drought-ethiopia-food-aid-resilience\">As drought hits Ethiopia again, food aid risks breaking resilience</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Agroecology isn\u2019t confined to Africa. In fact, there are examples from across the global south of farmers embracing new thinking to improve their yields and the sustainability of their communities. To cite just one example <a href=\"https://foodfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/JA11-The-Scaling-Up-of-Agroecology-Altieri.pdf\">from Brazil</a>, thousands of hill farmers using mulch to cover crops made up of legumes and grasses saw their maize yields jump from 3 to 5 tonnes per hectare without using chemical fertiliser.</p> <p>The big question often asked is: can agroecological farming <em>really</em> feed the world, with the global population hurtling towards 9.6 billion by 2050? It\u2019s clear that there\u2019s increasing evidence it could.</p> <p>A landmark 2001 <a href=\"http://www.agriculturesnetwork.org/magazines/global/coping-with-disaster/reducing-food-poverty-with-sustainable-agriculture#sthash.GQCiFI4y.dpuf\">study</a> by Jules Pretty and Rachel Hine examined 208 projects from 52 countries and found yield increases of 50-100% for rain-fed crops like maize. The cases studied involved 9 million farmers on around 3% of all of the farmed land in Asia, Africa and Latin America and the increases were typically bigger at lower yields, indicating greater benefits for the poorest farmers. </p> <p>To scale these advances even further, however, we need to radically rethink the economic and social mechanisms that keep farmers trapped on the treadmill of producing for international markets at the expense of themselves and their families.

  "<p><strong>Maria Semple, 52, is the author of the bestselling <em>Where\u2019d You Go, Bernadette</em>, which was shortlisted for the 2013 women\u2019s prize for fiction and is currently being adapted for a film directed by Richard Linklater. Before becoming a novelist, she was a TV writer for 15 years, working on hit shows including <em>Ellen</em>, <em>Saturday Night Live</em> and <em>Arrested Development</em>. She lives in Seattle with partner George Meyer, a former executive producer of <em>The Simpsons</em> and now a conservationist, and their 12-year-old daughter. Her latest novel, <em>Today Will Be Different</em>, is about a day in the life of Eleanor Flood, a woman who vows every day that she\u2019ll be a better person.</strong></p> <p><strong>Were you surprised by the success of </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/07/go-bernadette-maria-semple-review\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Where\u2019d You Go, Bernadette</em></strong></a><strong>?</strong><br>Totally surprised. I had written a novel before called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/28/this-one-is-mine-maria-semple-review-nothing-at-stake-bernadette\" title=\"\"><em>This One Is Mine</em></a>. It didn\u2019t sell and didn\u2019t catch on. I felt very discouraged and rejected by readers and by publishing and by everybody. But despite that, I felt like I was a novelist. It takes me a long time to get my point across and process things. And the form of the novel really matched my mind. When I wrote <em>Bernadette</em>, it was an act of defiance against the people who didn\u2019t believe in me. I tried to write something that was purely me and my taste and that I wanted to read. It captured this moment when I was feeling rejected professionally and feeling like a victim in a bad way. I was full of self-pity and I was angry and petulant. I was just in a really toxic mindset.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/07/go-bernadette-maria-semple-review\">Where'd You Go, Bernadette by Maria Semple \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>And yet that seemed to connect with readers. Particularly mothers of school-age children. Why is that, do you think?</strong><br>The way it resonated with people was also a surprise. One of the very interesting things that happens when you write a novel is that you don\u2019t know what the novel is to people. Some people thought it was a send-up of private schools. For me, that was a minor thing in it, although I did want to give it authentic detail. For me it was a book about the conflict I felt between my rage and the true love that I felt for my daughter.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve returned to the theme of a woman whose career hasn\u2019t quite worked out, feeling frustrated by motherhood. Was that conscious?</strong><br>Eleanor [the antiheroine of <em>Today Will Be Different</em>] is still working [as an animator on TV shows] but she does feel that her greatest success is behind her. I think that has to do with being a mother. Despite all of society\u2019s advances, there\u2019s something unseemly about a mother being really ambitious. To be an artist requires a single-mindedness that is supposedly not maternal. Those things conflict with each other. I\u2019m speaking for myself but imagining that it\u2019s the same with other women.</p> <p><strong>In <em>Today Will Be Different</em>, the teenage son Timby comes across as more adult than his mother, Eleanor... How are the parent-child relationships in your novels based on your own experience?</strong><br>In <em>Bernadette</em>, it was an idealised version of us. In <em>Today Will Be Different</em>, it\u2019s about your kid seeing a bad side of you and you feeling bad that your kid sees a bad side of you. I carry a lot of guilt about having been neurotic and letting my emotions get to me in front of my daughter. Half of Timby\u2019s line are things my daughter has said to me. She\u2019s not mean or sarcastic. It\u2019s just the truth. And you feel like you\u2019ve been zinged. When they\u2019re just pointing out the reality.</p> <p><strong>You have said: \u201cYou need to write from a place of almost nausea.\u201d What does that mean to you?</strong><br>All I need to do is stop in my tracks and it appears. With <em>Bernadette</em>, it was the disgust that I felt with myself. I felt really humiliated that I wrote a book that didn\u2019t sell. After that, I didn\u2019t have the whole failure thing any more. <em>Bernadette</em> washed that away. Then my thing was: Why am I so distracted? Why do I always want to be alone and write? Why, when my daughter says \u201cWill you play a game with me?\u201d and I say \u201cYes, later\u201d, do I never play a game with her? Why aren\u2019t I a better version of myself?</p> <p><strong>Is it true a species of Sri Lankan moss frog, Philautus poppiae, is named after your daughter, Poppy?</strong><br>Yes. In the early days of <em>The Simpsons</em>, George would donate to the Global Amphibian Assessment. They count frogs. It has proven to be a hugely important component in the science of climate change. To say thank you, they named a frog after Poppy. We have to make sure it doesn\u2019t go extinct. Because that would be a bad omen.</p> <p><em>Today Will Be Different is published by W&amp;N (\u00a314.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/today-will-be-different.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to order a copy for \u00a312.29</em></a></p>",

Therefore novel technological devices need to be developed that can address health problems and improve quality of life,\u201d reads the blurb for Monday\u2019s keynote session.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/24/only-complacency-can-stop-nigeria-and-africa-from-finally-conquering-polio\">Only complacency can stop Nigeria \u2013\u00a0and Africa \u2013\u00a0from finally conquering polio | Oyewale Tomori</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Is this \u201cmust try harder\u201d assessment correct? Is the solution to stark inequities in global health outcomes, and the enduring exclusion of developing countries from the benefits of innovation, to do more and better innovation?</p> <p>Certainly, innovation for improved global health is arguably needed more than ever with the need to combat new and emerging diseases from Ebola to Zika and to find better ways of tackling non-communicable diseases such as cancer. But when we look at the innovations made in response to Ebola, we should pause for thought.</p> <p>One stark example: in November 2014, when the Ebola outbreak was raging through west Africa, the US Food and Drug Administration went through an <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/race-is-on-to-detect-ebola-more-quickly-1415213428\">expedited approval process</a> for a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.fda.gov/EmergencyPreparedness/Counterterrorism/MedicalCountermeasures/MCMIssues/ucm422400.htm\">one-hour Ebola test</a>, reducing the time for results by five hours from the previous fastest machines. The problem was that few west African countries had the resources to acquire the $40,000 machines or the skills to run them. They were, however, to be found in many US hospitals.</p> <p>Or another example: Med\u00e9cins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) helped to trial and demonstrate the effectiveness of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57a0897ee5274a31e00000e2/Innovations-in-Emergency-Disease-Response_Case-study-MIHIS-project-FINAL.pdf\">new tests for TB in low income and humanitarian settings in 2011-12</a>. But the price of the test made it prohibitive for many countries until a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1001347\">large public-private initiative emerged to subsidise the cost of the tests for 145 developing countries</a> that were most affected by TB. Only then could this innovation benefit those who needed it most.</p> <p>These are far from the only stories of how the poorest are excluded from the innovations that they need most. Once the stories start to accumulate, they turn from a trickle to a river to a flood. And one has to start wondering whether the old adage about famines is not relevant here: famines rarely result from a lack of food, rather it is lack of access to food. Similarly, the inequalities in tackling health problems are not because of a lack of innovation, but because of a lack of access to innovation. The binding constraints, I would argue, are seldom technical but instead related to the political and economic choices, which determine how innovations get funded, resourced and supported, by whom and for whom.</p> <p>What to do in the face of such a system? The answer is to fight the innovation and political battles at the same time. We have to identify the gaps, and to test and trial the best new ideas that can address longstanding challenges faced by the world\u2019s most vulnerable people, and build the evidence base that these ideas really can make a difference. Political leaders need to ensure that the scaling of new solutions includes those people who need innovation most, and who are most likely to be excluded from its benefits.</p> <p>In doing so, it is worth looking to the work of organisations such as MSF, which do an admirable job of balancing the scientific and political aspects of advocacy in their <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.msf.org.uk/access-medicines\">Access to Medicines campaign</a>. But we should also remember the work of pioneers, from Florence Nightingale to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://johnsnowbicentenary.lshtm.ac.uk/about-john-snow/\">John Snow</a>, who worked tirelessly to ensure their ideas benefited those in society who needed them the most.</p> <p>The speakers and delegates at the World Health Summit should remember this pioneering spirit, which fused the spirit of medical discovery with political advocacy. And they should ensure that any statement calling for more and better medical technologies is quickly followed by a statement recognising that technology should at best be seen as a complement to, but never a substitute for, political action.</p> <p></p>",
  "<p>It isn\u2019t an easy subject. It is, however, an important one, and perhaps the best place to start when it comes to the issue of safe standing is to look at the number of countries who have already had the debate and concluded that if it can change football for the better then there is nothing to be afraid of.</p> <p>It is the creation of a safe-standing section that helps to explain why watching football at Celtic Park can have the same effect as standing next to the speakers at an Iron Maiden concert. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/david-conn-inside-sport-blog/2012/dec/02/ermany-bundesliga-noisy-fans\" title=\"\">Germany has led the way</a> and, one by one, the other leagues are following behind. Austria, Switzerland, Hungary, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands all now operate safe standing. Australia is bringing it in. Various grounds in the United States have put it in place. Even Russia, a football environment that sometimes feels like stepping back into the 1980s, has gone for the modern option. CSKA Moscow have safe-standing areas, featuring rail seats, behind both goals in their new stadium, the Arena CSKA.</p> <p>It is also apparent that the majority of Premier League clubs like the idea. Tottenham Hotspur, Crystal Palace, Sunderland, Swansea City, Burnley, Hull City and Watford are all actively pushing for safe standing, and it is commonly known that many others think it is time the league\u2019s chief executive, Richard Scudamore, began exploratory talks with the government. Indeed, one of the people involved in the process estimates that if it went to a vote in the coming week all 20 clubs, bar Liverpool, would support a consultation process.</p> <p>Others suspect Everton might choose to abstain but the safe standing movement certainly appears to be gaining traction. The Chelsea Supporters Trust has asked the club to explore the possibilities at a redeveloped Stamford Bridge. Spurs have already designed parts of their new ground with this in mind, which indicates they imagine the legislation will eventually be changed. David Gold, West Ham\u2019s joint chairman, has backed safe standing and maybe wishes it was already in place, given some of the settling-in issues at their new stadium. Arsenal are keen and, though it is not something the two Manchester clubs feel they should actively push, my information is that both will be supportive, when the time is right. It is just a delicate area when there so many sensitivities to take into account. Nobody wants to be seen as lacking tact, or failing to understand how emotive this issue is on Merseyside.</p> <p>It does, however, feel like more and more people are acknowledging it is time to have the debate and are coming round to the idea that safe standing means exactly what it says, and is arguably safer than the common practice of supporters standing in seated areas.</p> <p>What it does not mean \u2013 and it is important to be clear on this \u2013 is a return to the vast terraces where crushes were once commonplace, injuries taken for granted and a sense of danger was never too far away. A safety barrier would be on each row, eradicating the threat of overcrowding or those old terrace-tumbles when in one sudden sway you could suddenly find yourself transported 20ft in any given direction. The rail seats are bolted upright. They can be turned down for European games, when Uefa insists on all-seated stadiums, but otherwise each spectator would be given a place to stand where their seat would usually be.</p> <p>Liverpool\u2019s position, in line with that of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, is in support of all-seated stadiums and, to go back to my earlier point, this is always going to be a highly sensitive subject. Trevor Hicks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/16/hillsborough-inquests-trevor-hicks-two-daughters-died-evidence\" title=\"\">whose teenage daughters, Sarah and Victoria</a>, died in the tragedy, has explained to me the group\u2019s thinking and we are talking here about someone whose dignity, courage and perseverance marked him out as a man of rare substance during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2016/apr/26/hillsborough-disaster-inquest-jury-returns-verdict-live-updates\" title=\"\">that long, almost unimaginable fight</a> to prove Hillsborough was not just a national disaster but a national scandal.</p> <p>His view is that all-seated stadiums have brought more families and young people to football and the sport should not bend to a \u201cvociferous minority who live in the past\u201d. We spoke on Friday and he was absolutely vehement that standing at football should never return. \u201cWe are against any attempts to go backwards. In very simple terms, we think it would be a retrograde step. It is a point of principle and we believe all\u2011seater grounds are much safer.\u201d</p> <p>Is it possible to respect that view, and hold this man in the highest esteem, while also disagreeing? I sincerely hope so because my view is that standing has never really gone away. The Taylor report into the events at Hillsborough, whose recommendations led to the outlawing of standing in the top two divisions, suggested that match\u2011goers would get accustomed to sitting down. Instead, what we see every week are thousands of supporters on their feet in front of their seats. It breaches safety regulations and blocks views. It causes arguments between fans, disputes with stewards and, on occasion, injuries (one recent example being a Manchester United supporter suffering a broken leg when a massed goal celebration at Hull spilled over the seats).</p> <p>In many cases, it also leads to away-fan allocations being reduced, whereas I am yet to see any possible downside to an area such as the one accommodating 2,975 people in a corner of Celtic Park. One quote from the Celtic chief executive, Peter Lawwell, feels highly relevant. \u201cThe introduction of rail seating represents an investment in spectator safety,\u201d he&#xa0;said.</p> <p>A debate of this nature is always going to divide opinion but it does strike me that each club should be allowed the choice and it is a mistake, plain and simple, to assume that everybody affected by Hillsborough is opposed to standing.</p> <p>Stephen Wright, whose brother, Graham, 17, was one of the 96 people to die in that FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest in April 1989, was passed the microphone during the recent AGM of Spirit of Shankly, one of Liverpool\u2019s more influential supporters\u2019 groups, and proceeded to talk in favour of a safe-standing debate, as did every speaker from the floor.</p> <p>Lou Brookes, whose brother, Andrew, died at Hillsborough, aged 26, is another advocate: \u201cI know my brother would have hated sitting. Standing didn\u2019t kill my brother but other factors did.\u201d The Hillsborough Justice Campaign is supportive of a \u201cfull and objective debate\u201d and there was a notable exchange on BBC Radio Merseyside recently when Peter Daykin of the Football Supporters\u2019 Federation was invited to put forward the case for safe standing.</p> <p>Barry Devonside, whose son, Christopher, died at Hillsborough, aged 18, was also on the show, having previously argued in the <em>Liverpool Echo </em>that football should stick with the Taylor report and that it would not be safe to do otherwise. It was all set up for the classic radio format: one guest putting across one side, another taking the opposing view. Except Barry, speaking with dignity and grace, announced he had changed his mind, having made it his business to find out more about what was involved, and now thought there was a legitimate argument that should merit a wider debate.</p> <p>There is certainly an appetite to follow the Bundesliga, given that one of the FSF\u2019s large-scale surveys had 92% of fans in England and Wales wanting a choice between sitting and standing, and you may have seen the news in the last few days about Spirit of Shankly deciding to adopt a position on safe standing, now beginning a process of consultation to determine precisely what that position should be.</p> <p>The surprising thing, perhaps, is that the Premier League has never formally raised the issue when, behind the scenes, the relevant people are fully aware about the strength of support and the sports minister, Tracey Crouch, has stated the standing ban will be reassessed \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/05/liverpool-supporters-consult-hillsborough-safe-standing-anfield\" title=\"\">once evidence from the Scottish experience is available</a>\u201d, the first time any government has committed to a review of the&#xa0;legislation.</p> <p>When the Football League asked its clubs to vote three years ago, 77% were in favour of safe-standing trials. Nobody should be surprised if that number was even higher now bearing in mind the shift in attitude, for instance, that led to Brighton, once opponents of safe standing, announcing a few days ago that they had visited Borussia Dortmund and Celtic, seen how it worked and would eventually like to incorporate such an area at the Amex Stadium. Nobody can be sure when this might be. It is, however, reaching the point when the relevant authorities have to realise it is time they started looking at it seriously&#xa0;themselves.</p>",

That time is 4.18am, to be precise, a moment that recurs across tracks, and finds Tempest\u2019s characters locked into flats, bedrooms, kitchens: Esther, a carer, making sandwiches and swigging beer after a long night shift; Zoe, packing her belongings into bin-bags, the grease of Blu-Tack on the woodwork; Bradley, a Mancunian PR who finds himself in London, alienated and depersonalised, trying to reassure himself that reality still exists by making films on his phone. \u201cWhat\u2019m\u2019I going to do to wake up,\u201d he asks himself, \u201cI know it\u2019s happening, but <em>who</em> is it happening to?\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fO1dZbyZc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W7fO1dZbyZc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fO1dZbyZc\">Watch an album trailer for Let Them Eat Chaos.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>These individual narratives are projected, puppet-style, on to a much larger canvas, in which the global financial crisis, migration, environmental catastrophe and police brutality rotate; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOXXdYtZSbQ\">\u201cmassacres, massacres, new shoes\u201d</a>, as the lyric goes. Tempest\u2019s rallying cry is for us to recognise \u201cthe myth of the individual\u201d, and the damage to our collective consciousness it has done; to burst out of our bedrooms and clubs to save ourselves. Her musical restlessness underpins that message, constantly changing tempo and tone, with the feeling that one could be plunged from a lullaby to a piece of savagely fast-paced satire; a clever reference to Bob Dylan\u2019s A Hard Rain\u2019s a-Gonna Fall, a brilliantly downbeat sampling of Sister Sledge\u2019s Thinking of You. But perhaps Tempest\u2019s greatest achievement is not to fall prey to the pressure for unnecessary revolution; her work sits more comfortably in the tradition of perfecting the groove, not changing it. That perfection might be illusion, but its pursuit can produce wonderful work, as it has right here.</p>",
  "<p>Few space missions can claim to be as dramatic as the European Space Agency\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta\" title=\"\">Rosetta comet\u2011chaser</a>. Launched in 2004, it captured the public\u2019s attention in November 2014 because of its placing of the Philae lander on the \u201cduck-shaped\u201d comet <a href=\"http://sci.esa.int/rosetta/14615-comet-67p/\" title=\"\">67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko</a> in search of the chemicals that made life possible on Earth.</p> <p>ESA project scientist Matt Taylor is the public face of the mission. Born in Manor Park, north-east London, the son of a bricklayer, he has become instantly recognisable thanks to his tattoos. We spoke to him shortly before Rosetta completed its final task, crash-landing on to the comet\u2019s surface.</p> <p><strong>How are you feeling now it is the end of the&#xa0;mission?</strong><br>It\u2019s the end of the operational mission, but the science is continuing and it will continue for many years. Some of the people here [at the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany] today are PhD students. They will continue their careers working on Rosetta data \u2013 there is so much of it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Certain rock singers should have stopped when they were fully functioning, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing with Rosetta</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Rosetta is being commanded to plunge into its target comet \u2013 why destroy it?</strong><br>Science. That\u2019s what this is all about. That\u2019s the reason for doing this. It wasn\u2019t to give my colleagues here in ESOC a toy to play with to fly around a comet, although they have done a very good job. It was for the science and that is what we are celebrating here. This final plunge is allowing us to get to a region above the comet that we would never have been able to get to otherwise. The plunge is the only way to get this low \u2013 to where the ice becomes the gas. It was one of the goals of the mission to study this and this is how to do it.</p> <p><strong>Couldn\u2019t you have put it into hibernation and revived it in five years\u2019 time?</strong><br>It\u2019s like rock bands: I\u2019ve seen certain rock bands with certain singers who can\u2019t sing any more. They should have stopped when they were fully functioning and that is what we were doing here. If we were talking about going into hibernation again, we don\u2019t know whether the spacecraft will come back. We don\u2019t know how it is going to function when it comes back, we don\u2019t know what the quality of its voice is going to be or how rheumatic its hands are going to be when playing guitar. This way, we are getting something unique during the descent. So what better way to go out?</p> <p><strong>Why now?</strong><br>Rosetta has been in space since 2004. It is ageing. Even when we came out of hibernation, we noticed some issues with the thruster system and the reaction wheels. So we were looking at different options for when we went out away from the sun again. The power is dropping fast; we\u2019ve already switched off a number of payload items. This weekend [1-2 October], we start to move into conjunction [where the sun blocks the signal from the spacecraft]. The signal from the spacecraft will drop through the floor to 1kb/s. It\u2019s only 41kb/s now [domestic fibre optic broadband can be 1,000 times faster than this]. This weekend is the wall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cbbb0356dc1865871ad4129c721d9748d877731d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbbb0356dc1865871ad4129c721d9748d877731d/74_0_2456_3070/800.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Taylor\u2019s Rosetta-themed thigh tattoo.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Taylor\u2019s Rosetta-themed thigh tattoo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What\u2019s been the most surprising result from the mission?</strong><br>That\u2019s a tough one, because I should try to balance everything and keep everyone [on the individual instrument teams] equally happy. We\u2019ve analysed this comet from kilometre scales down to micrometre and nanometre scales now. We are linking from the dust grains at the very smallest scales to the way these stuck together to make the comet as a whole. We have got that tracked now.</p> <p><strong>It is actually two comets stuck together, isn\u2019t it?</strong><br>The orientation of the layers can tell you when you have two different bodies. I make the analogy to onion skins: the \u201cduck shape\u201d of this comet can only be formed by two of these onions coming together. You could not get this shape by getting a big onion and chewing out the middle bit. This has to be two objects that have come together.</p> <p><strong>The mission set out to determine whether comets brought water and the organic, carbon-rich molecules necessary for life to Earth. What did the mission reveal?</strong><br>It says that comets were not the dominant mechanism for delivering water to Earth. It does not say that they never hit the Earth, but they did not bring the majority of the Earth\u2019s oceans. That water matches what we find in asteroids, so they did the majority of that delivery. But when you look at the other stuff in the comet \u2013 the really cool stuff \u2013 the amino acids and other organics that we have detected, this could have come to Earth from comets. It\u2019s like when someone first invented beer: they put some water and other stuff together and it fermented. I think it\u2019s like that for life on Earth. Asteroids bring the water, comets bring the funky&#xa0;organics.</p> <p><strong>Does the existence of water on comets make human exploration of space any easier?</strong><br>Any time you put anything in space, you learn from it. It might not be directly applicable, however, to landing humans on Mars. It costs a lot to launch stuff into space, but what if that stuff is in space already? Comets contain water and all the material to make fuel, but are just a bit too difficult to use as a fuel stop, I think. They travel really fast and are difficult to orbit around, as demonstrated by Rosetta. However, they are all pieces that you can learn from. But can you connect Rosetta to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/04/the-martian-review-matt-damon-shines-stranded-astronaut\" title=\"\">Matt Damon on Mars</a>?

Did you expect there to be so much public&#xa0;interest?</strong><br>In terms of the mission, we knew it was going to be big. We knew it was special; it was exploration, it was danger. But we did not conceive that we would have this level of interest. In terms of myself, I didn\u2019t expect this, I don\u2019t welcome it, but it is part of my job to promote the mission, to tell everyone why this mission is important and to tell everyone why their tax money has gone into this.</p> <p>The interest in me personally is something that I wasn\u2019t expecting. My family didn\u2019t expect it and don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t particularly like it, but it is part of the job now. And that, I expect, will go away, frankly. Although the mission will continue scientifically, there will not be that level of interest because we haven\u2019t got a live spacecraft. I will not be sorry to see it reduce. Maybe I\u2019ll&#xa0;turn <a href=\"http://twitter.com/esa_rosetta\" title=\"\">Twitter</a> off in the next couple of months and say, that was just part of the operational phase of the mission. There is something about the operational phase that makes it feel current.</p> <p><strong>What do you remember of Rosetta\u2019s wake-up in January 2014?</strong><br>Wake-up was the first milestone. We went from nothing to something. It was the anticipation of whether we have a mission at all. All the years of preparation and work was dependent upon those eight hours of the spacecraft autonomously warming itself up and finding Earth to re-establish contact. One of my memories was looking around and seeing one of the guys who was responsible for writing the hibernation exit software and that guy looked very relieved. I remember a lot of going: \u201cYeah, yeah!\u201d but then thinking: \u201cOh God, we\u2019ve got all this work to do.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/gallery/2014/nov/13/rosetta-mission-philae-landing-site-comet-67p-pictures\">Rosetta mission: Philae's landing site on comet 67P \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Is ESA looking at a follow-on mission?</strong><br>We\u2019ll see what comes in during the <a href=\"http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/call-for-m5-missions\" title=\"\">M5 call</a> [an opportunity to propose medium-size missions to ESA that closed on 5 October]. Maybe some of those will be minor body missions. We have yet to return samples from a comet, but maybe that\u2019s too hard to do. The material is really volatile and needs to be kept really cold, \u2013150C, all the way down to Earth. That is a real challenge. There are ideas being studied, but we wait for the scientific community to propose them. I leave it to them to give me a job, if they want me.</p> <p><strong>So what\u2019s next for you?</strong><br>I stay on Rosetta for a couple of years. This is the archive phase, where we make sure the data is the best quality. And I try to encourage my colleagues to continue to work together for the continued goal of science. My job will be to set up workshops and get people together and generate the momentum to keep this going.</p> <p><strong>Any regrets?</strong><br>I think I will only be able to answer that question fully in a couple of years. I don\u2019t think many of the mission\u2019s milestones will sink in and process properly until then. There are parts that I can\u2019t even remember clearly \u2013 maybe that is a psychological defence.</p>",

Four years later, she has become a monument of <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=picasso+olga&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgil=HM0Wr02bs1b1rM%253A%253BnZDlBAYAujfFoM%253Bhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.wikiart.org%25252Fen%25252Fpablo-picasso%25252Folga-1923&amp;source=iu&amp;pf=m&amp;fir=HM0Wr02bs1b1rM%253A%252CnZDlBAYAujfFoM%252C_&amp;usg=__VnlvYsOGo2_KsRX5sZm1MMf2DqU%3D&amp;biw=1139&amp;bih=674&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimpcin1sPPAhWLAMAKHaCdAVUQyjcIiQE&amp;ei=RPP0V6bzBouBgAagu4aoBQ#imgrc=HM0Wr02bs1b1rM%3A\">neoclassical maternity</a>. By 1927, Picasso has fallen for the teenage Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter, although Olga \u2013 now a sharp-featured crag \u2013 is the last to know.</p> <p>When she finds out, Picasso paints a post-cubist rant: Olga as <a href=\"http://www.npg.org.uk/assets/microsites/Picasso/images/Hat2.jpg\">a pinched polyhedron</a> with a hyphen-slot mouth and ridiculous hat. Her shining eyes are now dumb black pennies.</p> <p>These images, and more, appear on opposite walls of <a href=\"http://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/picasso-portraits/exhibition.php\">this show</a> so viewers can look back and forth between them. What strikes are all the usual wonders \u2013 Picasso\u2019s stupendous draughtsmanship and super-fertile mind, always inventing new pictorial ideas \u2013 but also his sheer volatility. He is sardonic, lustful, exuberant, passionate, satirical, furious. The mood swings from love and camaraderie through humour to outright aggression. This is not Picasso as we generally know him.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If all portraits are caricatures, then Picasso\u2019s portraits of other people are simultaneously caricatures of himself</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In fact, the show is a true liberation from art-historical constraints. Its curator, Elizabeth Cowling, urges us to view Picasso as an actual man rather than an avant garde deity. She has assembled nearly 80 portraits from every phase of his career \u2013 blue period drinkers, cubist fl\u00e2neurs, opulent nudes, caricatures, late self-portraits \u2013 in a condensed retrospective that fills the entire ground floor of the National Portrait Gallery. Nor are these pseudo-portraits, like the Tate\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/picasso-weeping-woman-t05010\"><em>Weeping Woman</em></a>, lacking any sense of individual presence. Each image has force of personality, no matter how remote from conventional likeness.</p> <p>Picasso is compulsive, constantly redefining the portrait for every sitter. <a href=\"http://archive.acquavellagalleries.com/exhibitions/2008-10-15_picassos-marie-therese/\">Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se</a> is a lavender moon or a rhythm of interlocking ovals, holding her own bosomy beauty together; the dealer <a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/111060\">Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler</a> splinters in a fractal proliferation of graphic signs. Picasso\u2019s first partner, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/05/books/chapters/loving-picasso-the-private-journal-of-fernande-olivier.html\">Fernande</a>, is broken into wintry planes at the end of the affair, built up in loving smudges at the start.</p> <p>The sneaky vagabond <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/about-us/press-and-media/press-releases/rarely-seen-picasso-portrait-goes-on-display-at-the-national-gallery\">Bibi-la-Pur\u00e9e</a> looks out from such an overhang of impasto he seems to be literally squinting through the paint.

He can draw like Raphael (as he once boasted) yet depict his infant daughter Maya like a plump Peppa Pig. And the crux is always drawing, as this show successfully demonstrates. Picasso the schoolboy cartoonist becomes the quickfire genius encapsulating character and likeness in tight kernels of truth.</p> <p>Take his <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/209135976416428232/\">sketch of Stravinsky</a> \u2013 a perfect lesson in draughtsmanship. Here is the composer\u2019s taut mask, inscribed with exacting frown lines, the collar summarily defined by the tie, the glasses two quick arcs that the mind\u2019s eye completes. All of Stravinsky\u2019s acerbity and logicality, his disciplined but almost unthinkable vision, are transcribed in these knife-edge contours. The hair is so sparingly drawn you can count the marks \u2013 and what\u2019s hair but a sheaf of lines?</p> <p>This is Stravinsky distilled, but not mocked. Picasso would have been the greatest caricaturist who ever lived had his imagination stopped at wit. And yet his portraits are often comic. Two grisaille paintings in this show are like frames from some early cartoon. Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se poses nude, breasts a plump sofa, nipples and eyes rhyming like upholstery buttons. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/mar/11/french-muse-nusch-eluard-surrealist\">Nusch \u00c9luard</a>, a professional acrobat, resembles a particularly spiky Wilma Flintstone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27d4239e66a107b9be5f31b39d060e92a48b0c35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27d4239e66a107b9be5f31b39d060e92a48b0c35/0_0_1535_2066/743.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Nusch \u00c9luard by Pablo Picasso, 1938.\" width=\"743\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Cubism caricatured years later\u2019: Portrait of Nusch \u00c9luard by Pablo Picasso, 1938.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Succession Picasso/DACS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Picasso\u2019s style here, in 1938, seems to prefigure the great Hanna-Barbera era. And not the least humour lies in the artist\u2019s self-parody. Nusch\u2019s eyes have swapped places on either side of her nose, cubism caricatured years later. Picasso darts restlessly back and forth between styles. A 1954 portrait of <a href=\"http://www.pablo-ruiz-picasso.net/photo-195.php\">his second wife, Jacqueline</a>, her face a white oval framed by a black scarf, conflates early blue period sentimentality with neoclassicism and hints of El Greco. Later, she has become an armour-plated warrior, one fish-eye trained upon the artist in the gloomy interior, the other on the green world through the window. She looks like a post-cubist Minoan.</p> <p>The portrait is dark, claustrophobic, oppressive; its geometric forms are scored into the surface with the brush end. But even these marks remain suavely athletic. Picasso\u2019s signature is in every line of his work, and every line communicates the sheer physical virtuosity of its making.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/30/pablo-people-picasso-national-portrait-gallery\">Pablo\u2019s people: the truth about Picasso's portraits</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jacqueline sat regularly for Picasso, though he also worked from photographs and memory. But what this show reveals is a more startling source for the portraits. Picasso\u2019s paintings talk back and forth across the gallery (it never really feels as if he\u2019s dead), calling each other into being. The coinages in one are ramified in another, shapes are echoed, riffs multiplied, reprised or distorted. Look from neoclassical Olga to polyhedron Olga and you see it is not just the woman but her painted portrait that\u2019s mocked.</p> <p>And Picasso also rounds on himself: filthy monkey, priapic octogenarian, bony death\u2019s head with sightless eyes (what lies beyond?) Even the late brothel etchings \u2013 Rembrandt badly overexcited, Raphael making love, but not so passionately he has to put down his brushes \u2013 are self-satirical, exposing Picasso\u2019s notoriously competitive streak. If all portraits are essentially caricatures, to paraphrase the artist, then Picasso\u2019s portraits of other people are simultaneously caricatures of himself.</p> <p>And that is the revelation of this enthralling show: it humanises Picasso, weaving the story of his life with that of his art in a most intimate way. And he himself saw it as a vast pictorial autobiography. Certainly the subject of his portraits is picture-making \u2013 the late takes on Vel\u00e1zquez are nothing less than portraits of pictures \u2013 as much as the human beings who came before him. But for all his superhuman genius, Picasso turns out to be just as mortal.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/dec/05/philippe-parreno-serpentine-gallery-review\">Philippe Parreno</a>, French film-installationist extraordinaire, has <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/hyundai-commission/hyundai-commission-philippe-parreno-anywhen\">transformed the Turbine Hall</a> at Tate Modern into a subaqueous tank.

She says favelas have been fighting for decades just to make it on to the planning maps that serve as the basis for determining provision of city services and on where to stage construction projects.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis Vila Aut\u00f3dromo situation reminds me of a [Brazilian Petroleum giant] Petrobras advertisement that showed the city from above, and if you see the picture it has the landscape of Rio without any favelas in the hills, which are completely green,\u201d Rolnik says. \u201cThat\u2019s a powerful mechanism of denial of existence.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1884e78b59c88b50ba5fdcd43624ad9e03cb67ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1884e78b59c88b50ba5fdcd43624ad9e03cb67ec/0_0_1696_2328/729.jpg\" alt=\"petrobras ad\" width=\"729\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Petrobras advert wiping out Rio de Janeiro\u2019s favelas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Viomundo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Rio De Janeiro city council produced the guide through its tourism arm RioTur, which in turn commissioned Mirian Isabel Say of Tem\u00e1tica Cartografia to create the map.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere was no discrimination, prejudice or deliberate exclusion,\u201d Say explains. She argues it is not technically feasible to include all details of a city in a tourist map, and that if residents were unhappy they could provide feedback for consideration in the next update.</p> <p>Say\u2019s efforts with RioTur certainly went further than previous editions of the agency\u2019s city guides, which like the Petrobras advertisement and the work of many private mapmaking companies render even high-profile favelas like Vidigal, one of the city\u2019s top tourist attractions, and Rocinha, featuring a population of more than 70,000, as uninhabited jungle backdrops for the wealthy urban enclaves of S\u00e3o Conrado and Leblon.</p> <p>Online map providers once excluded favelas as well, but the digital topography is changing rapidly. Microsoft and Google have both ramped up coverage of Rio\u2019s informal urban areas, however, the inclusion of certain favelas with a high crime rate proved controversial last year when 70-year-old Regina Murmura was murdered after the Google-owned Waze app directed her to a dangerous area featuring a street with the same name as her intended destination.

  "<p>Midway through her conference speech, Amber Rudd paused and waited for the applause. At first, her announcement that only the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/04/rudd-announces-crackdown-on-overseas-students-and-new-work-visas\" title=\"\">\u201cbrightest and best\u201d foreign students </a>would be welcome in British universities, and that those wanting to join \u201clower quality courses\u201d should be kept out because they would be economically unproductive, drew none. She smiled expectantly, and then came a ripple. Was her Tory audience a little confused? Was this really the same Amber Rudd who only weeks before had warned that Brexit would do untold damage to the nation and cause an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/mar/24/energy-secretary-electric-shock-eu-referendum-brexit\" title=\"\">\u201celectric shock\u201d to the UK economy?</a> The same Amber Rudd who had said before the EU referendum that Boris Johnson was not fit to run you home after a party, never mind run anything else? The same person who had appeared on TV over the summer fulminating against those misguided, narrow-minded Brexiters?</p> <p>Last week\u2019s Tory conference required everyone to clear their memory banks and delete all such inconvenient details of recent history. Never mind what Rudd had believed so passionately in June. Here was the new-look home secretary embracing a hard Brexit as a fantastic opportunity to slash immigration, keep young foreigners out if they were judged second-rate, and shame British companies who signed up too many overseas workers and not enough Brits. \u201cWork with us, not against us, and we\u2019ll better control immigration and protect our economy,\u201d was her message now. When Theresa May spoke the following day, Rudd and Johnson, the prime minister\u2019s surprise choice for the post of foreign secretary, were new best friends, sitting side by side, glancing approvingly at one another time after time as ovation followed ovation.</p> <p>In party political terms, the Conservatives will look back on their four days in Birmingham as a success. Unity was what mattered most, not consistency. In the insulated confines of Birmingham\u2019s International Convention Centre, it seemed to matter little that the pound was diving on world markets or that representatives of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/30/nissan-hard-brexit-compensation-new-uk-investment-tariffs\" title=\"\">UK car industry</a> were touring the bars warning that Nissan and other big companies might well decide to move their plants to Slovakia within months because a hard Brexit would be a disaster, and a soft one little better. \u201cWe can see no outcome for us from all of this that is better than what we have now,\u201d said one senior car industry figure.</p> <p>Most Brexit-supporting Tory MPs seemed not the least bit alarmed by such talk. They convinced each other that it was all going very well indeed. \u201cWe are resetting the dial on British politics,\u201d one remarked. \u201cMarkets fluctuate. The pound will recover. Look what the falling pound is doing for our exports!\u201d While most Conservatives wore looks of cheery optimism that bordered in some cases on smugness, Labour, the supposedly pro-EU party to which the forgotten 48% who voted to remain are looking to for reassurance and hope, was notably quiet.</p> <p>After his own difficult party conference the week before, Jeremy Corbyn was pictured walking in Northumberland with his wife as the Tories got under way in Birmingham. Later in the week he was more concerned with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/07/labour-reshuffle-jonathan-ashworth-shadow-health-secretary-nec-national-executive-committee\" title=\"\">reshuffling his shadow cabinet </a>than commenting on the country\u2019s future in Europe.</p> <p>The frustration of those who want to fight against hard Brexit and who are tearing their hair out at Labour\u2019s divisions on issues as central to the Brexit debate as immigration was perhaps best exemplified by news that an exasperated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/07/tony-blair-political-comeback-labour\" title=\"\">Tony Blair was considering returning</a> to some role in front-line politics. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s a tragedy for British politics if the choice before the country is a Conservative government going for a hard Brexit and an ultra-left Labour party that believes in a set of policies that takes us back to the 60s,\u201d Blair told <em>Esquire</em> magazine. \u201cDo I feel strongly about it? Yes, I do. Am I very motivated by that? Yes. Where do I go from here? What exactly do I do? That\u2019s an open question.\u201d</p> <p>He and others could see that the Tories were wide open to challenge but were being allowed, by the lack of effective opposition, to run what he called a \u201cone-party state\u201d and drive the UK out of the EU in a way that much of the business community regards as hugely risky and without regard to the concerns of the almost half of voters who backed Remain on 23 June.</p> <p>The Conservatives had two objectives last week and the more they tried to deliver on both, the more the tensions and contradictions that Labour failed adequately to expose became evident. The first was to convince their own party \u2013 and as much as possible the country \u2013 that they would deliver the will of the people and make a success of getting out of the European Union. Having concluded that immigration was the main factor behind the narrow Leave win, they felt they had to be crystal clear that Brexit would be both hard and clean, and that they would be ready to leave the EU single market, which the Conservative party has championed for decades, if that was what was needed to control immigration. The \u201cliberal elite\u201d who tried to soften Brexit and spoke up for the benefits of immigration and working with our partners were dismissed as sour, bad losers flouting democracy.</p> <p>The second aim was to showcase the personal vision of prime minister May, allowing her to explain how she intended to create \u201ca country that works for everyone, not just the privileged few\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-consigns-cameron-to-history-in-populist-speech\" title=\"\">May\u2019s first conference speech </a>as prime minister shunned the individualism of Margaret Thatcher and the shrinking-state Conservatism of her successors, including David Cameron, replacing all that with a commitment to an active state that would intervene wherever and whenever it could to help people \u201cacross the line\u201d. \u201cWe succeed or fail together,\u201d said May, recalling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/19/alistair-brownlee-jonny-world-triathlon-series\" title=\"\">one Brownlee brother dragging the other across the finishing line</a> in their recent triathlon success. \u201cWe achieve or fall short together. When one of us falters, our human instinct is to reach out our hand and help them over the line. There is more to life than individualism and self-interest,\u201d she declared, in what was intended to be a defining section of her speech.</p> <p>But just as budgets can unravel fast, so can conferences that play too much to the party gallery and then crash into reality. The hard Brexit lines looked like a pitch for Ukip votes. Ukip\u2019s main donor, Arron Banks, said the Tories had morphed into Ukip itself. Business was alarmed. The anti-immigrant dog whistling certainly did not sit easily with May\u2019s softer themes, her appeals to the centre ground, her talk of a global Britain, her pledges to help everyone succeed.</p> <p>On several occasions May and her ministers went too far and had to backtrack. No sooner had she suggested that foreign doctors would have to return home from 2025 once enough extra home-grown ones had been trained than she retracted it, saying this would not in fact be the case. The morning after Rudd had intimated that ministers would \u201cname and shame\u201d companies that employed too many foreign workers, she went on BBC radio to say this was \u201cnot something we\u2019re definitely going to do\u201d. The Tories were pulling to the right then to the left then back.</p> <p>Within Conservative ranks, fissures were exposed. Former minister Nick Herbert warned of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/beware-brexit-three-blind-mice-nick-herbert\" title=\"\">dangers of \u201cBrexit fundamentalism\u201d</a> while former education secretary Nicky Morgan said that hard Brexit would encourage people \u201cto say things about their fellow citizens that promote intolerance and bigotry\u201d.</p> <p>Some Tories, and even the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, worried that the party might lose the support of business. The day after the conference, as the pound plummeted in reaction to all the Brexit noise and May\u2019s conference speech, in which she spoke of the \u201cbad side\u201d of low interest rates and quantitative easing, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, gave an interview in New York to row back a bit on the nationalist tone of his colleagues. Clearly worried, he made it clear that the UK was not shutting the door completely to the single market or free movement of labour. The British people had certainly voted, he told the Bloomberg news agency, not to have full \u201cfree movement\u201d of people. \u201c[But] that is not the same as \u2018we will not allow any people from the EU to come into the UK. It\u2019s about controls and processes,\u2019\u201d he said.</p> <p>Hammond also went out of his way to counter the delusion among many Tories that the economy was enjoying some sort of post-referendum boom, questioning the wisdom of papers such as the <em>Daily Mail</em> that had claimed day after day that all was wonderful in Brexit land. \u201cSadly, there is a part of the British press saying precisely that. The answer, of course, is that the data that the media is mostly focused on is backward-looking data, which tells us a very good news story, that the UK economy was more robust than we thought in the first half of this year.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday the pound suffered more dramatic and alarming fluctuations, including a short-term \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/07/theories-emerge-for-pounds-flash-crash-against-dollar\" title=\"\">flash crash</a>\u201d with analysts blaming concern over the UK government\u2019s approach to Brexit. Hammond appealed again for calm.</p> <p>The party conference season south of the border is over (the pro-EU SNP will meet in Glasgow this week). Tories have been sent back to their constituencies with simple hard Brexit messages. Some see through them to difficult times ahead. On Sunday former chancellor Kenneth Clarke will appear on the BBC\u2019s <em>Andrew Marr Show</em> and make clear his worries about leaving the single market. Other Tories are anxious about May\u2019s promotion of an active state and her new \u201cborrow to build\u201d approach. MPs in all parties want a vote in parliament on any decision to leave the single market. The CBI is on the warpath. But with Labour divided and incoherent on Europe, Jeremy Corbyn a lukewarm defender of the single market, and the Lib Dems struggling to be heard, the forgotten 48% lack a champion they can trust to hold back the Tory charge to the exit.</p> <p>Polling released on Sunday by the New Economics Foundation (Nef) shows that among Remain voters, 68% say they are likely to vote at the next general election according to how political parties deal with Brexit. Some 77% agreed that issues such as tax avoidance, climate change, international security and global poverty can only be tackled by working with other countries and that it would be bad for Britain if its government retreated from these global relationships. Marc Stears, Nef\u2019s chief executive, said the conferences had concentrated inevitably on the interests of those who wanted to leave. \u201cNo one has been very interested in the views of Remain voters. But the findings of this poll show that any political leader who turns their back on the 48%, seeking to diminish and jettison values like tolerance and internationalism, does so at their peril,\u201d he said.</p> <p>At the end of her speech on Wednesday, May appealed to the entire country to back her. \u201cTo everyone here this morning \u2013 and the millions beyond, whether Leavers or Remain \u2013 I say: come with me and we\u2019ll write that brighter future.\u201d She may have done enough to unite most if not all in her own party last week, but to many others outside it, including much of the business community, the future she spoke of looks darker than it did a week ago.</p>",
  "<p>The concept of an industrial strategy seems like a topic that must have featured in <em>Yes Minister</em>, the peerless 1980s political sitcom starring Paul Eddington and Nigel Hawthorne.</p> <p>Yet, oddly, it never did. Still, the series did touch on some themes that look relevant now the policy is back in vogue, such as when Hawthorne\u2019s Sir Humphrey was asked if he shouldn\u2019t believe in policies he implements. \u201cI have served 11 governments,\u201d he explains. \u201cIf I\u2019d believed in all their policies, I\u2019d have been ... committed to keeping out of the Common Market, and ... committed to joining it. I\u2019d have been ... convinced of nationalising steel and of denationalising it.\u201d</p> <p>That seems prophetic given the way our governing party, after years of saying Whitehall must get out of the way of business, is suddenly enthusing about the PM\u2019s new industrial strategy.</p> <p>This week, two former business secretaries, Vince Cable and Michael Heseltine, plus erstwhile chancellor George Osborne, give evidence to the relevant select committee on this topic \u2013 where there may be questions on the HS2 rail link, one of Osborne\u2019s previous efforts in this field. His successor, Philip Hammond, has already pooh-poohed that scheme, saying he believes easily deliverable projects are best \u2013 a credo dubbed the \u201cEddington principle\u201d after its creator. That\u2019s former BA boss Rod, not Paul.</p> <h2>The fund managers working for all of us</h2> <p>You may have noticed that another one of Theresa May\u2019s big themes has been how we need a country that \u201cworks for all of us\u201d \u2013 especially now everyone has given up pretending we\u2019ve all been in it together.</p> <p>This latest iteration of capitalism will get a high-profile boost starting on Sunday when \u201csome of the world\u2019s most influential asset owners, asset managers and policymakers\u201d gather in New York to congratulate themselves on how they \u201care working to make capitalism more equitable, sustainable, and inclusive\u201d.</p> <p>Yes, it\u2019s the third annual conference on inclusive capitalism, when a group of folk that manage combined assets of more than $38 trillion will convene to \u201ccommit to implementing business and investment practices in their companies that extend the opportunities of the economic system to everyone\u201d.</p> <p>Of course, it is almost impossible to satirise such an event.</p> <p>It was founded and is run by the proletarian-sounding Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild \u2013 but please don\u2019t say that her Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism does not live up to its name. The event is invitation only.</p> <h2>Expect some margin of error over YouGov</h2> <p>One of the more fascinating debates had by watchers of the global economy over recent years has to be that wrangle about the efficacy of forecasters. Opinion pollsters, economists or City analysts, the argument goes: which group is the most useless?</p> <p>Well, having slugged it out for years with some heroic misreads, we get a pair of these prizefighters in the same ring this week. The online opinion pollster YouGov is announcing full-year results, which means that some City number-crunchers are assembling guesses about what will be unveiled.</p> <p>For the record Numis \u2013 which, as YouGov\u2019s own broker, you\u2019d assume has a good chance of getting close \u2013 now reckons pre-tax profits will come in at \u00a311.7m. The caveat with that punt, however, is that the same firm quickly had to raise its profit estimate by 7% in August after YouGov made a trading statement.</p> <p>But, what a match the pair seem to be. Like its rivals, YouGov spectacularly called the 2015 general election incorrectly, before following that up by getting this year\u2019s EU referendum wrong too. Still, it has tried to claim it really got it right, despite erroneously calling the result 52-48 in favour of Remain on polling day.</p> <p>Or as YouGov spins it: \u201cThe online polls were right.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>They have a reputation for being sinister loners, creatures that swim the seas in solitary silence before pouncing on unsuspecting prey. Think of the deadly predator in <em>Jaws</em> and you have the perfect stereotype of a shark.</p> <p>But scientists in the United States, using a novel tagging procedure, have discovered that some shark species are really finny networkers who like to spend their time mixing and chilling out together. In some cases, the sharks were found to spend up to 95 consecutive hours together. And all without <a href=\"https://www.snapchat.com/\">Snapchat</a>.</p> <p>The shark project is the handiwork of University of Delaware researchers who have collected tens of thousands of interactions between the 300 or so sand tiger sharks, fitted with electronic tags, over the past four years. Details of their research has just been published in the <em>Nature</em> journal <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/articles/srep34087\"><em>Scientific Reports</em></a> and could provide invaluable information for preserving sand tiger shark populations.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The two tagged sharks encountered more than 50% of all the other tagged sand tigers on the east coast of the US</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The sand tiger shark, which is related to the great white shark, is fished for its meat, liver oil and fins and is also hunted for sport and caught in beach nets and trawls. In addition, it is considered vulnerable because of its low reproduction rates, producing only one to two pups every two or three years.</p> <p>The University of Delaware project was launched in 2012 with only a modest 20 sand tiger sharks involved at first. Each had an implanted acoustic transceiver fitted to study their movements. \u201cWe knew that during the summer the sand tiger population formed groups in Delaware Bay, with male and female adults and juveniles all together in the same places, sometimes very close together,\u201d Danielle Haulsee, the paper\u2019s lead author, told the University of Delaware website <a href=\"http://www.udel.edu/udaily/\">UDaily</a>. However, it was not known where the sharks went during the other six to eight months of the year \u2013 or with whom, if anyone, they consorted, she added.</p> <p>The transceivers were able to answer the question by initially focusing on two male sharks whose movements were tracked throughout the year. Crucially, the devices also recorded details of other animals carrying transmitters that came near the two sharks. These included Atlantic sturgeons, white and sandbar sharks, spiny dogfish and also lemon and bull sharks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/11/400-year-old-greenland-shark-is-the-oldest-vertebrate-animal\">400-year-old Greenland shark is oldest vertebrate animal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The two sand tiger sharks did not always travel together, it was found, but they did reconnect at various times of the year and encountered more than 50% of all the other tagged sand tiger sharks on the east coast of the United States. It was also discovered that sand tigers social behaviour changed considerably at different times of the year. After chilling out in the waters of Delaware Bay in summer, the two males tracked by the researcher headed south in the company of other males. Female sand tiger sharks take a different migration route at this time, it is presumed. Then, off the coast of North Carolina, the males, females and juveniles came together for a massive shark party around December.</p> <p>Sand tiger sharks are proficient hunters of skates, rays and smaller sharks. With its three rows of sharply pointed teeth, it is also one of the fiercest looking of all sharks and has been known to attack humans, although only a few dozen occasions have been recorded, and never with any fatalities. On average, a sand tiger shark reaches a full length of between 6ft and 10ft and weighs between 200lb and 350lb.</p> <p>Haulsee said that the acoustic transceiver tags provided scientists with a way to explore how an individual marine population works.\u201cIf we only studied them in Delaware Bay, we would think the sand tiger shark population is always mixed, with male and female juveniles and adults together throughout the year. Our work has shown that, seasonally, they are changing the size and composition of their groups. Now that we know this, we can start to identify places where human impacts may be affecting one portion of the sand tiger life cycle disproportionately.\u201d</p>",

Muted title sound, yet an opening sequence of such technical magnificence it looked as if it had been beamed back to us from about 2048. The fetlocks of horses were being 3D-modelled with filigree\u2019d and granular precision, as were the noses of crooked barmen (as if there\u2019s any other kind) and doughty sheriffs, and the very ivories of nags\u2019 teeth and of pianolas, and suddenly we were into Westworld, a panorama of haughty big skies, aching beauty and spitefully small human dreams.</p> <p>A world, in case you missed all the media hype (and where on earth were you? Possessing a life?), in which guests will pay handsomely for a week or so in a wild west in which they can go riotously tootsie: sleep with every perfumed whore, gut-shoot every sweaty dog-breath hoodlum. Even, if addled and bourbonned enough, shag the bandit and gun the girl. They\u2019re all robots, programmed to hurt and bleed like us, but also to wake the next day mended and with no memories.</p> <p>It\u2019s an intriguing premise, of course, and, of course it will all go wrong: a sudden aberrant line of source code will risk not only the lives of the guests but, more crucially, the psyches of the androids in the park, who suddenly have twitches of memories. For the moment, we care more about the robots, who seem more human than the visitors, who cannot be physically harmed in the park: a depressing number have chosen to go all black hat with their moneyed freedom, murdering and fornicating at any whim: be advised that this is often nasty viewing.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eX3u0IlBBO4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eX3u0IlBBO4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eX3u0IlBBO4\">Watch a trailer for Westworld.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It could have been just another tricksy CGI fantasy. But it came from the pen of Michael Crichton, responsible for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jurassic-park\"><em>Jurassic Park</em></a>, which also asked pertinent questions about humanity and technology. I would happily class Crichton with Ray Bradbury and Philip K Dick, because they also wrote wisely about ourselves: even when it might have been spuriously about robots, or dinosaurs, it was always about us. What might we do? Are we happy with discovering the people we truly are or only happy with the people we want to be? And if you can\u2019t tell the difference between the humans and the androids, should it matter?</p> <p>This is existentially and morally mired, in that it raises questions not of the narrative in itself but of us, the reader/viewer. This opener was tremendously, deliberately confusing: the good guy is a robot, the bad guy (a tremendous Ed Harris, playing the part he was born to play) a veteran vicious tourist on the hunt for darker levels, to assuage all he lacks in real life, which is shaping up as a howdy-doody lot of a lack. It\u2019s all rather scintillating, not least because if features <em>Borgen</em>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/feb/01/sidse-babett-knudsen-borgens-appeal\">Sidse Babett Knudsen</a> as the searingly blue-eyed head of quality assurance, off stage and chain-smoking high on the controllers\u2019 gantry, intent not on money but simple control: of robots, the \u201clivestock\u201d, but also of every human around her.</p> <p>Could it be a worthy successor to <em>GoT</em>? Absolutely. HBO has another global heavyweight on its hands, thanks to the authors: I\u2019m hooked, in a way I never was with early <em>Thrones</em>. Again: this is not about robots: it\u2019s about us. Yet every time I am tempted to worry about robots taking over the world any time before about 2416 I simply think of self-service tills. Smile my usual smile.</p> <p>Most winning programme of the week was undoubtedly <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b07ycbj5/a-world-without-downs-syndrome\"><strong>A World Without Down\u2019s Syndrome?</strong></a>, in which Sally Phillips, with quizzical wit and just the right salting of lip-trembling anger, asked whether we\u2019re right to hail with such a blizzard of approbation a new non-invasive test for pregnant mothers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfcaa86a8d9e8f662f4c5c99293bf504a0788da8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfcaa86a8d9e8f662f4c5c99293bf504a0788da8/146_0_4372_2624/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Halld\u00f3ra, one of the few people in Iceland with Down\u2019s, and actor Sally Phillips.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Halld\u00f3ra, one of the few people in Iceland with Down\u2019s, and actor Sally Phillips.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Not Known/BBC/Dragonfly</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some of the statistics were frightening. In Iceland, where they have had the test for a while, every positive diagnosis for Down\u2019s has resulted in termination: 100% in the past five years. There are now fewer than 40,000 people with Down\u2019s in Britain. Phillips, whose dear son Olly is one, made a passionate yet refreshingly unsentimental case for the right to have Down\u2019s extant in this world. It\u2019s not a disease, it\u2019s a set of characteristics (and ones that, actually, genetically predispose the child to happiness).</p> <p>Hugely set against this comes the understandable set of fears of any mother: of an inability to cope, of a child\u2019s being bullied, even of their own prejudices. Yet Down\u2019s remains the one disability it has become socially acceptable to \u201ccleanse\u201d and Sally was more than troubled (as was I) by medical professionals\u2019 universal embracing of one and only one tenet: Down\u2019s is always bad, choice is always good. This lucid and strangely uplifting programme should be only the very beginning of a debate we should have been busily having for about 30 years.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the business equivalent of a diamond.

Among the finest and flintiest in the recent spate of films tackling the European migrant influx, Jonas Carpagnino\u2019s serenely confident debut (not a documentary, though there\u2019s little narrative varnish here) tracks two friends from Burkina Faso as they make a new life in Italy, sparing us no complication or point of frustration in the adjustment process. It\u2019s not expressly political film-making: Carpagnino invites viewers to consider his two subjects (beautifully played by Koudous Seihon and Alassane Sy) not as symbols or statistics, but as lively, imperfect people in even less perfect circumstances: amid the broader crisis, they bicker, bruise and rock out to Rihanna. Deservedly a big deal on the festival circuit last year, it\u2019s quietly slipping straight to DVD here.</p> <p>StudioCanal\u2019s giving the same low-key treatment to <strong>Shelley</strong> (StudioCanal, 18), also well worth rescuing from the shelf: Iranian director Ali Abbasi\u2019s Danish-set film is a refreshingly humane, slow-simmering spin on the often lurid pregnancy-horror genre. Soberly following the eerie fallout when a wealthy liberal couple employ their immigrant maid as a surrogate, the film adds all manner of complex social stitching to its velvety atmospherics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5e707a3f8b7d0972f75ec99d71b507675aa0944\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5e707a3f8b7d0972f75ec99d71b507675aa0944/269_0_2503_1502/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Turgid corned-beef hash\u2019: Duncan Jones\u2019s Warcraft: The Beginning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Turgid corned-beef hash\u2019: Duncan Jones\u2019s Warcraft: The Beginning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s already among the bigger flubs of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/aug/09/summer-blockbuster-season-bad-box-office-suicide-squad\" title=\"\">bleak summer for blockbusters</a>, so I shan\u2019t spend too much time telling you what you\u2019ve already heard about Duncan Jones\u2019s optimistically titled video-game adaptation <strong>Warcraft: The Beginning </strong>(Universal, 12): a turgid corned-beef hash of multiple familiar fantasy realms and aesthetics, it might just be the most biliously ugly film ever to cost \u00a3125m. I\u2019m not going to make any great claims for <strong>Race</strong> (Spirit, PG), but it\u2019s a film with some time for beauty. A diverting if overly smooth-sanded Wiki-biopic of trailblazing Olympic athlete Jesse Owens, the film gazes in gilded awe upon his aesthetic prowess, though invites more questions than it perhaps expects to answer when a half-formed subplot semi-celebrates Hitler\u2019s favourite film-maker Leni Riefenstahl for doing the same at the 1936 Munich Olympics.</p> <p>Two of this week\u2019s re-releases are rather special. The Criterion Collection\u2019s latest addition is a double bill: <strong>The Emigrants</strong>/<strong>The New Land</strong> (Sony, 15) gives bright new life to Swedish director Jan Troell\u2019s ravishing yet largely unromanticised 19th-century family saga of a Sm\u00e5land clan journeying to Minnesota. Though they met with Oscar-approved crossover success in the 1970s, the films seem to have fallen out of fashion a bit among cinephiles, but their stately muscularity has aged very well. Meanwhile, the Quay Brothers, the most spookily singular force in stop-motion animation, get the Blu-ray retrospective they deserve in the short film omnibus set <strong>Inner Sanctums \u2013 Quay Brothers: The Collected Animated Films 1979-2013</strong> (BFI, 15) \u2013 which includes, beyond the obvious and treasured content, a new, short Christopher Nolan documentary on the duo\u2019s curious workings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e000027b77744801187a6ca70fe7fbbb6b12915d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e000027b77744801187a6ca70fe7fbbb6b12915d/0_269_2650_1591/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullman in Jan Troell\u2019s The Emigrants.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann in Jan Troell\u2019s The Emigrants.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: www.ronaldgrantarchive.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Netflix\u2019s <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/netflix-50-percent-content-original-programming-cfo-1201865902/\" title=\"\">drive towards having 50% original content</a> is gathering pace. This week saw the online release not just of Ava DuVernay\u2019s eagerly awaited race-relations study <strong>13th</strong> \u2013 see below for Wendy Ide\u2019s take on that \u2013 but also the premiere of <strong>The Siege of Jadotville</strong>, which dramatises the eponymous colonial-era siege in the Congo, as Irish UN troops battled Katangese rebels in 1961. Richie Smyth\u2019s film offers a light grounding of measured political context before launching into rousing gung-ho territory \u2013 anchored sturdily by Jamie Dornan who, after this and the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/11/anthropoid-review-jamie-dornan-cillian-murphy-ss-general\" title=\"\"><em>Anthropoid</em></a>, has probably had his fill of bullet-pocked standoffs for a while. Thinly scripted but technically hale-and-hearty, it\u2019s a slab of action history that looks entirely cinema-ready.</p>",
  "<p>On 27 September, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton faced up to one another in the first of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/presidential-debate-preparation-trump-clinton\" title=\"\">televised presidential debates</a>. Most observers concluded that Clinton had come off best. She was better prepared, they thought, and towards the end Trump seemed rattled and&#xa0;rambling.</p> <p>Needless to say, this didn\u2019t stop the Trump campaign team from using the phrase \u201cTrump Won\u201d in ads <em>even before the debate ended</em>. Aha, you say, that\u2019s American politics for you: you get what you pay for. And in these circumstances, every candidate says that she or he has won anyway, no matter what happened in the debate.</p> <p>But then something interesting happened. The hashtag #TrumpWon went viral on Twitter and in a few hours had reached the top of the global trending list. Trump was on to it like a shot. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/780758306239512577\" title=\"\">\u201cThe #1 trend on Twitter right now,\u201d he tweeted</a>, \u201cis #TrumpWon \u2013 thank you!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Trump declares debate victory.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The #1 trend on Twitter right now is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/TrumpWon?src=hash&quot;&gt;#TrumpWon&lt;/a&gt; - thank you!&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Donald J.

A Twitter user called <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DustinGiebel/status/780814613021548544/photo/1\" title=\"\">@DustinGiebel posted a tweet</a> showing a map of Russia centred on St Petersburg under the heading \u201cThe #TrumpWon hashtag starting location, that\u2019s interesting\u201d. The clear implication was that the hashtag began in St Petersburg and so \u2013 nudge, nudge, wink, wink \u2013 constituted yet another confirmation that Trump has supporters in Russia, possibly even linked to Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>The person who tweeted the map said he\u2019d spotted it on TrendsMap.com, a service that tracks trending topics on Twitter. So I went to the site but couldn\u2019t find the hashtag anywhere near St Petersburg. Neither could <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/27/that-viral-image-showing-trumpwon-starting-in-russia-is-probably-fake/\" title=\"\">Philip Bump of the <em>Washington Post</em></a>; he checked with Trendsmap, which confirmed that the map in the original tweet wasn\u2019t theirs. They also said that, according to their data, the hashtag had originated in the US.</p> <p>At this point, Gilad Lotan, a data scientist who works at <a href=\"https://betaworks.com/\" title=\"\">Betaworks</a>, took up the trail. He researches ways in which people are hacking social networks in order to gain more of what has become the scarcest resource of all in our networked world \u2013 attention. He started by looking for the geographical areas where the hashtag #TrumpWon began trending. He found <a href=\"https://medium.com/i-data/trumpwon-trend-vs-reality-16cec3badd60#.lu50stvo8\" title=\"\">that it never showed up in any Russian location</a>; instead, the growth began in Baltimore and Detroit, after which it very quickly jumped to \u201cworldwide\u201d status and stayed there for a few hours as it spread to Australia and the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Giebel's response to Trump after the debate.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/TrumpWon?src=hash&quot;&gt;#TrumpWon&lt;/a&gt; hashtag starting location, that&amp;#39;s interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/V7SFhvEurX&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/V7SFhvEurX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dusty (@DustinGiebel) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DustinGiebel/status/780814613021548544&quot;&gt;September 27, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Normally, Lotan says, when a hashtag goes viral you see the trend jump from city to city before reaching countrywide or global status. But this didn\u2019t happen with #TrumpWon. Instead, he reports, \u201cthere was a group of highly organised users who all posted the exact same message at around the same time, from (seemingly) different geographic locations. The exact same message was published by thousands of accounts, likely all over the world, a few hours after the debate had ended (between 3-5am UTC time).\u201d</p> <p>The tweet that did the trick read: \u201c#TrumpWon the debate tonight! Let\u2019s make America Great again. Add your name: bit.ly/2dfF4E4\u201d. The link went straight to the Trump campaign website. Lotan then built a network graph of the Twitter users who were first to post to the hashtag. They clustered into four groups \u2013 #MAGA (for Make America Great Again), #Trump2016 1, #Trump2016 2 and #TGDN (a tag used by conservatives to identify each other).</p> <p>This neat piece of network analysis is interesting for several reasons. The first is that it shows that you can never take anything that happens on social media at face value. So when mainstream journalists regard the fact that something is trending on Twitter or Facebook as being significant, one should take the reports with a large handful of salt.</p> <p>The second is that social media of all kinds are now being \u201cgamed\u201d for political, commercial and other purposes. One of the interesting things about the #TrumpWon story, for example, is not only that it was gamed by Trump supporters, but that someone also attempted a counter-strike, seeking to undermine it by faking a Russian connection.</p> <p>But perhaps the most important lesson to draw from the saga is that it highlights the skills one needs to unearth the truth about anything that happens online. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Tomalin\" title=\"\">Nick Tomalin</a>, the great <em>Sunday Times </em>journalist who was killed in the Yom Kippur war, used to say: \u201cThe only qualities essential for real success in journalism are ratlike cunning, a plausible manner and a little literary ability.\u201d To these we now need to add: a knack for network&#xa0;analysis.</p>",
  "<p>As traders caught their breath on Friday morning, following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/07/confusion-as-pound-falls-10-in-insane-asian-trading-and-no-one-knows-why\" title=\"\">the pound\u2019s dramatic overnight plunge</a>, one strategist came up with a neat way of explaining the market forces at play. HSBC strategist David Bloom said: \u201cThe currency is now the de facto official opposition to the government\u2019s policies.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, ministers at the Conservative party conference hint at a hard Brexit and the pound weakens, reflecting widespread fears the UK economy will suffer long-term losses and slip down the global rankings.</p> <p>It is a new world for a currency once happy to bend itself to simple rules: generally, strong economic data boosted the pound, weaker indicators hurt it. Now, as Bloom points out, the pound has become a political and structural currency. As the Brexit drama plays out, sterling is subject to the utterances of divided UK ministers and EU officials, and to worries about Britain\u2019s global standing.</p> <p>Bloom also has an explanation for the pound\u2019s path since the vote, which saw it take a dive, stabilise and then, in the last week, another lurch lower. \u201cTo us, the foreign exchange market is exhibiting an uncanny resemblance to the five stages of grief,\u201d he wrote in a research&#xa0;note.</p> <p>\u201cFirst, following the Brexit vote came the denial \u2013 theories circulated whether a second referendum would have to take place. Second was anger \u2013 claims the vote was unfair. Third was the bargaining \u2013 arguments maybe it wouldn\u2019t be that bad, what if the UK followed the Norwegian or Switzerland model. Now, the fourth \u2013 a gloom is prevailing over the pound.\u201d</p> <p>That gloom stems from worries that the government will put a crackdown on immigration above all else in Brexit negotiations. The price it will pay will be to end up shut out of the single market. The upshot is foreign investors find the UK less attractive, home-grown businesses face costly trade barriers, and the lack of access to skilled workers from overseas compounds their problems.</p> <p>Economists see this as a frightening prospect for an island economy reliant on inward investment. Bank of England governor Mark Carney summed up the risks when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/26/mark-carney-fails-to-rule-out-eight-year-term-at-bank-of-england\" title=\"\">he warned in January that Brexit could test \u201cthe kindness of strangers\u201d</a> that the UK relies on to fund its hefty current-account deficit.</p> <p>These worries are best expressed in the pound, which hit fresh 31-year lows against the dollar on Friday. Even after recovering from a short-lived \u201cflash crash\u201d to $1.1841 in Asian markets, it was still down more than 1% at $1.2450 as a torrid week came to a close. On the day of the Brexit vote, 23 June, it was just below $1.50.</p> <p>Grant Lewis, head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets Europe, <a href=\"http://www.uk.daiwacm.com/research-zone/research-blog/posts/2016/10/sterling-%E2%80%93-far-from-flash\" title=\"\">noted sterling was the world\u2019s worst performing currency over the last week</a>. \u201cEven over a longer time period, sterling now sits among a sorry band of currencies in terms of performance \u2013 since the start of the year only the currencies of Angola, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Venezuela, Mozambique and Suriname have fallen by more.\u201d</p> <p>And there is worse to come, he warns. \u201cSterling\u2019s all-time low against the dollar was $1.05 \u2013 if the government keeps careering headlong into a hard Brexit, a return to those lows is not unimaginable.\u201d Bloom sees the pound at $1.10 by the end of 2017.</p> <p>There are silver linings of course. Tourists have flocked to Britain\u2019s luxury boutiques to buy cheaper watches. For exporters, the weak pound makes their goods more competitive.</p> <p>But to focus on the boon to overseas sales is to forget that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/07/uk-industrial-output-manufacturing-trade-deficit-office-national-statistics\" title=\"\">the UK imports more than it exports</a>. And those imports, from foods to metals, have become pricier on the pound\u2019s fall. British factories will pass those higher costs on to consumers, and sterling\u2019s weakness will be felt at the tills.</p> <p>And so to the fifth phase of grief: acceptance. Currency traders have already reset their expectations for the UK outside the EU. It\u2019s time the public joined them in accepting a vote for Brexit was a vote for a weaker pound \u2013 and all that comes with it.</p> <h2>To QE, or not to QE</h2> <p>So, farewell then quantitative easing, aged seven-and-a-half. It was seen as the solution to the economy\u2019s problems during the dark days of early 2009, but <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-05/may-says-unorthodox-monetary-policy-had-some-bad-side-effects\" title=\"\">Theresa May thinks QE is doing more harm than good</a> and has killed it off.</p> <p>Or perhaps not. There are certainly side-effects associated with the Bank of England\u2019s asset-purchase programme, which will be expanded to almost \u00a3450bn as a result of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\" title=\"\">new round of stimulus announced by Threadneedle Street</a> in August. The object of QE is to drive down interest rates on safe government bonds and encourage investors to move into riskier assets such as shares and property. Not surprisingly, prices of these assets have gone up, enriching those who hold them. But those with assets in a bank or building society savings account have long been getting rotten returns thanks to rock-bottom interest rates.</p> <p>May\u2019s point is that the better-off have milked the benefits of QE while small savers have been hurt by the policy. The message from her speech to the Conservative party conference could not have clearer: this is not good enough and will have to change.</p> <p>Yet when pressed in Washington about whether this meant the government was contemplating changing the Bank\u2019s remit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/06/pound-sterling-chancellor-hammond-wall-street-charm-offensive-business-live\" title=\"\">Philip Hammond was unambiguous: it had no such plans</a>.</p> <p>Nor does the Bank share May\u2019s view about QE. It accepts that there are distributional effects from asset purchases, but says that without QE, the economy would have grown more slowly and unemployment would be higher. It doesn\u2019t accept that there are winners and losers from QE, rather that some gain more than others.</p> <p>Given that this is the Bank\u2019s strongly held view, it is not hard to envisage circumstances during Brexit negotiations in which Mark Carney tells Hammond that he wants more QE and needs the Treasury to indemnify the Bank against possible losses from the trades. In theory, Hammond could say no. But the smart money would be on him saying yes.</p> <h2>Tesco must tread carefully</h2> <p>Tesco\u2019s latest offer for investors is a perplexing one \u2013 enjoy an increase in your share price, but then see your credit rating fall. The supermarket group\u2019s share price surged last week after it reported a 1% increase in like-for-like sales in its half-year results, and chief executive Dave Lewis targeted a 3.5% to 4% operating margin by 2019/2020, well ahead of the present 2.2%.</p> <p>However, ratings agency Moody\u2019s swiftly warned that Tesco could face another downgrade to its credit rating \u2013 which is already at junk level \u2013 because of its \u00a35.9bn pension deficit.</p> <p>Despite Tesco\u2019s recovery under Lewis, the deficit looms over the company. Given the repercussions from the BHS scandal \u2013 which saw the failed company left with a \u00a3571m deficit \u2013 and Theresa May\u2019s tough talk on corporate governance, Tesco faces a delicate balancing act if it is to invest in its shops, make payments to directors and shareholders, and repair its pension scheme.</p>",
  "<p>It was the late 70s, and I was dancing with a revue in <a href=\"http://www.surfersparadise.com/\">Surfers Paradise, Australia</a>. The show was modelled on those at the Lido and Moulin Rouge in Paris. Topless girls, feather plumes and jazzy choreography. I\u2019d been in Australia for a couple of years, initially with a ballet company, and this was a change of pace. I was having a good time.</p> <p>One day, a bunch of surfers hit town. There was a big contest up the coast and some of them came to see the show. Afterwards, they came to a party at the apartment block at the place where we lived. One of them, word went round, was taken with Amanda, a lead dancer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Abellira had a distinctive stance, very low over the board, carving his turns with streamlined precision</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When the surfers arrived, I stared. The guy who fancied Amanda was not some local hotshot, it was <a href=\"http://renoabellira.com/\">Reno Abellira</a>, one of the most stylish wave riders in the world. I\u2019d seen him on film, inscribing long, flowing lines on the Hawaiian North Shore. He had a distinctive stance, very low over his board, carving his turns with streamlined precision. And he was brave. Four years earlier, in what some still consider the greatest big-wave contest ever, he had won the <a href=\"http://www.surfline.com/surf-news/great-moments-in-surfing-history-reno-abellira-wins-the-1974-smirnoff-pro-1_112610/\">Smirnoff Pro on a thunderous day at Waimea Bay</a>, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/63131845\">charging down the near-vertical face of a 30-footer</a> to snatch the victory from fellow Hawaiian Jeff Hakman.</p> <p>And here he was, on a sweltering night in Queensland, surrounded by thirsty, excitable dancers. Amanda was slim as a willow wand, with red hair cascading down her back. A few years later, she would be principal dancer at the Lido in Paris. Reno was all muscle, with a down-turned 70s moustache and skin tanned the colour of Pacific mahogany. He was a handsome guy and a surf god, but this cut no ice with Amanda. She was lovely, with a wicked sense of humour, but when the occasion demanded she could summon a cool ballerina hauteur. She was polite to Reno, but that\u2019s as far as it went.</p> <p>Seeing Reno standing alone, I joined him. I asked him what it felt like to drop into a giant wave like those at Sunset and Waimea, and he told me you felt the fear, but did it anyway. As we talked his eyes followed Amanda, who was prowling around the apartment like a restless jaguar. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s interested,\u201d he said, with the ghost of a smile. \u201cHang in there,\u201d I told him, but it wasn\u2019t long before he left.</p> <p>The next day Amanda and I were warming up before the show. \u201cI think I\u2019ve made a mistake,\u201d she told me. \u201cI really, really liked Reno.\u201d But the surf tour had moved on.</p>",

One of those round spindly stands used for oyster platters is placed on the table. On top of that goes a thick wooden breadboard. On top of that is a torn piece of greaseproof paper, printed with a facsimile of an Italian sports newspaper. On top of that are wedges of toasted bread smeared with tooth-baringly acidic mayo, and on top of that, finally, are the ingredients that we actually ordered as part of the sharing three cicchetti platter. Blimey, I didn\u2019t know whether to eat it or strap on crampons and scale it.</p> <p>I\u2019ll come back to those toppings in a moment, because it\u2019s worth examining his restaurant in a little more detail first.

The staff, mostly pretty Italian boys, occasionally look a little startled, like kids left in charge of the grown-up\u2019s shop, but they are eager and friendly. There are shelves of produce and, of course, stacks of D\u2019Acampo\u2019s books.

God knows there have been times on my travels when I would have killed for somewhere comfortable to rest up. It\u2019s colourful and warming. Two women with large suitcases pull up at the bar, flirt lightly with the waiter and order strawberry daiquiris. They sip and they sigh.</p> <p>Here, as ever, is what I don\u2019t understand. Why spend all this money \u2013 on the waiter\u2019s natty outfits, the marble bar tops, the open ovens, the glassware, and the photos of Gino with Donny \u2013 and then produce such mediocre food?

The best espresso at Euston station is almost certainly served here. It is dark and nutty and powerful. The tiramisu is a model of its kind. It\u2019s not overly sweet and has a fine balance of cream to sponge. They make good zucchini fritti, which is not easy. One of those cicchetti toppings is a pleasing salad of spiralised courgette and fennel with salty capers and the punch of good, peppery olive oil.</p> <p>But everything else seems to be trying to make up its mind whether to be awful or just plain odd. The other two cicchetti are four seared king prawns, not all of which have been cooked through, lending the centre a grey translucence, and small lumps of breaded cod. Some are overcooked and some are under. The \u00a316 price tag for this is on the utterly shameless side of enthusiastic.

It\u2019s dotted with four scallops that have seized up in the heat. Make that three and a half scallops. One of them is missing the best of itself. Still, I suppose it was there in the fridge when the order came in, why not throw it into the pot? Nobody will notice. Or perhaps they will.</p> <p>The same attention to margins and gross profit appears to apply to the seafood linguine. I do a count. There\u2019s one big prawn, two mussels, two rings of calamari cooked to the rubber-band stage, and four clams. For \u00a313.50. I check the menu. It also mentions a langoustine. I fork through the pasta. Where\u2019s my bloody langoustine? I raise it with a waiter, who takes it up with the head chef in the open kitchen.

They\u2019re completely out of langoustine so, y\u2019know\u2026 They take the dish off the bill.</p> <p>The pasta is serviceable, but the tomato sauce has the brisk metallic whack of something that needs so much longer on the heat. Overall the dish tastes of rigorous and attentive accountancy. The same sauce turns up with veal meatballs that are hard and unyielding, first to the fork then the teeth.

  "<p>Everyone assumes that lead poisoning is no longer a real risk, and that the horror story of lead-laced water in Flint, Michigan, would mean that the only safe amount is no lead at all.</p> <p>Yet lead is still in use and that means we run the risk of exposure. In the UK we still subscribe to 40-year-old legislation that permits some concentrations of lead (products must contain less than 2,500 parts per 1,000,000).</p> <p>Fortunately, <a href=\"https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/andrew-turner\">Dr Andrew Turner</a>, reader in environmental science at Plymouth University, is on the case. I spent a day with him in Bristol as he fired an XRF spectrometer (a type of laser gun) at climbing frames and seesaws. What bounced back were readings showing toxic levels of lead, mainly from paint used to coat play-park equipment.</p> <p>Some of Turner\u2019s research has shown amounts 40 times greater than legal levels. Lead can remain in the body for 30 years and its toxicity affects bodily systems including the kidneys. It can also interfere with enzymes, and have irreversible effects on the central nervous system.</p> <p>Once lead is introduced into the environment, you can\u2019t get rid of it. Decades of research by <a href=\"http://www.bris.ac.uk/social-community-medicine/people/alan-m-emond/index.html\">Professor Alan Emond</a> and his team at the University of Bristol shows that lead at low levels can have an impact on child development. The team followed some children into adulthood and discovered that exposure to lead early in childhood can affect educational attainment, as well as levels of hyperactivity and antisocial behaviour.</p> <p>So it would be great to find out why, or how, local authorities are commissioning play equipment that is still using lead paint. Until then, there\u2019s no need to panic \u2013 but neither is there an excuse for toxic swings and roundabouts.</p> <h2>The big picture: Wildscreen\u2019s eco exhibition</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8042e96797da26b52a18b623529840c1052df0cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8042e96797da26b52a18b623529840c1052df0cd/0_266_3984_2390/1000.jpg\" alt=\"No monkey business: a memorable image from Wildscreen 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No monkey business: a memorable image from Wildscreen 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jasper Doest</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bristol is a hub for natural history photography and this prowess is showcased in Wildscreen 2016, a free exhibition running until 28 October, celebrating storytelling about the natural world.

  "<p>A new age is dawning. Whether it is a wonderful one or a terrible one remains to be seen. Look around and the signs of dizzying technological progress are difficult to miss. Driverless cars and drones, not long ago the stuff of science fiction, are now oddities that can occasionally be spotted in the wild and which will soon be a commonplace in cities around the world.<br></p> <p>With a few flicks of a finger, we can use our phones to order up a meal, or a car, or a translation for a waiter\u2019s query in a foreign country. Gadgets such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/26/amazon-echo-alexa-voice-recognition-superfans\">Amazon Echo</a> are finding their way into living rooms, where they sit listening, ready to comply with a voice command.</p> <p>Just a few years ago, one could dismiss the digital age as consisting of little more than social networks and cat videos; no longer. Yet at the same time, many of the world\u2019s fundamental political institutions look dangerously unsteady. Britain is preparing to crash out of the European Union. In America, Republicans have nominated for president a man with no regard for global norms and little enough for the American constitution. </p> <p>What is important, but far from obvious, is that these two trends \u2013 this careening toward a new digital age on the one hand and this descent into political darkness on the other \u2013 are closely related. </p> <p>History suggests that periods of great economic change are also times of political and social difficulty. We must recognise that the present is no exception. It is our failure to recognise and address the difficulties created by the digital revolution that has helped usher us to this troubling political moment. There could be more trouble ahead. The digital revolution is beginning to teach us what a tectonic economic transformation feels like. It is putting us in the shoes of our great-great-grandparents: those who first experienced the transmission of a human voice across an electrical wire, who watched as the time to travel from one city to a distant other shrank from weeks to hours and who found themselves displaced as smiths or farmhands by fantastic new technologies. We have all found our working lives altered by it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a44dbb44f65e2f1d386341e374751bbe2cb01500\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a44dbb44f65e2f1d386341e374751bbe2cb01500/0_336_2971_1782/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Today\u2019s technology is disrupting life, just as the machines of the Industrial Revolution destroyed the work patterns of our great-great grandparents.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Today\u2019s technology is disrupting life, just as the machines of the Industrial Revolution destroyed the work patterns of our great-great grandparents.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Topical Press Agency/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today\u2019s economic revolution produces concern and not simply about the uncertainty of employment in the years to come. Those of us who currently appear to have job security can more than likely look forward to making less in the future than we had once hoped we might. Over the last couple of decades, wages, adjusted for inflation, have scarcely grown throughout a broad range of rich countries, longer in some cases. And this wage stagnation has occurred alongside other distressing trends. The share of income flowing to workers, as opposed to business and property owners, has fallen. And, among workers, there has been a sharp rise in inequality, with the share of income going to those earning the highest incomes increasing in an astounding fashion.</p> <p>Then there is the sobering data on employment. In America, the share of adult men of prime working age who are working or actively looking for work has fallen steadily, in some cases dramatically, over the last generation. Among all men, the rate of participation in the workforce dropped from about <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/20160620_cea_primeage_male_lfp.pdf\">76% in 1990 to 69% in 2015. </a>That may not sound especially worrying, but it corresponds to a difference of about 9 million men.</p> <p>And those squeezed out of work often find their lives upended. Stuck in atrophying communities with few prospects, many struggle to find purpose and satisfaction in life; indeed, recent research has turned up an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/nov/02/death-rate-middle-aged-white-americans-aids\">alarming rise in mortality since the late 1990s among middle-aged white Americans</a>, mostly accounted for by an increase in suicides and in drug and alcohol abuse. The authors see economic insecurity as a contributing factor.</p> <p>This trend is not limited to America and neither can it be explained away as the product of ageing and retirement. In Europe, one in five adults under the age of 25 is unemployed. Across the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/oecd\">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a> (OECD), 12% of people aged between 15 and 29 are neither in school nor work. Some are engaged in illicit activity or are in jail; others are in their parents\u2019 basements playing video games. Much the same is true of the long-term unemployed, many of them older men without much education, who drift around, often drinking to pass the day, lacking much, if any, connection to society at large.</p> <p>For an awful lot of people, work has become a less certain and often less remunerative contributor to material security. But work is not just the means by which we obtain the resources needed to put food on the table. It is also a source of personal identity. It helps give structure to our days and our lives. It offers the possibility of personal fulfilment that comes from being of use to others and it is a critical part of the glue that holds society together and smooths its operation. Over the last generation, work has become ever less effective at performing these roles. That, in turn, has placed pressure on government services and budgets, contributing to a more poisonous and less generous politics. Meanwhile, the march of technological progress continues, adding to the strain.</p> <p><strong>Either society will develop ways to shore up work or find substitutes</strong><br></p> <p>The digital revolution alters work in three ways. The first is through automation. New technologies are replacing certain workers, from clerks to welders, and will replace more in the future, from drivers to paralegals.<br></p> <p>At the same time, the digital revolution has supercharged a second force: globalisation. It would have been nearly impossible for rich western firms to manage the sprawling global supply chains that have been wrapped around the world over the past 20 years without powerful information technology. And while China and other emerging markets might have become better integrated in the world economy even without companies such as Apple scattering production across the globe, such growth would have been much slower and less dramatic. Instead, global employment grew by over a billion jobs over the last generation, with most of the growth occurring in emerging economies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41cfe51e84d520e67fbd8df459e0a6c1ede19180\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41cfe51e84d520e67fbd8df459e0a6c1ede19180/0_243_3453_2073/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Globalisation of western companies has helped the growth of China and other emerging economies.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Globalisation of western companies has helped the growth of China and other emerging economies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STR/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Third, technology provides a massive boost to the productivity of some highly skilled workers, allowing them to do work that it might previously have taken many more people to accomplish. Technology enables small teams of money managers to run vast funds; it is increasingly allowing highly skilled instructors to build courses that can be taken and retaken by millions of students, potentially replacing hundreds or even thousands of lecturers. New technology is allowing fewer doctors and nurses to observe and treat many more patients, fewer lawyers to pore over vastly more trial-related evidence and fewer researchers to sift through massive amounts of data and test more hypotheses more quickly.</p> <p>These three trends \u2013 automation, globalisation and the rising productivity of a highly skilled few \u2013 are combining to generate an abundance of labour: a wealth of humans. In its struggle to digest this unprecedentedly enormous ocean of would-be workers, the global economy is misfiring in worrying ways. And the institution of work \u2013 apart from family, our most important piece of social infrastructure \u2013 can no longer be counted on to fulfil its many crucial roles, from the ordering of our days, to the allocation of purchasing power, to the strengthening of the social ties that are nurtured when individuals feel as though they are contributing positively to the community. Workers are unlikely to take these woes lying down. Something has to give. Either society will find ways to shore up work or develop substitutes for it or workers will use the political system to undermine the forces disrupting their world.</p> <p>This should be a good problem for mankind to have. An abundance of labour is arguably the point, to the extent that there is one, of technological progress. It is the beginning of the end of the need to work hard to stay alive. A system in which people actively seek out labour they would strongly prefer not to do \u2013 manning call centres to handle the complaints of unhappy customers or carrying packages around a boiling warehouse, for example \u2013 is not one society ought to aim to preserve any longer than technologically necessary.</p> <p>Yet the hardest part in finding utopia is not the figuring out of how to produce more. We\u2019ve managed that. The hard part is the redistribution. Crafting a balance of work and redistribution that is sustainable is incredibly difficult. The rich and privileged don\u2019t want to subsidise the poor. The poor may conclude that what redistribution the rich offer leaves an impossibly huge, even unfair gap in the incomes of the haves and have-nots. The poor may also not be content with an economy in which they are effectively unnecessary, kept at peace by a hand-out from the state. If redistribution is managed too clumsily, the incentive for clever or ambitious individuals to work to improve the economy might be lost, leading to stagnant growth and too little social surplus with which to provide all members of society with a rising standard of living.</p> <p>The battle lines of the great social upheaval are already being drawn. Their defining questions: who deserves credit for generating economic bounty and who has the right to claim a share of that bounty once it has been generated? Many of those earning top incomes, in individualist America in particular, believe they are the overtaxed \u201cmakers\u201d in society. But a makers-and-takers conception of the world is one that neglects the social foundation on which wealth is built. We aren\u2019t merely divided into makers and takers. We are participants in societies, operating according to a broad social consensus. When that consensus breaks down, the wealth goes away. Society either agrees a way to share its riches that most members find acceptable or the system fractures and the social wealth available to everyone shrinks.</p> <p>The social nature of wealth, always important, is increasingly critical. The long process of cultural development that eventually yielded the Industrial Revolution was in many ways the process by which humanity learned ever better ways of structuring society in order to foster the emergence of complex economic activity. The digital revolution is increasing the importance of social wealth in two key ways.</p> <p>First, new technologies increase our potential productivity and output as a society; because we are capable of becoming richer thanks to digital technology, the economic return to economically important social institutions, such as a government capable of enforcing private property rights, is rising. The gap between the incomes of societies capable of supporting these institutions and those that cannot is growing. In 1980, Americans were 30 times richer than residents of the Central African Republic. In 2015, they were 90 times richer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The better countries become at sharing social wealth, the greater the pressure to shrink the circle of social membership</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And second, the small-scale economic processes that generate new knowledge and turn it into profitable, welfare-enhancing activity are also becoming more social, and less individual, in nature. The value-generating pieces of successful companies were once satisfyingly tangible, consisting of buildings and machines, patents and people. That is ever less the case. Company cultures, which shape worker incentives and determine how a business reacts to changes in the marketplace, have become much more important in the digital age. Today, more than 80% of the value of Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 firms is \u201cdark matter\u201d: the intangible secret sauce of success; the physical stuff companies own and their wage bill account for less than 20%, a reversal of the pattern that prevailed in the 1970s.</p> <p>A large proportion of that dark matter is an amorphous \u201cknow-how\u201d: the culture, incentives and tacit knowledge that make a modern company tick. Successful companies, be they Goldman Sachs or BuzzFeed, evolve a way of gathering, processing and acting on information that is critical to their success and which cannot easily be replicated. The value generated by a firm\u2019s culture, just like the value generated by networks of people within cities, or by a country\u2019s economic institutions, is social rather than individual.</p> <p>As social wealth becomes more important, fights about who belongs within particular societies \u2013 and can therefore share in that social wealth \u2013 will intensify. To take full advantage of its promise, countries must become better at sharing social wealth. Yet the better countries become at sharing social wealth among members, the greater the pressure to shrink the circle of social membership.</p> <p><strong>Separatist and nationalist political parties are on the rise across Europe</strong><br></p> <p>Today\u2019s political disturbances reflect the opening exchanges in a long societal negotiation over just what the state and the economy ought to do, and for whom, in the digital era. If the industrial era is any guide, this negotiation will last for decades to come and will occasionally result in dramatic, and possibly even violent, changes to the structure of global politics. Political systems are stubbornly resistant to change. Political parties are massive social institutions that persist for decades or centuries by building and maintaining connections with collections of smaller interest groups and individuals. Those people and interest groups come to define their political identity through their association with the party. Identities are not rewritten on a whim. Yet long-term changes in economic fundamentals do eventually force change.<br></p> <p>In America, where the political structure strongly favours a two-party system, the rise of fundamentalist factions has led to partisan polarisation. Intense, intra-party battling could eventually lead to irreconcilable differences, prompting a major party shake-up (or break-up). Such shifts are extremely rare in American politics, however. It is more probable that ascendant ideological camps within the Republican party, such as those with nativist passions, will come to dominate the party leadership, displacing the former establishment bosses. And the former establishment will then mostly accommodate itself to the new order, an easier trick, for most partisans, than flipping to the other side of the aisle entirely.</p> <p>Separatist and nationalist parties are on the rise across Europe. Le Pen\u2019s Front National is ascendant. Radical parties in Hungary and Poland are pushing for significant political change: to undermine existing democratic institutions and to edge away from the EU. In Britain, nationalist political elements, within the Ukip and the Conservative party, astonished the world by calling and winning a popular vote to remove Britain from the EU. Brexit will encourage Scottish nationalists, who may ultimately demand to leave the United Kingdom.</p> <p>Radical factions and parties battling for supremacy each have at their heart a particular conception of the \u201cgood life\u201d. Writers and thinkers, like me, try to imagine post-work utopias, in which, for example, sensibly structured social safety nets could free people of the constraints of the typical job. These people could then offer their services by the hour or the job on newfangled market-making apps, among other things, or they could even abandon labour markets altogether, as new forms of social institution encouraged them to volunteer their time to the community or otherwise engage in pro-social behaviour \u2013 while also living alongside people from vastly different backgrounds and perhaps nationalities, if some of us get our way.</p> <p>But that is possibly not what the typical rich-world citizen would consider the \u201cgood life\u201d, however much we might want that to be the case. We should instead anticipate that voters in many countries, rich and poor alike, will want something more predictable than life governed by supply-and-demand matching apps; more structured than life on the perpetual dole; more comfortable and familiar than life surrounded by people who do things in different ways, speak different languages and worship different deities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae141403c84fba58dfee476c3c5884a80c114fc8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae141403c84fba58dfee476c3c5884a80c114fc8/0_221_4074_2445/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Violent opposition to migrants in countries across Europe, including Poland, are forcing political change.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Violent opposition to migrants in countries across Europe, including Poland, are forcing political change.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marcin Obara/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In any future in which technology frees workers of the need to spend most of their daytime hours on the job, many people will opt for much more down time, often spent in rather aimless fashion. Yet people of all backgrounds also seem to value narratives of personal ambition and responsibility. People wish to have control over their economic lives and to be seen as contributing both to society and to the wellbeing of their families. People desire agency. They do not wish to be forced into unpleasant work by the need to feed their families, but neither do they want to be written off \u2013 or assigned meaningless work as the price of a generous welfare cheque. It isn\u2019t clear that the digital economy can provide the working conditions needed to extend the possibility of bourgeois comfort and status to a broader class of people. That will not stop them desiring it.</p> <p>The conflict between what people want and what economic and political systems are able to provide will play out in the political arena. Political battles will increasingly feature narratives about how to restore us all to a world in which people work at purposeful jobs for good pay. Those narratives will be thick with bogeymen: the malevolent forces denying voters access to that \u201cgood life\u201d. Conniving foreign governments, job-stealing immigrants, greedy bankers and incompetent politicians all star in such roles. Demagoguery can be a compelling political force.</p> <p><strong>Generous welfare policy will struggle to emerge in ethnically diverse regions</strong><br></p> <p>Reformers can compete in this arena. There will be room for leaders willing to say that the \u201cgood life\u201d of misty memory cannot be brought back; who promise instead to push forward modest, incrementalist policies, such as more generous state benefits and increased investment in training and infrastructure.<br></p> <p>The difficulty the reformers will face is that the global economy will tend to punish such effort. Labour abundance and structural demand weakness are not the sorts of things national politicians working in isolation can fix. They can ameliorate the worst effects, but that will leave voters disappointed. Moderate reformers will find themselves losing ground to politicians keen to unpick elements of the era of moderation, from the move towards freer trade and capital flows to the elimination of labour-market protections.</p> <p>Could there be a constituency for a more radical set of policy innovations: for generous, universal basic incomes, for example? Political interest in these sorts of reforms is growing. Yet generous welfare policy might struggle to emerge outside of places where political units are more ethnically or nationally coherent: where an absence of tribal suspicion facilitates the sharing of social wealth. It is no wonder that experimental, generous welfare policy has tended to emerge in Nordic countries, where ethnic and communal ties are strong (but where openness to immigration has begun to tear at the social consensus).</p> <p>Indeed, the creation of such communally coherent groups in an effort to protect social safety nets often seems to be the point of the new nationalist politics. What separatist quasi-nations seem to want is a world in which they enjoy the economic benefits of global integration, but in which critical political and economic decisions are made by societies with a high degree of national or ethnic coherence: a future of Irelands and Estonias rather than of Britains and Spains: larger states with more diverse populations. The institutions of the EU or, indeed, the world economy as a whole are not built to handle waves of fracturing nations.</p> <p>Italian, Belgian and even German leaders are understandably reluctant to sign off on Catalan independence, given the damage regional separatism could do to their own states. Rich-world ethno-nationalism could destroy the economic integration on which its prosperity depends. Even if it doesn\u2019t fail before it begins, the model of highly redistributive, ethno-nationalist mini-states will depend for its success on the exclusion of outsiders, condemning much of the world\u2019s population to poverty.</p> <p>Some time in the future, a wonderful new politics might well emerge that provides a robust minimum standard of living to all regardless of race or nationality, which supports a multitude of different conceptions of the \u201cgood life\u201d and which does not rely on some underlying fear of some outside other to maintain its popularity. We are not yet able to conceive of such a system or to understand what balance of political forces needs to emerge to bring it into existence and sustain it. And so, for the time being, we are stuck in a world of nasty political trade-offs. We can but hope this era will prove a fleeting one. History suggests it will not be. But perhaps we will get lucky.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/284165/the-wealth-of-humans/\">The Wealth of Humans</a> <em>by </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ryanavent\"><em>Ryan Avent</em></a><em> is published by Allen Lane, \u00a325</em><br></p>",
  "<p>Seeking sustenance in a Brummie cafe to get me through the Tory conference, I heard myself request \u201ca full English Brexit\u201d. That\u2019s what it does to your head: several days of close confinement with Conservatives salivating over departure from the European Union.</p> <p>Back in the conference hall, the full English Brexit was being served up by Theresa May and all the mini-Mays in the cabinet as they sought to satisfy the audience\u2019s appetite for the starkest form of rupture with our partners of the past four decades. There are several possible ways of exiting the EU. They range from amicable separation to bitter divorce. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\" title=\"\">Tory gathering in Birmingham</a> set Britain on a course that leads to the most turbulent, disruptive and hazardous form of departure. It was the working assumption of all the cabinet ministers I spoke to, and this was so regardless of which side they took during the referendum, that it is now near inevitable that Britain will cease to be a member of the single market. Among those Tories who have always yearned for that outcome, I found them talking as if it was a given. Even more significantly, ministers who would once have recoiled in horror from that prospect now sound resigned to it.</p> <p>This is hugely significant and how we got to this point needs some explanation. In June, it was not a given that Britain would do Brexit the hard way. Out had won, but only narrowly. There was much room for interpretation of what that meant. There was quite a lot of talk from leading Outers about needing to respect the 48% who voted the other way. Once the forces of Remain had recovered from the shock of their defeat, they initially remustered around the cause of preserving British membership of the single market and with it the trade and investment on which so many livelihoods depend. They could cite the Tory party\u2019s election manifesto. This had clearly suggested that, even if Britain voted to leave the EU, a Conservative government would sustain membership of the single market. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/14/conservatives-election-manifesto-2015-the-key-points\" title=\"\">The manifesto promised</a>: \u201cWe are clear about what we want from Europe. We say: yes to the Single Market\u201d. That, Remainers declared, was the trench where they would dig in.</p> <p>That trench is still there, but I found very few people left defending it in Birmingham. The Tories are plunging towards hard Brexit and a riven Labour party is not in a fit condition to stop them. After an initial period of complacency, investors are waking up to the prospect that Britain could lurch out of the EU without reliable access to her most important markets. The more loudly her activists cheered Mrs May, the faster came the plunge in the pound. By the end of the week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/07/flash-crash-in-pound-spooks-investors-business-live\" title=\"\">sterling had dropped so vertiginously </a>that one pound didn\u2019t buy one euro at bureaux de change. As it has become clearer that Britain\u2019s government is tilting towards the Full Monty Brexit, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/08/eu-leaders-line-up-to-insist-uk-will-pay-a-high-price-for-brexit-stance\" title=\"\">European leaders have hardened their language</a> about the penalty that will entail.</p> <p>Why has this happened? A large part of the explanation is Mrs May and how she is choosing to resolve the paradox of being a prime minister tasked by the voters to deliver an outcome that she campaigned against. Many of the hardline Tory Brexiters were highly wary when she first moved into Number 10 because she had been a Remainer, albeit a near-invisible one, during the referendum campaign. Now the Brexiters speak of Mrs May in glowing terms. \u201cIt turns out that having a Remainer as prime minister has worked perfectly for us,\u201d one remarked to me. \u201cShe has to keep proving to us and the party that she is serious.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Remainers in the cabinet often sounded like they were the psychological captives of the Brexiters</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She threw them three big lumps of meat. One of those announcements was really spin disguised as meat. Her \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/theresa-may-great-repeal-bill-eu-british-law\" title=\"\">Great Repeal Act</a>\u201d will in reality transfer EU law into British law, to then be removed or amended at a later date. Her more substantial announcement was that she would trigger article 50, the formal notification to the EU that Britain wants a divorce, no later than March next year. This creates an unforgiving timetable for what will be a horrendously complex and fraught negotiation.</p> <p>Even some of the Brexiters in the cabinet are starting to sober up to the reality of it. To describe the inundation of papers on the subject that he is consuming, one minister adopted an Americanism and told me it was \u201clike drinking from a fire hydrant\u201d.</p> <p>That negotiation will not be made easier by the prime minister\u2019s third, and most significant, act. That was to set a firm face against trying to find any accommodation with EU countries over freedom of movement. \u201cWe are not leaving the European Union only to give up control of immigration again,\u201d she declared. One of her cabinet confirmed to me that they plan to approach the negotiations by telling the EU that freedom of movement is simply not on the table; they only want to talk about trade. If you believe that the Out vote was powered by opposition to migration, then the only form of Brexit that respects the referendum result is a mode of departure that ends freedom of movement. This position has a logic to it and some of the recanting Tory Remainers contend that this logic is too powerful for them to argue with it. Resistance, they say, is futile. It is impossible to reconcile rejecting freedom of movement and the jurisdiction of the European court of justice with continued membership of the single market. So Britain will be left to gamble on trying to get some sort of tariff deal with EU countries at a time when they are in no mood to do us any favours.</p> <p>Stockholm Syndrome describes how some hostages become traumatically bonded with their kidnappers. Remainers in the cabinet often sounded like they were the psychological captives of the Brexiters. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/amber-rudd\" title=\"\">Amber Rudd</a>, a liberal Tory who was a star of the Remain campaign, was one of the ministers who made a hostage-video sort of speech to the conference. The home secretary announced that companies would be forced to declare how many foreigners they employed, as if attracting skilled people from abroad was a mark of shame. In her setpiece at the end of the conference, Mrs May denounced \u201ccitizens of nowhere\u201d. That was a clever applause line with unclever implications for a country that thrives by attracting overseas talent and investment. It is this that will be noted by the rest of the world, not fatuous rhetoric about Britain \u201cgoing global\u201d. The conference resounded to the slam of doors being shut.</p> <p>There were a few voices of resistance. One was the effervescently gobby former minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/30/anna-soubry-brands-liam-foxs-free-trade-speech-delusional\" title=\"\">Anna Soubry.</a> Another was the former cabinet minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicky-morgan\" title=\"\">Nicky Morgan</a>. They stood out so much because those prepared to argue openly for a softer Brexit were so thin on the ground in Birmingham. Tory resistance to hard Brexit has been badly weakened by what has been happening in the Labour party since the referendum. In its immediate aftermath, Labour MPs declared that they would battle to preserve membership of the single market. Then they examined the vote in their party\u2019s traditional heartlands in Wales, the north of England and the Midlands and grew terrified by the strength of the Out vote there.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourconference\" title=\"\">Labour conference in Liverpool </a>was notable for the number of prominent MPs from its centrist wing declaring they could no longer defend unrestricted freedom of movement. Jeremy Corbyn has another position again. He is hostile to the single market but in favour of unlimited migration. The net result is that the Tory soft Brexiters do not think that they can rely on support from the main opposition party.</p> <p>Business and the City are becoming increasingly agitated that Brexit will not be the soft landing they hoped for. Representatives of manufacturers at the conference spoke of becoming more depressed by the day. But the mood of the times is not sympathetic to business arguments. It was striking to witness a Tory conference eagerly applaud a Tory prime minister lacerating corporate Britain. Some Tories say publicly, and more will say privately, they are willing to sacrifice some prosperity if that is the price of curbing immigration. This made it especially ironic that the Tories met in Birmingham, a melting-pot city whose prosperity was built on entrepreneurship and trade. Never has the Conservative party sounded less like a friend of business. Never has the Conservative party sounded more hostile to liberal free markets. Were the Labour party under a different form of management, the Tories might be more nervous of alienating business by taking the hard route to Brexit. But not in a century of Sundays are the CBI and the City going to ally themselves with Mr Corbyn.</p> <p>Free-market liberals still have some champions in government, notably at the Treasury, which thinks the economic impact of a hard Brexit will be severe and long lasting. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond\" title=\"\">Philip Hammond</a>, the chancellor, told the conference that the referendum result was not a vote to make Britain poorer. That he would not have said unless he feared his colleagues are pushing in a direction that will leave Britain very much the poorer. The chancellor sounded like a man losing the battle. Lost it will be unless he finds some more friends and quick.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6272f2a04d1d124356e1c94b601560ecf78185ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6272f2a04d1d124356e1c94b601560ecf78185ce/0_38_2077_1244/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary, was one of few Tories prepared to call for a softer Brexit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary, was one of few Tories prepared to call for a softer Brexit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Back/Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

Unesco has listed almost 5m hectares of marine and terrestrial environment in Shark Bay as a world heritage area.</p> <p>But, until last year, Hamelin pool was nestled up against a grazing station, inhabited by thousands of sheep and goats. The world heritage area only extended to a little beyond the high-tide mark.
