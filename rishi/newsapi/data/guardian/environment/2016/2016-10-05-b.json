  "<p>There\u2019s an old adage in politics: never waste a crisis. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/28/south-australia-braces-for-storm-that-could-be-most-severe-in-50-years\">severe storms caused a power blackout</a> across South Australia last week, the Turnbull government bent mother nature to its will.</p> <p>But there\u2019s another adage that Malcolm Turnbull and his energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, should remember: don\u2019t win the battle only to lose the war. </p> <p>Last week Frydenberg showed what a shrewd politician he is. He won lots of battles. First, after the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, blamed renewable energy for causing the blackout, Frydenberg appeared sensible as he assured Australians that he knew it really was the 80,000 lightning strikes and 140km/h winds that caused the power to go out. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/05/wicked-windfarms-and-how-to-separate-the-facts-of-the-blackout-from-the-storm-of-spin\">'Wicked' windfarms and how to separate the facts of the blackout from the storm of spin | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Frydenberg then <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2016/s4547631.htm\">massaged</a> Joyce\u2019s unfounded renewable energy alarmism into an acceptable message about the challenges renewable energy might pose. </p> <p>\u201cThere are real challenges and the priority for us as a Coalition government is energy security. You see, it\u2019s OK to have more renewables, to reduce emissions, to meet our international targets but if people\u2019s homes go dark, if businesses get shut down, if there\u2019s huge economic loss and there\u2019s a threat to safety.\u201d</p> <p>And who poses this \u201cthreat to safety\u201d and the economy, according to Frydenberg? <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/climate/bill-shortens-crazy-ret-plan-to-cost-50bn-josh-frydenberg/news-story/fee56396b8ce4b5b1846fd0449d9b252\">State governments</a> that have set higher renewable energy targets than the federal government. Specifically, Labor state governments. And, for good measure, Frydenberg also fingered the federal Labor opposition\u2019s 50% renewable energy target by 2030 for blame.</p> <p>Then Frydenberg distracted everyone\u2019s attention by creating a \u201cproblem\u201d to be solved. All the energy minister had to do shift the nation\u2019s focus is suggest that renewable energy targets across the nation should be \u201c<a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-29/renewable-targets-'bring-challenges'-to-stability/7887280\">harmonised</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Frydenberg didn\u2019t have to explain why a different target in different jurisdictions is a problem. He didn\u2019t have to explain why he\u2019s never raised that issue in a serious manner before. (Case in point \u2013 the Coag energy council last met on 19 August 2016. That meeting\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.scer.gov.au/sites/prod.energycouncil/files/publications/documents/Energy%20Council%20Communique%20-%2019%20August%202016%20-%20FINAL.pdf\">communique</a> made no mention of the need for a nationally harmonised renewable energy target.) </p> <p>The minister deployed a trick as old as the Australian federation. Never forget, consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds. When a federal government has nothing else to say, it reaches for national harmonisation: it sounds so insightful and sensible and self-evident. It\u2019s not. </p> <p>There are lots of good reasons to avoid harmonisation for its own sake. It stifles innovation. It disregards local solutions for local conditions. It reduces capacity to respond to changing circumstances. It creates red tape. It often adds cost.</p> <p>Nonetheless federal governments usually win with propaganda on harmonisation (until it falls apart: think the VET Fee-Help scheme). On renewable target harmonisation, Frydenberg is winning so far. </p> <p>But \u2013 pardon the awful pun \u2013 storm clouds are gathering on the government\u2019s horizon. </p> <p>Frydenberg has made himself and the Turnbull government responsible for delivering solutions they will struggle to achieve.</p> <p>Start with Frydenberg\u2019s decision to convene a meeting of the Coag energy council this Friday to force the states and territories to discuss harmonising renewable energy targets and achieving energy security. </p> <p>Does anyone seriously think that state Labor governments are going to adopt the Turnbull government\u2019s lower renewable energy target of 23% by 2020? No chance.</p> <p>Even if Frydenberg redefines his harmonisation goal to getting the state and territories to slow down or stretch out their targets, he\u2019s still got a problem. </p> <p>The premiers and chief ministers won\u2019t agree to a compromise without the prime minister giving something away too, like increasing the federal government\u2019s target. Little chance Joyce and the anti-renewables brigade in the Coalition will applaud that. </p> <p>Second, \u201cenergy security\u201d appears to be Frydenberg\u2019s shorthand way of saying that Australia needs to ensure that its infrastructure \u2013 poles and wires and baseload supply in our national energy market \u2013 is sufficient to withstand major weather events. Sounds benign, doesn\u2019t it?</p> <p>For example, a second interconnector in South Australia might have kept the lights on in part of the state during last week\u2019s once-in-50-year storm. But at what cost? And who is going to pay for it? </p> <p>Remember that much of that infrastructure in SA and around the country now sits in private ownership \u2013 thank you, Liberal state governments.</p> <p>Either the Turnbull government stumps up the cash for these private sector companies (yeah, right) or it faces the wrath of voters when their electricity bills jump ever higher to pay for the upgrades the federal government requires. </p> <p>So much for Tony Abbott\u2019s efforts to save households all that money on their electricity bills by removing the carbon tax.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/29/south-australia-blackout-explained-renewables-not-to-blame\">South Australia's blackout explained (and no, renewables aren't to blame)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Third, it beggars belief that Frydenberg and Turnbull think the government\u2019s continued drop in the polls can be arrested by allowing Malcolm to look tough on renewable energy targets. </p> <p>Only six years ago, Turnbull was <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/environment/energy-smart/how-to-be-fully-renewable-in-10-years-20100812-121l0.html\">predicting</a> Australia could be 100% reliable on renewable energy within a decade. A little over six days ago, he \u201csaved\u201d<br>the Australian Renewable Energy Agency from his own government\u2019s cuts. But now Turnbull says renewable energy is a threat to our economy and safety?</p> <p>Turnbull\u2019s continued drop in the polls suggests voters are frustrated that the \u201creal Malcolm\u201d \u2013 who supported same-sex marriage, a republic and an emissions trading scheme \u2013 is not the prime minister. It\u2019s hard to see how giving voters another example of Turnbull\u2019s inauthenticity is going to help his \u2013 or his government\u2019s \u2013 standing. </p> <p>Nonetheless, the renewable energy battle is under way, and Josh Frydenberg is leading the charge. Add it to the list of battles the Turnbull government is fighting: business tax cuts, school funding, the ABCC legislation, the same-sex marriage plebiscite, media law reform, a childcare package, university deregulation, NDIS funding, Stuart Robert, the looming Myefo and the NBN, to name a few.</p> <p>In hindsight, maybe Turnbull and Frydenberg should have just let mother nature take the blame for what happened in South Australia, and moved on. This might have been one crisis worth wasting.</p>",

Titles such of \u201cToo Slow for Too Long\u201d, from April this year, are about as cheery as it gets.

Instead the IMF finds that the world economy is \u201cmoving sideways\u201d.</p> <p>Woohoo!</p> <p>This has meant for the first time in a long while there was no significant downgrade in the projection for world GDP growth.</p> <p>The 3.1% growth that was predicted in July remains in place. That\u2019s good news (of sorts) but a long way below the IMF\u2019s highest estimate back in September 2011 of 4.9%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"IMF projections for GDP growth in 2016\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/M5cH1/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But while the world GDP growth prediction remains steady, the outlook for advanced economies has been revised down yet again \u2013 from the 1.8% in July to just 1.6%, and massively down on the 2.2% predicted a year ago.</p> <p>The two big reasons for the slow-down in the advanced economies is a weaker than expected growth in the USA and the fallout from the Brexit vote. </p> <p>This time last year, the IMF was expecting the UK economy to be growing by 2.2%. The uncertainty of the Brexit vote saw them downgrade that to 1.9% in April and 1.7% in July. The good news is the IMF now expects the UK to grow by 1.8%. </p> <p>But when asked if this showed that the IMF had overestimated the impact of the Brexit vote, Maurice Obstfeld, the director of the IMF research department argued the sharp devaluing of the UK pound had helped keep the UK\u2019s economy growing better than would be expected (as it made its exports) but that the long term issues remained.</p> <p>For Australia, the situation is better in the short-term as well. The IMF has upgraded our forecast growth for this year from 2.5% to 2.9%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"IMF projections for GDP growth in 2016\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/yCs5o/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Alas the upgrades for Australia and the UK don\u2019t continue into next year. </p> <p>The IMF downgraded the growth projection for Australia in 2017 from 2.5% to 2.2%, while the projection for UK growth has been halved in the past 12 months.

It says that the slow recovery after the GFC has been \u201cespecially damaging in those countries where the distribution of income has continued to skew sharply toward the highest earners\u201d. In short, the IMF argues, \u201cgrowth has been too low for too long, and in many countries its benefits have reached too few.\u201d</p> <p>They suggest the impact of inequality has been a driver of a \u201cpolitical movement that blames globalisation for all woes and seeks somehow to wall off the economy from global trends rather than engage cooperatively with foreign nations.\u201d</p> <p>The IMF argues that because international trade is a key driver of economic growth, the movement to increase trade barriers will \u201clikely to depress global growth further.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/apr/14/the-imf-could-have-called-their-latest-report-the-new-normal-yep-it-still-sucks\">The IMF could have called their latest report 'The New Normal: Yep, it Still Sucks' | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead it argues that nations need to work together.

  "<p>To be in the bowels of West Ham\u2019s London Stadium last week was to experience the distilled essence of the modern, multi-billion pound Premier League behemoth.</p> <p>Outside, all the talk was of the corruption allegations that had led to a fresh wave of hand-wringing over the greed and grotesque sums in the game.</p> <p>In the stands of the former Olympic Stadium the echoes of the issues caused by the club\u2019s move from Green Street to Westfield still reverberated. But on the pitch a frenzy of activity is testament to one of the more welcome spin-offs of the billions that have poured into the Premier League from the pockets of fans paying for television subscriptions, replica shirts and tickets.</p> <p>Beneath cloudless skies representatives from some of the disability schemes funded centrally by a new Premier League initiative were practising a range of sports, Michael Owen and Owen Hargreaves were larking about as they prepared to play football blindfold and some of the more inspirational characters inside those clubs were talking about what they do week in, week out.</p> <p>You may believe the amount Premier League clubs put into their community schemes merely represents the crumbs from the captain\u2019s table. Or perhaps you buy the Premier League\u2019s portrayal of a virtuous circle in which the cash poured into \u201cgood causes\u201d increases as their TV rights bounty goes up and everybody wins. What is undeniable is that Paul Kelly, the Manchester City disability officer who began volunteering for the club when he lost his job as a bricklayer and now oversees a programme that reaches more than 1,000 disabled people per month, and many others are doing inspirational work.</p> <p>From a programme that now reaches 44 special schools in central and greater Manchester to representative sides that are part of an attempt to grow disabled leagues in the area, Kelly is a persuasive advocate for the power of Premier League clubs to reconnect with the communities they sit in.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing and there are still many ways and means it can grow. I\u2019ve got so many ideas and sometimes I get pulled back on my lead. You can see what Man City has done for the programme and the staff and the participants,\u201d said Kelly, who had gone from taking sessions for six kids on tatty, ripped astroturf eight years ago to having use of City\u2019s money-no-object Etihad Campus.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s only going to build and get better. We\u2019re still building and still developing. We want to grow and do something special with our disability team, just as we do with our ladies team and the first team and everything else we do.\u201d</p> <p>The event at the London Stadium was designed to unveil a new partnership between BT Sport and the Premier League that will ensure that every club has a dedicated disability officer. Many, such as Manchester City, have one already but Kelly said the funding would allow him to do more and with greater certainty.</p> <p>When the Premier League unveiled its \u00a38.3bn TV deal it was forced on to the back foot by criticism of how much of that cash would find its way to grassroots football, to community programmes and to the rest of the game.</p> <p>Stung by the criticism, it pledged at least \u00a31bn would make its way outside the Premier League, though the vast majority of that will go into funding parachute and \u201csolidarity\u201d payments to Football League clubs.</p> <p>Richard Scudamore, watching on, is also right to say the Premier League clubs often do not get the credit for the community work they do undertake. Every club has several Paul Kellys, going above and beyond to use the power of football and the unique geographical position of clubs in the heart of their cities to the benefit of their local communities. The question will always be whether they could do more and whether those that do less can be persuaded of the benefits. \u201cThere are only two ways of doing more. You either do more of the same or you try and expand the brief and expand the platform,\u201d said Scudamore.</p> <p>\u201cYou know how proud the clubs have been of their Kicks programme, which is our social inclusion programme, of their health programme, of Premier League 4 Sport programmes. If you go back over the last 15 years there is a huge layering-up of capacity within clubs to do this kind of work.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, even as they were launching the new scheme, the minister for disabled people was pointing out that only seven clubs had fully accessible toilet facilities at their grounds. \u201cIt is a simple thing, relatively inexpensive to rectify and a barrier that for some of your fans is insurmountable to overcome to watch their team play a home game,\u201d said Penny Mordaunt.</p> <p>Clubs have also come under fire for failing to provide sufficient accessible facilities, promising after significant pressure to meet official guidelines by the start of next season. \u201cOur clubs are trying to reach that higher standard, they\u2019re making huge progress and there\u2019s an enormous amount of work going on. Our aim is to get as close to, if not over, those guidelines by next August. It\u2019s absolutely the right thing to do,\u201d said Scudamore.</p> <p>Martin Sinclair, the older brother of Celtic\u2019s Scott, played for Team GB\u2019s cerebral palsy side in the 2012 Paralympics and is now working with Southampton\u2019s Foundation to establish a local pan-disability league.

  "<p>Barack Obama has said the Paris climate deal could prove a \u201cturning point\u201d in the effort to avoid dangerous global warming, after a flurry of commitments by nations pushed the agreement into force.<br></p> <p>The climate accord is set to be activated on 4 November after the European Union, Canada, Nepal and India all formally ratified the deal. The latest ratifications mean that 73 nations accounting for nearly 57% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions are <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9444.php\">fully committed to the process</a>, meaning the two key thresholds to the agreement have now been met.</p> <p>Obama said: \u201cToday is a historic day in the fight to protect our planet for future generations. This gives us the best possible shot to save the one planet we got. With optimism and faith and hope, we are proving it is possible.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/03/canada-carbon-emissions-tax-paris-climate-agreement\">Canada will tax carbon emissions to meet Paris climate agreement targets</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The US president said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris\">Paris agreement</a> will prove a \u201cturning point\u201d in the fight against climate change, should nations fully commit to cutting emissions. The US and China, the world\u2019s two largest emitters, both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/03/breakthrough-us-china-agree-ratify-paris-climate-change-deal\">ratified the agreement in September</a>. </p> <p>Obama said the deal, which commits countries to ensuring that the average global temperature doesn\u2019t rise 2C above pre-industrial levels, will \u201copen the floodgates for low-carbon innovation at a scale we haven\u2019t seen before\u201d. But he warned that emissions will need to be scaled back even further, along with mooted cutbacks in aviation and HFC pollution, if runaway climate change is to be avoided.</p> <p>\u201cNo nation, not even one as powerful as ours, can solve this on its own \u2013 we have to do this together,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if we meet every target, we will only get to part of where we need to go. But this will help delay or avoid the worst consequences of climate change. It\u2019ll help set bolder targets.\u201d</p> <p>The Paris agreement, struck last year, calls for all 195 signatories to come up with their own voluntary plans to reduce emissions. While the landmark deal is the first commitment by all countries to reduce emissions, the individual pledges are unlikely to be sufficient to stay within the 2C limit, which could be breached as early as 2050, <a href=\"http://phys.org/news/2016-09-global-2c-threshold.html\">according to recent research</a>.</p> <p>Separate studies have shown the world is on course for a temperature rise of <a href=\"https://www.climateinteractive.org/programs/scoreboard/\">around 3.5C</a> by the end of the century, based on the emissions cuts promised in Paris. This would cause a range of disastrous environmental consequences, including heatwaves, sea level rise, species extinctions and spread of disease.</p> <p>There are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/26/us-climate-change-emissions-miss-2025-target-research\">doubts that the US is on track even</a> to meet its initial promise to cut emissions by 26% to 28% by 2025 by 2005 levels. In a further complication, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has promised to withdraw the US from the deal should he win power. However, the ratification locks countries into the deal for four years, so an immediate US exit wouldn\u2019t be possible. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/02/india-paris-climate-change-agreement-un-narendra-modi\">India to ratify Paris climate change agreement at UN</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But green groups have celebrated the activation of the Paris deal, pointing to the lightening pace of ratification after decades of international wrangling over climate change.

  "<p>Not for the first time when it comes to global football\u2019s discredited overlords, the closing lines of Won\u2019t Get Fooled Again by The Who come to mind. \u201cMeet the new boss, same as the old boss\u201d. Ever since the former Uefa general secretary Gianni Infantino almost accidentally ascended to the Fifa president\u2019s office following the fall from grace of Michel Platini the question has been whether the Swiss-Italian who hails from the next village along from Sepp Blatter\u2019s birthplace represents a break from the past or a continuation of it.</p> <p>Allegations that swirled about his predilection for private jets and apparent desire to use his new powers to water down the independence of Fifa\u2019s oversight committees were dismissed by staff as rumours propagated by those who resisted the winds of change blowing through the world body\u2019s HQ.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/03/world-cup-expand-48-teams-fifa-gianni-infantino-suggests\">World Cup could expand to 48 teams, Fifa\u2019s Gianni Infantino suggests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even Infantino\u2019s enthusiasm for his Fifa Legends side, with whom he was endlessly photographed playing alongside and flew to Mexico City at great expense for his inaugural Congress in May, has been put down by supporters to his desire leave the politics behind and focus on football.</p> <p>Yet there was something about his throwaway line positing a 48-team World Cup that was pure Blatter. Apparently off-the-cuff yet clearly designed to start a hare running? Check. Capable of winning votes among those confederations disgruntled with their allocation of World Cup places (that is, anywhere but Europe)? Check. Completely ill-thought through and bearing only passing acquaintance with common sense? Check.</p> <p>Infantino\u2019s proposal for a 40-team World Cup, made to persuade floating voters during the presidential campaign at a time when all the candidates should have been focused only on the mess left behind by the corruption that had eaten world football from the inside out, was bad enough. It made little arithmetical sense and was almost impossible to implement without destroying the competitive balance of a competition that showed in Brazil that on the field at least it was still capable of delivering the goods.</p> <p>But it is so very Fifa, and so very in keeping with the gigantism that infects modern football (see also Euro 2016, Fifa\u2019s endless spin-off tournaments, Uefa\u2019s Champions League mission creep) that, instead of ditching the idea and sticking with 32, Infantino has instead proposed expanding to 48 teams.</p> <p>Not only that but in proposing 32 teams play off to enter the group stages he gives rise to the ludicrous prospect of 16 sides flying in from around the globe to play a solitary match before heading home again. Each of those sides would have to budget and plan for a potential stay of several weeks, bringing all their players to the host country for a pre-tournament training camp with all the attendant hype, before turning around and heading home after one game.</p> <p>The new president may counter that Fifa would pick up the tab but, as with the millions wasted on pointless committees, congresses and publications, this is all cash that could otherwise be diverted into growing the game.</p> <p>The proposal would be funny if Infantino were not so serious. Rather than boosting interest and TV broadcasting income, as he no doubt envisages, it just may go some way to adding to the growing sense of disillusionment with the international game. \u201cIt means we continue with a normal World Cup for 32 teams but 48 teams go to the party. Fifa\u2019s idea is to develop football in the whole world, and the World Cup is the biggest event there is. It\u2019s more than a competition, it\u2019s a social event,\u201d Infantino said.</p> <p>The idea of the World Cup as a party for fans did not seem to be so high in his mind when he was insisting recently that the next two World Cups in Russia and Qatar would be triumphs.</p> <p>The expansion idea is so simple minded, and so transparent in its aims, that it barely merits discussion. Yet it is becoming increasingly clear that what the president wants he usually gets, despite the reforms that are on paper designed to dilute his influence, and the proposal is sure to receive serious consideration around the table of the Fifa Council next week.</p> <p>The former executive committee may have been rebranded and expanded as part of Infantino\u2019s reform process, but it remains to be seen how much else has changed.

They\u2019re trying to make content which is personal and all about trying to get young people to understand the world in which they exist.\u201d</p> <p> Heald said the channel would not be a feed of the Vice cable channel but would \u201ccherrypick\u201d the best of its culture, music, travel, food, sport and news content for Australian audiences. There was even scope for Vice to produce local Australian content with SBS in the future.</p> <p> SBS2, which started in 2009, is largely an acquisitions channel that commissioned only 10 hours of local content last year on top of its in-house program The Feed. As a secondary channel, SBS2 doesn\u2019t have the budget to commission significant amounts of local content.</p> <p> Heald said SBS as a whole was still strongly multicultural, pointing to the SBS on demand platform, which has 900 movies \u2013 90% of which are in languages other than English.</p> <p> \u201cEven the content which Viceland is producing in the US is incredibly diverse,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that because they are in the US they are producing Anglo-Celtic content is just factually incorrect.</p> <p> \u201cI am a passionate defender of SBS and the fact is we are producing more multicultural and more multilingual content than ever before. I am extremely proud of the shows we\u2019ve been commissioning on the main channel whether it\u2019s fiction shows like The Principal and Family Law and factual series like DNA Nation.</p> <p> \u201cThe terms of the arrangement we have is as Viceland expands around the world \u2013 moving into 44 territories \u2013 our output arrangement will include content from around the globe including content in languages other than English. So from France, Germany, the Middle East.</p> <p> The chairman of the Federation of Ethnic Communities\u2019 Councils of Australia (FECCA), Joseph Caputo, said he thought it was a good move on the part of SBS because Vice provided \u201ccutting-edge programs from around the world and some of the best of youth culture\u201d, which would expand the youth audience of SBS.</p> <p> \u201cI would hope that it fits within the charter of SBS and that SBS continues to provide rich multicultural, multilingual and diverse programs \u2013 in this case for youth,\u201d he said.</p> <p> \u201cI believe that this is the right move and will be good for Australian youth and multiculturalism generally.\u201d</p> <p> The host of The Feed, Marc Fennell, wrote <a href=\"http://www.marcfennell.com/marcs-blog/2016/10/5/a-little-note-about-sbs-viceland\">a passionate post on his personal blog</a> defending the partnership with Vice from accusations it was part of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s empire because 21st Century Fox bought a 5% share in Vice Media.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/04/viceland-uk-ratings-sky-tv\">Viceland UK scores zero ratings on some nights after Sky TV launch</a> </p> </aside>  <p> \u201cNo precious publicly owned spectrum is being auctioned off to Uncle Rupert,\u201d Fennell said. \u201cWe are creating something new out of two broadcasters that have an incredible amount in common.\u201d</p> <p> However, Fennell did concede the arrangement seemed at first to be an \u201codd fit\u201d. \u201cExcept when you see the content you will realise that the whole goal of Viceland is to explore a multicultural world through the prisms of music, sex, the environment, film, food and more.</p> <p> \u201cIt\u2019s globally focused, it\u2019s diverse, it\u2019s fun and defiantly open-minded journalism and entertainment.</p> <p> \u201cFrankly, this move will bring SBS2 far more in line with our charter than some of our existing content.

Our panel\u2019s verdict | Jonathan Freedland, Polly Toynbee, Anne McElvoy, Joseph Harker, Giles Fraser</a> </p> </aside>  <p>May gave that reassurance on Wednesday. She is unscrutinised by the public and is the most opaque of politicians. She duly had to plead with her party to come with her on the \u201cquiet revolution\u201d, entrusted to her government by the voters, to fashion a new \u201cglobal Britain\u201d. She was unequivocal. They should \u201cstop quibbling\u201d and withdraw Britain from the European Union. It should become again a \u201cfully sovereign and independent country\u201d, outward-looking and embracing free trade. As for filling in the details, that was for the \u201cgive and take\u201d and wait and see. It was hardly satisfactory, but it served its purpose.</p> <p>May\u2019s other ambition was harder to articulate. It was to carve out a Mayism <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-draws-line-under-cameron-era-with-return-to-small-c-conservatism\" title=\"\">distinct from a Cameronism</a>, to put her own stamp on a government for which the electorate did not vote. Her desire for that most tedious of cliches, change, in \u201ca country that works for everyone\u201d, was beyond banality. It is one of those political phrases that reads the same in any word order. In comparison, Tony Blair\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/feb/10/labour.uk1\" title=\"\">\u201cthird way\u201d</a> and David Cameron\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10680062\" title=\"\">\u201cbig society\u201d</a> seem like white papers. May\u2019s constant reference to \u201ceveryone \u2026 ordinary people \u2026 working people\u2026 working-class people\u201d bordered on a speechwriter\u2019s tic.</p> <p>We know May wants to be cut from a different cloth from Cameron. We are told of her supposed puritanism. She is Thames Valley lowland, not Cotswolds upland.

May\u2019s ruthless culling of the Cameroons was clearly an emotional release, but it suggests a lack of tolerant collectivism. One chumocracy has gone, but only to make way for new chums.</p> <p>May claims to oppose privilege, and believes in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/11/theresa-may-tory-leadership-pitch-andrea-leadsom\" title=\"\">fairness, justice, hard work</a> and love of country. Who would not? There was certainly a mischievous, leftwing tinge to her remarks. She ridiculed Labour as the new \u201cnasty party\u201d and must be the first Tory in decades to demand we should \u201cremember the good that government can do\u201d. She is certainly the first to speak in favour of taxation, if only to threaten tax dodgers, multinationals and \u201ccitizens of the world and of nowhere\u201d \u2013 a felicitous phrase. May attacked the \u201cliberal elite\u201d, people who \u201cpatronised the electorate\u201d over immigration and Brexit. We might forget that she too voted for remain. She clearly has \u201cremorse issues\u201d.</p> <p>Of all vacuities, Tory centrism is the most empty. May ruined her pitch by then advocating the brutal divisiveness of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/07/thatcher-grammars-poison-theresa-may-tories\" title=\"\">selective schools at 11</a>. Her belief that this \u201cgives every child access to a good school place\u201d is bereft of intellectual coherence. She must also have approved home secretary Amber Rudd\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/amber-rudd-defends-proposal-to-make-firms-reveal-foreign-staff-numbers\" title=\"\">\u201cnaming and shaming\u201d</a> of foreigners in employment.

She seems likely to do the same on Heathrow. These hard choices mock her professed eagerness to boost under-privileged regions, the powerless and the poor. They suggest the Downing Street apparatchiks cannot tell good infrastructure from bad, or disentangle private gain from public interest. If this is the template for Brexit, it augurs chaos.</p> <p>May is gambling. She feels she is on a roll. She shows no sign of humility towards her lack of a personal mandate. She is cruelly dismissive of the legacy of the man, David Cameron, who holds that mandate, and who put her where she is. She may regard the June referendum as trumping the 2015 election, but she too \u201clost\u201d that referendum. And however it is spun, the referendum was on Brexit, not a government as a whole.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/05/birmingham-witnessing-tory-reformation-conservative-conference-brexit\">We are witnessing nothing less than a Tory reformation  | Rafael Behr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>May won a rousing conference reception.

Hovering in the wings are those who, in Thatcher\u2019s day, were the \u201cwets\u201d, the dispossessed ancients, the unrepentant remainers. May knows she has a small majority in parliament. She is defying constitutional propriety by trying to give MPs as little say in the Brexit process as possible. She must hope this show of constituency enthusiasm will scare remain MPs into obedience.</p> <p>That may not work. The Cameroons and the remainers may be crushed and silent, but when the going gets tough, they may become what John Major called \u201cthe bastards\u201d. May could yet find herself having more trouble with her own backbenchers than those opposite. She and Jeremy Corbyn may find they have something in common.</p> <p>Brexit never merited the overarching importance it has acquired. The actual risk to trade in tariff-sensitive goods with Europe is minimal to the British economy \u2013 however much noise the manufacturers like to make.

Even if we spend a decade getting over it \u2013 and perhaps then half-reverse it \u2013 withdrawal there must be.</p> <p>May was wise to leave no one in any doubt of this.

Jihadi groups have grown, often filling voids left by less well-armed and well-resourced moderates. Civilians are trapped in the middle. In Aleppo, 300,000 people are exposed to a relentless barrage of airstrikes. The Syrian government and Russia now seem intent on crushing Aleppo, the opposition\u2019s last stronghold, before a new American president takes office. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/03/us-russia-syria-bombing-campaign-aleppo\" title=\"\">Diplomacy has entirely collapsed</a>, with acrimonious exchanges in the UN replacing attempts at a ceasefire.</p> <p>This is the backdrop against which the White Helmets operate \u2013 a western-funded Syrian search-and-rescue organisation whose members put their lives at great risk to save civilians, receiving only a monthly stipend of $150.

They entertain no illusions that genuine measures will be taken swiftly to end massacres on a scale unprecedented in decades. The White Helmets do what they can, locally. It\u2019s the very least the west can do to back them.

They are a constant reminder that those targeted by Russia and the Assad regime\u2019s massive bombing campaign in Aleppo are civilians, not terrorists. And they show that individual acts of courage can go a long way to fight indifference. They also embody a spirit of civic resistance \u2013 upholding some of the ideals of the peaceful, popular uprising of 2011 and exemplifying courage and solidarity in the face of state-sponsored terror. The international community has utterly failed Syrians, by failing to protect them from mass atrocities. No Nobel peace prize can erase that.

There\u2019s evidence that the Pueblo people of what is now the south-west US were forced to abandon settlements in the 13th century due to a lengthy drought.

  "<p>Theresa May\u2019s government is facing a growing backlash over a proposal to force companies to disclose how many foreign workers they employ, with business leaders describing it as divisive and damaging.</p> <p>The proposal was revealed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/amber-rudd\">Amber Rudd</a>, the home secretary, at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\">Conservative party conference</a> on Tuesday as a key plank of a government drive to reduce net migration and encourage businesses to hire British staff.</p> <p>However, senior figures in the business world warned the plan would be a \u201ccomplete anathema\u201d to responsible employers and would damage the UK economy because foreign workers were hired to fill gaps in skills that British staff could not provide. One chief executive of a FTSE 100 company, whose workforce includes thousands of EU citizens, said it was \u201cbizarre\u201d.</p> <p>The proposals, which are subject to consultation, have also been questioned from within the Conservative party. Lord Finkelstein, the Tory peer, told the BBC it was a \u201cmisstep\u201d, while Tory MP Neil Carmichael, chairman of the House of Commons education select committee, said the policy was \u201cunsettling\u201d and would \u201cdrive people, business and compassion out of British society and should not be pursued any further\u201d.</p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, said: \u201cConservative party leaders have sunk to a new low this week as they fan the flames of xenophobia and hatred in our communities and try to blame foreigners for their own failures.</p> <p>\u201cDrawing up lists of foreign workers won\u2019t stop unscrupulous employers undercutting wages in Britain. Shutting the door to international students won\u2019t pay young people\u2019s tuition fee debts, and ditching doctors from abroad won\u2019t cut NHS waiting lists.\u201d </p> <p>Rudd was forced to defend the proposals on Wednesday, insisting they were not xenophobic and that she had been careful about the language used. The home secretary told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that some companies were \u201cgetting away\u201d with not training British workers and \u201cwe should be able to have a conversation about what skills we want to have in the UK\u201d.</p> <p>Rudd said that forcing companies to reveal their foreign workforce was \u201cnot something we are definitely going to do\u201d and was part of a wider review of immigration and employment practices. But a Home Office source said Rudd was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/amber-rudd-defends-proposal-to-make-firms-reveal-foreign-staff-numbers\">not backing away from the proposal</a> and it would be put out for consultation despite the backlash from businesses.</p> <p>Adam Marshall, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said that having a global workforce should not be seen as a \u201cbadge of shame\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cMost companies do their utmost to train their workers, engage with local schools and colleges, and look for local hires before going to the overseas market \u2013 which is often an expensive and bureaucratic step.</p> <p>\u201cBusinesses shouldn\u2019t be penalised or questioned for recruiting from overseas when they have specific skills needs. Many would be very concerned if their specific circumstances were boiled down to percentages, or used to suggest that they\u2019re somehow not doing their bit here at home.\u201d<br></p> <p>Manufacturers warned that foreign workers should not be regarded as a \u201csimple statistic\u201d.</p> <p>Tim Thomas, the director of employment and skills policy at the EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said: \u201cThe concept of businesses reporting the number of workers who are not UK nationals will be a complete anathema to all responsible employers. Ironically, at a time when the government says it wants to extend opportunity to all and promote inclusion, this proposal will be divisive and damaging to the UK\u2019s diverse and multicultural workforces.</p> <p>\u201cThe object, it seems, is to shame those employers with a proportion of non-UK workers above some hypothetic and arbitrary level. Workers, whether UK, EU or global contribute greatly to UK industry and should be welcomed and not regarded as a simple statistic.\u201d</p> <p>Small businesses could be turned into \u201cimmigration officers\u201d by the proposals, the Federation of Small Businesses said.</p> <p>Mike Cherry, the national chairman of the FSB, said: \u201cFundamentally, the UK has been a global magnet for talent and this must be considered by ministers. The ability to hire the right people for the right job is paramount, and we will be championing this in the upcoming consultation. </p> <p>\u201cWe also do not want to see small business owners turned into immigration officers nor encumbered by new bureaucracy.\u201d</p> <p>The Institute of Directors said businesses focused on the skills of workers rather than their nationality. Seamus Nevin, head of employment and skills policy at the IoD, said: \u201cThis is a concerning proposal from the government. The notion that employers prefer foreign workers to UK-born is wrong. Employers don\u2019t discriminate by nationality \u2013 all that matters is the talent available.</p> <p>\u201cImmigrants are not like-for-like substitutes. They fill skills gap that cannot be filled domestically. Therefore it is hard to understand what government expects this \u2018naming and shaming\u2019 policy will achieve.\u201d</p> <p>Bosses in the technology industry warned that the plans could jeopardise the fledgling sector in Britain.</p> <p>Russ Shaw, founder of Tech London Advocates, said: \u201cThis reactionary call to restrict access to global talent goes against everything we are doing to build a global tech hub that rivals Silicon Valley. One out of every three UK tech employees was born overseas, and their hard work and commitment has played an essential role in making London the capital of European tech.\u201d</p> <p>Trade union leaders also criticised the government\u2019s \u201canti-immigrant sentiment\u201d at the party conference in Birmingham.</p> <p>Kamaljeet Jandu, GMB national equalities officer, said: \u201cThe UK government must not get swept away on a raft of anti-immigrant sentiment while looking for new scapegoats for their economic mistakes. Instead, it must focus on actually improving the lives of working people in this country after Brexit.\u201d</p>",

In places around the world we have excessive debt. In some places we have debt, in particular non-financial corporations\u2019 debt, growing very fast.</p> <p>\u201cA crucial message from the fiscal monitor is that when private debt is on an unsustainable path it is important to intervene early on in the process to make sure financial crises and recessions can be prevented.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/governments-imf-global-debt-timebomb-international-monetary-fund-economy\">Governments must heed IMF warning of  $152tn global debt timebomb</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The IMF says fiscal policy, the power governments have over tax and spending, could help. It suggests government-led programmes to restructure debt and tax breaks to persuade creditors to lengthen repayment periods.</p> <p>Central banks have borne the brunt of attempts to boost growth for the past eight years, but the IMF said more active use of fiscal policy would provide a better mix. Excessive private debt was making global recovery more difficult and had increased the risk of financial instability. Rapid rises in private debt often led to financial-sector triggered recessions which were longer and deeper than normal downturns.<br></p> <p>Gaspar said debt was unevenly spread and concentrated in the advanced countries of the west and some of the big emerging market economies such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/16/chinas-debt-is-250-of-gdp-and-could-be-fatal-says-government-expert\">China</a>. He advised countries where it posed a risk to financial stability to be proactive and intervene early.</p> <p>The IMF\u2019s report shows that the overall debt level has not fallen since the financial crisis and recession of 2007-09, despite the fact that the most severe downturn of the post-war era was the consequence of too much reckless borrowing.</p> <p>Debt levels were high at the end of the second world war, but decades of strong growth and moderate inflation led to a steady decline in debt to GDP ratios.<br></p> <p>Gaspar said that the reason debt levels were now higher than they were before the 2007-09 crisis was that economic growth had been so weak. Faster US expansion since the crisis had resulted in a much sharper decline in private indebtedness than in the eurozone, he added.</p> <p>Some countries, including the UK, have seen a decline in non-financial private sector debt since the world economy fell into recession in 2008. But the IMF expressed concern about the rapid growth of China\u2019s private sector debt to GDP ratio, up 70 percentage points between 2008 and 2015.</p> <p>\u201cChina is so large and the debt of non-financial corporations is growing so fast that it is having significant effects on global trends,\u201d Gaspar said.</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>As Start Me Up pumped through the sound system, Theresa May danced out of the shadows hellbent on making some grown men cry. This was her Year Zero. Everything that had happened in the past six years had been nothing to do with her. She had hated every last minute. She had been home secretary only in name. She had been a prisoner in her own department. Any pro-EU sentiments she might once have voiced had been implanted in her head by metropolitan liberal elite aliens. And now a change was gonna come. Sam Cooke would have felt far queasier about having his song lyrics hijacked than the Rolling Stones.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to pay thanks to the man who made the party change,\u201d she said. It sounded very much as if she was going to give a shout out to Nigel Farage, but the man she had in mind was David Cameron. The former prime minister had changed things a lot in the past six years. For the worse. So it was up to her, Theresa, to change everything all over again. Dave was a stain on the country and his legacy needed to be erased. Theresa had just made her first grown man cry.</p> <p>A change was gonna come. The country had spoken and she was listening. She had made no great efforts to pay attention to the feelings of those who had been left behind during the referendum campaign, but she was now. Brexit must mean Brexit, and she could guarantee she would get the best deal for Britain. She didn\u2019t say how because she wasn\u2019t going to give a running commentary, but the rest of the world would inevitably bow to the might of British sovereignty. The Labour party might be heading back to the 1970s, but this was an unashamed retreat to the 1870s.</p> <p>A change was gonna come. To think an unBrexit thought was to show a lack of respect to the rest of the country. Theresa knew this and had understood it. She had no doubt that Brexit was the path of righteousness. To have voted to remain in the EU would have been to abdicate any claims of patriotism. \u201cThose who still believe Britain has made a mistake in leaving the EU are just patronising members of a liberal metropolitan elite,\u201d she said, happily patronising 48% of the country. Almost overnight the liberal metropolitan elite had grown to more than 16 million people. Quite some elite.</p> <p>A change was gonna come. Theresa also insisted she wanted a more equal country, but was rather hazy on the details of how she was going to achieve this, veering from one moment sounding like an old-fashioned Labour leader by advocating more state intervention to somewhere to the right of Farage with her anti-immigrant rhetoric. Anything to hoover up the middle ground vacated by Labour\u2019s lurch to the left. \u201cIf you believe you are a citizen of the world, you are a citizen of nowhere,\u201d she said gnomically. But don\u2019t worry. Theresa understands you.</p> <p>A change was gonna come. Theresa was gonna build hundreds of thousands of new homes. Huge swaths of green belt would be concreted over. She didn\u2019t know how she was going to pay for any of her promises, but that wasn\u2019t the point. She just had to hope that no one noticed her policies were as brittle as her performance. It would take a while for her to acquire the easy rubberiness of her predecessor. Still, she had to say something about money so she threatened to clamp down on tax-dodgers, but none of the millionaire Tory donors in the hall batted an eyelid. They knew no change was gonna come. Their cash was safe. Politicians always say they are going to tighten up tax loopholes, but they never do.</p> <p>A change was gonna come. The vision Theresa wanted to leave us with was of a Britain where the Brownlees were an example to us all. One brother stopping to help the other across the finishing line. Back in hospital, a second grown man cried. George Osborne rubbed his chest. He still had the bruises from where Theresa had kicked him unconscious before taking the tape alone. Do as I say, not as I do.</p> <p>A change was gonna come. The prime minister tried to convince the conference that she alone cared for the working-classes and that it was Labour who were now the nasty party. Some of the more gullible even believed it and gave her a standing ovation. She lapped it up, as well she might. A change was gonna come. It was just as well no one had bothered to enquire if the change would be for the worse.</p>",
  "<p>The fossil fuel industry\u2019s emissions of a powerful greenhouse gas are dramatically higher than previously thought.</p> <p>Researchers who pulled together the biggest database yet of worldwide methane emissions found that, after natural sources were discounted, emissions from gas, oil and coal production were 20-60% greater than existing estimates.</p> <p>Methane makes up just <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">16% of global greenhouse gases and is shorter-lived than the CO2 which accounts for three quarters</a>, but has a much more powerful warming effect. </p> <p>The extra methane estimated by the study is 300 times larger than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/26/los-angeles-aliso-canyon-gas-leak-methane-largest-us-history\">the amount leaked in California\u2019s Aliso Canyon last year</a>, which was the worst gas leak in US history. While bad news for efforts to tackle climate change, <a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature19797\">the new study published in Nature</a> also found that methane emissions had fallen as a fraction of industry\u2019s production.</p> <p>Lead author Stefan Schwietzke, of the University of Colorado and US science agency Noaa, said that methane from fossil fuels had played a significant role in global warming, but the gas\u2019s short lifetime meant acting on it now could pay quick dividends.</p> <p>\u201cThe good news is that reducing methane emissions now will reduce climate forcing in only a few years \u2013 it takes much longer for CO2. And since fossil fuel methane emissions are higher than previously thought, the potential to reduce climate forcing from this specific source is also greater,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Experts said the study meant scientists should reconsider their climate models. \u201cEmissions scenarios currently used for climate prediction need to be reassessed taking into account revised values for anthropogenic methane emissions,\u201d wrote Dr Grant Allen of the University of Manchester in a commentary in Nature.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/17/us-likely-culprit-of-global-spike-in-methane-emissions-over-last-decade\">Other studies</a> have suggested the huge growth in the US shale gas industry is to blame for a spike in methane emissions since the mid-noughties. But the new work found methane emissions from natural gas production had declined as a fraction of production from 8% in the mid-1980s to around 2% in the late 2000s and early 2010s.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been <a href=\"https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/Downloads/EPAactivities/Summary_Global_NonCO2_Projections_Dec2012.pdf\">anecdotal evidence</a> for a while that the oil and gas industry improved their efficiency. Our data confirms this anecdotal evidence on a global scale,\u201d said Schwietzke.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-04T10:54:59/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Methane emissions graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-04T10:54:59/embed.html\">Methane emissions graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Methane emissions have been rising since the industrial revolution but paused between 1996 and 2006 \u2013 believed by some to be because of decreased fossil fuel emissions in former Soviet Union countries \u2013 before marching upwards again. Most is from natural sources, such as wetlands and geological seepage, but humanity\u2019s share is estimated to account for 30-45% of the total.</p> <p>The study published on Wednesday examined the isotopic \u201cfingerprints\u201d of methane sources, compiling thousands of measurements from public sources and peer-reviewed papers. Allen said it was the largest database of its kind.</p> <p>Schwietzke said that such models on methane were very sensitive to the data that informed them. \u201cA key message is that the number and comprehensiveness of measurements matter.\u201d</p>",

Helena Smith reports: </p> <blockquote> <p>Anger over the incendiary issue of home repossessions intensified as clashes broke out while a court in the northern metropolis convened over the issue. Judges were forced to adjourn the hearing as protestors, who have formed a citizens group called Collectives Against Auctions, rioted with police reinforcements sent to guard the building. Last week, the same group managed to stop a similar hearing over the foreclosure of a home belonging to a man who had defaulted on a \u20ac300,000 bank loan after storming the court room. The man, a father- of-six, who also owed \u20ac80,000 to the social security fund, claimed he had been unable to meet loan repayments after his business went bust and he had suffered a heart attack that had left him almost wholly incapacitated.</p> <p>Home repossessions are widely seen as a tipping point for Greeks at the sharp end of the biting austerity that has been the price of the debt-stricken country\u2019s rescue from insolvency. </p> <p>But within the 19-member eurozone Greece is also the champion in non-performing loans with the International Monetary Fund estimating that of the \u20ac900bn worth of bad loans in the area around \u20ac100bn belong to the portfolios of Greek banks. By contrast the Greek economy accounts for a mere 1.5 per cent of the eurozone. The IMF and the EU, which have poured over \u20ac300bn in bailout funds into the country since mid 2010, are now pressuring the government to relax protection laws against home foreclosures. In the months ahead the wave of repossessions is expected to grow amid escalating concerns that the issue is assuming explosive proportions. Indicatively Michalis Sallas, the long-serving chairman of Piraeus Bank until resigning in July, recently warned: \u201cCitizens cannot live with the fear of expulsion and repossession. It is to nobody\u2019s benefit, not even the banks. Who will insure [properties], who will look after them, who will pay property tax?\u201d </p> <p>The Greek real estate market \u2013 with the exception of that on popular Greek islands \u2013 is among the worst performing worldwide, with properties in Athens having lost up to 70 percent of their value since the crisis began. </p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

Against that backdrop, the fall in the exchange rate will help to support activity, cushioning the impact of greater uncertainty. While that was expected, the effect could be coming through faster than we\u2019d anticipated.</p> </blockquote> <p>The speech also takes a good look at the impact, and causes, of record low bond yields (a massive headache for pension funds), and the wider issue of economic uncertainty. <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2016/speech929.pdf\">It\u2019s online here</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisGiles_/status/783598802099986432\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Really good speech by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland\">@bankofengland</a> Ben Broadbent <a href=\"https://t.co/5Tibyb4COl\">https://t.co/5Tibyb4COl</a></p>&mdash; Chris Giles (@ChrisGiles_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisGiles_/status/783598802099986432\">October 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f4c444e4b005191a20ee93\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T09:25:50.137Z\">10.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>This isn\u2019t how Theresa May would like her first conference as Tory leader to be remembered.</strong></p> <p>But it appears that the slump in the pound vs the euro this week means Britain has fallen to sixth place in the list of the world\u2019s biggest economies, behind our old friends France.</p> <p>The FT\u2019s Chris Giles has crunched the numbers, and explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>International Monetary Fund <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2016/10/03/AM2016-NA100416-WEO\">estimates of the size of economies in 2016</a> puts the UK at \u00a31,932bn with France weighing in at \u20ac2,228bn, putting the UK ahead so long as a pound buys more than \u20ac1.153.</p> <p>At the start of the week, the prime minister, chancellor, foreign secretary and Brexit secretary all boasted that Britain would get a good deal in EU talks because Britain was the fifth-largest economy in the world.

  "<p><strong>Pangolin</strong></p> <p>Sadly for the pangolin, the tough brown scales that so neatly tile its body are in huge demand for medicinal purposes, while the flesh that they protect is also appreciated as a delicacy in Vietnam and some parts of China. Earlier this month, conservationists <a href=\"https://www.iucn.org/content/most-traded-wild-mammal-pangolin-being-eaten-extinction\">warned of the devastating decline in pangolin populations</a>. Cites followed up by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/28/pangolins-thrown-a-lifeline-at-global-wildlife-summit-with-total-trade-ban\">putting all pangolin species into the highest category of protection</a>.</p> <p><strong>Grey parrot</strong></p> <p>Cheers and applause greeted the decision to finally ban the international trade in wild African grey parrot. This beautiful and highly intelligent creature \u2013 one study found that they are capable of the same logical reasoning as a four-year old human \u2013 has been heavily hunted in the central and western African countries where they are native. The birds are hugely popular around the world as pets, but their numbers in the wild have dwindled, with <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/02/160205-african-grey-parrots-wildlife-trafficking-ghana-extinction/\">Ghana estimated to have lost 90-99% of its wild population</a>. The conference <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/02/african-grey-parrot-has-cites-global-summit-thank-protected-status\">voted to move the parrot into Appendix I</a> \u2013 the highest level of protection.</p> <p><strong>Rosewood</strong><br></p> <p>With its distinctive dark auburn sheen, rosewood is loved by consumers who snap up luxury rosewood furniture in China. But the explosion in demand \u2013 the market has grown 65 times since 2005 and is now worth $2.2bn a year \u2013 is having a devastating impact on the forests in South-East Asia where the rosewood tree grows, and traffickers are now looking for sources in Africa and Central America. By a consensus decision, the Cites conference <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/29/wildlife-summit-cracks-down-on-illegal-rosewood-trade\">placed all 300 types of rosewood under trade restrictions</a>.</p> <p><strong>Rhinos</strong></p> <p>A proposal from Swaziland that would have allowed it to sell its 330kg stockpile of horn in order, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/28/swaziland-unveils-plan-to-legalise-rhino-horn-to-pay-for-anti-poaching-efforts\">it said</a>, to use the money to help support rhino conservation work, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/03/bid-for-stronger-protection-for-all-african-elephants-defeated-at-wildlife-summit\">was defeated</a>. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/26/revealed-the-criminals-making-millions-from-illegal-wildlife-trafficking\">a recent Guardian investigation revealed</a>, international criminal networks are making millions by smuggling rhino horn out of Kenya and South Africa into Asia where it is used for so-called medicinal purposes. There is a misplaced belief that rhino horn can increase fertility.</p> <p><strong>Lions</strong></p> <p>One of the few disappointments for conservationists at the conference came with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/02/african-lions-trade-ban-fails-global-wildlife-summit\">the defeat of a motion to increase protective measures for African lions</a>. Lion parts from captive-bred lions are traded around the world, and observers cite what appears to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/apr/16/south-africa-lion-bones-trade\">a growing market in lion bones</a> for medicinal purposes in Asia. But a motion to ban all trade in lion parts was defeated. Trade in wild lion parts will continue to be prohibited, but the hoped for ban on trade in captive lion parts did not materialise. Humane Society International who campaigns with Blood Lions against captive breeding of lions, called the decision a \u201cbitter disappointment\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Sharks and rays</strong></p> <p>Small furry shark mascots were all over the place at the Cites conference, and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/04/sharks-and-rays-win-new-protections-at-global-wildlife-summit\">the decision to place nine species of ray, three thresher shark species and the silky shark under international trade restrictions</a> was met with whoops and hugs. </p> <p><strong>Ivory markets and elephants</strong><br></p> <p>Elephants were one of the hottest topics at the conference, following heated discussions at the IUCN wildlife summit in September <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/10/ivory-trade-ban-international-summit-hawaii\">around plans to end the domestic trade in ivory</a>.</p> <p>Some Southern African countries, which claim to have elephant populations that are stable or recovering, are asking to be allowed to resume a legal trade in ivory so that the revenue can be used to help with conservation efforts. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/26/south-africa-saving-endangered-species-duty-everyone\">They argue</a> that only by allowing wildlife to contribute to national revenues can they run truly sustainable conservation policies. But conservationists argue that only a total ban will enable a proper crack-down on the massive illegal trade that is critically endangering the world\u2019s elephant population.</p> <p>In the end <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/03/bid-for-stronger-protection-for-all-african-elephants-defeated-at-wildlife-summit\">neither side succeeded in having their proposals for change passed</a>. In fact, the most significant gain for elephants was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/02/worlds-nations-agree-elephant-ivory-markets-must-close\">a resolution passed unanimously</a> calling for the closure of all domestic ivory markets \u201cthat contribute to illegal trade and poaching\u201d.</p> <p>With the conference also making progress on National Ivory Action Plans, and an announcement due from China later this year about its plans to close its own domestic market, conservationists hope that a tipping point in the battle to shut down the international ivory trade may be on the horizon. The Wildlife Conservation Society described the package of measures agreed at Cites as \u201ca huge win for elephants\u201d.</p>",

There was a plan to plug the debt, build the future and create the culture,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cRebranding ourselves was really important with our stadium. We\u2019re in the London Stadium. We added the word London to our crest because we felt it had real global appeal. Nobody else does it. We are in the heart of London, in the foothills of the financial sector. We have the best stadium \u2013 there are some great stadiums in this country but there is only one Olympic Stadium and it\u2019s ours. It\u2019s really had a dynamic impact on the things we can do.\u201d</p> <p>She also pointed to the figures to show that the move had been popular with fans, despite some recent complaints over the way it has been handled.</p> <p>\u201cWe had a difficult job to do when we were moving to a new stadium. We sold the stadium out to 52,000 season-ticket holders,\u201d Brady said. \u201cWe have 10,000 under-16-year-olds who come week in, week out. We have completely sold out hospitality. I have 50,000 people who have paid to join the waiting list to be able to buy a season ticket. We have 36,000 members.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b83074419388424e43693a81e23219f0ee045eaf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b83074419388424e43693a81e23219f0ee045eaf/0_120_5568_3342/1000.jpg\" alt=\"West Ham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">West Ham\u2019s move to the London Stadium had been well received by fans, Karren Brady told the Leaders Sports Business Summit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She said that when Gold and Sullivan bought the club it was necessary to reduce their debt and overhaul \u201ctheir culture\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere were two interesting things about it. One, it had \u00a3100m worth of debt. Two, it had no what I would call culture. At football clubs we don\u2019t make anything, we don\u2019t manufacture anything, we don\u2019t really produce anything other than more players,\u201d she told the Leaders Sports Business Summit. \u201cSo getting the culture right, being a place where something is expected of you, having discipline, planning and process and strategy. That wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p> <p>Brady insisted the fans remained at the heart of what the club was attempting to do. \u201cIf you\u2019re always driven by money, you lose your traditional values and what you\u2019re there for,\u201d she said. \u201cThe stadium and the league are not what makes a club. It\u2019s the people who support it. Protecting their traditions and their values and their integrity in their own brand is very important.\u201d</p> <p>Brady said in the Olympic Stadium, towards which West Ham paid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/14/west-ham-olympic-stadium-club-pay-per-season-rent\">\u00a315m of the \u00a3272m conversion costs</a> plus \u00a32.5m in annual rent, they saw an opportunity to rebrand the club. \u201cWe have this great stadium and much better prospects and facilities than in our old stadium but we charge a lower price. We offer a more dynamic product at an inferior price. It\u2019s been so well received and it comes back to our values and our culture.\u201d</p> <p>But the move has also been marked by unrest in the stands \u2013 with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/12/west-ham-united-fans-want-action-london-stadium-segregation-problems-police-presence\">supporters complaining of inadequate stewarding</a>, a lacklustre atmosphere and problems with the relocation of like-minded fans to sit next to one another \u2013 plus poor results.</p> <p>Following a convoluted process West Ham were given a 99-year lease to become the stadium\u2019s anchor tenant. The vehicle set up by the London Legacy Development Corporation and Newham Council to own the stadium is responsible for matchday costs and stewarding.</p> <p>In the face of criticism from some fans Brady defended the progress made by the club since she was employed by Gold and Sullivan. \u201cWe are in the Olympic Stadium, we have limited outside debt and we are ranked 15th in terms of brand values. We were 115th when I joined the club. We\u2019re now 20th in the Deloitte Money League,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have got the largest amount of season-ticket holders of any London club and the capacity will be increasing to 66,000. We feel we\u2019ve set out our goals and achieved them.\u201d</p> <p>Improbably, given the furore and discord that have marked the move, Brady also revealed the club were planning a feature film called Iron Men, following the journey of a group of fans from Upton Park to the London Stadium. \u201cWe\u2019re making a movie called Iron Men.

Here\u2019s the most obvious winners and losers.</p> <h2>Winners</h2> <p><strong>British workers</strong></p> <p>May promised her government would be on the side of British workers, ruling out a bonfire of employment rights post-Brexit, reiterating her leadership race commitment to putting employees on company boards and attacking company bosses who \u201cearn a fortune but don\u2019t look after your staff.\u201d<br></p> <p><strong>Rural Britain </strong></p> <p>Broadband is a priority which May mentioned in her speech, and one her spokeswoman said had been discussed in cabinet meetings and committees. It\u2019s in rural, and traditionally Tort, areas where connectivity is poorest and expect to see some concrete new policy on this in coming weeks and months.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a013ebd79c4e53dcee595bdb4f18a664763dd6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a013ebd79c4e53dcee595bdb4f18a664763dd6b/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BT Openreach engineers working on a broadband internet fibre cabinet in the street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BT Openreach engineers working on a broadband internet fibre cabinet in the street.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Savers</strong></p> <p>May said it was clear current low interest rates were not working for everyone, and there were gentle hints that the government may be preparing to rethink quantitive easing, a policy that would be attractive to savers. May said though QE had been good after the financial crash, the government would \u201cacknowledge there have been some bad side effects.\u201d Monetary policy like this however, is really the domain of the Bank of England.</p> <h2>Losers</h2> <p><strong>Foreign workers</strong></p> <p>May has made it clear she wants to prioritise voter concerns about immigration in her Brexit negotiations. Her speech will have unnerved many overseas workers, including doctors, whom the Prime Minister suggested may only be allowed to stay in the UK for a limited period. Firms have already started a huge backlash against a proposal floated by Amber Rudd to make companies list the number of foreign workers they employ. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d51fc0ddbe8ca6d5fb1c9985b69905818b873e92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d51fc0ddbe8ca6d5fb1c9985b69905818b873e92/231_43_3884_2331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Green Party banners during the Refugees Welcome march.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green Party banners during the Refugees Welcome march.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophie Baggott/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Energy companies </strong><br>May strongly hinted she wanted to tackle high energy bills, without a firm proposal. But her words about energy companies have been seized on as potentially a move towards Ed Miliband-style energy price caps. Her official spokeswoman did not rule out even tougher action, but said firmer policy announcements would follow.</p> <p><strong>Human rights lawyers</strong><br>One of the biggest cheers in the hall came as May attacked \u201cactivist, left-wing human rights lawyers.\u201d The focus of her anger was abuse claims against British troops, which defence secretary Michael Fallon had announced earlier would be protected against claims arising from the ECHR for future conflicts.</p> <p><strong>Tax avoiders</strong></p> <p>Nothing concrete yet, but May has seized on another Labour soundbite, it\u2019s patriotic to pay your taxes. \u201cWhoever you are you \u2013 however rich or powerful \u2013 you have a duty to pay your tax. And we\u2019re going to make sure you do,\u201d she said.

Business leaders are not pantomime villains, evading taxes and employing cheap labour from abroad out of some destructive desire to do Britain down, and for every Mike Ashley or Philip Green there are hundreds of thousands of hard-working entrepreneurs who are more likely to remortgage their homes than own a super yacht.

The spokeswoman said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What she is doing is identifying the problems and saying there is a determination to address them. She is setting out an agenda for the things that we will be looking at; the further detail will come from the departments.</p> </blockquote> <p>Broadband access in particular will be under the spotlight, and has been raised repeatedly at cabinet and other committees, the spokeswoman said. Corporate governance is also a key policy area where announcements will be made in the coming months.</p> <p>In the speech, May appeared to be pointing the finger at specific companies and individuals \u2013 Facebook, Google and the responsibility of billionaire Philip Green for the BHS pensions\u2019 crisis, or Mike Ashley for working conditions of Sports Direct employees.</p> <p>That was predictably denied by May\u2019s team. The spokeswoman said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>She\u2019s not picking out individuals. She knows people at home think it\u2019s one rule for one and one for another. They go away with massive profits and people don\u2019t see the benefits. She feels there\u2019s a further gap than ever between big business and workers.</p> </blockquote> <p>The spokeswoman refused to directly deny May had taken the playbook of former leader Ed Miliband and repackaged it for the Conservatives. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is being quite pragmatic.

But that was the Scottish leader, Ruth Davidson, whose speech introducing Theresa May was one of the best of the whole conference season. As for Theresa May\u2019s, it was rather more questionable.</p> <p>What was certainly bold was May\u2019s decision to cast herself as the leader of a \u201cquiet revolution\u201d (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-speech-tory-conservative-conference-theresa-mays-speech-politics-live?page=with:block-57f4daf8e4b0e2a2a25af297#block-57f4daf8e4b0e2a2a25af297\">11.51am</a>). Taking the EU referendum vote as her starting point, she said it was not just a vote to leave the EU but a protest against an economic and political system rigged in the interests of the elite to the detriment of ordinary people. She is not necessarily wrong, and this analysis is not unlike Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s, but May then set out to use it to make the case for her own brand of pragmatic, populist, \u201cone nation\u201d Conservatism. What she had to say about tax-dodgers (and, even more pointedly, tax-dodging accountants), corporate responsibility, market failure and industrial intervention was provocative in Tory terms, and yet another indication of how far the party has come from the days of Margaret Thatcher. Edward Heath coined the term \u201cthe unacceptable face of capitalism\u201d, and May has placed herself firmly in the Heath/Major/Blair centrist tradition. It\u2019s Christian democracy \u2013 or perhaps Anglican democracy, given that May\u2019s father was a vicar.</p> <p>Yet there was nothing in the speech to show that May is willing to match her rhetorical courage with action. If she really thinks working people are losing out under the tax system, she could abandon George Osborne\u2019s inheritance tax cut. If she is serious about intergenerational fairness, she could shelve the \u201ctriple lock\u201d. And if she accepts that housing policy needs to change so that people can get on to the ladder, she could rip up planning laws and send the bulldozers on to the green belt. But of course that wouldn\u2019t go down well in Maidenhead (her constituency), or with the Daily Telegraph, or with the Conservative party at large.</p> <p>May said at one point that government was about \u201caction \u2026 about doing something\u201d. But caution seems to be more her watchword. We\u2019re still waiting for a decision about Heathrow. </p> <p>Ultimately this speech will be judged by whether May can deliver on the heady ambitions that she set herself. It is not inconceivable; in some respects her record as home secretary was radical. But she would have been much more convincing today if she had backed her rhetoric with at least one announcement to show that change is real.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T12:58:28.033Z\">at 1.58pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f4e71de4b08ebe3d557064\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T11:46:20.230Z\">12.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is an agenda for a Conservatism rooted in the centre ground.</p> <p>That is what this government is about, she says.

He was particularly critical of the suggestion that companies could be forced to declare who many foreigners they employ. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-speech-tory-conservative-conference-theresa-mays-speech-politics-live?page=with:block-57f4b9c8e4b0afec6ad16f7a#block-57f4b9c8e4b0afec6ad16f7a\"> 9.37am.)</a> He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The tone of the Conservative conference has become increasingly xenophobic.

Here are 10 things we\u2019ve learned.</p> <p><strong>1. Brexit will be at the harder end of the scale. </strong>This was signalled in Theresa May\u2019s speech on Sunday and \u2013 judging not least by the market reaction \u2013 it is the most important takeaway from the whole conference. Ministers still seem uncertain as to exactly what they want, but the Norway/Switzerland models (soft Brexit) are out and, although May is not planning to simply walk away and slam the door (the hardest possible Brexit), she will prioritise getting control over immigration over single market membership. Brexiteers strongly object to the terms hard/soft on the grounds that they are loaded, because hard implies bad (clean/dirty is one alternative formula they prefer), but this terminology is not unreasonable. Economists believe disengaging from the single market will have negative consequences.<br></p> <p><strong>2. The Conservative party is largely united behind May on Brexit, but it is complacent about the risks. </strong>From what has been said in the conference hall, and on the fringe, you could easily forget that the party was split down the middle on the EU four months ago, because now the Tories seem remarkably unified. According to a <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2016/10/brexit-members-survey-todays-conservativehome-conference-newspaper-in-full.html\">ConservativeHome poll</a>, 76% of members back the harder Brexit May is offering. But there is a considerable disconnect between Toryworld, where many members are convinced that all forecasts about Brexit being bad for the economy are just wrong, and reality, where May\u2019s speech sent the pound tumbling. Two figures who are not complacent are May herself, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live?page=with:block-57f373d4e4b01506cbf24feb#block-57f373d4e4b01506cbf24feb\">who has been warning about \u201cbumps in the road\u201d</a>,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live?page=with:block-57f373d4e4b01506cbf24feb#block-57f373d4e4b01506cbf24feb\"> </a>and Philip Hammond, the chancellor, who used his speech on Monday to try to warn his party about potential bad news ahead.</p> <p><strong>3. City and business opinion does not matter to the Tory leadership as much as it used to.</strong> Traditionally the Conservative party has been quite deferential towards the City and business, but now the tone is different. \u201cCity delegates stranded on Planet Tory for the duration of the party conference report the atmosphere has turned toxic,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7133664a-8a29-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731\">the Financial Times\u2019 Lombard column reports</a>. A Bloomberg story saying <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-03/may-said-to-downgrade-city-in-brexit-shock-for-financial-sector\">the City would get no special favours in the Brexit negotiations</a> caused alarm (even though it was denied) and then Amber Rudd, the home secretary, announced a crackdown on work visas, <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/home-affairs/immigration/news/79577/business-backlash-against-amber-rudds-fresh-immigration\">which prompted a strong business backlash</a>. In government Hammond is fighting to protect business interests in the Brexit talks although, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pestonitv/posts/1703845213273550\">in a perceptive Facebook post</a>, ITV\u2019s <strong>Robert Peston</strong> says the conference shows \u201cthe Treasury, in the May government, is less powerful than it\u2019s been for many decades.\u201d<br></p> <p><strong>4. May seems serious about defining herself as a centre-ground politician, although so far there is little policy evidence to show that she will be very different from her predecessor.</strong> It is commonplace for political leaders serious about power to argue that they represent the centre ground, or that the centre ground has moved towards them, but May is finding it easier to make this case than David Cameron because for most his premiership the centre ground was taken by his coalition partners, the Lib Dems. However, so far, we have yet to see a big policy shift that makes this real. When Nick Robinson challenged her yesterday to show her commitment to working people by axing inheritance tax cuts (which only help the wealthy), or higher public sector pay, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live?page=with:block-57f36c6be4b0643b5d843d5b#block-57f36c6be4b0643b5d843d5b\">May ducked for cover</a>. </p> <p><strong>5. The Tories aren\u2019t very worried about Labour, but that has not stopped them annexing some of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s policy territory.</strong> In some respects, competitive party politics is quite simple: all you have to do is attack your opponents\u2019 bad ideas, pinch their good ones, and make sure you have the sense to tell which is which. The Tories have done that this week, hijacking some of the soundest aspects of the Corbyn agenda \u2013 a slower timetable for balancing the budget, reviewing whether employment laws suit the modern workplace, and a migration impact fund. Some Labour figures think that, if the Tories are on their turf, that will help Corbyn, but that is not necessarily so because, on the economy and immigration, the Tories are more trusted than Labour. The Tory MP Robert Halfon <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-labour-leader-tories-should-be-worried-and-not-celebrating-robert-halfon-minister-mp-a7342636.html\">gave an interesting speech</a> saying his party should worry about Corbyn\u2019s ability to inspire young voters, but he has been a lone voice and generally the Conservatives are not taking the threat from Corbyn seriously at all. </p> <p><strong>6. Next year\u2019s most important election may well be the West Midlands mayoral one.</strong> Labour is expected to win the mayoral elections in Greater Manchester and Liverpool city region next year quite easily, but the contest in the West Midlands could turn out to be gripping. The Tories have used the conference to promote their candidate, the outgoing John Lewis boss Andy Street, and Street say he just needs a 4% swing from the general election results to win. Given that the West Midlands is one of the regions where general elections are often decided, this will be a key test for Corbyn\u2019s Labour versus May\u2019s Conservatives.<br></p> <p><strong>7. The Tories have ditched the Cameron era quite ruthlessly. </strong>There is little gratitude in politics. Ministers have been acknowledging David Cameron in their speeches, but their tributes have barely gone beyond the polite and, outside the conference hall, it\u2019s more a case of \u201cDave who?\u201d. In the atrium there is a display featuring pictures of Tory prime ministers from Robert Peel to John Major, from which Cameron is notably absent. The people most closely associated with his administration, such as George Osborne and Michael Gove, have not turned up and, in a final indignity, Sir Craig Oliver, Cameron\u2019s former communications chief, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/david-camerons-former-aide-charged-1500-for-conference-ticket-after-publishing-attack-book-on-a7334966.html\">had to pay the extortionate business attendee rate</a> to get a pass to be allowed entry into the conference building.<br></p> <p><strong>8. Being foreign secretary has not changed Boris Johnson. </strong>Diplomacy is normally associated with a certain amount of gravitas, and before the conference it was not clear whether Johnson would adopt a serious tone, or whether we would get the usual faux-spontaneous, rambling, semi-frivolous standup routine. In the event we got the latter. It was actually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/02/conservative-conference-may-to-explain-brexit-great-repeal-bill-in-marr-interview-politics-live?page=with:block-57f13f37e4b015be6383371c#block-57f13f37e4b015be6383371c\">a very good speech</a>, probably the best anyone has delivered so far (not least for the use of the word \u201cfunkapolitan\u201d), although what the mandarins at King Charles Street and Johnson\u2019s fellow foreign ministers made of it is anyone\u2019s guess.<br></p> <p><strong>9. The Tories who backed the Vote Leave campaign are not willing to defend its key claims.</strong> One of the TV highlights of the conference has been Sky\u2019s Darren McCaffrey <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/783193789158481920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">trying to get the Tory Vote Leave leaders to defend their claim that Brexit would free up \u00a3350m a week for the NHS</a>. The Vote Leave NHS promise was disowned some months ago, but this week we\u2019ve seen further evidence that Vote Leave\u2019s Brexit forecasts were misleading. Rudd said she was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/03/conservative-conference-philip-hammond-confirms-osbornes-austerity-timetable-has-been-dropped-politics-live?page=with:block-57f25d97e4b0ff53b531bb7e#block-57f25d97e4b0ff53b531bb7e\">not planning to increase immigration from the Commonwealth as EU immigration falls</a> (leavers forecast the opposite), and Brexit ministers are backing away from the claim that there will be no trade-off between controlling immigration and enjoying the full benefits of the single market. (Admittedly, some of the worst remain economic forecasts have failed to materialise too, but the person most associated with those claims, George Osborne, is out of the picture.)</p> <p><strong>10. An early election looks less and less likely. </strong>May has been saying for some time that she has no plans for an early election, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/02/conservative-conference-may-to-explain-brexit-great-repeal-bill-in-marr-interview-politics-live?page=with:block-57f04384e4b0ab0063086f3f#block-57f04384e4b0ab0063086f3f\">in an interview on Sunday</a> she went further then before, saying an early election would generate \u201cinstability\u201d. Just as significantly, it has become clear from what has and has not been said around the conference that there is little appetite in the party for an early poll.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T10:40:05.813Z\">at 11.40am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f4c868e4b0d9ed530ef255\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T09:35:17.565Z\">10.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">SNP, Greens and Plaid Cyrmu issue joint statement condemning Tories's stance on immigration</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The SNP leader and Scottish first minister <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong>, the Green co-leaders <strong>Caroline Lucas</strong> and <strong>Jonathan Bartley</strong> and the Plaid Cymru leader <strong>Leanne Wood</strong> have released a joint statement this morning condemning the Tories for their stance on immigration.

We will not tolerate the contribution of people from overseas to our NHS being called into question, or a new version of the divisive rhetoric of \u2018British jobs for British workers\u2019. Neither will we allow the people of these islands, no matter how they voted <a>on June 23rd</a>, to be presented as a reactionary, xenophobic mass whose only concern is somehow taking the UK back to a lost imperial age. At a time of increasing violence and tension, we will call out the actions of politicians who threaten to enflame those same things.</p> <p>This is not a time for parties to play games, or meekly respect the tired convention whereby they do not break cover during each other\u2019s conferences. It is an occasion for us to restate the importance of working together to resist the Tories\u2019 toxic politics, and make the case for a better future for our people and communities. We will do this by continuing to work and campaign with the fierce sense of urgency this political moment demands. </p> </blockquote> <p>The statement has also been signed by Steven Agnew, leader of the Greens in Northern Ireland, Patrick Harvie, co-convener of the Scottish Greens, and Alice Hooker-Stroud, leader of the Welsh Greens.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f4bf25e4b0afec6ad16f97\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jessica-elgot\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T08:52:21.671Z\">9.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Communities secretary <strong>Greg Clark</strong> joked last night to a meeting of liberal Tories that Theresa May had been great for progressives because Boris Johnson \u201cspends most of his time out of the country\u201d.</p> <p>At a midnight reception for the Tory Reform Group, members of the group cheered as Clark, who was a remain campaigner teased his cabinet colleague. \u201cIt\u2019s been a great year for the TRG and particularly a great summer as there are more TRG MPs than there are Liberal Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cDamian Green in the cabinet!

Rudd,</strong> the home secretary, was on the Today programme this morning defending <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/amber-rudd-defends-proposal-to-make-firms-reveal-foreign-staff-numbers\">the plans she announced yesterday to restrict the number of foreign workers coming to the UK. </a>She said some firms were not doing enough to employ local people.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The purpose of this review is to look at whether they are doing enough to train people locally when they could be able to do that. There are record levels of employment, which is great, but there are still one in 10 18- to 24-year-olds unemployed and I want businesses to think first about locally training people where possible. For instance, I went and visited a factory quite recently where they recruit almost exclusively from Romania and Poland, where they have people who have experience in factories building these sofas that they have. They didn\u2019t even consider training locally \u2013 there was a local college they could have worked with, but they choose to recruit outside the UK.

Back even when he was London mayor, Boris Johnson had a failsafe shtick that was aped by the likes of Liz Truss, and which he was still flogging this week. We\u2019re so perfectly placed as a global trading nation, this runs, that \u201cwe sell tea to China, TV aerials to Korea and, my friends, we export French knickers to France!\u201d This riff has now also been nicked wholesale by those we might politely term lesser orators. Consider Liam Fox \u2013 pushing for such a hard Brexit that it was like a Viagra ad every time he opened his mouth \u2013 who declared (for the third time in a week) that the UK sold \u201ctea to China, wine to France, and boomerangs to Australia\u201d. Fox had taken the stage right after Leadsom, Britain\u2019s luckiest escape, who had trilled wide-eyed: \u201cWe\u2019re selling coffee to Brazil, sparkling wine to France and naan bread to India.\u201d We were even, Andrea smiled excitedly, selling \u201cbottled English countryside air for up to \u00a380 a go\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"923ff9bbc0c4bc16ca9ee5c6faff4e66f96665cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/923ff9bbc0c4bc16ca9ee5c6faff4e66f96665cb/0_135_3695_2217/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Don\u2019t worry, exports of naan bread will save the economy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don\u2019t worry, exports of naan bread will save the economy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Look, no one wants to let daylight in on tragic. But even cursory research reveals that the coffee claim amounts to a very small hill of beans we import from Brazil, then process and export back to Brazil in a deal worth the titchiest fraction of the coffee we buy in. The boomerang triumph can be traced back to a single company in Leighton Buzzard whose own general manager is at pains to stress <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37510315\">\u201cBoomerangs are obviously not exactly a huge market\u201d</a>, while the naans-to-India bit is a reference to <a href=\"http://www.dunstabletoday.co.uk/news/business/our-naan-is-so-good-we-re-taking-it-to-india-1-2193427\">one baker in Dunstable</a> who has invested in a factory outside Mumbai. Less than 2% of wine exported to France is English \u2013 around \u00a3940,000 worth \u2013 while we import \u00a3881m of the French stuff. Arguably, the crowning achievement of this vision of a post-Brexit trade bonanza is the guy selling the \u00a380 jars of \u201cfresh air\u201d to the Chinese. He turns out to be <a href=\"http://www.aethaer.com/\">a self-styled \u201cair farmer\u201d</a> with a website so pretentious it reads like a Chris Morris hoax, and who will only admit to having flogged around 300 units of his <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimwaterson/fart-in-a-jar-and-sell-it-at-twice-the-price?utm_term=.ylA9DZn2w#.ilMbqWreE\">nonsensical product</a>.</p> <p>So those are your big bucks post-Brexit beacons, ranging from a boomerang-maker who would very much like you to commute your expectations, to some hipster chancer who has sold fewer than 300 empty jars to Chinese ironists.

At present, Johnson\u2019s magic mirror still tells him he is the fairest of all, but the suspicion must be that one day he will see Ruth Davidson\u2019s face smiling insolently back at him. The Scottish Tory leader is very much the coming draw, inevitably chosen to warm up for May\u2019s climactic speech, but whose open distaste for Johnson saw her gift us three of the more amusing slapdowns of the summer. The first was during the Question Time that came live from Wembley, when she interrupted some military posturing by Boris to sniff: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/7-times-ruth-davidson-told-8252001\">I think I\u2019m the only one on this panel who\u2019s ever worn the Queen\u2019s uniform.\u201d</a> The next saw her decline to even break stride as a reporter asked her about Boris crashing out of the race to succeed David Cameron, only smiling lightly that, \u201cLeadership is hard. It\u2019s not for everyone.\u201d And the third was Davidson\u2019s majestically off-colour joke to a Westminster reception, which characterised the post-result landscape thus: \u201cLabour is still fumbling with its flies while the Tories are enjoying their post-coital cigarette. After withdrawing our massive Johnson \u2026\u201d I\u2019m not saying the Tory crowds don\u2019t still love Boris.

On Sunday, when May pre-emptively shafted the Brexit negotiations, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s only media intervention was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/783223886229938176\">a tweet</a>: \u201c@LabourFilmFest is coming to the North West for the 1st time.

  "<p>Romania has banned all trophy hunting of brown bears, wolves, lynx and wild cats in a surprise decision that gives Europe\u2019s largest population of large carnivores a reprieve from its most severe and immediate threat.</p> <p>The move on Tuesday reverses a trend which has seen the number of large carnivores being shot by hunters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/16/romanian-politician-calls-for-the-army-to-help-control-bear-population\">grow year on year</a> since Romania\u2019s accession into the European Union in 2007. In 2016, the largest hunting quotas yet gave hunters the mandate to shoot 550 bears, 600 wolves and 500 big cats over 12 months. </p> <p>Over the last decade, hunting has grown into a multimillion-euro industry in Romania, with hunters from all over the world paying up to \u20ac10,000 (\u00a38,800) to claim a \u2018trophy\u2019 \u2013 hunting parlance for the carcass of a hunted animal \u2013 from the Carpathian mountains. </p> <p>The government has claimed that in order to exist, the industry relies on a loophole in European law which allows for the culling of wild animals that have been proven to be a danger to humans. Under the habitats directive, all large carnivores are protected in European Union member states, yet the state can order the killing of specific animals if shown to have attacked a person or damaged private property.</p> <p>\u201cHunting for money was already illegal, but it was given a green light anyway,\u201d environment minster, Cristiana Pasca-Palmer, told the Guardian. \u2018The damages [clause in the habitats directive] acted as a cover for trophy hunting.\u201d</p> <p>Each year, hundreds of hunting associations across the country would submit two numbers; the total population of each large carnivore species, and the total number which they believed to be likely to cause damages. The second number would then act as a basis for a government-issued hunting quota for each species. These quotas were then carved up between hunting companies and sold as hunting rights to the public. </p> <p>\u201cThis method raised some questions,\u201d says Pasca-Palmer. \u201cHow can hunting associations count how many animals are causing damages a priori \u2013 before the damages have happened? By introducing the ban, what we are doing is simply putting things back on the right track, as the habitats directive originally intended.\u201d</p> <p>Wildlife NGOs claim that the methodology also tended to dramatically overestimate the populations of large carnivores. The official figure for the number of bears in Romania is over 6,000, and for wolves is 4,000. Yet with hundreds of hunting associations each responsible for monitoring a small area of land, and animals prone to wandering, it is understood that individual animals were often counted multiple times, potentially pushing the total population statistics up by thousands.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/16/romanian-politician-calls-for-the-army-to-help-control-bear-population\">Romanian politician calls for the army to help control bear population</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Announced late on Tuesday evening, the ban is expected to divide Romania\u2019s population, pitching rural and urban dwellers against each other. The government\u2019s decision has strong support in the larger cities, which have seen a growing movement against hunting in recent months. But in much of Romania\u2019s remote countryside large carnivores are a daily threat to villagers and a persistent nuisance to livestock farmers, and many see hunting as the only solution.</p> <p>Csaba Domokos, a bear specialist with wildlife protection NGO Milvus group, is convinced that the success or failure of the hunting ban rides on the government\u2019s ability to address the rural population\u2019s fears. </p> <p>\u201cDamages caused by large carnivores are a very real concern in the countryside,\u201d he said. \u201cThe system up until now did not work; hunting does not reduce conflicts between carnivores and humans; in fact many studies show that with wolves and large cats, it can actually increase the problem. </p> <p>\u201cBut the rural population believe that hunting is the answer, and unless they can be convinced otherwise, people may well start to take the problem into their own hands. The ban is a great step, but we don\u2019t want hunting to be replaced by poaching.\u201d</p> <p>Domokos points out that hunters also have a vested interested in the protection of their quarry. \u201cTo some extent, hunting acts as a financial incentive for wildlife management, from preventing poaching to conserving habitats. There is some concern that once you take that away, the government will not invest enough to replace it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2eddcc9143d53cedd87d48e139734cf83d1daf98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eddcc9143d53cedd87d48e139734cf83d1daf98/0_0_5428_3539/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hunters pay up to \u20ac10,000 to trophy hunt in the Carpathian mountains\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hunters pay up to \u20ac10,000 to trophy hunt in the Carpathian mountains.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Turner/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The government\u2019s response is to take management into its own hands.

  "<p>The death of a newborn baby at a vicarage that resulted in a murder investigation will be re-examined by prosecutors after an inquest heard the boy could have survived.</p> <p>A vicar and his daughter did not resuscitate the newborn baby and left it in the house alone for up to two hours after it was born following a concealed pregnancy, an inquest heard. </p> <p>Baby Jonathan Percival was born alive at the Holy Trinity vicarage in Freckleton, Lancashire, and took a breath but was not given any medical attention and died shortly afterwards. </p> <p>His mother, Ruth, allegedly told midwives soon after giving birth in November 2014 that she did not want the baby and asked them to dispose of him. </p> <p>The Rev James Percival went on to tell the police the child appeared \u201csallow and lifeless\u201d and he thought it was \u201cobviously deceased\u201d but Blackpool coroner\u2019s court was told the baby could have survived up to 15 minutes after delivery.</p> <p>The inquest heard Jonathan was born between 3.30pm and 4pm on 25 November 2014 but was not seen by a medical professional until about 5.35pm when the reverend let paramedics into the family home at Sunnyside Close.</p> <p>Ruth Percival, who was 28 at the time, and her father were arrested and questioned on suspicion of murder shortly after the baby\u2019s death. In April this year, the pair were told they would face no charges \u2013 but the case could now be re-opened and may go before a criminal court. </p> <p>Coroner Alan Wilson dramatically adjourned the inquest at Blackpool town hall after three medical professionals giving evidence agreed that the baby had been born alive and suggested he could have survived had he been given the correct medical attention. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Wilson said he would have to pass the case on to the director of public prosecutions as evidence given during the inquest \u201cstrengthened previously existing suspicions\u201d a criminal offence may have taken place. </p> <p>The evidence suggested that the baby had an 80% chance of survival had he been given correct medical attention within 20 minutes of being born. The coroner singled out the evidence of Dr Ruth Gottstein, a consultant neonatologist, who told the court. \u201cIf resuscitation had been initiated, I think the baby would survived. Mouth-to-mouth would have done a good job.\u201d</p> <p>He said: \u201cThis is a rare occurrence and not one that I take lightly but given the evidence I have heard it strengthens the previously existing suspicions that a criminal offence may have taken place to cause or allow the death of a child.</p> <p>\u201cIn court Dr Gottstein clearly stated that if a resuscitation attempt had been made she could see no reason why this child would not have survived.\u201d</p> <p>The inquest was told that at the time of the birth, which was a full-term pregnancy, Ruth Percival, now 30, was living at the vicarage with her mother Susan, 66, and her father, who had been vicar at the church for 11 years. She was said to have hidden the pregnancy from her parents. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The court heard that Ruth Percival, an office cleaner, had contacted her GP to try and terminate her pregnancy, but then \u201cburied her head in the sand\u201d after being told by staff at the Marie Stopes centre in Manchester that she was \u201ctoo far gone\u201d. </p> <p>On 25 November, 2014, she was sent home from work suffering from stomach pains. She was in the house with the reverend when he heard her in pain in the downstairs bathroom of the vicarage.</p> <p>He opened the bathroom to find the his daughter on the floor covered in blood holding a baby wrapped in a towel. The court heard he took the baby from her who was described as being \u201csallow and lifeless\u201d and put him on the floor before moving him to the sofa. </p> <p>The pair then did not contact the emergency services, with the vicar instead cleaning the bathroom while his daughter went upstairs to change her clothes. They then left the baby in the house alone and went to a previously arranged GP appointment. </p> <p>It was only once they arrived at the GP surgery that emergency crews were alerted. Ruth Percival told her GP about the birth and that the child had been left alone in the vicarage. </p> <p>Wilson said: \u201cThey left the child wrapped in a towel on the sofa. When the GP took an account from Ruth and then went out to the car to get her father and an ambulance would be called for Ruth and paramedics would be sent to the house and he was told to go home.\u201d</p> <p>But the inquest heard that the reverend did not go home immediately and instead went to pick up his wife from Dobbies Garden centre before dropping her off at the GP surgery. He finally went home and let paramedics in at just after 5.30pm \u2013 almost two hours after the baby had been born. </p> <p>Wilson said the vicar then allegedly told paramedics that he saw his daughter \u201cput the baby in a bin\u201d. But both he and his daughter subsequently denied putting the child in a bin. However, they admitted that the baby had been taken out of the house after being shown photographs of Jonathan with a leaf stuck to his left thigh. </p> <p>The baby was taken to Blackpool Victoria hospital where he was pronounced dead. Midwives found that the baby had the cord wrapped around his neck. </p> <p>Whilst at the hospital the coroner said Ruth Percival allegedly told midwives: \u201cMy dad said the baby died because the cord was wrapped around the neck. I wanted nothing to do with the baby. I want the nurse to dispose of it.\u201d</p> <p>During the two-hour inquest the vicar and his daughter sat at opposite ends of the courtroom as three medical professionals including two pathologists gave evidence. <br></p> <p>The father of the child, Brian Hanlon, had been invited to attend the proceedings as an interested party but had not responded to correspondence from the coroner.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The inquest heard that owing to the baby being born in a concealed environment and with the mother being in denial it was particularly vulnerable. </p> <p>Pathologists could not ascertain the cause of death, but the inquest heard there was a possibility asphyxiation could have been a contributory factor. It was also heard that because the baby did not receive any medical attention after being born its chances of survival were significantly reduced. </p>",

These large molecules look a bit like dumbbells, with a ring sitting around the middle. As with the catenane, this ring is not fixed - it can move along the length of the dumbbell and what\u2019s more, this movement can be controlled.

Marie Alta Jean-Baptiste, head of Haiti\u2019s civil protection agency, said on Wednesday that Haiti\u2019s confirmed death toll had doubled from five to 10.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88bd4bc6065978545a090bd1c4ff1b4830beecd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88bd4bc6065978545a090bd1c4ff1b4830beecd6/12_146_3624_2174/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People carrying a coffin try to cross the river La Digue, after the passing of hurricane Matthew\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People carrying a coffin try to cross the river La Digue, after the passing of hurricane Matthew</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Orlando Barria/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Haiti\u2019s government said Sunday\u2019s presidential and legislative elections \u2013 due to be held on Sunday \u2013 would be postponed for the second time this year while the government assessed the extent of the hurricane\u2019s damage. \u201cGetting assistance to the population is more important than elections right now,\u201d said Provisional Electoral Council president, Leopold Berlanger. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/06/hurricane-tracker-frontend/v1/?name=Hurricane%20Matthew&amp;id=matthew&amp;type=at4&amp;zoom=4&amp;lat=32&amp;lon=-79&amp;speed=64\" data-alt=\"Hurricane Matthew\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/06/hurricane-tracker-frontend/v1/?name=Hurricane%20Matthew&id=matthew&type=at4&zoom=4&lat=32&lon=-79&speed=64\">Hurricane Matthew</a> </figure>  <p>Hours after Matthew swept in on Tuesday, bringing 145mph winds, Haitian government leaders said they had not been able to assess its impact. With a key bridge washed out, roads impassable and phone communications down, the rural south-western peninsula tip of Haiti remains isolated.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we know is that many, many houses have been damaged. Some lost rooftops and they\u2019ll have to be replaced while others were totally destroyed,\u201d said the country\u2019s interior minister, Fran\u00e7ois Anick Joseph.</p> <p>The UN\u2019s World Food Programme (WFP) and its children\u2019s agency, Unicef, have begun mobilising resources to help. WFP has arranged enough food supplies to feed 300,000 people for a month, while Unicef is preparing life-saving aid for 10,000 people in Haiti.</p> <p>Marc Vincent, Unicef\u2019s representative in Haiti, said Matthew was the worst storm Haiti had seen in decades. Carlos Veloso, the WFP\u2019s Haiti director, said efforts to gauge the scale of the emergency were being complicated by the lack of communications and the fact that the airport in Port-au-Prince was still closed.</p> <p>The storm ripped away a bridge in the flooded town of Petit Goave, preventing any road travel to the hard-hit south-west. Local radio reported water shoulder high in parts of the southern port city of Les Cayes.<br></p> <p>With access to the hardest-hit areas difficult, there are growing fears that the country\u2019s cholera epidemic could spread further. The disease, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/18/un-public-admission-haiti-cholera-outbreak\">unwittingly introduced to Haiti by UN peacekeepers</a> after the earthquake, has killed 9,000 people and there have been 27,000 suspected cases of cholera already this year, a third of them in children.</p> <p>Frank Manfredi, senior director of resilience at child\u2019s rights group Plan International, said cholera, a waterborne disease, is a \u201cmajor concern\u201d for aid groups. \u201cPeople are wading through water that can be from ankle to waist deep, and in some places impassable,\u201d Manfredi said.</p> <p>Manfredi said that on the ground, there is also concern about how the wind and rain have destroyed crops. People are expecting landslides as well, which could further damage agriculture.</p> <p>Because the impact of waterborne disease remains unknown, and large swaths of land are cut off from communication, Manfredi expects the death toll to rise. \u201cUnfortunately with areas cut off, it would not be surprising if those figures rose,\u201d he said.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2016/oct/04/international-space-station-shows-hurricane-matthew-from-space-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/55qgc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2775018\"            data-video-name=\"International Space Station shows Hurricane Matthew from space \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Nasa/ AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57f3584fe4b0643b5d843d07\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/04/161004Matthewspace3_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733783&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733783&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2016/oct/04/international-space-station-shows-hurricane-matthew-from-space-video\">International Space Station shows Hurricane Matthew from space</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Prospery Raymond, country manager for the international charity Christian Aid, said the departments of Sud and Grand\u2019Anse had been the worst affected by the storm, along with parts of the Ouest department. He said the wind and rain had torn roofs from houses, swept away plantations, ripped trees from the earth and drowned livestock.</p> <p>\u201cThe road to Grand\u2019Anse is not open because one of the main bridges has collapsed,\u201d he said. \u201cCommunication is not working. We don\u2019t have much information on the number of people who\u2019ve died but the main thing is shelter and housing: a lot of people have lost their roofs or had their houses destroyed. The roof of the big church in Les Cayes, which is one of the symbols of the city, blew away.\u201d</p> <p>He said that unless water and sanitation supplies were brought to areas where the water was now \u201csticky with mud\u201d, the risk of cholera would only increase \u201cand there will be another emergency to deal with when it comes to all sorts of water-borne diseases\u201d.<br></p> <p>Raymond said the Haitian government and many local NGOS and civil society groups wanted to make sure they played a central role in the relief effort. One of the enduring criticisms of the international response to the 2010 earthquake is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/12/haiti-earthquake-five-years-on-village-solidarite\">Haitians were sidelined</a> as foreign groups decided how best to respond and rebuild.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are waiting for support from the government and I think the government would like to co-ordinate most of the international help,\u201d said Raymond. He added that Christian Aid and its partners would \u201cpush international donors to work more closely with the Haitian government and to provide support directly to it in order to move the response\u201d.</p> <p>Veloso said the UN and other international agencies and NGOs were working closely with Haiti\u2019s directorate of civil protection to ensure the mistakes of the past were not repeated.</p> <p>\u201cThere have been constant meetings with [the directorate] and several organisations have placed people full time in the department to boost its capacity and to create a better communication line with the UN agencies and NGOs,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Muddy rivers and tributaries continued to rise as water flowed down hillsides and mountains, threatening further flash floods and mudslides even as Matthew tracked away from the country.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65642cb15bb9faa498a44807fdbaf22fd6e0ca18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65642cb15bb9faa498a44807fdbaf22fd6e0ca18/0_141_3355_2013/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A flood in Santo Domingo, capital of the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A flood in Santo Domingo, capital of the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erika Santelices/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Milriste Nelson, a 65-year-old farmer in the town of Leogane, said neighbours fled when the wind tore away the corrugated metal roof on their home.

Some sought shelter only after the worst was already upon them.<br></p> <p>Jean-Michel Vigreux, Haiti director of the humanitarian agency CARE International, said that while communication with the southern part of the country is \u201cvery difficult,\u201d they had heard of \u201cdestroyed houses, streets and bridges, dead livestock, destroyed livelihoods\u201d. </p> <p>CARE dispatched a response for about 50,000 people but noted that the country is still recovering from a string of natural disasters including the earthquake, two cyclones, a tropical storm and two draughts.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe population is very strained,\u201d Vigreux wrote. \u201cStrengthening people\u2019s resilience and boosting the reconstruction are key.\u201d</p> <p>Rainfall totals were predicted to reach 15-25ins (38-64cms) in Haiti, with up to 40ins in isolated places.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d1302a6d70bcc44cb1a98b4e8bb100dda1564ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d1302a6d70bcc44cb1a98b4e8bb100dda1564ec/0_211_4712_2827/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man runs from a wave at the waterfront in Baracoa, Cuba.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man runs from a wave at the waterfront in Baracoa, Cuba.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ramon Espinosa/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The hurricane rolled across the sparsely populated tip of Cuba overnight, destroying dozens of homes in the island easternmost city, Baracoa, and leaving hundreds of others damaged.

Now it is the International Monetary Fund sending out a warning about global debt.</p> <p>For the first time, the IMF has had a comprehensive look at indebtedness and the numbers are huge. Global debt is estimated at $152tn, or about 225% of annual global output. Two-thirds of the debt \u2013 approximately $100tn is held by the private sector.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/21/united-nations-unctadwarns-debt-crisis-poor-developing-countries-oil-prices\">UN warns over global fallout from debt crisis in poor countries</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The IMF hopes the debt data published in its half-yearly fiscal report will chivvy governments into action before it is too late.</p> <p>The first thing to note is that there has been no overall debt deleveraging since the financial crisis and recession of 2007-09, despite the fact that the most severe downturn of the post-war era was the consequence of too much reckless borrowing. Indeed, the IMF notes that debt as a proportion of GDP has never been higher.</p> <p>Debt levels have been high before, such as at the end of the second world war. But in the three decades after 1945, strong growth and moderate inflation meant global output increased much more quickly than indebtedness, and the problem gradually melted away. Since 2009, growth and inflation have been low by historic standards.</p> <p>Central banks have responded to weak growth and the threat of deflation by keeping interest rates low, but this approach has proved to be a double-edged sword. It has helped by making it cheaper to service debt repayments but has also increased demand for borrowing.</p> <p>As a result, many borrowers would quickly find themselves in trouble were central banks to start raising interest rates, with a return to the levels seen before the financial crisis unthinkable.</p> <p>Like the Bank for International Settlements, the IMF thinks central banks are shouldering too much of the burden for sustaining global growth, but any normalisation of interest rates would need to be handled sensitively.</p> <p>The IMF says fiscal policy \u2013 the power governments have over tax and spending \u2013 could help. It suggests there should be tax breaks to persuade creditors to lengthen repayment periods or measures to remove debt from balance sheets.</p> <p>Fiscal action would, of course, increase government debt in the short term, but the IMF believes this is better than the alternative. That is a situation in which weak nominal growth and low inflation locks the global economy into the sort of debt-deflation spiral envisaged by the US economist <a href=\"https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/docs/meltzer/fisdeb33.pdf\">Irving Fisher</a> during the depths of the great depression in the 1930s.</p> <p>Governments need to heed the warning. The IMF says there is a debt timebomb out there. And the ticking is getting louder.</p>",

To that end, it brazenly sought to colonise territory that used to belong to Labour - thereby shoving that party to the very margins.</p> <p>Start with the more obvious treats served up for the Mail. None was bigger, of course, than the promise to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">exit the European Union</a>, with no ifs or buts on ending both free movement and jurisdiction by the European court of justice.

May offered a vision that was a radical break from Thatcherism. She said: \u201cThere is more to life than individualism and self-interest,\u201d as if rebuking the notorious claim that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-quotes\">\u201cthere is no such thing as society\u201d</a>. While Thatcher\u2019s ally Ronald Reagan always insisted that government was the problem, May said it could be \u201cpart of the solution\u201d.</p> <p>She made the case for an active state, intervening where the market had failed. She praised Clement Attlee, the NHS and the BBC. She made a moral argument for rich people to pay their taxes. She called the housing market \u201cdysfunctional\u201d, and promised that the government would start building houses. While she was at it, she denounced modern slavery, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/feb/11/uk-police-forces-still-abusing-stop-and-search-powers\">stop-and-search</a> and institutional racism.</p> <p>The political pitch was clear: to promise onetime Labour voters that they could have everything they used to value in Labour, without backing what had become \u2013 in a neat reverse of her past verdict on her own political tribe - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/oct/08/uk.conservatives2002\">\u201cthe nasty party\u201d</a>. For it was, she said, the Tories who were now the party of the workers, the NHS and of public servants.</p> <p>It was bold, even shameless. Thanks to Brexit, it may also prove hollow \u2013 since exiting the EU will threaten many of the things about Britain she boasted of. (How long will Britain boast three of the world\u2019s 10 best universities when foreign students are discouraged from coming here?)

A million have been sacked, and the rest suffer the harshest pay downgrade ever.</p> <p>Yes, this powerful speech will be remembered and May will be reminded of these words every step of the way. Will she halt the disastrous \u00a313bn benefit cuts still to come, especially to tax credits of her \u201cjust-about-managing\u201d families, whose incomes will fall sharply?

Britain changed on 23 June, revealing a host of issues that had been festering, unacknowledged, for decades: of huge swaths of the country that had missed out on economic success; of communities impacted by rapid change; of simmering hatred towards an out-of-touch elite.</p> <p>May can claim to be the fresh new face who can change all this. Meanwhile her party faithful are revelling in the afterglow of Brexit and the thought of \u201ctaking back control\u201d. And the official opposition is reeling after a ferocious and divisive summer-long leadership challenge. So, right now, May can say what she likes and people will lap it all up \u2013 including many traditional Labour lines.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the prime minister can say she believes 100% in the free market, yet that the Conservatives are \u201cthe party of the workers, the party of public servants, the party of the NHS\u201d. She can run through a list of racial injustices and say, \u201cI want this Conservative government to fight every single one of them.\u201d</p> <p>Why May can rebrand herself as passionately pro-Brexit \u2013 \u201cour laws will be made not in Brussels but Westminster\u201d \u2013 even though she was notionally on the remain side.

  "<p>Britain\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/automotive-industry\">car industry</a> enjoyed a record September for new vehicle sales, but said Brexit uncertainty could weigh on future demand.</p> <p>The new 66 plate helped to lift new car sales by a modest 1.6% last month compared with a year earlier to a total of 469,696, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).</p> <p>It was the highest number on record for September, typically a strong month for sales because of the plate change. </p> <p>Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, described the 1.6% rise as \u201cdecent if unspectacular\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cStrong year-on-year growth in car sales are becoming ever harder to achieve as they are coming from a high base following extended healthy gains,\u201d Archer said.</p> <p>\u201cThere is also the possibility that September\u2019s modest growth rate in car sales could be a sign that consumers are becoming more cautious about making major purchases such as a car due to heightened uncertainty following June\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit vote</a>.\u201d</p> <p>A 7.3% increase in fleet sales was behind the rise in September, while sales to private buyers fell 1.7%. The top three best sellers were the Ford Fiesta, Vauxhall Corsa and Volkswagen Golf.</p> <p>Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said, the 66 plate, new models featuring the latest technology and cheap financing deals had all helped to boost demand in September.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a0c2b4de20ea7a66cb13dd2d3b400d2cd75ca6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a0c2b4de20ea7a66cb13dd2d3b400d2cd75ca6e/0_0_1896_1060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New car sales had a record September last month\" width=\"1000\" height=\"559\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New car sales had a record September last month</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SMMT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said, however, that the future strength of the UK car market was at risk because of the uncertainty posed by the Brexit vote.</p> <p>\u201cBusiness and consumers place September orders many months in advance, so the ability of the market to maintain this record level of demand will depend on the ability of government to overcome political uncertainty and safeguard the conditions that underpin consumer appetite,\u201d Hawes said.</p> <p>The expectation is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/qa-falling-pound-rising-markets\">the sharp drop in the pound since the Brexit vote</a> will start to weigh on consumers over the coming months. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation\">Inflation</a> is expected to rise and companies are expected to limit wage growth as they seek to keep their costs down.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a very real likelihood that inflation will move above earnings growth during 2017,\u201d Archer said.</p> <p>In the first nine months of 2016, 2.15m new cars were sold.

  "<p>Insurance companies and pension funds are at risk of becoming insolvent if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/14/lower-interest-rates-failed-spending-retirement\">ultra-low interest rates </a>persist for a prolonged period, the International Monetary Fund has warned.</p> <p>After almost eight years in which central banks have kept borrowing costs at record lows in an attempt to boost growth, the IMF said an over-reliance on monetary policy could have unwanted side-effects.</p> <p>It used its half-yearly health check of the global financial system to advise that the calmer-than-expected conditions since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> vote might not last.</p> <p>While short-term risks had abated over the past six months, the IMF said big challenges remained \u2013 including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/25/negative-interest-rates-the-case-against-john-maynard-keynes\">the impact of record-low interest rates on pension funds and insurance companies</a>, the fragility of banks, rapid credit growth in China and the heavy indebtedness of the corporate sector in emerging countries.</p> <p>\u201cThe solvency of many life insurance companies and pension funds is threatened by a prolonged period of low interest rates,\u201d the IMF said in its global financial stability report (GFSR).</p> <p>\u201cLow interest rates add to the legacy challenges facing many insurance companies and pension funds, along with those from ageing populations and low or volatile asset returns. Heightened concern over these important long-term saving and investment institutions could encourage even greater saving, adding to financial and economic stagnation pressures.\u201d</p> <p>The GFSR said regulators and supervisors needed to take prompt action to sustain the strength of insurance company and pension fund balance sheets, including identifying risks of insolvency and funding gaps. \u201cMany pension funds face funding gaps, where the present value of future liabilities exceeds the market value of their assets,\u201d the IMF said.</p> <p>Poor profitability continued to blight Europe\u2019s banks, the GFSR said, noting that a third would remain weak even if growth accelerated from the low levels recorded since the financial crisis and recession of 2007-09.</p> <p>For the west as a whole, 25% of banks with assets of $11.7tn (\u00a39.21tn) would remain in poor shape after a cyclical recovery. Since the start of the year, the market capitalisation of western banks had fallen by almost $430bn, strengthening the case for tackling vulnerabilities.</p> <p>\u201cMore deep-rooted reforms and systemic management are needed, especially for European banks,\u201d the IMF said. It said the number of bank branches in Europe should be reduced, while stronger measures were needed to tackle the high level of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/26/european-banks-prepare-for-possible-shockwaves-from-stress-test-results\">non-performing loans.</a> Together, the two changes would add a net $180bn to the capital position of Europe\u2019s banks, allowing them better to support growth.<br></p> <p>The GFSR said the shock of Brexit had initially led to turbulence in financial markets, but they had subsequently shrugged off concerns about the risks to the UK from leaving the EU.</p> <p>But it said the medium-term outlook was less rosy, with a need to look beyond monetary stimulus from central banks towards a stronger mix of policies to strengthen the foundations of the global position. The GFSR said this could help avoid financial stagnation and protectionism, which would reduce global growth by around three percentage points over the next five years.</p> <p>Low interest rates raised the present value of existing long-term liabilities, steadily eroding capital and solvency buffers the longer the low-rate environment persists.<br></p> <p>\u201cA protracted period of low and negative policy rates and yields could undermine financial resilience in the medium term, but the risks of increased headwinds may materialise more immediately,\u201d the IMF said, adding that falling share prices were likely to put pressure on banks to curtail lending until early 2018.</p> <p>\u201cIn many European countries, a more complete solution to address legacy bank problems can no longer be postponed. Specifically, both the high level of nonperforming loans and rising strains on profitability require urgent and comprehensive action.\u201d The IMF identified Italy and Portugal as particularly vulnerable. </p> <p>While fears of a market meltdown after the Brexit vote had not materialised, there was a risk of the City losing business as a result of the decision to leave the EU, according to the report.</p> <p>\u201cThe post-referendum bout of market volatility faded after central banks responded promptly; no major disorderly market events surfaced, other than a sharp sell-off in some UK-based real estate funds,\u201d the GFSR said.<br></p> <p>\u201cYet the biggest challenges remain ahead. The shape of future trade arrangements and the uncertain impact of Brexit on the United Kingdom\u2019s large and globally integrated financial system have created uncertainty over the longer-term financial prospects of the United Kingdom. There is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding future arrangements and the implications for the UK financial sector.\u201d <br></p>",

He said: \u201cThere are many innovative ways to improve the training and continuing professional development of teachers, and distance learning can play a role \u2013 but is not in itself a magic bullet.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/fs30-teachers-en.pdf\">Unesco figures</a> show that while the number of primary school teachers in Ghana has increased by 61% over the past decade, there was a decrease in trained teachers from 72% in 1999 to 53% in 2013. The distance-learning method allows teachers to learn novel methods of teaching, which, especially in Africa, have relied for too long on rote learning and dictation, said Pota. </p> <p>Teachers also need to be paid more and paid on time, argue campaigners. Teachers\u2019 salaries are often so low that they are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/03/the-10-a-month-teacher-and-the-slum-school-she-rescued\">forced to live hand-to-mouth</a>, supplementing their work with other jobs or spending <a href=\"http://www.nation.co.ke/news/Knut-files-appeal-in-Supreme-Court-over-teachers--salary/1056-3001950-10prm3k/index.html\">decades disputing their pay</a> (as is the case in Kenya). </p> <p>But other socioeconomic and gender factors affect how long a child stays in school, said Forsyth, who pointed to issues such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/may/28/we-need-to-talk-about-periods-why-is-menstruation-still-holding-girls-back\">poor sanitation and the absence of doors on toilets</a> as reasons why girls may stop attending school.</p> <p>He said: \u201cSo many children go to school and then drop out because of poverty \u2013 they have to work instead.

You can talk to it, ask it various questions and it will provide a consistent experience throughout, as well as prompting you with information when it thinks its relevant.\u201d</p> <p>Ana Corrales, vice president of global operations and Google Store, said: \u201cWe\u2019re leveraging 18 years of search and evolving it into an assistant powered by machine learning and artificial intelligence that we believe will be the next wave of computing for the next 10 years or so and it will get better and better as people use it.\u201d</p> <p>Google Assistant will be available through the familiar \u201cOK Google\u201d hotword, which can be said at any time, and a long press of the Pixel\u2019s home button.

Google Assistant will be the Pixel phones\u2019 unique selling point, at least in the short term, in a very competitive market where Apple and Samsung dominate, but neither have been able to crack the useful integrated and intelligent personal assistant.</p> <p>The Pixel will also have unlimited full resolution phone backup with Google Photos, where other smartphones are limited in photo size and quality. They will be some of the first devices to feature the latest version of 4G - cat 9 LTE advanced - for the fastest possible data speeds, 4G calling and Wi-Fi calling, supported by EE as Google\u2019s exclusive network partner in the UK. </p> <p>Google will also provide a so-called Quick Switch Adapter to import iMessages, photos, videos, contacts and other data directly from Apple\u2019s iPhone, clearly targeting users disenfranchised with Apple\u2019s recent efforts.</p> <p>The 5in Pixel will cost \u00a3599 with 32GB of storage or \u00a3699 with 128GB of storage. The 5.5in Pixel XL will cost \u00a3719 with 32GB of storage or \u00a3819 with 128GB of storage. Both models match the pricing of Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.

But Assistant goes beyond relatively simple voice recognition, and as on the Pixel smartphones, can pull personal information, schedules, the weather and other day-to-day activities. It is designed as an artificial intelligence in-home helper.</p> <p>Explaining how Home would work in day-to-day life, Gummi Hafsteinsson, product management director on the Assistant engineering team said: \u201cThe other day I was trying to cook some eggplant, so I said \u2018OK Google, how do I cook an eggplant?\u2019 It then described it to me and said I had to cook it for 25 minutes, so I just said \u2018OK, Google, set a timer for 25 minutes\u2019 and it was done. I didn\u2019t have to touch anything, because my hands are busy doing something in the kitchen, and I can just get it to play music while I wait.</p> <p>\u201cThe long-term vision is for the assistant be available wherever you need it, not just on your phone.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England</a> deputy governor Ben Broadbent has said policymakers had been too pessimistic about the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, but warned of an \u201cinsidious\u201d threat to business investment.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s little doubt that the economy has performed better than surveys suggested immediately after the referendum and ... somewhat more strongly than our near-term forecasts as well,\u201d Broadbent said in a <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2016/929.aspx\">speech at the Wall Street Journal\u2019s offices in London.</a></p> <p>\u201cThe central projection in the August inflation report didn\u2019t involve a recession, simply a slowing in the economy\u2019s rate of growth. But that slowing looks so far to have been more moderate than we feared.\u201d<br></p> <p>But the deputy governor cautioned against reading too much into individual pieces of data following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU</a>.</p> <p>He said that while consumer spending would be \u201crelatively unperturbed\u201d, the greater risk would be a hit to business investment, as companies hold off on big spending commitments because of heightened uncertainty. </p> <p>\u201cA lack of clarity about the UK\u2019s future trading relationships needn\u2019t result in visible, headline-grabbing closures of productive capacity. The effect is likely to be more insidious: decisions to expand, that might otherwise have been taken, are delayed.\u201d</p> <p>Last week the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/30/nissan-hard-brexit-compensation-new-uk-investment-tariffs\">Japanese carmaker Nissan said it could scrap a potential new investment at its Sunderland factory</a> unless the UK government pledged to compensate it for any tariffs imposed after Brexit.</p> <p>Broadbent said a combination of factors had probably helped the UK economy in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, including strong domestic demand and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/qa-falling-pound-rising-markets\">a weaker pound</a>.</p> <p>He defended the Bank against the accusation that its policy of ultra low interest rates was driving up pension deficits. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">In August the Bank announced measures to support the economy following the Brexit vote.</a> Interest rates were cut to an all-time low of 0.25%, and the Bank increased its asset purchasing programme \u2013 quantitative easing \u2013 by \u00a360bn to \u00a3435bn.</p> <p>Broadbent suggested that while looser monetary policy did play a part in rising deficits \u2013 because lower bond yields increase pension liabilities \u2013 the key driver was the economic backdrop.</p> <p>\u201cThe decline in policy rates is a symptom not a cause of the forces shaping the global economy,\u201d Broadbent said.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe main thing to understand is that, even if domestic monetary policy has some bearing on real interest rates, at least for a while, it is not their ultimate determinant.\u201d<br></p> <p>He said that while looser monetary policy tended to drive bond yields lower, historically it also tended to increase the value of assets, benefiting pension funds. </p> <p>\u201cBut over the past decade or so, equities and bonds have been negatively correlated. More to the point, the general tendency has been for bonds to do well \u2013 for yields to decline \u2013 and equities poorly. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s this outperformance of the safe asset, highly unusual over such a sustained period, that has been the main problem for defined benefit [pension] schemes.\u201d</p>",

Since the December 2010 awards, corruption has been exposed in the global game, with the then-Fifa president Sepp Blatter among those now banned from the game.</p> <p>Montagliani, speaking at the Leaders in Sport conference in London, said: \u201cIf Russia and Qatar wouldn\u2019t have got these World Cups would we be in this situation now with an opportunity to clean the game?</p> <p>\u201cI think that was the starting point and the tipping point for certain things to happen. If England and the US had got the World Cup, maybe we would\u2019ve had status quo. I\u2019m just wondering if the authorities that have stepped up their involvement in the game would\u2019ve done that if the choices had been a bit different. Maybe the best thing that happened in football was Russia and Qatar.\u201d</p> <p>Montagliani, a Canadian, was elected Concacaf president this year, following the disgraced Jeffrey Webb as leader of North American, Central American and Caribbean football. Montagliani is also an ally of the Fifa president Gianni Infantino, who was named Blatter\u2019s successor in February.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/03/world-cup-expand-48-teams-fifa-gianni-infantino-suggests\" title=\"\"> Infantino has raised the prospect of expanding the World Cup from 32 teams to 40</a> \u2013 and now 48. Fifa, which governs 211 nations, who all take part in World Cup qualifying, is expected to decide on the format for the 2026 tournament early next year.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s obvious it\u2019s not going to stay at 32 for 2026. I think it\u2019s going to change,\u201d Montagliani added. \u201cIf we listened to traditionalists we\u2019d still have a 16-team World Cup. And there is a balance. You don\u2019t want 211 countries in a World Cup either.</p> <p>\u201cBut the reality is that the World Cup is such a strong brand and inspires a lot of hope and inspiration in countries. For them just to dream about it, never mind get a piece of it, provides a lot of groundswell in those countries to promote the game. I think it\u2019s an opportunity and I think the president is right to really look at it. Should it expand? I think the answer is probably yes. I think [the question] now is: \u2018What\u2019s the format?\u201d\u2019</p> <p>Montagliani says the United States, Canada and Mexico may host the World Cup themselves, but a regional bid is possible, too. \u201cI think it\u2019s time it does come back to Concacaf. We haven\u2019t had it since 1994 [USA],\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t want to prejudice their own individual positions, but as Concacaf president I don\u2019t see any negatives in terms of a regional bid.\u201d</p> <p>Concacaf has struggled with corruption perhaps more than any other of Fifa\u2019s six confederations, with Montagliani seeking to address the troubles and the image with the appointment of a first chief-compliance officer and a potential re-naming of the organisation. \u201cNo longer can a president or anyone else do things on a wink and a nod,\u201d he added. \u201cRight now [re-naming Concacaf] is an idea. We\u2019re looking at it. As an organisation you always have to look to change. Your brand or your name should not be exclusive of that. Part of it is the history, but part of it is also can we maximise in terms of leveraging a new brand and a new name.\u201d</p>",

They know that in every school year or geographical area there is a small but significant number of people with emotional difficulties that are entrenched and severe.</p> <p>These are the children for whom general interventions, such as school mentoring, social skills groups and community support do not help or do not help enough. These are the children parents, carers, professionals and communities are most worried about. But it\u2019s not always easy to tell if there is a problem; and if there is, what can parents, carers and professionals do about it?</p> <p>All children and young people experience powerful anxiety, confusion, distress and rage. Living in a family, making relationships with peers and making mental connections in order to learn are emotional matters. Experiences of disappointment and frustration, at ordinary levels, are as important as achievement and satisfaction.</p> <p>Play is one way children explore, and try to make sense of and communicate their emotional life. Talking is another. And children usually show how they are feeling through their behaviour.</p> <p>It\u2019s puzzling or alarming if a child or young person is behaving oddly, if they seem unusually upset, withdrawn, aggressive, controlling or uninhibited in a way that\u2019s hard to understand.

Even with babies, parents often notice that they are wondering out loud what the matter is.</p> <p>Of course the child may not know why they are upset or cross, and may not want to talk about things. It can be nerve-racking for parents to see that something is wrong and that the usual attention, comfort or strategies are not working. And it can be hard to wait and be ready to talk if things shift. Parents talking to each other, with teachers or other professionals, and putting their own observations and thoughts together can help to build a fuller picture.</p> <p>If parents and teachers can notice there\u2019s a problem and hold their nerve, they often observe that a child\u2019s temporary behaviours \u2013 such as sleeping, toileting or eating difficulties, problems with concentrating at school or with friendships, or low or overexcited mood \u2013 can be understood as being connected to where they are developmentally, to events at home or at school or changing circumstances in the family. Seeing the behaviour in context can reduce alarm for the adults, which can help with talking about things.</p> <p>While recognising that a child may have particular difficulties, it\u2019s always important to bear in mind different aspects of their emotional situation. A child may be showing something about their personal emotional situation or about the emotional situation of the whole family. A child always has a home context and culture, a wider social, cultural and economic environment, their own developmental history, and their own individual way of experiencing and interpreting the world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Helping children with complex emotional difficulties starts with noticing that something\u2019s the matter</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When trauma, including traumatic or repeated loss, dislocation, abuse or neglect is part of the child\u2019s experience, they are more likely to find day-to-day relationships hard to manage.</p> <p>Some children, families and young people have complex difficulties that persist.

  "<h2>Amsterdam, the Netherlands: \u2018When scarcity is applauded, that\u2019s very wrong\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cHere gentrification happens very quickly. Every month some \u2018nice\u2019 restaurant or shop opens. The old name of my neighbourhood (Kinkerbuurt) was changed and rebranded to \u2018Hallenkwartier\u2019. I would enjoy many of the changes if I knew others could enjoy it as well. But poor people have to leave, social housing is sold off, and rich people and tourists move in.</p> <p>There was a squatting action, a demonstration and protests against the rebranding of the neighbourhood. I have seen posters and banners on houses. But the city council is just selling off social housing. Waiting time for a house in this neighbourhood used to be eight years, now it is 18 years. The biggest ruling party has even worse plans; they want to give the social houses only to working people, saying jobless people should leave the city.</p> <p>I can\u2019t believe what Amsterdam has become, it was very different 10 years ago (I\u2019ve lived here for 22 years). Generally rent is easier to control with rent caps than housing prices, so this ideal of having property should be discouraged. We have a great tradition of social housing corporations in the Netherlands \u2013 some cities had 50% social housing. Now the whole way of thinking is about extracting money, not creating communities. When prices go up, they say \u2018the market is doing well\u2019. When scarcity is applauded, that is very wrong.\u201d <em>(Pieter Voogt)</em></p> <h2>Montreal, Canada: \u2018New restaurants can\u2019t be located near existing ones\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cVarious parts of Montreal have been experiencing gentrification.

Owners would be forced out of the city. Tenants would be rehoused in the area but probably with much higher rents. The prospect of seeing our lovely peaceful village-type estate being demolished and replaced with upmarket homes at top market prices is creating anxiety and illness.

The people who keep our city running are needed and need homes: what will Bath do if the dustmen, the waiters, the chefs, the nurses, the childminders, the recyclers are forced to live outside of this expensive city?

Landlords are evicting people to start a touristic business every day. </p> <p>We need new laws that encourage landlords to choose long-term renting, instead of short term or leaving apartments vacant.

The city is becoming an entirely segregated, exclusive place. Local and national governments are doing nothing to stop this happen.

Now, after regeneration efforts, we\u2019ve got cleaner streets, reduced crime, and a revived local economy - due in no small part to immigration, by the way. The housing crisis is a scandal.

The city has taken some steps to keep prices down (for instance by capping rent increases) but this has also ignited the popularity of Airbnb and similar sites, where renters can take advantage of these laws by paying low rents themselves, but making huge profits through short-term rentals. This then takes a number of apartments off the market, increasing rent prices and shortages. </p> <p>An acquaintance has rented four flats at a low rate, and rents them all out through Airbnb. It\u2019s become a very profitable full-time job for him. The city has put some restrictions on the amount of days you can rent your property, but these are apparently easy to evade and not well enforced. The city is still catching up to the use of new technologies. Rent caps and restrictions on Airbnb are a start, but they need to be more strictly enforced.\u201d <em>(Daniel)</em></p> <h2>Somerville, US: \u2018We need more community control of land\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cGentrification is out of control here in Somerville, Massachusetts.

Despite the loss of some of the shops and communities which create the identity of this area, there are a few initiatives that are trying to resist the present trend. In order to preserve the ethnic and social diversity in Goutte d\u2019Or, the city has been trying to slow down the process of gentrification by developing social housing. One third of the flats created were reserved for emergency housing, one third for regular social housing and one third for middle class \u201cpioneers\u201d.

This city is very rich in terms of diversity, but this is now being threatened, especially because private housing is deregulated and many foreigners are investing in real estate, making prices grow artificially.

It follows September\u2019s Hurricane Hermine, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/01/hurricane-hermine-nears-florida-us-storm\">the first hurricane to hit Florida in nearly 11 years</a>. </p> <p>While the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s prediction of a <a href=\"http://www.noaa.gov/media-release/near-normal-atlantic-hurricane-season-is-most-likely-year\">\u201cnear-normal\u201d Atlantic hurricane season</a> is still on track, scientists have pointed to Hurricane Matthew as the sort of fierce lashing that will become more common due to climate change.</p> <p>There was previously far more certainty among climate scientists over the increase of temperatures than trends in hurricanes, but government officials are <a href=\"http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/our-changing-climate/changes-hurricanes\">now confident enough to say</a> there has been a \u201csubstantial increase\u201d in Atlantic hurricane activity since the 1980s, with the destruction set to ratchet up further as the world warms.</p> <p>\u201cWe expect to see more high-intensity events, <a href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php\">category 4 and 5 events</a>, that are around 13% of total hurricanes but do a disproportionate amount of damage,\u201d said Kerry Emanuel, a climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cThe theory is robust and there are hints that we are already beginning to see it in nature.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be270441f30db3b5e2a7f13780c8bc811001fe1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be270441f30db3b5e2a7f13780c8bc811001fe1d/0_165_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trees sway with the wind as Hurricane Matthew passes through Haiti.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trees sway with the wind as Hurricane Matthew passes through Haiti.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andres Martinez Casares/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hurricanes draw their energy from the ocean, which is currently acting like a sponge for the extra heat accumulating in the atmosphere due to human activity. Warming is thereby supercharging hurricane wind speed, with increased moisture delivering buckets of extra rain to affected areas. Parts of Haiti are expected to get 3ft of rainfall from Hurricane Matthew.</p> <p>Some <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2646.epdf\">studies</a> have found that while the number of hurricanes may dip slightly in the future, the most destructive events will actually increase.</p> <p>\u201cThere will be subtleties with hurricane frequency \u2013 it\u2019s likely the most intense ones will increase, while it\u2019s unclear what the weak or moderate ones will do,\u201d said James Done, a project scientist and Willis fellow at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research.</p> <p>\u201cThe message is that hurricanes that do occur in the future, the major ones, will be stronger. Category four and five hurricanes could double or triple in the coming decades.\u201d</p> <p>But while the wind speed may be climbing, it won\u2019t, on its own, prove the greatest killer. The seas are rising at their <a href=\"http://www.climatecentral.org/news/study-reveals-acceleration-of-sea-level-rise-20055\">fastest rate in 2,800 years</a>, with water <a href=\"http://www.climatecentral.org/news/rapid-ocean-warming-making-floods-worse-19955\">disproportionately piling up</a> on the east coast of the US. Storm surges and flooding caused by hurricanes will be fueled by this heightened sea level, posing a growing threat to life and limb.</p> <p>\u201cStorm surges and flooding are big killers, so this is a big worry,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cIf <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hurricane-sandy\">Hurricane Sandy</a> occurred 100 years earlier it may not have flooded lower Manhattan because the sea was about 1ft lower in 1912. </p> <p>\u201cWe expect another 3ft in sea level rise by the end of the century, so we should expect steadily increase damage.

  "<p>As we close out a summer marked by uncertainty in news and events, one trend for which analysts voice increasing certainty is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/03/doe-charts-show-why-climate-doom-and-gloom-isnt-needed\">the accelerating pace of the clean-energy transformation</a> reshaping how the world generates electricity. </p> <p>With increasing speed, global energy markets are turning away from fossil fuels and towards wind and other renewable sources, not just because they\u2019re <em>clean</em> but because they\u2019re <em>cheaper, more competitive</em> energy choices and offer a level of long-term <em>certainty</em> more price-volatile fossil fuels just can\u2019t match. </p> <p>In fact, by 2030 clean energy is expected to overtake fossil fuels and become the largest source in global electricity production \u2014 and wind power is forecast to lead the way to meet the surging demand for renewables. In its <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/press-releases/coal-and-gas-to-stay-cheap-but-renewables-still-win-race-on-costs/\">2016 Outlook</a>, Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) projects: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>a fundamental transformation of the world electricity system over coming decades towards renewable sources.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>From forecast data to market demand, it\u2019s clear the future belongs to wind and other clean energies.</p> <p>In the top energy markets on six continents, wind is now the cheapest or largest source of newly installed power and gaining share. In 2015, the wind industry crossed the <a href=\"http://www.gwec.net/global-figures/wind-energy-global-status/\">60 gigawatt</a> (GW) mark for the first time and reached an unprecedented 63 GW installed globally. <br></p> <p>The bottom line: wind is winning. Not just in forecasts, but in today\u2019s global marketplace. <br></p> <p>Wind power installations are projected to continue this trend, more than doubling in developing countries and increasing by one-third in developed countries by 2030. As wind energy costs continue to drop, the primary drivers for clean energy are expected to include replacement of existing generating capacity \u2013 fossil fuel or nuclear \u2013 because they simply no longer make economic sense; further growth in global electricity demand; long-term policy stability such as that provided by the production tax credit in the U.S.; and nation-specific targets driven by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/dec/14/the-paris-agreement-signals-that-deniers-have-lost-the-climate-wars\">the Paris Climate Agreement</a>.</p> <p>Developing markets in particular have an opportunity to leapfrog older energy sources and meet new electricity demand by using wind power that is cleaner and cheaper than fossil fuels. One example is the Lake Turkana wind project in Kenya, where Vestas supplies wind turbines and Google will be a key investor. Upon completion, it will supply 310 megawatts of clean power, account for some 15% of the country\u2019s electricity consumption, and power Kenya\u2019s future growth more cheaply and cleanly than traditional fuels.</p> <p>While the present and the future look bright for renewables, pushing their energy costs even lower remains key for accelerating the transition to a clean energy mix globally. BNEF reports that onshore wind\u2019s costs are expected to drop 23\u201336% globally by 2030, but Vestas is committed to driving down the levelized cost of wind energy even further. </p> <p>To achieve this, we are leading the industry with investments in research and development and our smart data capabilities to help customers lower their cost of energy, increase their annual energy production, and strengthen their business case. With an unrivaled data pool from the industry\u2019s largest installed base of wind turbines as well as meteorological reporting from around the world, we are constantly improving every aspect of the business \u2014 from product design and testing, siting and manufacturing, to operations and maintenance. </p> <p>With this kind of constant innovation and technological advancement driving down the cost of energy, wind is well-positioned to keep its lead as the preferred renewable energy choice. And clean power will continue leading the global transformation away from traditional energy sources. <br></p> <p>Indeed, the future belongs to clean energy, and the world\u2019s new clean-energy economy looks strong.</p> <p><em>Anders Runevad is CEO and Group President of Vestas Wind Systems A/S, the global leader in wind energy.</em></p>",
  "<p>A European trio of chemists have won the Nobel prize in chemistry for developing \u201cnano-machines\u201d, an advance that paved the way for the world\u2019s first smart materials.</p> <p>Sir Fraser Stoddart, from Scotland, Bernard Feringa, from the Netherlands, and Jean-Pierre Sauvage, from France, will share the 8m Swedish kronor (\u00a3718,000) prize announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm today.</p> <p>The Nobel committee described the tools developed by the chemists as the \u201cworld\u2019s smallest machines\u201d. The technology is already being used to create medical micro-robots and self-healing materials that can repair themselves without human intervention.</p> <p>In living organisms, cells work as molecular machines to power our organs, regulate temperature and repair damage. The Nobel trio were among the first to replicate this kind of function in synthetic molecules, by working out how to convert chemical energy into mechanical motion.</p> <p>This allowed them to construct molecular devices a thousand times smaller than the width of a human hair, including switches, motors, shuttles and even something resembling a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15637867\">motorcar</a>.</p> <p>The advances have allowed scientists to develop materials that will reconfigure and adapt by themselves depending on their environment - for instance contracting with heat, or opening up to deliver drugs when they arrive at a target site in the body.</p> <p>In an interview following the announcement, Feringa said that winning the prize had been \u201csuch a great surprise. I\u2019m so honoured and also emotional about it,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/live/2016/oct/05/nobel-prize-in-chemistry-2016-to-be-announced-live\">Jean Pierre Sauvage, Sir Fraser Stoddart and Bernard Feringa win Nobel prize in chemistry - live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He added that it had also been a shock when he succeeded in developing the first function: he \u201ccould hardly believe it worked\u201d. </p> <p>G\u00f6ran Hansson, secretary general of the Swedish Academy of Sciences, said: \u201cThe laureates have opened this entire field of molecular machinery. They have shown it is possible to make a machine at the molecular scale.\u201d</p> <p>The Nobel committee compared the trio\u2019s breakthrough to the first crude electric motors in the 1830s, when scientists were unaware that spinning cranks and wheels would eventually lead to electric trains, washing machines, fans and food processors.</p> <p>Mark Miodownik, professor of materials and society at the University College London, said that the advent of nano-machines could transform the very fabric of cities. </p> <p>\u201cIf you want infrastructure that looks after itself - and I think we do - I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re going to be moving towards self-healing systems,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have plastic pipes that can repair themselves or a bridge that when it gets cracked has these machines that rebuild the bridge at a microscopic scale. It\u2019s just beginning. The potential is really immense.\u201d</p> <p>Prince Charles famously raised the spectre of a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/may/01/thisweekssciencequestions.robots\">grey goo</a>\u201d catastrophe in which the types of micro-machines first designed by the laureates replicate and devour the planet. However, Feringa told the Stockholm press conference that he didn\u2019t have apocalyptic nightmares about his inventions. \u201cWe have to think about how we can handle these things safely,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not so worried about that ... We will have the opportunity to build in safety devices if that is needed.\u201d</p> <p>Sauvage, professor emeritus at the University of Strasbourg, made the first step towards a molecular machine in the 1980s, when he succeeded in linking two ring-shaped molecules together paper-chain style, and later showed one ring structure could rotate freely relative to the other.</p> <p>Speaking to the French TV channel iTele this morning, Sauvage said: \u201cI have won many prizes, but the Nobel prize is something very special, it\u2019s the most prestigious prize, the one most scientists don\u2019t even dare to dream of in their wildest dreams.\u201d</p> <p>In the 1990s, Stoddart, who is based at Northwestern University, Illinois, built the first molecular wheel - a free-moving ring structure on an axle that was later used to develop a molecular muscle and an abacus that could act as a computer chip. Feringa, who works at the University of Groningen pioneered the nano-motor, first showing that a molecular rotor blade could be made to spin continually in the same direction. He later put four of these together to make a car smaller than the width of a human hair that could \u201cdrive\u201d across a surface.</p> <p>Stoddart\u2019s daughter, Alison, who is chief editor of the journal Nature Reviews Materials, said her father had always been driven and passionate when it came to his research. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a particularly trendy field of chemistry many decades ago but my Dad stuck at it,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cI remember when I was a kid, he came home from a trip to Stockholm with a chocolate Nobel prize.

They are on the frontline in the fight against climate change, yet they often lack the finance and knowledge to withstand its effects. This can prove devastating to their livelihoods.</p> <p>So what can be done to address this poverty imbalance and empower smallholder farmers? This was the question posed at a recent Guardian Sustainable Business seminar, supported by social impact investor Oikocredit and chaired by broadcaster and Guardian journalist Lucy Siegle. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/27/coffee-climate-change-supply-chain-risk-smallholders-fairtrade-tech\">Coffee and climate change: what you need to know</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lebi Hudson, general manager at the Rungwe Smallholders Tea Association in Tanzania, said climate change is already having a direct impact on the association\u2019s 15,000 members. Growers have experienced reduced yields in recent years due to extreme weather, including prolonged droughts. </p> <p>The impacts extend to the wider community, too, he said, with young people in particular seeing farming as an unattractive prospect and migrating to urban areas. For smallholders, \u201ccrisis is a constant way of life\u201d, said Hudson, but climate change presents a more extreme challenge than any previous situation, he added.</p> <h2>Financial aid to combat climate change</h2> <p>What it boils down to is farmers managing risk,said Paul Steele, chief economist at the International Institute for Environment and Development. \u201cThe issue is whether climate change is such a huge risk that they can\u2019t recover from it and need outside support from governments and other agencies.\u201d</p> <p>With insufficient international aid for smallholders, the need for investment is clear, said Steele. And with the <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld\" rel=\"nofollow\">UN calling for collective action to end poverty by 2030</a>, the need to support rural communities is increasingly pressing.</p> <p>But who will provide the funds?

Rubio said climate change had delivered a \u201creal wake-up call\u201d for Oikocredit, which has seen its coffee portfolio drop by 20% in the past three years.</p> <h2>Sourcing crops from smallholders</h2> <p>Urvi Kelkar, livelihoods and economic impact manager at multinational beverage company SABMiller, said her company was also facing immediate challenges as a result of climate change. \u201cDeclining yields are a threat to security of supply,\u201d she said, referring to the fact that SABMiller sources many agricultural crops from developing countries.</p> <p>Despite the challenges, Kelkar said sourcing from smallholders in Africa was a \u201cstrategic priority\u201d for SABMiller. The company claims it seeks to build inclusive supply chains, where it sources raw materials from smallholders, with the aim of improving incomes and livelihoods, as well as contributing to the host country\u2019s economic growth.</p> <p>SABMiller has increased its competitiveness in the Ugandan beer market by developing an affordable lager through its subsidiary, Nile Breweries. Eagle Lager is made from sorghum, a cereal grain sourced from smallholder farmers. Some 20,000 smallholders have earned $15m (\u00a311.5m) from Eagle Lager, which has also generated $70m for the Ugandan government. </p> <p>Hudson also highlighted the opportunities for smallholders in supplying domestic markets, referring to the World Bank\u2019s <a href=\"http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTAFRICA/Resources/Africa-Can-Feed-Africa-Report.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Africa Can Help Feed Africa report</a> (pdf), which suggests the continent could generate an additional $20bn annually if African leaders remove cross-border food trade restrictions.</p> <p>\u201cSmallholders are directly contributing to food security,\u201d he said, explaining that his members have diversified by growing potatoes and bananas, with approximately half of their bananas destined for Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"GSB tweet\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt; &lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Perhaps surprisingly, 90% of Kenya's horticulture is consumed domestically, says Paul Steele from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/IIED&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;@IIED&lt;/a&gt;.

For example, Caf\u00e9direct, which Oikocredit invests in, is helping 6,600 coffee smallholders plant trees in the Peruvian region of Piura. The initiative contributes to reforestation, which earns the farmers additional income through carbon credits.</p> <p>In east Africa, a project funded by Caf\u00e9direct aims to help empower female farmers, who stand to improve their yields by up to 30% by having access to the same knowledge and inputs as their male counterparts. But, as Hudson pointed out, there are wider cultural barriers that need to be addressed. \u201cIn some farming communities, women aren\u2019t allowed to speak in front of men. [Women] have to be able to make decisions, too,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Partnering with a range of different stakeholders is fundamental to supporting the developing world\u2019s farmers, said Rubio. Oikocredit is working with technology providers such as Technoserve to help farmers monitor crop performance (which is important for gaining sustainability certifications), as well as financial literacy trainers. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/23/climate-change-india-salt-farmers-gujarat-solar-loans\">Farming on the edge: the Indian salt producers coping with 48C heat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kelkar said partnerships and collaboration have been critical for SABMiller as the company has developed new supply chains with smallholders.

  "<p>There is <a href=\"http://www.developmentprogress.org/10things\">a lot to celebrate in international development</a>. Despite what can sometimes feel like an overwhelming number of bad news stories, incredible progress has been made. Over the past quarter of a century, more than 1 billion people were lifted out of extreme poverty, 137 million additional children were enrolled in primary school, and in the last 15 years alone, some 59 million deaths from diseases like malaria and tuberculosis were averted. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/\">millennium development goals</a> (MDGs) played a role in these achievements. Their successor, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/ng-interactive/2015/jan/19/sustainable-development-goals-changing-world-17-steps-interactive\">sustainable development goals (SDGs)</a>, comprised of 17 goals and 169 targets, has the potential to accelerate progress across an even broader range of issues.</p> <p>However, in order to reach the new goals by 2030, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/11/global-goals-sustainable-development-act-fast-or-risk-leaving-the-poorest-behind\">we need to act now</a>. Without early action there is risk of leaving people behind and failing to achieve certain goals altogether. A closer look at trends across the range of issues \u2013 both globally and by region \u2013 reveals just how much more effort is needed. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.developmentprogress.org/publication/projecting-progress-reaching-sdgs-2030\">Our research</a> shows that without increased effort, none of the goals will be met for all people everywhere, although progress on some issues and for some people will inevitably move faster than others. </p> <p>Globally, projections show that ending extreme poverty, sustaining economic growth in least-developed countries and halting deforestation will all get more than halfway toward selected targets by 2030 if current trends continue. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jul/20/we-must-focus-on-the-un-goals-that-are-the-best-value-for-money\">We must focus on the UN goals that are the best value for money</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For <a href=\"http://www.developmentprogress.org/SDG-Africa-scorecard\">Africa</a>, strengthening domestic resource mobilisation is also set to do well. <a href=\"http://www.developmentprogress.org/SDG-Asia-Scorecard\">Asia</a> will see additional likely progress in improving access to sanitation and expanding energy access. In <a href=\"http://www.developmentprogress.org/SDG-LatinAmerica-Scorecard\">Latin America</a>, if present trends continue, reductions in inequality will count as some of the most impressive globally.</p> <p>A large number of other goals are heading in the right direction, yet they would need to speed up by several multiples of current rates in order to reach SDG targets. This includes the <a href=\"http://www.developmentprogress.org/blog/2015/09/17/millennium-development-goals-success-stories-and-%E2%80%98unfinished-business%E2%80%99\">\u2018unfinished business\u2019 of the MDGs</a> in areas such as hunger, health, education, sanitation and gender. Ambitious efforts are unquestionably needed here.</p> <p>Most worryingly, however, are a group of SDG targets that require outright reversals in their trajectories. Based on analysis we conducted, there are <a href=\"http://www.developmentprogress.org/publication/projecting-progress-reaching-sdgs-2030\">five targets needing complete turnaround</a>: reducing inequality, limiting slum populations, reducing waste, combating climate change and protecting marine environments.</p> <h2>Reduce income inequality - target 10.1</h2> <p>Income inequality is set to worsen globally if current trends continue. Four out of five people live in countries where the bottom 40% has experienced slower growth than the average. Globally, since 2000, the bottom 40% has grown around half a percentage point slower than the average rate of growth annually.</p> <h2>Reduce slum populations - target 11.1</h2> <p>The number of people living in slums continues to rise, if the numbers follow their current course they are predicted to rise from 850 million today to over 1 billion people by 2030. The vast majority of this increase is due to take place in sub-Saharan Africa, where slum populations will almost double.</p> <h2>Reduce waste - target 12.5</h2> <p>Projections show that the total amount of solid waste generated globally will almost double from 3.5 million tonnes a day in 2010 to 6.1 million in 2025. Projected growth is mainly driven by emerging market economies in east and south Asia where waste generation is forecast to triple, and other developing countries where it is projected to double. This of course is on top of what is already quite a high level per capita in OECD countries.</p> <h2>Combat climate change - target 13.2 </h2> <p>While this target does not refer to a quantifiable indicator, reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions is a useful proxy. Significant growth of greenhouse gases is projected to occur in emerging markets, on top of already high levels in OECD countries. These emissions need to be reduced in order for the world to be able to address climate change effectively.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c12de132b9eca4992fea53df8e2a9a53827540d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c12de132b9eca4992fea53df8e2a9a53827540d6/0_0_2800_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Great Barrier Reef in Australia is in danger of destruction.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Great Barrier Reef in Australia is in danger of destruction.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Mccormick/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Protect marine environments - target 14.2 </h2> <p>Projections show that 90% of reefs will be under threat by 2030, up from a starting point of 75% in 2007. While harmful coastal practices like overfishing are of current concern, part of the increased threat is due to anticipated thermal stress and acidification linked to carbon emissions.</p> <p>These turnaround targets, cutting across issues of inequality and environment, are central to the overall development agenda. They go beyond the traditional MDG focus on social sectors and remind us that SDG commitments demand a broader and more ambitious approach. </p> <p>Moreover, developed countries are set to play a significant role in any success or failure to achieve gains in these areas. More attention is needed to these about-turns if there is any hope of attainment of the SDG agenda. </p> <p><em>Susan Nicolai is head of <a href=\"http://www.developmentprogress.org/\">Development Progress</a> at the Overseas Development Institute.

  "<p>Google has just launched a new smartphone, the Pixel, and for the first time this isn\u2019t just another Android smartphone \u2013 it\u2019s a Google phone. The company is finally launching a direct assault on its biggest rival: Apple.<br></p> <p>For years Google has been involved in a proxy war with the iPhone maker. It makes a rival operating system, Android, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/29/google-motorola-lenovo-sale\">buys up patents</a> and it <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-google-settlement-idUSBREA4F0S020140517\">goes to court to protect them</a>. </p> <p>But until now it hasn\u2019t truly engaged in hardware itself. It licenses Android for others to use \u2013 and while that has made the operating system the world\u2019s most popular on mobile, ahead of iOS, with over 1.4bn devices active a month, it\u2019s not without downsides. </p> <p>While there is a strength in the sheer number of different manufacturers using Android, filling almost any market niche, that multi-manufacturer strategy has also caused problems for the state of Android. </p> <p>Unlike iOS devices, most Android phones do not receive updates for much longer than a year. Some do get monthly security updates, but others get Android version updates sometimes years after Google releases new versions, creating so-called fragmentation that makes it harder to develop apps and services.</p> <p>This fragmentation is a problem. Francisco Jeronimo, market research firm IDC\u2019s research director for European mobile devices, says: \u201cMany people care about updates. They recognise that getting the latest update is about getting something better, unless they\u2019ve got an old phone. But it\u2019s about how easy it is to do. Going online and finding an update is something most will not do. If you present it as a notification, as Apple does, then most will jump on board.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ac1c4e4307bc6c113d9f2ce464f4e6f5c1cc03f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ac1c4e4307bc6c113d9f2ce464f4e6f5c1cc03f/0_0_2100_1260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google Nexus 5X Nexus 6P\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Google\u2019s last attempt at a smartphone, the Nexus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Google</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The only Android devices to get similar updates to Apple\u2019s worldwide pushing out of iOS updates are Google\u2019s Nexus devices, which until now have been made in partnership with a big smartphone manufacturer. LG, Huawei, Samsung and HTC have all made Nexus devices with Google, but these differ from the Pixel phones \u2013 they haven\u2019t been sold as the flagship Android device, but more as developer curiosities, selling on average around 3m devices each time.</p> <p>According to data from IDC, Google and its Nexus partners have only sold around 23m in total since 2010, making them only 0.2% of the total shipments of smartphones in that period. A curio, more than a mainstream smartphone. Samsung, on the other hand, has sold a total of 520m Samsung S models over the years, while Apple has sold 1bn iPhones.</p> <p>Samsung has therefore been left as the premium Android champion, particularly as smaller players including HTC, Sony and LG have struggled. Samsung and Apple are currently locked in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/17/samsung-apple-smartphone-ios-android\">war for the so-called floating voter</a>: the 20% of users that ever actually switch platforms.</p> <p>Now Google has decided to enter that battle and compete with Apple directly. No more proxies, no more relying on others to champion its mobile operating system or to make them in a partnership, and it will provide direct updates to devices in the same way Apple does. The Pixel is a Google phone, and a statement of intent.</p> <p>This moment will reveal a lot about the strength of Google\u2019s brand. Marc Allera, chief executive of EE, Google\u2019s exclusive network partner in the UK, says: \u201cGoogle has long been known as an innovative tech brand and consumers can expect it to now become a new and exciting player within mobile following this move.\u201d</p> <p>For Google, the Pixel is about putting its brand and services \u2013 the Google Assistant \u2013 front and centre. Jeronimo says: \u201cWith the Nexus, Google attempted to bring the best device running the latest version of Android, but couldn\u2019t give priority to one of the tier two manufacturers that were interested in making it when you have companies like Samsung and Huawei leading the market. It meant Google struggled to differentiate with its own device when its partners were already making very good devices that were good value.\u201d</p> <p>The benefits of having one company design hardware and software cannot be overlooked. That may also have an impact on other Android manufacturers who rely on Google for software.</p> <p>Despite Google making an explicit play for iPhone users with a data import tool available for first time to switchers, the likelihood of Google enticing a serious number of users to move over immediately is small. In reality, the Pixel\u2019s first users are likely to be current Android users, those with phones from HTC, Sony, LG, Samsung and Huawei.</p> <p>Google\u2019s vice president of global operations and the Google Store, Ana Corrales says the Pixel is a continuation of Google giving customers and users choice. \u201cWe\u2019re not necessarily trying to compete against Apple. We\u2019re just trying to provide choice at every level and continue our Android strategy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c689db24a257cfa0822211483fb17e8ff2a2017\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c689db24a257cfa0822211483fb17e8ff2a2017/0_86_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google Pixel back of phone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If users buy into the idea of a Google phone, then Google knows that its brand and services are a key attractor in a out in a competitive market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Risberg/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How third-party manufacturers react will be interesting. Samsung has been developing its own Tizen operating system for several years, and has both smartphones and smartwatches running it currently in the market. It\u2019s unlikely Samsung will simply ditch Android in the near term, but should it decide to divert resources to alternative operation systems, Android\u2019s marketshare could fall.</p> <p>Jeronimo says: \u201cNow is the time for Google to reset, start from scratch and deliver on the promise of the Nexus, which it never did. It needs to show the market what can be done with Android, not just with hardware but with software, so that third-party manufactures can take those features and adapt them, generating a stronger relationship with Google.\u201d</p> <p>So the Pixel phone becomes a referendum on Google: If users buy into the idea of a Google phone, then Google knows that its brand and its services are a key attractor in a like-for-like shoot out in a high competitive market. Should it fail to sell, Google could end up with a crisis over brand and users that affects more than simply a smartphone.</p> <p>Either way, Google launching a smartphone is seen as a good thing by industry watchers, regardless of how Google\u2019s sales battle with Apple goes.</p> <p>\u201cIt keeps people interested in Android and it raises awareness that Google is not just developing one version of Android after the other without trying to be innovative,\u201d says Jeronimo. \u201cAn announcement like this is important to the market if it brings something different and innovative, something users can expect to use over the next year.\u201d</p>",

The players and other passengers were roused from their beds, lifeboats were manned and the group was towed to the village of Villagarc\u00eda by local fishermen.</p> <p>The following day a passing liner bound for the Canaries picked up the 20-strong Rovers squad and were, according to Rovers player Tom Jennings, invited to eat at the captain\u2019s table because of their chivalrous behaviour during the rain-swept abandoning of the Highland Loch. A few days later they were safely deposited at their destination \u2013 and the traumatic journey did not seem to adversely effect the players.

As an environmental journalist, I sometimes feel it\u2019s my job to simply document the decline of life on planet Earth. The word \u2018depressing\u2019 doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it. </p> <p>For many of us \u2013 myself included some days \u2013 the desperate state of our environment leaves us numb with sadness and, frankly, lost in hopelessness. We don\u2019t act, because we don\u2019t know what to do; we don\u2019t act, because there\u2019s only so much negativity we can swallow before we throw up our hands and go back to playing Pokemon Go. Without any dose of hope, we feel ourselves succumbing to despair. </p> <h2>Optimism summit</h2> <p>There may be a cure coming, however. As I write this, there is a small but growing movement within conservation to bring back a little optimism, a little hope, a little wonder into what has become a decidedly bleak calling. This week, the Zoological Society of London and Oxford University announced a <a href=\"https://www.conservationoptimism.org/\">Conservation Optimism Summit</a> for 2017 in London, culminating in a big Earth Day public celebration focused on the world\u2019s youth. </p> <p>For the first time, the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/conservationoptimism\">summit</a> will see conservationists from around the world gather to discuss how to change the culture of despair in conservation and share upbeat stories about what\u2019s working from the Philippines to Belize to the hedgeros of the UK. </p> <p>The concern that conservation, and environmentalism for that matter, has become drowned in a culture of negativity has been simmering for awhile now. A <a href=\"http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/60/8/626.short\">paper</a> in 2010 identified a \u201cculture of hopelessness\u201d in conservation biology, which the authors feared would make it harder for conservation to succeed. They <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2014/08/why-conservationists-need-a-little-hope-saving-themselves-from-becoming-the-most-depressing-scientists-on-the-planet/\">argued eloquently</a> that a glass-half-empty outlook would make it difficult to attract young peopleto conservation careers. They also warned that the constant drip-drip-drip of despair would only succeed in bringing in people who already have a negative view of the world, creating a feedback loop of despairism. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b256d21efa2d179dbae10c262af2e533f632224\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b256d21efa2d179dbae10c262af2e533f632224/0_155_2000_1201/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Kihansi spray toad was saved by conservationists.

Apathy is often the result of gloomy messaging. This has been <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/doom-and-gloom-wont-do-it-heres-how-to-sell-the-climate-change-message-31999\">extensively studied</a> in regards to climate change, but next year\u2019s summit will be the first time it\u2019s addressed for conservation in such a formal and public setting. If conservationists aren\u2019t able to turn around the narrative, they fear they will continue to lose public interest, support, and, in the long run, the battle to preserve life on Earth.<br></p> <h2>Understandable gloom-and-doom <br></h2> <p>But it will be a delicate dance to inject optimism without undercutting the fact that biodiversity and bioabundance around the world are in deep trouble. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We already know that conservation works. In fact it works really well. We just need a lot more of it.</p> <footer> <cite>Jeremy Hance</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say we\u2019ve mucked up our world. The climate is rapidly warming while our oceans are being emptied and acidified. We are still cutting down forests as if they have no value beyond chopsticks and office paper, while many of the world\u2019s habitats have simply been silenced by over-hunting, indiscriminate trapping, and relentless killing. Meanwhile, there are 7-plus billion Homo sapiens \u2013 and we all require food, clothing and shelter, not to mention cars, air conditioners and smart phones. All this means we are facing the prospect of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2015/oct/20/the-four-horsemen-of-the-sixth-mass-extinction\">mass extinction</a> not seen since the comet that took out the dinosaurs.</p> <p>But there are other stories in conservation. Without the passion of generations of conservationists, we would very likely live in a world today without bison, rhinos, big cats or whales. There would be few, if any, bald eagles left. There would be zero California condors. Elephants might only be in zoos. There would never have been any Prezwalski\u2019s horses or Kihansi spray toads to re-release back into the wild. </p> <p>Without hard-working conservationists, we would live in a world lacking national parks and other protected areas. Imagine that: how many more species would be extinct? How many more wildernesses would have been razed? The fact that around 15% of our land has been set aside as protected or indigenous areas is something worthy of unbridled celebration. <br></p> <h2>The long game<br></h2> <p>Part of what makes optimism in conservation so challenging is the global trend of decline in wildlife, but it\u2019s also that success stories are often decades, if not generations, in the making. <br></p> <p>The people who first started caring for the last dozen European Bison could only have faith that their efforts could one day lead to a population of some 3,000 free-roaming individuals in nine countries. The Greenpeace activists who passionately fought for the end of whaling could only dream of humpback whales rebounding to a population 80,000-strong. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1c9a85f67498257cf850c12fa4a00ae7eac7938\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1c9a85f67498257cf850c12fa4a00ae7eac7938/0_138_5121_3071/1000.jpg\" alt=\"If activists hadn\u2019t succeeded in ending whaling, many species would likely be extinct today.

In fact it works really well. We just need a lot more of it \u2013 and we need faith in the long term instead of listening only to naysayers who say \u2018we\u2019re all screwed.\u2019 </p> <h2>And what about my role in this?</h2> <p>Journalists like myself are hardly blameless for the largely negative portrayal of conservation today. On the one hand, we know that bad news often gets more attention \u2013 i.e., eyeballs \u2013 than happy stories. And journalism today is measured by clicks. <br></p> <p>But even more so, journalists are trained to point out what\u2019s wrong in world. That\u2019s our job: to uncover things that aren\u2019t working and put them in front of the public. Journalists are not trained to fix problems \u2013 believe me \u2013 but to communicate them to those who could do something about them. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2015/apr/21/rotoroa-new-zealand-birds-wildlife-rewilding\">Conservationists turn tiny New Zealand island into bold wildlife experiment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But covering environmental stories, especially those with global impact, only exacerbates our journalistic penchant for focusing on the dire. The stakes of issues like climate change and ocean acidification are so high that it\u2019s almost impossible to write about them without sounding apocalyptic. Moreover, let\u2019s be honest, environmental issues rarely show up on your Facebook or Twitter trending feeds, which means environmental journalists struggle to find ways to get people to notice. If I could drop celebrity names into every headline, I would: <em>Vaquita almost extinct, proclaim Beyonce, Brad Pitt and Darth Vader</em>.</p> <p>In lieu of such desperation, I have to constantly ask myself: okay how do I get the public to notice this issue? And believe me I\u2019ve tried many strategies: from oh-my-god-this-is-bad, to look-how-cute-this-animal-is, to isn\u2019t-nature-freaking-awesome?, to seriously-wake-up-people! <br></p> <p>But here\u2019s my pledge to you: over the next 12 months I promise to amp up my coverage of what\u2019s working in conservation, to find some little-reported stories of comeback species. This doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll ignore the bad stories by any means, but I\u2019ll try to achieve a better balance on this blog. </p> <p>After all, conservation is ultimately an act of hope. It\u2019s a belief that actions taken today will bear fruit long in the future and that people, one day, will grow a little wiser. It\u2019s the faith that billions of humans could, one day, cohabitate a planet with multitudes of wild tigers, flocks of orange-bellied parrots and herds of forest elephants. But we won\u2019t get there without hope. <br></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 October 2016 to correct the location of the 2017 Conservation Optimism Summit.</p>",

Was he opposed to every word coming out of Tim Kaine\u2019s mouth? Or was he just dismayed at his own situation?</p> <p>It\u2019s not easy campaigning as Donald Trump\u2019s running mate. You can\u2019t admit the obvious: that your presidential candidate is hiding his tax returns, stoking racism and spooking allies around the world. </p> <p>So you have to deny Trump\u2019s quotes, or accuse your opponent of hurling insults. But most of all, you have to look affable while your running mate looked irascible.</p> <p>In that sense, Pence succeeded in beating his boss.

Like two insurance salesmen getting drunk at their annual trade conference, Kaine and Pence were just trying too hard.</p> <p>Kaine tried to beat Pence into submission with pesky facts.

While Pence kept his cool, Kaine tried to imitate Joe Biden\u2019s interruption-heavy performance against Paul Ryan in 2012 \u2013 without half his charisma. Kaine\u2019s biggest downfall, though, may not have been about tone. </p> <p>Compared to Kaine, Pence told a compelling \u2013 if terrifyingly cynical and blatantly false \u2013 story of a country that has lost its way, and how he and Trump intend to restore it. \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d might be one of the best political slogans of the past decade. But Trump owes its creation to people such as Margaret Thatcher and Reagan, who worked to spread the neoliberal gospel that\u2019s now seeped into both parties. That evangelizing project has been incredibly successful, with each candidate airing concerns about government spending, personal responsibility and the limits of American coffers.</p> <p>There were glaring omissions tonight, too. Despite a series of increasingly brutal projections about the likelihood of catastrophic global warming, talk of climate change was limited to a few coded words at the debate\u2019s start, like the mythical \u201cwar on coal\u201d and \u201cclean energy jobs of tomorrow.\u201d A cringe-worthy conversation about criminal justice reform somehow managed not to breach mass incarceration. And a brief discussion of reproductive rights \u2013 one that should have been up top given Pence\u2019s deplorable record on the issue \u2013 got shunted to the very end.</p> <p>The Democratic party has spent the past several decades pivoting around terms of debate set by the right. Kaine\u2019s loss in tonight\u2019s debate showed just how much work the Democrats \u2013 and the social movements pushing them \u2013 need to do to recenter the conversation. </p> <p>More than the \u201cintelligence surge\u201d Kaine and Clinton keep pushing, the Democratic party needs a surge in imagination, to do more than play defense against attacks from across the aisle and propose transformative solutions, in line with the pain many Americans today are facing.

Neither disappointed. </p> <p>At the start, when asked what made him a good candidate for the vice-presidency, Kaine faltered. Looking down, he rushed a heavily scripted first answer, told through the filter of Clinton\u2019s point of view, that took too long and strained to connect back to the question. Kaine directed his entire answer off camera, which greatly reduced his engagement with the television audience. </p> <p>Pence restated Trump\u2019s conservative positions, doubling down on wealth and whiteness for the win. Pence tried to spin away from Kaine\u2019s points on policy, using plain speak \u2013 the common language of the Trump campaign. When Kaine pushed Pence on social security, all that Pence could offer was: \u201cThere they go again.

Let us not be fooled.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/04/vp-nominees-tim-kaine-mike-pence-catholic\">Kaine and Pence: two Catholic-inspired visions with little else in common</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><br></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamie-weinstein\">Jamie Weinstein:</a> Pence kept his cool \u2013 and won by a landslide<br></h2> <p>Kaine attempted to act like a bulldog Tuesday night but instead came across as a nipping chihuahua.</p> <p>The senator from Virginia entered the first and only vice-presidential debate intent on making the mild-mannered Pence defend his running mate\u2019s most outrageous statements. But unlike Trump, Pence apparently isn\u2019t prone to chasing shiny objects. <br></p> <p>Constantly interrupting Pence and speaking at a mile a minute, Kaine tried for the life of him to get Pence to discuss Trump\u2019s racist attack on Indiana Judge Gonzalo Curiel, Trump\u2019s proposal to ban Muslims, Trump\u2019s praise of Vladimir Putin, Trump\u2019s call to deport all illegal immigrants, and so on and so forth. Whatever the accuracy of Kaine\u2019s attacks on Trump \u2013 and make no mistake, they were often accurate \u2013 Kaine\u2019s style was excessive. By throwing out so many issues in one breath, he made his rhetorical assault hard for viewers to follow. He also made it easy for Pence to ignore him with a shake of the head \u2013 a nonverbal \u201cthere you go again\u201d.</p> <p>Kaine\u2019s constant \u201cI know it all\u201d interruptions might be considered the 2016 version of Al Gore\u2019s groans. It made him come across as a thoroughly unlikable figure. </p> <p>By contrast, Pence was calm and cool. He methodically hammered home the Trump campaign\u2019s positive themes \u2013 let\u2019s get America\u2019s economy moving again, let\u2019s put American workers first, let\u2019s bring back American jobs, let\u2019s project strength in the world, America needs change. </p> <p>Sure, these are broad themes, but presented in Pence\u2019s confident manner, they resonate. Like Kaine, Pence had his share of canned lines. Unlike Kaine, he was able to deliver them in a way that made them appear sincere and sometimes even heartfelt. Performance matters. </p> <p>Pence won the debate by a landslide, and it\u2019s hard to imagine there will be many in the media who will even attempt to claim otherwise. The only question is how his running mate\u2019s fragile ego will react when all those who panned his debate skills praise Pence\u2019s. <br></p>",
  "<p>The excitement around artificial intelligence (AI) has created a dynamic where perception and reality are at odds: everyone assumes that everyone else is already using it, yet relatively few people have personal experience with it, and it\u2019s almost certain that no one is using it very well.<br></p> <p>This is AI\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter\" rel=\"nofollow\">third cycle</a> in a long history of hype \u2013 the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_Conferences\" rel=\"nofollow\">first conference on AI</a> took place 60 years ago this year \u2013 but what is better described as \u201cmachine learning\u201d is still very young when it comes to how organisations implement it. While we all encounter machine learning whenever we use autocorrect, Siri, Spotify and Google, the vast majority of businesses are yet to grasp its promise, particularly when it comes to practically adding value in supporting internal decision making.<br></p> <p>Over the last few months I\u2019ve been asking a wide range of leaders of large and small companies how and why they are using machine learning within their organisations. By exposing the areas of confusion, concerns and different approaches business leaders are taking, these conversations highlight five interesting lessons. <br></p> <h2>Choose your question carefully</h2> <p>Far more important than the machine learning approach you take is the question you ask. Machine learning is not yet anywhere near \u201cartificial general intelligence\u201d \u2013 it remains a set of specialised tools, not a panacea. </p> <p>For Deep Knowledge Ventures, the Hong Kong-based venture firm that <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/vital-named-to-board-2014-5?IR=T#ixzz31dVwrSEo\" rel=\"nofollow\">added a machine learning algorithm</a> named <a href=\"http://aginganalytics.com/our-approach/\" rel=\"nofollow\">VITAL</a> to its board in 2014, it was about adding a tool to analyse market data around investment opportunities. For global professional service firms experimenting in this space, machine learning could allow deeper and faster document analysis. Energy companies want to make better use of production and transport data to make resourcing decisions while one defence contractor is looking for \u201cwiser\u201d analysis of stakeholder networks in conflict zones.</p> <p>While there is widespread fear that AI will be used to automate in ways that creates mass employment, the vast majority of firms I spoke to are, at least at this stage, experimenting with machine learning to augment rather than replace human decision making.</p> <p>It\u2019s therefore important to identify which processes and decisions could benefit from augmentation: is it about better contextual awareness or more efficient interrogation of proprietary data? Precise questions lead more easily to useful experimentation. </p> <h2>Manage your data better</h2> <p>Machine learning relies on data \u2013 whether big or small. If your decisions revolve around deeper or faster analysis of your own data, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll need to get that in order before you can do anything else. This could mean not just new databases and better data \u201chygiene\u201d, but new inputs, new workflows and new information <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)\" rel=\"nofollow\">ontologies</a>, all before you start to build the model that can take you towards recommendation or prediction to support decision making. Don\u2019t forget to double down on your cyber security strategy if data is now flowing to and from new places.</p> <h2>Invest in people</h2> <p>Data scientists are not cheap. <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/palo-alto-data-scientist-salary-SRCH_IL.0,9_IC1147434_KO10,24.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glassdoor</a> lists the average salary of a data scientist in Palo Alto, California, as $130,000 (\u00a3100,000). And though you may not think you are competing with Silicon Valley salaries for talent, <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/artificial-intelligence-experts-are-in-high-demand-1430472782\" rel=\"nofollow\">you are if you want great people</a>: a great data scientist can easily be 50 times more valuable than a competent one, which means that both hiring and retaining them can be pricey. </p> <p>You may opt to outsource many aspects of your machine learning, however, every company I spoke to, regardless of approach, said that machine learning had required a significant investment in their staff in terms of expanding both knowledge and skills. </p> <h2>The ecosystem is evolving rapidly</h2> <p>The latest rage is bots \u2013 application programming interfaces (APIs) that use machine learning to do specialised tasks such as process speech, assess text for sentiment or tag concepts. Bots can be seen as a small and, but <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/324013ce-7b57-11e6-ae24-f193b105145e?siteedition=intl\" rel=\"nofollow\">imperfect</a>, part of \u201cMachine learning as a service\u201d. If the creator of Siri is right, there will be an entire ecosystem of machine learning APIs that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/09/siri-creator-shows-off-first-public-demo-of-viv-the-intelligent-interface-for-everything/\" rel=\"nofollow\">write their own code to meet your needs</a>.</p> <p>Companies like Salesforce have also started to <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2016/09/introducing-salesforce-einstein.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">integrate machine learning into their platforms</a>, lowering the cost and friction of getting started. As the machine learning ecosystem evolves, companies will find interesting ways to combine in-house industry experience with a range of off-the-shelf tools and <a href=\"https://github.com/showcases/machine-learning\" rel=\"nofollow\">open source algorithms</a> to create highly-customised decision-support tools. </p> <h2>The values of algorithms matter</h2> <p>Technologies are not \u201cvalues-free\u201d \u2013 all the tools we design, including AI systems, have a series of values, biases and assumptions built into them by their creators and reflected by the data they interrogate. Systems that use machine learning to make decisions for us can reflect or reinforce <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37306828\" rel=\"nofollow\">gender</a>, <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2208240\" rel=\"nofollow\">racial</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/20/norwegian-editor-challenges-zuckerberg-to-discuss-censorship\">social</a> biases. Compounding this, the perceived complexity of machine learning means that when it fails there is little recognition of harm and no appeal for those affected, thanks to what <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdCJYsKlX_Y\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cathy O\u2019Neil</a> calls \u201cthe authority of the inscrutable\u201d. As we discussed during <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuOm5iisVwE\" rel=\"nofollow\">UCL School of Management</a> debate on AI on Tuesday night, human beings need to be firmly at the centre of all our technological systems. </p> <p>When our decisions are assisted by machine learning, the reasoning should be as transparent and verifiable as possible. For humans and intelligent machines to have a satisfying partnership, we need to ensure we learn from machines as much as they learn from us. </p> <p><em>Nicholas Davis is head of society and innovation and a member of the executive committee of the World Economic Forum.

  "<p>This summer, I have spent a lot of time thinking about popularising palaeontology. </p> <p>On the 16th of September, palaeontological museum curators, researchers, students, authors and performers packed up some of their fossil collections (and even a whole <a href=\"https://emeraldant.com/2016/05/02/the-iguanodon-restaurant-the-grand-opening/\">restaurant inside an <em tabindex=\"-1\">Iguanodon</em></a>) and descended upon Scarborough\u2019s Rotunda Museum for the <a href=\"http://www.yorkshirefossilfestival.co.uk/\">Yorkshire Fossil Festival</a>. The three-day festival was a chance for the public to get up close to fossils and for palaeontologists to enthuse, inspire and engage about evolution, extinction, anatomy and taxonomy. In the evenings it was a rare chance for palaeontologists from across the country to catch up, share news and there was a fair bit of geeking out. </p> <p>Two days before the Yorkshire Fossil Festival was the <a href=\"http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/history/eventrecords/2016-17/Popularizing-Palaeontology-Current-&amp;-Historical-Perspectives-.aspx\">Popularising Palaeontology</a> workshop at King\u2019s College London. This was a more formal meeting of curators, researchers, palaeo artists, authors, historians and journalists, who met to discuss the past, present and future of popularising palaeontology.</p> <p>As a museum professional, my interest lies in how we popularise palaeontology in museum spaces. Museums and their physical specimens still remain one of the prime gateways into communicating palaeontology to a broader audience. Talking to fellow palaeontologists, educators and members of the public, there are a number of threshold challenges in the public understanding of palaeontology that are enduring. </p> <p>One of the biggest problems is the dominating dinosaurs. Many museum visitors, young and old, assume that palaeontology is just dinosaurs. Every articulated skeleton in a museum must be a dinosaur and every museum must have a dinosaur. So pervasive is this idea, that natural history museum educators spend a lot of their time, telling visitors what isn\u2019t a dinosaur. Can you blame visitors for thinking every skeleton or fossil skeleton must be a dinosaur, however, when so many museum displays, <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/business-services/touring-exhibitions.html\">touring exhibitions</a>, popular palaeontological books, images in this article and museum shop merchandise focus on little else?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jun/01/britains-oldest-dinosaur-fossil-found-on-north-yorkshire-coast\">Britain's oldest dinosaur fossil found on North Yorkshire coast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another challenge is the idea that palaeontology, or at least interesting palaeontology, is something that we don\u2019t have in the UK. This does seem to vary regionally. At the Yorkshire Fossil Festival, people of all ages could recognise an ammonite and many had collected these fossils locally, even if they didn\u2019t know that ammonites were the shells of extinct cephalopod molluscs. In other parts of the country where fossil sites are a less obvious part of the local landscape, people are nearly always surprised to learn that mammoths, plesiosaurs, hippos and yes, even dinosaurs were stomping (and swimming around) in their neighbourhood millions of years ago. </p> <p>This is where the amazing range of the UK\u2019s palaeontological museums come in and not just the larger better known ones. Museums up and down the country are filled with local, national and international fossil collections but many of them are not widely known about. <br></p> <p>This isn\u2019t just a public perception issue either, many palaeontologist researchers are unaware of the UK\u2019s many museums, collections and important characters from history beyond the Natural History Museum London. For example, there\u2019s no mention of museums <em>at all</em> in the <a href=\"http://eurogeologists.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Geology-for-Society_English-Final.pdf\">2015 Geology for Society</a> report by the Geological Society and the European Federation of Geologists, despite museums and palaeontology being one of the key entry points into an interest in geology. </p> <p>Another common misconception encountered whilst doing outreach for museums, is the idea that museums are more than static display cases and hushed spaces. There\u2019s a pervasive notion that museums are treasure houses guarded by curators who go back into cupboard themselves at the end of the night and that collections definitely aren\u2019t for non-experts, let alone for handling or, dare it be suggested, for being interesting. This is a much bigger challenge that the entire museum sector is working to address. Fighting to maintain free entry and running large public programmes, isn\u2019t enough alone to encourage would-be visitors to step over the threshold of our intimidating public spaces. </p> <p>One of the best kept secrets about museums is that they are institutions for the public. Increasing accessibility is at the core of most modern museum strategies from outreach and public engagement through to using the latest technology to increase our visitor and user numbers. </p> <p>The perception that palaeontology happens elsewhere and not in the UK, couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Many aspects of palaeontology and the popularisation of palaeontology were pioneered in the UK, which has a geological as well as a historical richness exemplified by many UK museums and institutions.</p> <p>Below is an incomplete list, of some of the UK\u2019s palaeontological museums to hopefully signal boost the diversity and richness of collections and collectors. From national museums, local authority museums and universities, museums are more than just their collections, many have expert staff and active public programmes. The institutional websites are linked to where appropriate, although with rare exception few give a good indication of their galleries and displays or are any good in general (a blog post for another day). </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bristolmuseums.org.uk/bristol-museum-and-art-gallery/\">Bristol Museum and Art Gallery</a>.

  "<p>The announcement at this week\u2019s Tory party conference by the communities secretary Sajid Javid of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tories-pledge-five-billion-billion-housebuilding-a7342031.html\">a \u00a35bn boost to housebuilding</a> can be seen in part as a belated recognition of the explosion of housing insecurity in Tory heartlands \u2013 a crisis the prime minister has hinted at with her promise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/01/theresa-may-consider-living-rent-policy-linked-wage\">to help those families on low to middle incomes who are \u201cjust managing\u201d to get by</a>.</p> <p>However, if proof were needed that the problem of homelessness is no longer reserved for its metropolitan heartlands but has rippled out into the commuter cities and market towns of middle England, it is the housing crisis that exploded this summer in Peterborough, landing the city\u2019s Tory-controlled council with a potential \u00a31m bill for<a href=\"http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/our-region/peterborough/1m-hotel-bill-for-homeless-1-7592507\"> putting up homeless families in local Travelodge hotels</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/01/theresa-may-consider-living-rent-policy-linked-wage\">May is urged to consider policy of 'living rents' linked to wage levels</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In April, the city experienced an unexpected spike in homeless households. In a single month, 150 families were accepted as needing housing support\u2013 equivalent to more than a third of the total number who were rehoused in the whole of last year. A chronic shortage of temporary accommodation meant the council had nowhere to put them but the Travelodge. Currently, about 40-50 homeless families are resident in the city\u2019s three hotels at any one time, costing the council up to \u00a3588 a week per family, and they stay for an average of 20 nights.</p> <p>The local housing ecosystem, under so much pressure for so long, had, it seemed, finally broken down. Not enough new housing had been built in Peterborough in recent years. Social housing vacancies had practically dried up. Cuts to housing benefit, the closing of buy-to-let tax breaks, and the introduction of welfare reforms such as universal credit and the benefit cap had alienated private landlords, some of whom <a href=\"http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/our-region/peterborough/peterborough-landlords-side-with-council-over-mps-in-dispute-over-1-million-travelodge-bill-for-homeless-families-1-7607144\">said they would no longer rent to tenants on benefits</a> because they considered them too high risk.</p> <p>At the end of June, the number of Peterborough families unlawfully put up for longer than six weeks in bed and breakfast accommodation \u2013 a key indicator of a council\u2019s capacity to manage homelessness \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/statutory-homelessness-and-homelessness-prevention-and-relief-england-april-to-june-2016\">stood at 30</a>, one of the worst records on this measure in England. \u201cUltimately it is about supply and demand,\u201d says Adrian Chapman, Peterborough\u2019s director of adult services and communities, \u201cWe do not have enough suitably sized homes in either the private or social sector to meet demand.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b644383f691e69c700edc5b5c2856bdcaf45bece\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b644383f691e69c700edc5b5c2856bdcaf45bece/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside the demonstration mobile home.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside the demonstration mobile home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Importantly, Peterborough\u2019s problem is not one of rough sleeping. This exists, but official numbers are stable. What is pushing up homelessness rates in a growing, relatively affluent city, is the emergence of people with jobs who are evicted because they cannot afford to meet private-sector rents, or who cannot find an affordable place to move to after a tenancy ends. Says Chapman: \u201cWe are seeing more and more people who are working and who are coming to us for help. People who are employed but struggling, the working poor.\u201d</p> <p>The council is scrambling to acquire more temporary accommodation. It has arranged to lease 74 private rented homes, and is looking at renovating a disused sheltered housing scheme earmarked for demolition. But there is less confidence that the underlying causes of homelessness will go as quickly. As Irene Walsh, the council\u2019s cabinet member for communities and environment capital, told the Peterborough Telegraph: <a href=\"http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/our-region/peterborough/1m-hotel-bill-for-homeless-1-7592507\">\u201cI\u2019m very concerned we may not see an improvement in the near future\u201d.</a></p> <p>The city\u2019s Conservative leader, John Holdich, meanwhile, blamed the crisis squarely on the government. Angrily responding to accusations by the city\u2019s Tory MP, Stewart Jackson, that Peterborough\u2019s homelessness crisis was down to council mismanagement, Holdich highlighted the bedroom tax and universal credit as key drivers of the problem. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/our-region/peterborough/peterborough-landlords-side-with-council-over-mps-in-dispute-over-1-million-travelodge-bill-for-homeless-families-1-7607144\">One of these days our MP will accept some responsibility for the actions of his government which led to unintended consequences</a>,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Peterborough is not alone in unexpectedly struggling to cope with England\u2019s homelessness crisis. Last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/statutory-homelessness-and-homelessness-prevention-and-relief-england-april-to-june-2016\">official homelessness data</a> revealed that 6,520 households are living in B&amp;B accommodation in June 2016, up 16% on 2015. Picturesque Arun, on the Sussex coast, leafy South Buckinghamshire, and New Forest in Hampshire were among those district councils struggling to rehouse homeless people and which this summer breached the six-week limit for B&amp;B stays.</p> <p>Housing charity Shelter has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/10/low-income-families-private-housing-rent-benefit-freeze\">long warned</a> that the consequences of housing shortages and cuts to housing benefit would increasingly be felt outside major cities. \u201cEvery day at Shelter we hear from families across the country who are desperately struggling to meet their monthly housing payments and living in constant fear of losing their home,\u201c says its chief executive Campbell Robb: \u201cWith further cuts still to take effect, we\u2019re worried that this will only get worse.\u201d</p> <p>Five years ago, Three Rivers district council in south Hertfordshire put no homeless families in bed and breakfast accommodation. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/statutory-homelessness-and-homelessness-prevention-and-relief-england-april-to-june-2016\">Last year it housed 10.</a> Three Rivers is \u201cnot a B&amp;B type area\u201d says Martin Trevett, the local authority\u2019s lead member for housing and planning. The council, struggling with a shortage of temporary accommodation, has had to house families miles away in Slough and Luton. Most homeless households, he says, are \u201cworking on low wages\u201d, and are \u201cnot the government\u2019s lazy scrounger stereotype\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/10/low-income-families-private-housing-rent-benefit-freeze\">Low-income families in private housing face large benefit shortfalls</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trevett says that while rents in south Hertfordshire are seen as cheap by some commuters used to London prices, for people on average or low incomes, rents of \u00a31,500 a month for a three-bed home are unmanageable. Especially as local housing allowance (LHA) rates \u2013 maximum levels of housing benefit support for tenants in the area \u2013 are failing to keep pace (currently \u00a31,050 for a three-bed home). The four-year freeze in LHA rates, he believes, means the problem is \u201conly going to get worse\u201d.</p> <p>In Chelmsford, Essex, <a href=\"http://www.chelmsfordweeklynews.co.uk/news/14593859.Council_plans_to_convert__containers_for_homeless/\">the council is preparing to purchase and assemble 40 \u201cmodular\u201d homes</a> \u2013 specialist one and two-bed static caravan-style units to try to shrink a temporary accommodation bill heading for at least \u00a31m this financial year. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/statutory-homelessness-and-homelessness-prevention-and-relief-england-april-to-june-2016\">Homelessness soared from 124 in 2010-11 to 305 households last year</a>. The number in temporary accommodation was up nearly sixfold over that period. Numbers in B&amp;B rose sevenfold. At the end of June, 10 of those families had been in B&amp;B accommodation for longer than six weeks.</p> <p>Homelessness is in part an unfortunate byproduct of the city\u2019s success, says Conservative councillor Paul Hutchinson, the cabinet member for strategic housing at Chelmsford city council. Chelmsford is an affluent commuter satellite of London, but with wealth has come high house prices and rents. A new-build two-bed home costs \u00a3325,000, he says, but the average local salary is just \u00a326,000. \u201cIt\u2019s a prosperous town for many people, but for many it is not,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have a legal and a moral duty to help people who are homeless.\u201d</p> <p>Fulfilling that duty is much more difficult, Hutchinson accepts. Chelmsford\u2019s social housing stock is under pressure, and while the city is improvising solutions, the real issue is building more homes. The barriers to this are high, not least in terms of local public opposition to new developments, despite what Hutchinson says is a general acceptance locally that it is in society\u2019s interests that people in need are housed. \u201cProbably 1m more homes [nationally] would make a difference,\u201c says Hutchinson, \u201cbut that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>A recent <a href=\"http://www.local.gov.uk/media-releases/-/journal_content/56/10180/7762622/NEWS\">survey of councils by the Local Government Association (LGA)</a> found that four-fifths of councils in England anticipated that current government housing policies, coupled with welfare reforms, would lead to a rise in homelessness, increased demand for temporary accommodation and longer social housing waiting lists by 2020. Observers note a marked tension between local conservative politicians and Tory ministers, particularly over right to buy, which they believe are likely to both drive up homelessness and deplete councils\u2019 ability to fulfill their homelessness duties.</p> <p>Certainly councils gave Javid a lukewarm reception at the Tory party conference, and are hostile to an imminent <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2016-17/homelessnessreduction.html\">private member\u2019s bill</a> from the Tory backbencher Bob Blackman, aimed at reducing homelessness by placing more statutory duties on councils without any guarantees of more resources.</p> <p>Councils, including Tory-controlled authorities, want more freedom to build and manage genuinely affordable housing in their area. That is pushing against the grain of recent housing and welfare policy, but the sense of grassroots council frustration at national housing policy is now palpable. For Hutchinson, building affordable housing is both an economic and a moral imperative. \u201cHomelessness has always happened and always will. The important thing is how one responds.\u201d</p>",

Over 100 Schwarzman scholars have already been selected: 45% American, 20% Chinese and 35% from the rest of the world.

His London counterpart, Mary Trevelyan, hoped that international students would rebuild a world based on \u201ctrust and tolerance between one nation and another\u201d.

  "<p>When I was 13, in 1983, I spent several weeks trying to like a new LP called <em>Power, Corruption &amp; Lies</em>. There was no band name, or band photos, or song titles on the record sleeve, which was dominated by a doomy old painting of a basket of roses, bone-coloured blooms against a dark backdrop. The music seemed equally forbidding: long, circling, incremental songs, with a small-voiced singer trudging across great expanses of bass and drums. Most British pop then was much brighter and less mysterious. The older boys at school noted my choice of listening with approval.</p> <p>Over the 33 years since, New Order have gone from cult taste to pop institution \u2013 pioneers of both dance music and rock, co-writers of England\u2019s only decent World Cup song, global performers of addictive, happy-sad hits such as \u201cTrue Faith\u201d and \u201cBlue Monday\u201d \u2013 in a way that would have bewildered earnest early fans like me.

It is as self-importantly long as a Victorian novel.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYH8DsU2WCk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FYH8DsU2WCk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It will also come as a shock to anyone who has taken New Order\u2019s often solemn, hairshirt image at face value. While I was poring over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/aug/08/power-corruption-lies-new-order\"><em>Power, Corruption &amp; Lies</em></a> in 1983, the band were on tour in California: \u201cWe had a food fight in the dressing room,\u201d writes Hook. \u201cAfter the show we met ... two girls who both looked like Raquel Welch.\u201d The \u201conly other thing of note\u201d was their tour manager Terry Mason \u201cgetting so sunburned that when he dived in the pool the next day\u201d he and \u201chis top layer of skin parted company ... Everyone around the pool ran away screaming.\u201d</p> <p>Hook describes himself in the book as \u201ca daft twat from Salford\u201d. He includes on-the-road anecdotes about groupies and drink and drugs with such glee and tirelessness that even the most rock\u2019n\u2019roll readers will probably find themselves skipping sections. As soon as their career trajectory allowed, he says, New Order behaved like \u201cpigs at a trough\u201d. This note of self-disgust tempers all the laddishness a little, as does an unusual attention to detail: \u201cThe thing with crack is that it\u2019s better than coke while you\u2019re doing it. It\u2019s much smoother, warmer and not as edgy,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut then afterwards ... you\u2019d happily slit your own throat.\u201d At times, <em>Substance</em> \u2013 the book\u2019s title is surely an unsubtle druggy pun as well as a claim to definitiveness \u2013 becomes as debauched as the notorious biography of the 70s rock decadents Led Zeppelin,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/observer/omm/story/0,13887,1415153,00.html\"> <em>Hammer of the Gods</em></a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0731935bc1df6a62396c9a28de523b52451f7e89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0731935bc1df6a62396c9a28de523b52451f7e89/0_156_1440_1799/800.jpg\" alt=\"Performing at the Super Rock festival, Portugal, in 2005.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Performing at the Super Rock festival, Portugal, in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel de Almeida/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But New Order were blotting something out as well as enjoying themselves. The band began in 1980, hastily formed from the remnants of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/12/ian-curtis-so-this-is-permanence-joy-division\">Joy Division</a>, a more tormented, more shortlived group whose singer Ian Curtis killed himself, partly because of the pressures of approaching fame. Four years ago Hook published a shorter, more delicate memoir about Joy Division, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/28/unknown-pleasures-peter-hook-review\"><em>Unknown Pleasures</em></a>, and in <em>Substance</em> he says little, at least at first, about the transition from one band to the other. According to him the three surviving musicians simply, almost unthinkingly, carried on playing together. Their sometimes tyrannical manager Rob Gretton chose another name for them, from a Sunday Times story about a Cambodian rebel group (and not, as widely supposed, as a would-be transgressive Nazi reference). Then the band began adapting their music to make up for Curtis\u2019s absence.</p> <p>Thanks to his unhappiness and sense of drama, Joy Division songs had been grand but terse. New Order\u2019s were less bleak, more expansive, shaped by the band\u2019s sense of a fresh start, and by the uplifting dance records they heard in New York nightclubs during their American tours. But because of limited technology \u2013 the electronics they wanted to use remained expensive \u2013 and lack of musical technique (\u201cnone of us could sing and play at the same time\u201d), it took half a decade for New Order to turn the sparse, awkward experimentation of their initial records into the busy, shiny, surging sound which would make them mainstream stars. Hook tells the story of this stop-start transformation well. \u201cThe best version\u201d of \u201cBlue Monday\u201d was lost when the drummer, Stephen Morris, used a kettle lead to connect a costly new drum machine to a socket: \u201cAfter days of programming \u2026 the mains lead popped out of the back \u2026 the machine dumped all its information\u201d.</p> <p>Hook portrays his bandmates as inspired, if sometimes careless, musicians, but pretty poor human beings. New Order\u2019s singer and guitarist Bernard Sumner, in particular, is \u201ca twat\u201d on one page, keenly appreciated on the next: \u201cThe struggle in Bernard\u2019s voice was a major part of the band\u2019s appeal.\u201d As New Order matured, there was an ongoing battle between Sumner, who wanted to make them more polished and electronic, and Hook, whose booming, melancholy bass-playing was a rawer, more analogue presence, a vestige of Joy Division\u2019s intensity. While recording New Order\u2019s 1986 album <em>Brotherhood</em>, Hook reveals with satisfaction, he conspired against Sumner with a sound engineer, disconnecting a control intended to quieten his bass on the LP. By the mid-80s, New Order and their swelling entourage had split into barely communicating factions.</p> <p>Rock writing rarely tells us properly what a band treading water or in slow decline feels like from the inside. Hook does so memorably. \u201cIn Japan again,\u201d he writes with ennui and pleasure, \u201cwe were introduced to two new wonderful things: kimonos and Kobe beef \u2026 Our palates, along with our waistlines, were expanding.\u201d The last two-thirds of the book is an ambivalent record of ever more lucrative foreign tours, drawn-out recording sessions and breakaway solo projects by band members \u2013 in many ways, New Order came to resemble the 70s rock aristocrats who had helped provoke Joy Division and other punk-aligned bands into being in the first place.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VcGJZpfl1c\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0VcGJZpfl1c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>New Order retained their musical credibility, though, by being adaptable, their mindset and song structures open enough to absorb modern sounds and production techniques. The band\u2019s finances were another matter. Hook tells the familiar story of the fall of the innovative but rickety Manchester-based musical empire with which New Order were entwined: the record label <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/13/comment.pop\">Factory and the Hacienda nightclub</a>, which finally collapsed in 1992 and 1997 respectively. Other awful, premature losses have punctuated the band\u2019s long existence: the unhealthy Gretton died in 1999; Martin Hannett, the equally obsessive and brilliant producer of New Order\u2019s first releases and of Joy Division, died in 1991. The comedian Caroline Aherne, with whom Hook had a volcanic marriage between 1994 and 1997, died this July. Controversially, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/03/peter-hook-caroline-aherne-physically-abusive-during-marriage\">Hook accuses Aherne of \u201cputting cigarettes out on my arm, attacking me with bottles, knives, chairs\u201d</a>. For all his boisterous indestructability, this book often has a haunted quality, and is all the more powerful for it.</p> <p>He left New Order in 2007, not long after his 50th birthday. Several pages here usefully and drolly demystify the job of being a rock star, and one details the physical toll of decades of bass-playing, worsened by Hook\u2019s idiosyncratic, low-slung, Viking-warrior style: \u201ctrapped nerves in neck \u2026 bent lower spine \u2026 one arm longer than the other\u201d.</p> <p>New Order still exist, and last year released their tenth album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/27/new-order-music-complete-review-unexpectedly-coherent\"><em>Music Complete</em></a>, to decent reviews. In 2014, Sumner published his own memoir of Joy Division and New Order, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/30/musicians-memoirs-setting-the-record-straight\"><em>Chapter and Verse</em></a>. None of this receives much attention from Hook here. \u201cNever trust a musician,\u201d he warns at one point. \u201cEven me.\u201d For the last half dozen years, he has been performing Joy Division and New Order songs with a new band, the Light: Hook sings, his son plays bass. \u201cHe\u2019s almost as good as me,\u201d Hook writes, characteristically both bragging and self-mocking. It\u2019s a sentimental, slightly claustrophobic end to a book about how some gifted young Britons tried to escape a great darkness in the early 80s, like a few of their compatriots, and never quite did so.

  "<p>On 23 February, Donald Trump stood before a rally of cheering supporters to celebrate a thumping victory in the Nevada Republican caucus \u2013 his third consecutive win, in defiance of the naysayers who had predicted that his bubble was about to burst. \u201cIf you listen to the pundits, we weren\u2019t expected to win too much \u2013 and now we\u2019re winning, winning, winning the country,\u201d he bragged. \u201cWe won with young. We won with old. We won with highly educated. We won with poorly educated. I love the poorly educated.\u201d</p> <p>That last line provoked immediate waves of mockery. It sounded at the time like another one of Trump\u2019s many gaffes \u2013 he loves that people do not get a decent education? Yet behind the mockery was a real sense of disquiet, which has not gone away: Trump loves the less educated because they appear to love him back. As the Atlantic reported in March: \u201cThe best single predictor of Trump support in the Republican primary is the absence of a college degree.\u201d Education \u2013 or the lack of it \u2013 seemed to be propelling the Trump bandwagon.</p> <p>The possibility that education has become a fundamental divide in democracy \u2013 with the educated on one side and the less educated on another \u2013 is an alarming prospect. It points to a deep alienation that cuts both ways. The less educated fear they are being governed by intellectual snobs who know nothing of their lives and experiences. The educated fear their fate may be decided by know-nothings who are ignorant of how the world really works. Bringing the two sides together is going to be very hard. The current election season appears to be doing the opposite.</p> <p>Trump continues to poll far ahead of Clinton among voters who did not go to college, while Clinton still leads by a considerable margin among college graduates. This is a significant change from 2012, when the picture was far more mixed. Four years ago, the college-educated vote was almost evenly split, with graduates favouring Obama over Romney by a narrow margin, 50 to 48. Recent polling puts Trump\u2019s lead over Clinton among <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/26/poll-trump-leads-clinton-76-percent-to-17-percent-among-white-men-without-college-degrees/\">white men without a college degree</a> at a sobering 76 to 19.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/nov/29/how-the-education-gap-is-tearing-politics-apart-podcast\">How the education gap is tearing politics apart \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, there are other factors at play here. Race is one; gender is the other. The overwhelming majority of Trump\u2019s supporters are white, regardless of their education levels. However, white men with a college degree split much more evenly between the candidates, whereas white women without a college degree still strongly favour Trump. Less educated voters who support Trump are not necessarily poor: many earn more than $50,000 (\u00a339,000) a year. Trump scores particularly well among small business owners who did not go to college. These polling numbers \u2013 which are only indicative, since no one has actually voted yet \u2013 can be unpicked a hundred different ways. But it is hard to avoid the conclusion that how people vote is increasingly being shaped by how long they spent at school.</p> <p>What is happening in the United States has also been happening in the UK. The Brexit campaign had its own Trumpian moment, courtesy of Michael Gove, who told Faisal Islam in an interview on Sky News on 3 June that \u201cthe British people have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/09/michael-gove-experts-academics-vote\">had enough of experts</a>\u201d. Gove was also widely mocked \u2013 if not experts, who was he proposing to get to repair his car, fix his teeth, teach his kids?</p> <aside class=\"element element-membership element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Membership Event: </span><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-long-read-live-at-the-hospital-club-27192843527\">The Long Read live at the Hospital Club</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But what he said struck a deep chord, because it contained a large element of truth. The experts Gove was deriding had been telling the British public that the risks of Brexit far outweighed any potential benefits. Gove insisted that the voters should decide this for themselves, on the basis of their own experiences, rather than listening to elite voices that had a vested interest in the outcome. Those voices came trailing educational qualifications, which had put them in their positions of authority \u2013 at the IMF, the Bank of England, the Treasury. Gove was asking voters lacking anything like the same educational qualifications to feel empowered to reject what they were being told. And in the referendum on 23 June, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron\">that is what they did</a>.</p> <p>Voters with postgraduate qualifications split 75 to 25 in favour of remain. Meanwhile, among those who left school without any qualifications, the vote was almost exactly reversed: 73 to 27 for leave. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/people-who-felt-marginalised-drove-brexit-vote-study-finds\">report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation</a> last month confirmed that \u201ceducational opportunity was the strongest driver\u201d of the Brexit vote. Again, there were plenty of other factors at work \u2013 including a significant generational divide. Older voters were far more likely to vote leave, which partly helps to explain the education gap, since the rapid expansion of higher education in recent decades means older voters are also much less likely to have attended university. But the Rowntree report concludes that educational experience was the biggest single determinant of how people voted. Class still matters. Age still matters. But education appears to matter more.</p> <p>A post-Brexit electoral map of Britain starkly illustrates this new divide. Scotland voted remain for its own particular reasons. But in England and Wales, many university towns emerged from the referendum as isolated outposts of pro-EU sentiment in a sea of Brexit. Newcastle, York, Nottingham, Norwich, Cambridge, Brighton, Warwick, Exeter, Bristol, Reading, Oxford and Cardiff all voted remain. I live in Cambridge, which voted remain by a margin of 74 to 26. There was consternation here following the result. It was accompanied by a barely suppressed feeling that ignorance had won the day. I lost count of the number of times I was told that one of the top trending searches on Google in the immediate aftermath of the vote was: \u201cWhat is the EU?\u201d The implication was that we had been taken out of Europe by people who did not even know what it was they were being asked to decide about.</p> <p>Few felt comfortable, at least in public, following this thought through to its logical conclusion. Yet it was hard to escape the sense that a long buried suspicion of democracy was fighting its way back to the surface. If politics has turned into a contest between ignorance and knowledge, then places like Cambridge may be starting to feel dismayed by the realisation they are now on the losing side. But that would be to fall into an old trap.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>Elite anxiety about the consequences of political ignorance is nothing new. In the long history of intellectuals worrying about democracy and its failings, two basic fears keep nagging away. The first is that democracy will mean rule by the poor, who will use their power to steal from the rich. The second is that democracy will mean rule by the ignorant, who will use their power to do the dumbest things. Both these worries go back at least as far as Plato. The ancient Greeks understood full well that democracy meant letting the have-nots get their claws into the haves. For Aristotle, that\u2019s what the word meant: it was rule by the poor (the <em>demos</em>) over the wealthy. But if class conflict came with the territory, the deeper fear was what the masses might do out of sheer foolishness.</p> <p>For Plato, democracy suffered from the basic defect of putting decision-making in the hands of people who were not competent to decide. Politics was a skill \u2013 and most people were simply clueless. Worse, that made them prey for hucksters and demagogues who would promise the earth and get away with it. Democracy was fertile ground for fantasists with a taste for power. If you tell the people that up is down, and the people believe you, then who is going to let them know that they are wrong?</p> <p>These fears have never really gone away, and they reassert themselves at times of political crisis. In the 1920s, the American political commentator Walter Lippmann updated Plato for the 20th century by arguing that modern citizens simply lacked the mental capacity to process the information needed for intelligent decision-making. Lippmann had worked in American propaganda during the first world war and had seen at first hand just how easy it was to manipulate public opinion.</p> <p>\u201cIt is no longer possible,\u201d he wrote, \u201cto believe in the original dogma of democracy: that the knowledge needed for the management of human affairs comes up spontaneously from the human heart.\u201d People will vote on the basis of anything that grabs their attention in a passing moment, filtered by whatever deep prejudices they harbour beneath the surface. Evidence means little to the average voter; reasoned argument means even less. Lippmann concluded that democracy could only be rescued by establishing a cadre of specially trained experts, whose job was to steer politicians away from the dubious instincts of the people and back towards what the evidence required. Otherwise, the manipulation of public opinion would become the be all and end all of democracy, which is all the encouragement demagogues ever need.</p> <p>Lippmann\u2019s fears chimed with the growing worry of some prominent mid-20th century economists that too much democratic decision-making would lead to financial ruin. A series of future Nobel prize winners, from Friedrich Hayek to Milton Friedman, channelled the ancient critics of democracy by arguing that putting the voters in charge meant short-term impulses would prevail over long-term prudence. Ultimately, they thought, democracy produced inflation, which was just another way of the poor getting their own back on the rich. Hayek and Friedman both put their ultimate faith in the power of markets. But first, they felt experts had to be empowered to rein in the self-destructive impulses of the voters. Hayek at one point advocated restricting the franchise to those aged 45, in order to cut out the young, who don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for them, and the old, who have a vested interest in the past. Hayek did not believe that anyone, however expert, could know the future. But he wanted to put self-knowledge back at the heart of democracy: the worldly wisdom of understanding what is possible, and what is just wishful thinking.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is tempting to think that democracy is reverting to type and that ignorance is being set against knowledge</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lippmann, Hayek and Friedman insisted they were trying to save democracy, not destroy it. But what they thought democracy needed saving from was itself. The voters had to be rescued from their preference for fairytales and the people peddling them. In the late 20th century, partly under the influence of such thinkers, democratic politics did carve out spaces where experts could be better insulated from the impulsive decision-making of the masses, as independent central banks and other unelected bodies were entrusted with more and more decision-making capacity, away from the glare of public opinion. Now, in the 21st century, these are the experts who find that the voters no longer want to heed their advice.</p> <p>In the year of Trump and Brexit, it is tempting to think that democracy is reverting to type and that popular ignorance is once again being set against expert knowledge. Trump is what you get when demagoguery is allowed to run unchecked, egged on by a craven media that simply enjoys the show. Brexit is what you get if you ask people a question that they lack the basic information to answer. This is the view that has been doing the rounds in the circles in which the highly educated move. But to think this is a big mistake.<strong> </strong>The educational divide that is opening up in our politics is not really between knowledge and ignorance. It is a clash between one worldview and another.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>What is the EU?<strong> </strong>Hearing educated remainers mock those who asked that question the day after the vote was an uncomfortable experience \u2013 and not just because the story about Google searches was largely apocryphal. After all, the question is not as straightforward as it seems: it is simple enough to say what the letters refer to, but far more difficult to know what they really mean for our politics and our future. Education is not the same as knowledge. Nor is knowledge the same as knowing which way to vote. The split between the university towns and other parts of the country did not arise because one set of people understood what was truly at stake and the others were just taking a wild guess. Both sides were guessing.</p> <p>Even now, no one truly knows what is going to happen. The better-educated cleaved to one set of predictions because these chimed with what they already believed in. Polling carried out before the referendum, which asked people what they thought was likely to happen in the aftermath of a Brexit vote, found that university graduates thought that it would produce an immediate financial crash, whereas those with fewer qualifications thought it much more likely that things would carry on as before. Prior political preferences shape what we think the evidence shows, not the other way round.</p> <p>None of this would have surprised Lippmann. When he argued that ordinary voters were incapable of judging complex policy questions on their merits, he did not exclude the educated from that judgment. He meant everybody. As he wrote: \u201cI have not happened to meet anybody, from a president of the United States to a professor of political science, who came anywhere near to embodying the ideal of the sovereign and omnicompetent citizen.\u201d He thought that we needed experts who were trained in eliminating their own biases \u2013 and whatever a regular university education does, it does not do that.</p> <p>\u201cThe historical record leaves little doubt that the educated, including the highly educated, have gone astray in their moral and political thinking as often as anyone else,\u201d write the political scientists Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels in their new book <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10671.html\">Democracy for Realists</a>, echoing Lippmann. What the educated are better at is sounding like they know what they are talking about, because they have been trained in how to make an argument. \u201cWell-informed people are likely to have more elaborate and internally consistent worldviews than inattentive people, but that just reflects the fact that their rationalisations are better rehearsed.\u201d Education gives you the ability to tailor your arguments to suit your personal preferences, which is why it is a big asset on the job market. But it does little to help tailor your personal preferences to suit the best arguments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"84ce22140f4c0663b48956256603613171397104\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84ce22140f4c0663b48956256603613171397104/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Guardian Design\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guardian Design</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Guardian Design</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the current political climate, a lack of education is sometimes blamed for the spread of conspiracy theories, which run like wildfire through many populist movements. Trump\u2019s campaign, with its nods and winks to \u201cwhat\u2019s really going on\u201d, and its pre-emptive warnings about the vote being stolen, has been feeding and feeding off the appetite for conspiratorial thinking. Yet to blame this on the absence of education is just another version of the old fear of the credulity of the untutored masses: they will believe anything.</p> <p>The real story is more complicated. Polling conducted earlier this year by a research project in Cambridge shows that education does sometimes make a difference when it comes to conspiracy theories: the likelihood of someone thinking the moon landing was a hoax, or that the government is hiding the existence of aliens, does decline as you go higher up the education ladder. But when the theories concern politically divisive issues, then education has far less effect.</p> <p>Possessing a university degree does not alter the probability of someone believing that global warming is a hoax \u2013 that tracks prior political commitments, not superior knowledge. Nor are conspiracy theories confined to the right. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s support among Labour party members contains a high proportion of university graduates. Yet in a YouGov poll, 55% of Corbyn supporters agreed with the statement that intelligence services such as MI5 have been working to undermine Corbyn since he became leader. That figure compares with only 19% of the wider public who give credence to the same claim. People will believe what their political loyalties incline them to believe, regardless of how much education they have received.</p> <p>This doesn\u2019t mean that our political beliefs are simply a reflection of our narrow self-interest. It is true that we all have a tendency to favour the worldview that enhances our future prospects. The preference of university graduates for remaining in the EU echoes the benefits that EU membership gives them: the free movement of labour and easy access to European networks is better for those with the qualifications to take advantage of a knowledge economy. But it is not the case that the education divide is just another version of the class divide, with the winners from globalisation lined up against the losers.</p> <p>As with Trump supporters in the US, Brexit was not simply the cause of the disadvantaged and left behind. Many Brexiteers come from the affluent middle classes, particularly in the south of England, outside of the university towns. Meanwhile, universities are producing their fair share of losers these days, as students leave burdened with debt and confronted by a bleak job market. Yet these students \u2013 rich or poor, in work or out, elite or not \u2013 overwhelmingly favoured EU membership. Education does not simply divide us on the grounds of what is in our interests. It sorts us according to where we feel we belong.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>Why does education do this?<strong> </strong>Political scientists have been aware of the growing education divide for decades. A report on the 1983 general election \u2013 whose authors included a young John Curtice, the current eminence grise of the UK polling business \u2013 noted that education levels were emerging as a significant indicator of voting patterns. The report put this down to the distinctive social attitudes that were picked up at university. \u201cEducational experience,\u201d it noted, \u201cis an important source of values distinct from class experience.\u201d These values often related to issues that were not straightforwardly economic.</p> <p>Graduates, even in the 1980s, tended to be much more concerned about the environment than other sectors of the population. They were also strikingly more internationalist in outlook. In 1983, 58% of graduates expressed a positive attitude to what was then known as the European Economic Community, whereas only 35% of those who left school at 16 felt the same. Not much has changed since. But at that time, the Labour party was still overtly hostile to the European project, and withdrawal from the EEC was part of its famously radical 1983 election manifesto. Many graduates reported having leftish attitudes on a whole host of other questions \u2013 from defence spending to women\u2019s rights. But on this issue their cosmopolitanism took precedence over their party loyalties. The result was that in the 1983 election more than twice as many university graduates voted for the centrist pro-European SDP-Liberal Alliance as voted for Labour.</p> <p>One reason this was not a bigger issue back then \u2013 and the Alliance did not manage to supplant Labour as the main party of opposition \u2013 was that there were not that many university graduates. Although participation had been steadily rising, in the mid-1980s fewer than one in five people had benefited from higher education. That was enough to make a difference, but not enough to tip the balance. By <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/apr/24/students-higher-education-almost-50-per-cent\">2012, university participation among 18-30 year olds was close to 50%</a>, and it has only dipped recently because of rising tuition fees. That is enough to start splitting the population into two camps.</p> <p>But it is not simply a question of demographics. The gap has been amplified by certain forms of social mobility, which have reinforced the education divide by enabling the better-educated to start congregating together: socially, geographically, romantically. In a previous generation, graduates often married non-graduates, because their choices tended to be driven by where they happened to live or work. As the clich\u00e9 has it: bosses used to marry their secretaries. Not any more, and not just because there are fewer secretaries. If you went to university, ask yourself: how many of your friends didn\u2019t go to university? And among your friends, how many of those who did are married to people who didn\u2019t? Greater freedom of movement produces greater freedom of choice. But that does not produce more social diversity, it produces more social stratification.</p> <p>Social media now enhances these patterns. Friendship groups of like-minded individuals reinforce each other\u2019s worldviews. Facebook\u2019s news feed is designed to deliver information that users are more inclined to \u201clike\u201d. Much of the shock that followed the Brexit result in educated circles came from the fact that few people had been exposed to arguments that did not match their preferences. Education does not provide any protection against these social media effects. It reinforces them.</p> <p>The growing political divide between the educated and the less educated can be seen across Europe. It is most pronounced in Scandinavian countries, where university attendance is high and levels of education are an increasing driver of voting habits. It is less visible in southern and eastern Europe \u2013 in places such as Portugal and Poland \u2013 where participation in higher education is lower, and other social factors, including family and religion, still exert a strong grip.</p> <p>But Britain and the US are different again, because of their political systems. In European countries with proportional representation, smaller parties can offer a home to particular segments of the population, including those at both ends of the education scale. The support for many European parties of the populist right is heavily drawn from less educated voters. Meanwhile, green and liberal parties, especially those that favour immigration, rely strongly on university graduates for their support. That group includes the Liberal Democrats, which is still the UK-based party that attracts the highest proportion of graduates among its voters. But as the Lib Dems have discovered to their cost, with first-past-the-post that is not enough. Under a PR system, targeting the graduate vote can generate significant representation in parliament. Here, it can get you wiped out \u2013 especially if you make a promise to students not to raise their tuition fees and then fail to keep it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The education divide derives from values often characterised as the opposition between libertarians and authoritarians</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The education divide is never going to supplant traditional left-right politics. There is not going to be a \u201cGraduate party\u201d taking on a party of \u201cSchool Leavers\u201d. Instead the divide cuts across left and right, which is why it is proving so disruptive to our politics right now. Big-tent political parties are struggling to hold their fractured coalitions of voters together. Polling still reveals some shared attitudes between university graduates and those without educational qualifications on economic issues, such as support for trade unions and mistrust of the free market. But the education divide derives from an alternative set of values, which is often characterised as the opposition between libertarians and authoritarians.</p> <p>Authoritarians are looking for order and control, libertarians want greater freedom and tolerance. Along with education levels, the strongest indicator of likely support for Brexit was shown by attitudes to capital punishment: the more you were in favour, the more you wanted to leave the EU. These attitudes tend to track educational experience. Labour\u2019s support is now split between left-leaning libertarians (broadly pro-union and anti-banks, but also pro-immigration, and often highly educated) and left-leaning authoritarians (also pro-union and anti-banks, but far tougher on immigration and very concerned about crime and community). Each grouping might gather upwards of 20% of the electorate under its wing. Together that would be enough for a parliamentary majority. But they do not fit together any more, and increasingly they neither like nor trust each other.</p> <p>The same forces are threatening to play havoc with electoral politics in the US. Trump\u2019s army of the less educated is on the march inside the Republican party, but that leaves plenty of traditional Republicans \u2013 including many college-educated ones \u2013 wondering where to go. Some Republicans will be voting for Clinton. Some traditional Democrats<strong> </strong>will be sorely tempted by Trump\u2019s deeply authoritarian message. It is true that American democracy has proved highly resilient in the past and the party system has adapted to many demographic and cultural shifts. However, it is also possible that the gap between the educated and the less educated is going to become more entrenched over time, because it is not just a question of economic interests. It represents a gulf in mutual understanding.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>The conflict between rich and poor<strong> </strong>still matters a great deal in our politics. But the age-old fear that democracy would end up letting the poor steal from the rich has always looked overblown. Constitutions \u2013 including the one carefully crafted by the American founders to guard against just that outcome \u2013 have done their bit to safeguard the interests of the propertied classes. So, too, have the increasingly complex institutional arrangements that give power to experts in areas \u2013 defence, finance, environment, health \u2013 where technical knowledge is assumed to be required. Representative democracy has proved effective at staving off class war. It has done it by finding electoral outlets for popular dissatisfaction \u2013 as with the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, of Attlee in 1945, or of Obama in 2008 \u2013 that never quite let the people take charge. When inequality gets out of hand, the system does what it can to correct for it. But it is designed to avoid extreme solutions driven by popular anger. That still holds. The haves do not look in danger of being expropriated by the have-nots any time soon.</p> <p>The contest between the educated and the less educated is different. Many of the safeguards that have been put in place to bypass popular politics \u2013 above all, the authority that now resides in central banks \u2013 have had the effect of empowering a new class of experts, for whom education is a prerequisite of entry into the elite. These are not just the bankers, but the lawyers, the doctors, the civil servants, the technicians, the pundits, the academics. Not all of the educated are winners in this world, but almost all of the winners are educated. It gives the impression that knowledge has become a proxy for influence.</p> <p>When Gove suggested that the experts should not be trusted because they have a vested interest in what they are saying, that was his point: once knowledge becomes a prerequisite of power, then it no longer speaks for itself. It appears to speak for the worldview of the people who possess it. At that point it ceases to be knowledge and simply becomes another mark of privilege.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Educated v less educated may be even more toxic than rich v poor, because it comes laden with assumptions of superiority</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The education divide has the potential to break apart the careful ties that hold representative democracy together. Regardless of our different interests, we elect representatives to take decisions on our behalf on the understanding that we share certain basic values, including a respect for knowledge, wherever it comes from. Once knowledge is assumed to be just another one of the perks of power, then the basis to trust others to take decisions for us becomes eroded. Asserting the facts and asserting your privilege grow increasingly difficult to distinguish.</p> <p>Educated v less educated may be even more toxic than rich v poor, because it comes laden with assumptions of moral superiority. These days the rich find it quite hard to get away with the presumption that their wealth is proof of their virtue. When they seek protection from the system, it is pretty clear what they are up to: they are looking after their interests. But when the educated look out for themselves they can dress it up as something ostensibly better than that: expertise.</p> <p>To those on the receiving end, that stinks. It stinks of hypocrisy, and it also stinks of self-interest. The fact that the educated are not always the beneficiaries of the social attitudes that they hold \u2013 Corbyn\u2019s supporters, like Bernie Sanders\u2019s, would rightly insist that many of the positions they adopt are designed for the benefit the socially excluded \u2013 does not help. It just makes them sound even more self-righteous.</p> <p>In the run-up to the EU referendum Jeremy Cliffe of the Economist \u2013 the house journal of the educated expert \u2013 suggested that although Brexit might win this time, it was possible the UK would vote to rejoin the EU in a second referendum 20 years from now, by which point current levels of university education would have spread to later age groups. Twenty years is a very long time in politics. Before then, the gap between the educated and the less educated has the potential to widen, as each side digs in. The viciousness of public debate, as bad as it is now, could still get worse. Because two-party politics does not map on to this division, mainstream politicians will have to find creative ways to try to harness it. These carry the risks of making it worse.</p> <p>The EU referendum was seen by educated optimists \u2013 including some of the people around David Cameron \u2013 as just another way for democracy to let off steam: a means of giving vent to anger without letting it run out of control. That is what the optimists have been saying about Trump too.

Both are practical requirements of the process; neither tells us anything about the outcome. The prime minister lit them up as beacons, rallying the troops for a liberation crusade.</p> <p>All that May has to offer is symbols, but symbols are a more powerful currency with true believers than is ever understood by agnostics. Likewise, the prime minister\u2019s repeated assertion that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/01/no-10-brexit-means-brexit-tory-peer-lady-wheatcroft-lords-delay\">\u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d</a> has attracted more ridicule than it deserves. (May has now added a second line to the mantra: \u201cIt means we are going to leave the European Union.\u201d) To the cynical ear this is vacuity dressed in tautology. But that objection presumes that slogans are meant to transmit information. Often their function is performative \u2013 a signal of belonging to the tribe. There is a liturgical quality to May\u2019s Brexit creed. You can imagine it as a call-and-response prayer, with the congregation supplying the new follow-up verse.</p> <p>It is the quasi-religious mood in Birmingham that makes Cameron\u2019s reign feel so remote. For years, the balance of Tory grassroots opinion was hostile to the power they called Europe. The demand for rupture was voiced by a small minority, but more would have joined in had they believed it was possible and available. Now they are told it is both, by a leader who \u2013 crucially \u2013 has far better credentials as an orthodox Tory than her predecessor. May, the provincial vicar\u2019s daughter, has done her time tramping the streets, stuffing envelopes, working the local Conservative association circuit. Her conversion is not mistrusted as some tactical ruse but celebrated as the completion of a journey on behalf of the whole party.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/03/theresa-may-tory-conservative-party-direction\">Theresa May: a Tory saviour who offers no sense of hope | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is nothing less than a reformation in the Church of Conservatism, with the authority of Brussels cast as a modern-day Rome. Cameron tried to manage the old schism but the suspicion lingered that his loyalties were divided; that he read from a vernacular Tory bible at home and then jumped on the Eurostar to kiss the papal commission\u2019s ring. Now Theresa May stands before her party like Elizabeth I: a true, Protestant queen, their own Gloriana.</p> <p>By temperament, the new prime minister is not a fanatic, and the obligation to staff a government with recruits from across the Tory spectrum precludes a purge of heretics. Like Elizabeth, May comes to power with no desire to make \u201cwindows into men\u2019s souls\u201d. If ministers want to practise a bit of Europhilia at home, that is their business, but they should not go confessing it in public.</p> <p>It is striking how quickly this new regime has taken hold. Even quite ardent Tory pro-Europeans are suppressing private fears of an imminent economic blunder for the sake of party loyalty and ambition. Only a handful of backbenchers publicly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/02/hard-brexit-eu-trade-deal\">sound the alarm</a> about Downing Street\u2019s apparent willingness to abandon membership of the European single market. They are dismissed by colleagues \u2013 including former remainers \u2013 as rogue elements weirdly bent on career suicide.</p> <p>Misgivings about May\u2019s European position are transmitted mostly in code. Some moderates look to the Treasury for hope, seeing in Philip Hammond\u2019s warnings about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/03/philip-hammond-pledges-economic-pragmatism-during-brexit-process\">Brexit-related \u201cturbulence\u201d</a> a discreet genuflexion to the old religion. Downing Street, meanwhile, eyes George Osborne warily as a dangerous grey cardinal, banished from court but maintaining his old network of allies and spies.</p> <p>Then there are the Brexit ultras to May\u2019s right, the caucus of hardliners who keep pulling their party towards the most austere professions of anti-Europeanism. They play the role of what the historian J E Neale dubbed \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puritan_choir\">the puritan choir</a>\u201d in Elizabeth\u2019s parliament, urging an extirpation of every last residue of papish corruption from the body politic.</p> <p>Finally there are the self-styled buccaneers of the free-trade seas. Boris Johnson would probably cast himself as Sir Walter Raleigh \u2013 polymath, wordsmith, adventurer. That leaves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/30/globalisation-poverty-corruption-free-trade-liam-fox\">Liam Fox</a> to play Sir Francis Drake, looking for domestic glory in global circumnavigation but seen from abroad as a pirate.</p> <p>This is all myth and fantasy, of course. But parties have always been sustained by internal mythologies, and the task of exiting the EU is so complicated and fraught with danger that fantasy becomes a necessary comfort. As one former minister says of the puritan choristers: \u201cThey have spent their lives working towards this dream. Of course they don\u2019t want to accept that it\u2019s a nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>Tory pro-Europeans are in the impossible position of using rational argument against faith. If they counsel compromise on migration or the single market, they are accused of talking Britain down or trying to refight the referendum. They have few reinforcements across the political water. Labour is a shambles. The Lib Dems are puny in parliament. Scotland has its own distinct politics, and in Nicola Sturgeon its own remainian queen with her own independence agenda.</p> <p>The Tories do not speak for all of England, but in the absence of credible opposition they feel as if they do, and will act accordingly. To those millions who did not vote to leave the EU, the message is clear: you are free to pray for whatever you like. Your antique rites will be tolerated.

He was pressed on this support in an interview with O\u2019Reilly, who himself called the operation \u201c<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/donald-trump-immigration-deportation-215783\">really brutal</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWell, well, I\u2019ve heard it both ways. I\u2019ve heard good reports, I\u2019ve heard bad reports,\u201d Trump told the Fox News host. \u201cWe would do it in a very humane way.\u201d</p> <p>But Trump has given mixed messages since his<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-60-minutes-scott-pelley/\"> early calls</a> for mass deportation, and he has used the phrase <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/watch/trump-vows-to-deport-11-million-people-564859459935\">\u201cdeportation force\u201d</a>. In August of this year, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-immigration-policy-deportation\">appeared to have doubts, </a>until finally promising<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/donald-trump-vows-to-deport-millions-during-first-hour-in-office-in-hardline-speech\"> \u201cno amnesty\u201d and a \u201chumane\u201d removal </a>of migrants.</p> <p><strong>Kaine: the nuclear deal with Iran has prevented Tehran from developing weapons</strong></p> <p>The nuclear deal with Iran was finalized in July 2015, three years after the end of Clinton\u2019s term as secretary of state, and it does not completely remove Iran\u2019s nuclear program. It removes a reserve of medium-enriched uranium, cuts into its low-enriched uranium, and allows access to international inspectors.</p> <p>Kaine also appears to exaggerate how quickly Iran could have developed a bomb. During negotiations, intelligence officials and analysts said they believed Iran was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal.html\">two to three months</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-is-reached-after-long-negotiations.html\">away from bomb capabilities</a>. The terms of the deal extend that \u201cbreakout\u201d ability to a year, and have restrictions extending over 10, 15 and 25 years.</p> <p><strong>Pence: the US doesn\u2019t know who Syrian refugees are and should block them</strong></p> <p>The government has a fairly clear idea about how many people are in the US without legal authorization. Using data from the Census, Department of Homeland Security, Office of Refugee Resettlement and surveys and analysis from Mexico and Latin American countries, <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics-publications\">the DHS</a> and nonpartisan <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/19/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/\">Pew Research</a> have each been able to estimate the number, and arrived at similar figures in recent years: around 11.3 to 11.5 million people. The margin of error for these figures is generally around a million people at most \u2013 not 20 million as Trump says.</p> <p>Pew and the DHS both try to account for deaths, under-counted groups, arrivals and departures, and have adjusted their calculations based on decades\u2019 worth of research. Both have found that net migration has stabilized in recent years, and that <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2015/11/19/more-mexicans-leaving-than-coming-to-the-u-s/\">more undocumented Mexicans are leaving</a> the US than entering it. In other words, recent net migration into the US has hovered near its lowest levels of the last 20 years.</p> <p><strong>Kaine: blocking Syrian refugees is unconstitutional</strong></p> <p>On Monday, the seventh circuit court of appeals accused Pence of baseless \u201cnightmare speculation\u201d and compared the governor\u2019s attempt to block refugees to an attempt to exclude black people from his state, Indiana. Pence tried to deny 174 refugees resettlement aid, and the case was taken to court.</p> <p>\u201cThe governor of Indiana believes, though without evidence, that some of these persons were sent to Syria by ISIS to engage in terrorism and now wish to infiltrate the United States in order to commit terrorist acts here.

He has been in the job for seven years.<br></p> <p>\u201cI used to live on the streets myself, when I was 14 and 15,\u201d he says. \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t have any money. We lived in a small village about 130km from Hanoi. When I was 14 I decided I needed to find a job so I got on a bus and came to the city.\u201d<br></p> <p>For two years, Vi slept on the floor of a hostel and worked shining shoes on the streets. On a good day he could hope to make the equivalent of 80p. He still remembers the hunger and fear of those days. \u201cI was beaten up a lot,\u201d he recalls.<br></p> <p>No one is quite sure how many children are homeless in Vietnam. <a href=\"https://www.essex.ac.uk/armedcon/story_id/childrenofthedust.pdf\">A Human Rights Watch report</a> from 2006 estimated that there were 23,000. Unicef says that official government figures for 2014 were down to 7,300. But these statistics do not accurately reflect the prevalence of children living and working on the streets, according to Vijaya Ratnam-Raman, acting chief of child protection for Unicef in Vietnam. \u201cPreviously [they] were much more visible, however, this decrease in visibility does not necessarily equal a decrease in the actual numbers.\u201d</p> <p>These days Vi is happily married with a young daughter. But it was a chance encounter 14 years ago that changed his life. One particularly hot summer\u2019s day, Vi was searching for customers, and bumped into Michael Brosowski, a teacher from Sydney. Brosowski had set up a free class for children who couldn\u2019t afford to pay, running lessons out of a small cafe on Sunday afternoons. </p> <p>\u201cVi had a real spark about him,\u201d Brosowski remembers. \u201cHe was clearly a bright kid, and very confident. He gave me a huge smile and just said, \u2018Shoeshine!\u2019 \u2013 which was the only English word he knew. We sat in the little courtyard outside my house and he polished my shoes while we chatted.\u201d<br></p> <p>Vi started attending Brosowski\u2019s classes and a year later his mentor set up Blue Dragon. These days the centre offers free meals, clothes and classrooms for more than 200 street children a year.

We know there are a lot of paedophiles that come to this area, both Vietnamese men and foreigners. These children face a lot of abuse.\u201d He says that one child he met recently was propositioned six times by men on his first night sleeping rough in the city.</p> <p>Vi emphasises that building trust is a slow process. \u201cThe first time you meet these kids you know they aren\u2019t telling you their real story. So at the beginning I don\u2019t ask too many questions \u2013 I just try to be friendly, talk to them about sport, like football. Tell them about my life as a street kid.\u201d</p> <p>He recalls one boy he met two years ago. The 14-year-old was being preyed on by paedophiles and had turned to methamphetamines to dull the pain.<br></p> <p>\u201cI worked with him for months. I said, \u2018If you need money we can help you,\u2019 but he refused. He was on this path to self-destruction \u2013 he kept going back to paedophiles and drugs,\u201d said Vi.<br></p> <p>\u201cEvery time I saw him he would cry. I didn\u2019t know what to do. After three months of reaching out I\u2019d said everything, done everything I could think of. People asked me why I kept going. I\u2019d say, \u2018I don\u2019t know \u2013 all I can do is be his friend.\u2019\u201d<br></p> <p>Vi\u2019s persistence paid off. A year ago, the boy turned up at the shelter, and now it is his home. \u201cHe has never turned back to his old life,\u201d says Vi, proudly.

The overload of the Heywood interconnector tripped the system, which caused the blackout. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/29/south-australia-blackout-explained-renewables-not-to-blame\">South Australia's blackout explained (and no, renewables aren't to blame)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The report also notes that in the lead-up to the statewide blackout, generation reduction occurred at six windfarms, while there was no reduction in thermal generation.</p> <p>Aemo says each reduction coincided with a drop in voltage observed at the windfarms\u2019 connection points, but it says it is too soon to say why: \u201cAdditional analysis is required to determine the reasons for the reduction in generation and observed voltage levels before any conclusions can be drawn.\u201d</p> <p>Energy economist Bruce Mountain told Guardian Australia the report, while preliminary, made it abundantly clear that the South Australian event was \u201ca transmission failure, not a generation failure.\u201d</p> <p>He said it was clear the primary event creating the sequence leading to the blackout was the failure of three major transmission lines. By the time the third transmission line went out, it was \u201cgame over\u201d, he said.</p> <p>Mountain noted the report had identified localised issues with windfarms, possibly linked to lightning strikes during the storm, \u201cbut kind of \u2018so what?\u2019 This happens all the time in an electricity system.\u201d</p> <p>He said there was nothing in the report to suggest wind was a more unreliable technology than any other technology in an electricity system: \u201cThe production or not from these windfarms would have made no difference to the ability to sustain supply in South Australia after those three 275kV lines had been dropped.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/28/south-australia-braces-for-storm-that-could-be-most-severe-in-50-years\">South Australia blackout: entire state left without power after storms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Australian Energy Council\u2019s chief executive, Matthew Warren, assessed the material differently. He said the report indicated governments and regulators \u201cneed to think differently about how we run a decarbonising electricity system, reflecting the significant differences between using conventional thermal generation compared to a mix with higher levels of intermittent renewables.\u201d</p> <p>The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/29/jay-weatherill-accuses-barnaby-joyce-of-pushing-anti-windfarm-agenda-over-blackouts\">linked the SA blackout explicitly to the state\u2019s use of renewable energy</a>, calling it a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for state leaders who were trying to hit \u201ccompletely unrealistic\u201d renewable targets.</p> <p>A special meeting of energy ministers has been convened in Canberra to discuss last week\u2019s events.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters in Sydney on Wednesday, Turnbull said the cause of the blackout was \u201cstorms disrupting transmission lines\u201d.</p> <p>He repeated the sequence identified by the Aemo report: transmission lines were knocked over, this disrupted the supply of power across the state, \u201cincluding from renewable sources, including from the various windfarms, beyond Adelaide\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that then in turn put extra strain on the interconnector with Victoria, which caused it to shut down. So it was a cascading blackout \u2013 it happened very quickly \u2013 but this issue of energy security is one that we have to take very, very seriously,\u201d Turnbull said.</p> <p>He continued to point the finger at South Australia.</p> <p>He said the state had the highest wholesale energy costs in the country, and that wasn\u2019t good for jobs, or investment. He said the SA premier, Jay Weatherill, \u201chas to answer for that\u201d.</p> <p>The prime minister listed a hierarchy of priorities with energy.</p> <p>Turnbull said rule number one was \u201ckeep the lights on\u201d. Rule number two was \u201cwe have to ensure energy is affordable\u201d. The third priority he identified was emissions reduction \u201cin accordance with our international obligations\u201d.</p> <p>In Adelaide, Weatherill said the Aemo report pointed the finger squarely at extreme weather as the cause of the statewide blackouts, not the impact of renewables.</p> <p>\u201cMalcolm Turnbull, our PM, took the first opportunity to lecture South Australians about the dangers of renewable energy, and for the Labor states in promoting unrealistic renewable energy targets,\u201d the premier told reporters on Wednesday.</p> <p>Weatherill said Turnbull\u2019s comments were \u201cin contradiction of the oral advice that we were receiving from the Aemo\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe PM was fearful that he would be blamed by the right wing of his party for pushing into renewable energy when he knows that he leads a party which is dominated by coal interests,\u201d the premier said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s deeply disappointing that we do not have the national leadership which is necessary to deal with this and other issues.\u201d</p> <p>South Australia has also signalled that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/03/south-australia-seeks-to-put-emissions-intensity-trading-scheme-in-play\">it will raise the idea of applying an emissions intensity trading system to the electricity market</a> at Friday\u2019s meeting \u2013 but the environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, has already dead-batted that push.</p> <p>The ACT \u2013 which has a bipartisan renewable energy target of 100% renewables by 2020 \u2013 has urged the federal government to get its story straight on renewable energy.</p> <p>Deputy chief minister, Simon Corbell, says the former environment minister Greg Hunt, on the sidelines of global climate talks in Paris last December, <a href=\"http://reneweconomy.com.au/2015/hunt-urges-states-to-adopt-act-style-auctions-to-boost-wind-and-solar-projects-67719\">had clearly urged the states to adopt reverse auctions</a>, following the model developed successfully in the ACT to drive the uptake of renewable energy.</p> <p>Now, less than a year later, the government was blasting state renewable energy targets as being reckless and insufficiently attentive to energy security. \u201cThe inconsistency here is very clear,\u201d Corbell told Guardian Australia on Tuesday.</p>",

But bigger suppression makes a stronger fight. </p> <p>\u201cWe just hope that Joshua is safe,\u201d the 19-year-old activist added. \u201cWe will not give up the fight for democracy and the fight against the Chinese government which disrespects human rights.\u201d <br></p> <p>Nathan Law, Demosist\u014d\u2019s president, <a href=\"http://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1288801-20161005.htm\">told Hong Kong radio</a> he believed there was \u201csome connection\u201d between Wong\u2019s detention and Beijing. <br></p> <p>Rimsky Yuen, Hong Kong\u2019s justice secretary, was due to visit Thailand on Wednesday, Law said, adding that he hoped he would raise Wong\u2019s case \u201cin defence of Hong Kong citizens\u2019 basic human rights abroad\u201d. </p> <p>Wong, 19, was due to address students at Chulalongkorn University at an event to mark the 40th anniversary of a massacre of pro-democracy students by security forces and royalist militias in 1976. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1976/oct/07/fromthearchive\">The Thammasat massacre of 6 October 6 1976</a>, remains a deeply sensitive issue in Thailand\u2019s turbulent recent history, and was the prelude to a military coup.</p> <p>He was expected to talk about his experiences during the 79-day umbrella movement protests in Hong Kong in 2014.</p> <p>Jason Ng, a Hong Kong-based writer who knows Wong, said that before leaving Hong Kong the student activist had voiced concerns that he might not be allowed to enter Thailand.</p> <p> The suspected abduction of Hong Kong bookseller Gui Minhai last year by Chinese agents had also left Wong nervous about potential risks to his well-being. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/08/gui-minhai-the-strange-disappearance-of-a-publisher-who-riled-chinas-elite\">Gui Minhai: the strange disappearance of a publisher who riled China's elite</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe was\u2026 most concerned about his personal safety, being abducted or attacked. Being turned back is one thing, getting hurt or disappearing is another,\u201d said Ng, the author of a book on Hong Kong\u2019s umbrella movement protests.</p> <p>To guard against such threats, ahead of Wong\u2019s trip to Thailand supporters set up an encrypted group on the messaging service WhatsApp through which the activist could notify Bangkok-based academics and journalists of any problems. </p> <p>Wong\u2019s detention appeared to be the latest example of the closer ties between Thailand\u2019s military regime and China\u2019s Communist rulers, who consider the student activist a subversive.</p> <p>Since the 2014 coup in Thailand, a series of incidents have underlined Beijing\u2019s influence in the south-east Asian country.</p> <p>In October last year a Hong Kong publisher who specialised in salacious books about the Communist party elite<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/08/gui-minhai-the-strange-disappearance-of-a-publisher-who-riled-chinas-elite\"> vanished from his seafront apartment</a> in the Thai resort town Pattaya, only to reappear in custody in mainland China where he is now being held.</p> <p>At around the same time, a Chinese journalist and campaigner called Li Xin fled China, hoping to claim political asylum in Thailand. However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/03/activist-li-xin-vanished-in-thailand--held-in-china-says-wife\">he disappeared while traveling from Thailand to Laos</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI warned him to be very careful in Thailand. It is very dangerous here,\u201d one Chinese exile living in Bangkok said at the time.</p> <p>A number of other Chinese dissidents and members of the Uighur ethnic minority from western China have also been deported back to China at the request of its government.</p> <p>Netiwit, who said he waited at the airport until 3am after Wong\u2019s Emirates Airline flight landed at 11:45pm, said his treatment amounted to \u201ccensorship\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cActually Joshua Wong was just in Taipei, Taiwan, and he was able to travel there and stayed there for two-to-three days,\u201d he told the <a href=\"http://www.khaosodenglish.com/politics/2016/10/05/hong-kong-activist-joshua-wong-detained-bkk-whereabouts-unknown/\">Khaosod news website</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThailand should stay out of the Chinese sphere of power, but we\u2019re not able to do this.\u201d</p> <p>Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, said: \u201cThailand\u2019s arrest of Joshua Wong, a well-known pro-democracy activist in Hong Kong, sadly suggests that Bangkok is willing to do Beijing\u2019s bidding. Wong should be freed immediately and allowed to travel and exercise his right to free expression.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The anonymous message-board site <a href=\"http://www.4chan.org/\">4chan</a> has come to represent the darkest corners of internet subculture, rife with the misogyny, web taste and the politically incorrect humor of the alt-right.</p> <p>Now it appears to be in financial trouble, according to the site\u2019s new owner, Hiroyuki Nishimura, who <a href=\"http://boards.4chan.org/qa/thread/706294#p706331\">said</a> on Sunday that the site can no longer afford \u201cinfrastructure costs, network fee, servers cost and CDN [servers that help distribute high-bandwidth files such as video]\u201d.</p> <p>The post begins: \u201cThank you for thinking about 4chan. We had tried to keep 4chan as is. But I failed. I am sincerely sorry.\u201d</p> <p>Nishimura outlined three options for the future of the site: halving traffic costs by limiting upload sizes and closing some boards, adding many more ads including pop-up ads, or adding more paid-for features and \u201c4chan pass\u201d users.</p> <p>An unlikely savior for the site may have already emerged in the form of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\">Martin Shkreli</a>, the controversial former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, who rose to fame after his company bought the patent to an HIV drug and raised its price from $13.50 to $750 per pill, causing mass outrage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/punch-martin-shkreli-good-cause\">Punch Martin Shkreli \u2013 it's for a good cause</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Shkreli <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MartinShkreli/status/782649157404229633\">announced on Twitter</a> that he was \u201copen to joining the board of directors of 4chan\u201d. He then reached out to Nishimura directly, who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hiroyuki_ni/status/782730299574714368\">responded</a>: \u201cI have replied your DM. Thank you for supporting 4chan @MartinSkreli.\u201d</p> <p>4chan was founded in 2003 by an American schoolboy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/07/chris-poole-4chan-google-hire-social-media\">Chris Poole</a>, as an English-language version of popular Japanese image-sharing board 2chan, and split into a number of sub-category boards based on interest, many of the most popular ones pornographic. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/23/4chan-founder-moot-christopher-poole-goodbye\">It was sold by Poole to Nishimura</a>, the founder of 2chan, in 2015. </p> <p>Nishimura did not respond to requests by the Guardian to comment.<br></p> <p>The site\u2019s influence in shaping the identity and culture of the internet as we know it today is vast. It is the internet\u2019s sweaty engine-room. </p> <p>It has birthed global movements: the hacktivist group Anonymous originated here, and the group is named for the \u201cAnonymous\u201d tag attached to 4chan posts.</p> <p>More recently its anonymous message boards, especially the far-right leaning politics board /pol/, gave early succor to GamerGate and its spawn, the so-called alt-right movement, which have emerged in 2016 to ally themselves with Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. </p> <p>It produced Pepe, the frog meme that was picked up by white supremacists and trolls and was later condemned by the Southern Poverty Law Center as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/29/pepe-the-frog-alt-right-mascot-racist-anti-semitic\">a hate symbol</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/29/pepe-the-frog-alt-right-mascot-racist-anti-semitic\">Pepe the Frog: yes, a harmless cartoon can become an alt-right mascot | Oren Segal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pepe is by no means the only meme 4chan has produced. Rickrolling (the practice of tricking someone into clicking on a link leading to a video of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\">Rick Astley\u2019s Never Gonna Give You Up</a>, leading to nearly 250m views on YouTube and an unlikely revival of Astley\u2019s career), LOLcats, and innumerable other memes and slang and inside jokes originated here. </p> <p>It is the internet\u2019s id, a place where anonymity runs free in its purest form. The true nature of mankind can be glimpsed there, in all its horror and glory and depravity.</p> <p>Predictably, the response to Nishimura\u2019s message on the site was mixed. Posters from some boards \u2013 many of which have loyal, almost tribal user-bases \u2013 called for other boards to be closed. </p> <p>One suggestion was to close /b/, the wildly popular random topic board, to which other users expressed immediate worry that /b/ users would spread to other boards. \u201cOh god\u201d, one posted.</p> <p>\u201cHOW MANY PORN BOARDS DO WE NEED? NOT THIS MANY\u201d read another post. Some heatedly discussed the perils of pop-up advertising, while a few suggested merchandising as a way to solve the site\u2019s revenue problems.</p> <p>Others just seemed worried. \u201cPlease don\u2019t fuck this website up for us,\u201d one user plaintively posted. Another wrote: \u201cHiro please. Don\u2019t ruin this for us. This is our only home.\u201d</p>"
