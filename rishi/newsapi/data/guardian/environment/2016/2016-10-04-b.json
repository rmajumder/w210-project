If interest rate rises are passed on at a different rate to cuts it can adversely affect the efficacy of expansionary versus contractionary <a href=\"http://www.rba.gov.au/monetary-policy/\">monetary policy.</a></p> <p>In August 2016, <a href=\"http://www.apra.gov.au/adi/Publications/Pages/monthly-banking-statistics.aspx\">Australian Prudentional Regulation Authority data</a> showed the big four Australian banks held 83% of the home loan market (including both the owner occupier and investment categories).</p> <p>At an individual level, the ability and willingness of lenders to pass on the official interest rate cuts to borrowers depends on many factors. These include exposure to overseas funding sources, market power, the funding mix, reserves and the extent of securitisation. But it\u2019s also clear that delaying interest rate cuts can significantly impact their bottom line.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"760\" responsive=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://c311ba9548948e593297-96809452408ef41d0e4fdd00d5a5d157.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/2016-10-04-Rates-passed/v3/Rates%20slider.html\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>According to my analysis, the big four banks can make approximately $8.6m each day as a group if they do not fully pass on to borrowers a hypothetical 0.25% cut in the Reserve Bank\u2019s cash rate.<br></p> <p>More specifically, if ANZ, CBA, NAB and Westpac manage to postpone lowering their mortgage interest rates, say, by 10 days, they can potentially make an extra $16m, $28m, $16m and $26m dollars in profits, respectively.</p> <p>Previous studies on <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1042443114000559\">mortgages</a>, <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11187-014-9579-z\">small business loans</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13547860.2013.803846\">credit card interest rates</a> have found significant evidence for the \u201crockets and feathers\u201d hypothesis. That is, when the cash rate increases, various lending rates shoot up like rockets \u2013 but when the opposite occurs they go down like feathers.</p> <p>In my research I used monthly data (2000-12) for 39 bank and non-bank financial institutions including seven building societies, 15 Australian-owned banks, three foreign subsidiary banks, 13 credit unions and one major mortgage broker. The research found the mortgage interest rate spread of all lenders rose after the 2008 global financial crisis, albeit to varying degrees.</p> <p>In general <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1042443114000559\">the research shows</a> most building societies and some credit unions can offer more competitive home loans than banks.</p> <p>There is no significant relationship between lenders\u2019 markups and the level of over-the-counter customer service since the 2008 financial crisis. This is an important observation as the mortgage spreads of larger lenders are typically higher than those of their smaller non-bank counterparts. This puts lie to the view that the relatively higher mortgage interest rates of the larger banks in Australia are justified by higher overhead costs associated with the running of their large branch networks.</p> <p>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/abbas-valadkhani-177513\">Abbas Valadkhani</a> is a professor of economics at Swinburne University of Technology.

The figures \u2013 based on data from 89 countries, and representing 84% of the developing world\u2019s population \u2013 indicate that much work will be needed to meet the sustainable development goal of <a href=\"http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/poverty/\">eradicating extreme poverty by 2030</a>.</p> <p>Children are disproportionately affected by extreme poverty \u2013 they make up just a third of the population studied, but comprise half of the extreme poor. They are twice as likely as adults to be living on less than $1.90 a day, the report claims, with 19.5% of children in developing countries living in extremely poor households, compared to just 9.2% of adults. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost a double blow \u2013 firstly, that children are twice as likely as an adult to live in extreme poverty, but also that children are much less likely than an adult to be able to cope with extreme poverty because of stunting, infant mortality, and early childhood development,\u201d said Unicef\u2019s deputy executive director, Justin Forsyth. </p> <p>\u201cExtreme poverty can either kill you, or ruin your potential for the rest of your life.\u201d</p> <p>The report follows the release of World Bank data <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/poverty-and-shared-prosperity\">looking at inequality and poverty worldwide</a>, which found that half of the 767 million people living on less than $1.90 per day in 2013 were under 18.</p> <p>While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/05/world-bank-extreme-poverty-to-fall-below-10-of-world-population-for-first-time\">extreme poverty rates have been halved since 1990</a>, according to the UN, the magnitude of the latest figures indicates that a big funding push will be essential to reverse trends by 2030, says Ana Revenga, senior director of Poverty and Equity at the World Bank Group.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/30/the-country-that-cracked-its-stunting-crisis\">The country that cracked its stunting crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe sheer number of children in extreme poverty points to a real need to invest specifically in the early years \u2013 in services such as pre-natal care for pregnant mothers, early childhood development programmes, quality schooling, clean water, good sanitation and universal healthcare,\u201d said Revenga.</p> <p>\u201cImproving these services, and ensuring that today\u2019s children can access quality job opportunities when the time comes, is the only way to break the cycle of intergenerational poverty that is so widespread today.\u201d</p> <p>Based on the <a href=\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/402511475417572525/pdf/WPS7845.pdf\">limited data in the sample</a>, sub-Saharan Africa not only has the highest percentage of children living in extreme poverty (49%), it is home to the largest share of the world\u2019s extremely poor children (51%). South Asia has the second highest share (36%). One of the most tell-tale signs of extreme poverty is stunting: <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/global-development/2016/sep/30/world-bank-name-and-shame-countries-fail-stunted-children\">about 25% of children under the age of five</a> are so under-nourished that they are too short for their age.</p> <p>The data shows that children in rural areas are nearly three times more likely to live in extreme poverty than those in urban areas. But even children in households with higher incomes are disproportionately affected by poverty: around 45% of children are living in households surviving on less than $3.10 per person per day, compared to just 27% of adults.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e78fc1788d325b1a226bec5049ba3de65adddd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e78fc1788d325b1a226bec5049ba3de65adddd6/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A child and a woman break rocks extracted from a cobalt mine in Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of the Congo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A child and a woman break rocks extracted from a cobalt mine in Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of the Congo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Junior Kannah/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nations affected by conflict, political instability and poor economic management have a higher number of children living in extreme poverty, the data shows. More than half (58%) of children living in such countries live in extremely poor households, according to the report, increasing their risk of inadequate education, healthcare and nutrition. Extreme poverty also increases a child\u2019s risk of being exploited and abused. </p> <p>Unicef and the World Bank are calling on governments to include children in poverty reduction plans and ensure that child poverty is routinely measured and addressed at national levels. Child-sensitive social protection systems, such as cash transfer programmes that pay families directly, are also useful in helping eradicate extreme poverty among children, the report notes.</p> <p>\u201cThis is kind of a wake-up call for everyone in the world who\u2019s thinking about their national poverty plans,\u201d said Forsyth. \u201cWe have to look through the \u2018children\u2019 lens now \u2013 not just children but women and children. We\u2019ve got to focus on things that will particularly benefit very poor families, and very poor children.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>Nearly 250 million young children across the world \u2013 43% of under-fives \u2013 are unlikely to fulfil their potential as adults because of stunting and extreme poverty, new figures show.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The first three years of life are crucial to a child\u2019s development, according to <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/series/ECD2016\">a series of research papers published in the Lancet medical journal</a>, which says there are also economic costs to the failure to help them grow. Those who do not get the nutrition, care and stimulation they need will earn about 26% less than others as adults. </p> <p>\u201cThe costs of not acting immediately to expand services to improve early childhood development are high for individuals and their families, as well as for societies,\u201d say the researchers. The cost to some countries in GDP, they estimate, is as much as twice their spending on healthcare.</p> <p>The figures come as the World Bank prepares for a summit meeting with finance ministers around the globe on Wednesday to discuss how nurturing children in their early years will help their countries\u2019 economic development. The World Bank president, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/30/world-bank-name-and-shame-countries-fail-stunted-children\">Jim Yong Kim, has told the Guardian that he intends to use the World Economic Forum in Davos each year to name and shame countries</a> that do not reduce their high stunting rates.</p> <p>The Lancet series says the first 24 months of life are the critical time for avoiding stunting. Under-nourished children living in extreme poverty end up small and their brain development is affected, so that they find it hard to learn. \u201cSome catch-up is possible in height-for-age after 24 months, with uncertain cognitive gains,\u201d says one of the papers. </p> <p>In sub-Saharan Africa, 66% of children are estimated to be at risk of poor development because of stunting and poverty. In south Asia, the figure is 65%, and 18% in the Caribbean and South America. </p> <p>Mothers need to be well nourished to give their babies a good start in life and be able to breastfeed. Families need help to give children the nutrition and nurturing they need, say researchers. That includes breastfeeding, free pre-school education \u2013 which is available in only two-thirds of high-income countries \u2013 paid leave for parents and a minimum wage to pull more families out of poverty.</p> <p>There are children at risk in all countries, rich and poor. The series points to early childhood programmes that have been effective, including Sure Start in the UK, Early Head Start in the US, Chile\u2019s Crece Contigo and Grade R in South Africa</p> <p>In a Comment piece in the journal, Dr Margaret Chan, director general of the World Health Organisation, Anthony Lake, executive director of the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, and Keith Hansen, vice-president for human development at the World Bank, write: \u201cThe early childhood agenda is truly global, because the need is not limited to low-income countries. Children living in disadvantaged households in middle-income and wealthy countries are also at risk. </p> <p>\u201cIn targeting our investments, we should give priority to populations in the greatest need, such as families and children in extreme poverty and those who require humanitarian assistance. In addition, we have to build more resilient systems in vulnerable communities to mitigate the disruptive influence of natural disasters, fragility, conflict, and violence.\u201d<br></p> <p>Wanda Wyporska, executive director of the Equality Trust, said:<br>\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that the richer you are, the better your health is likely to be. But the chasm of health inequality between rich and poor has widened in recent years. </p> <p>\u201cBeing born into a poor family shouldn\u2019t mean decades of poorer health and even premature death, but that\u2019s the shameful reality of the UK\u2019s health gap.

There\u2019s only so much stick a manager can take and there has to be a point where the players look at themselves and say: \u2018This is not good enough.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cWith Sam, it came from nowhere. I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s a mess, but it\u2019s not nice for our game. I saw Alan Shearer say English football has become a laughing stock and, while it\u2019s hard to say, I agree a bit: with a manager losing his job after one game. It\u2019s not good in any sense and, whatever stance the FA takes after the four games [initially earmarked for Southgate in his role as interim manager], I hope the next England manager will be one for the long-term and help us to improve and get better in tournaments.</p> <p>\u201cBut the players, the manager and all the staff have got to take it on ourselves to try to lift the opinion of English football over the next few games, starting with a positive performance on Saturday against Malta and then another positive performance against Slovenia next week.\u201d</p> <p>That message was touched upon by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/03/gareth-southgate-england-manager\" title=\"\">Southgate in a team meeting</a> held to welcome the squad to St George\u2019s Park and debrief the Slovakia performance.</p> <p>Rose sent Allardyce a text following confirmation he was to leave his position after only 67 days in charge, \u201cthanking him for including me in his first England squad and allowing me to earn another cap\u201d. The 61-year-old duly texted back on Sunday, wishing him luck and commenting on the duel between the left\u2011back and City\u2019s Raheem Sterling which had left Rose with stud marks on his shin.</p> <p>The winger has since withdrawn from the squad with a calf injury, and was followed on Tuesday by Glen Johnson. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/04/injured-glen-johnson-replaced-england-squad-michael-keane\" title=\"\">Burnley\u2019s uncapped defender, Michael Keane, has since joined Southgate\u2019s party</a>.</p> <p>The Spurs defender, who would favour the appointment of an Englishman to the role full-time, suggested the 10 days Allardyce spent with his players around the game in Slovakia had actually left an impression, hinting at a legacy of sorts. \u201cSam introduced a few team bonding skills \u2013 it was only going to improve us a little bit, but the environment didn\u2019t need changing too much,\u201d Rose said.</p> <p>\u201cThere was quite a lot of team bonding, and team building skills, which he felt would help us improve. A lot of stuff like that. It was good, I enjoyed it. He got us into three different groups on one of the activities and you had to go and sit with someone who you are not really close with or hadn\u2019t spent much time with before, and you had to find out when the birthdays are, where they are from, who was the biggest inspiration in their lives ... stuff like that. I was with John Stones and we\u2019re from the same part of the world, and I wouldn\u2019t have know that if we hadn\u2019t done that exercise.\u201d</p> <p>Rose and his Tottenham club-mates arrived at the national set-up buoyed by their eye-catching display against City, which has hoisted them to the leaders\u2019 shoulder in the Premier League. \u201cIt\u2019s still very much early days, but I do feel as if we deserved to win that match,\u201d he added. \u201cWe showed Manchester City are beatable. The manager had a game-plan and he knows how to beat Pep Guardiola\u2019s teams as he\u2019d done in Spain, and we fully deserved the win at the weekend. I\u2019m not being cocky or anything, but I felt we were pretty comfortable as well.</p> <p>\u201cThe manager just sets out his game plan from the start of the week, with even the smallest details like (what we should do) from goal kicks. Things like that. He knew what he wanted us to do. We did it and we did it to full capacity. I haven\u2019t had the chance to speak to Mauricio, but I know that he will be over the moon after the game we played on Sunday.\u201d</p>",

Abbott knows that the Liberal rank and file admires the One Nation founder.

  "<p>Michael Saunders, the most recent appointee to the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate setting committee, is to warn that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/15/bank-of-england-leaves-interest-rates-unchanged\">the Bank\u2019s forecasts of weak growth next year</a> are likely to be wrong and the economy could recover strongly from the dip after the Brexit vote.</p> <p>Speaking to business leaders in Manchester on Wednesday, the former investment banker will say the economy was more resilient than many economists believed, including officials at the bank, and may grow at an accelerated pace in 2017.</p> <p>But he is to hint that he is unlikely to vote for a rate rise in the next few months following his assessment of the labour market, which showed the bank\u2019s forecasts of strong wage rises in 2017 and 2018 were optimistic.</p> <p>He will say employers are in a position to use Britain\u2019s flexible employment laws to keep wages in check, even when unemployment fell well below the 5% level Threadneedle Street has agreed should trigger higher wage claims.</p> <p>\u201cMy policy vote will probably depend on which of these factors is dominating,\u201d he will say. </p> <p>Saunders voted to keep interest rates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/15/bank-of-england-leaves-interest-rates-unchanged\">unchanged at a record low 0.25% last month</a>, at his first monetary policy committee meeting since joining the Bank from the US banking group Citi, where he was the chief UK economist. <br></p> <p>Britain\u2019s economy will likely \u201cnot be too bad\u201d in the year ahead, barring a sharp rise in global or Brexit-related uncertainty, according to the text of his speech released on Tuesday. </p> <p>The comments echo those of fellow policymaker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/22/bank-of-england-interest-rate-cut-to-025-should-prevent-recession\">Kristin Forbes</a>, who said recently that business surveys indicated the economy has fared better than feared after June\u2019s EU referendum.</p> <p>After its policy meeting in early September, the Bank said most officials expected to cut rates again this year if growth looked on track to slow broadly as forecast in August. </p> <p>Saunders will emphasise that the Bank has plenty of ammunition left in its arsenal if the economy fares worse \u2013 or better \u2013 than it expects in future.</p> <p>He is to say interest rates could start to rise as early as next year if the economy proves resilient, taking to task economists who believe lacklustre global trade growth, flexible labour markets and persistently low business investment will limit the scope for rate rises.</p> <p>Saunders will also say a reversal in the UK\u2019s fortunes, provoking a slump in GDP growth, could be countered with an expansion of the Bank\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/qe-quantitative-easing-all-you-need-to-know\">quantitative easing programme</a> and a further cut in the base rate to zero.<br><br>The Bank has substantial scope for further stimulus through asset purchases if required, he will say.</p>",
  "<p>The first incumbent described his post as \u201cthe most impossible job on this earth\u201d. Trygve Lie had only 50-odd nations to wrangle, but found the combination of backroom politicking, public profile and organisational management too much. Whoever takes the reins from Ban Ki-moon as UN secretary general this year will inherit 193 member states, plus a mammoth, haphazardly evolved bureaucracy \u2013 and a poisonous schism at the heart of the security council.</p> <p>That split <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/26/lot-of-factors-east-west-north-south-inside-the-race-for-un-secretary-general\" title=\"\">is likely to determine who triumphs</a>. Wednesday\u2019s <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ecfr/ecfrs-world-in-30-minutes-who-will-be-the-next-un-secretary-general\" title=\"\">straw poll</a> may give the first clear hint, since permanent members will use coloured ballots, indicating a likely veto, for the first time. When the race began, two criteria seemed pressing: that it was eastern Europe\u2019s turn, and that <a href=\"http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2016/8/ed-statement-on-a-woman-as-sg\" title=\"\">a woman should take charge</a> for the first time. Rotation by region is standard; one woman after eight men does not seem excessive. <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Backsliding on more equal representation</a> in the ranks, after initial progress under Mr Ban, makes the issue more important. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the former Portuguese prime minister who ticks neither box, clearly led his rivals in the indicative straw polls; but Bulgaria\u2019s decision to switch candidates from Unesco\u2019s Irina Bokova (acceptable to Russia, but not the UK or US) has brought EU budget chief Kristalina Georgieva into the race as an alternative female eastern European candidate.</p> <p>The real question is not who but what the ninth secretary general is. The UN charter says little about the organisation\u2019s top job, which is defined by the incumbent and circumstance. No one can meet every standard, and people often seek the qualities lacking in the last holder as well as those that seem most needed in the hour of choice. Mr Ban has been admired for his persistence in convening, prodding and cajoling governments to make progress on climate change, but there is hunger for a strong crisis negotiator or charismatic moral force. Mr Guterres and Ms Georgieva appear keen to be strong humanitarian activists \u2013 which is, of course, not endearing to Russia. Less conspicuous, but crucial, is the need to whip UN humanitarian and peacekeeping operations into shape. There is <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/uk/news/latest/2016/6/5763b65a4/global-forced-displacement-hits-record-high.html\" title=\"\">record displacement</a> due to war and persecution globally: 65 million, equivalent to 24 people fleeing every minute. The UN has 100,000 peacekeepers worldwide, but they are stretched thin and already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/21/the-guardian-view-on-un-peacekeeping-admirable-aims-but-a-troubled-record\" title=\"\">beset by failures to protect, abuses and cover-ups</a>.</p> <p>This demanding role has only the authority it is permitted to have by the great powers, and has always been filled by negotiations between them. Perhaps that is appropriate. Despite the job\u2019s aura of sanctity, the secretary general requires the icy realism to make necessary compromises, as well as the most passionate idealism, to seek the best possible outcome. What no one expected was how badly relations between Russia and the west would have degenerated by this point. It will be dismaying if the appointment is made purely on the basis of who is least offensive and which favours can be traded for support.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the initial push to transform the contest, by the <a href=\"http://www.1for7billion.org\" title=\"\">1 for 7 Billion</a> grassroots campaign and others, has had real impact. They have put ordinary citizens, whom the secretary general should ultimately serve, at the heart of the process. The result has been unprecedented transparency: a public slate of candidates, who have been obliged to present a vision for the UN and engage with member states. Those changes should be valued and built upon in the next contest.</p> <p>Before that, however, another of 1 for 7 Billion\u2019s suggestions should be enacted: for the secretary general to serve a single, non-renewable term of seven years rather than, as has become routine, two terms of five years. This could be implemented immediately; no amendment to the UN charter is required. Instead of wasting one term lobbying for the second, the holder would be able to concentrate on the job. Instead of trying to avoid alienating the security council\u2019s permanent members, he or she would be freed to act more boldly and decisively; strikingly, as he heads for the exit, Mr Ban has become increasingly outspoken in denouncing the \u201cdepravity\u201d of much that has happened in the war in Syria.</p> <p>For that very reason, one may expect resistance to the suggestion. It would also, admittedly, create the risk of a longer lame-duck period. But it would help the next leader&#xa0;to effect the changes needed for the UN to continue functioning in the face of mounting challenges. That is something which everyone has a stake in, and it is why the security council should step up and embrace this proposal.</p>",
  "<p>Theresa May has the admirable intention of restoring confidence in government by paying careful attention to the discontents of the 52% who voted Brexit. She recognises that many who voted leave did so from a sense that Westminster had yielded control of important policies, most notably immigration, to Brussels. That is partly the consequence of setting a target for net migration that was unachievable. Mrs May spent six years trying to make it work against internal opposition from the Lib Dems, and sometimes from George Osborne\u2019s Treasury. It was <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11329609/George-Osborne-sees-off-Theresa-Mays-controversial-plan-to-deport-foreign-graduates.html\" title=\"\">Mr Osborne who vetoed a manifesto pledge</a> to prevent international students staying on after they had finished their studies. But international students stayed in Mrs May\u2019s sights, one of the few points of traction in the government\u2019s efforts to bring net migration down below 100,000.</p> <p>Now her successor at the Home Office, Amber Rudd, <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/10/full-text-amber-rudds-conference-speech/\" title=\"\">in a speech that was startlingly hardline</a>, is planning a new attack on the numbers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live\" title=\"\">students coming to Britain to study</a>. Ms Rudd wants to impose different tests for applicants to different universities and colleges. The net effect is likely to be a cut in the numbers taking shorter courses or attending the post-1992 universities that offer more accessible degree subjects, and a blow to their viability, since international students account for 30% of university revenue. This is a bad policy. It imposes new bureaucratic burdens on all universities, and might seriously undermine newer ones that serve an important local role. It will be hard to enforce. Worse, it is based <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/publications/destination-education\" title=\"\">on flaky and contested evidence</a> about how many students stay after they have completed their course of study: last year, just 11,100 people who previously held study visas <a href=\"http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/non-european-student-migration-to-the-uk/\" title=\"\">were granted extensions to remain in the UK</a> in a category other than study. But the government relies on the International Passenger Survey, which suggests as many as 100,000 international students might stay on. With such a dubious evidence base, it seems unlikely that these latest moves will dent the net migration figures \u2013 while further souring an atmosphere where anti-migrant attacks already appear legitimised by the Brexit campaign. A sceptical public will have yet more evidence that migration is a problem the politicians cannot solve.</p> <p>Mrs May\u2019s Home Office legacy is the Immigration Act 2016, a piece of legislation expressly intended to create \u201c<a href=\"https://www.jcwi.org.uk/blog/2016/05/23/what%E2%80%99s-next-hostile-environment-immigration-act-2016-and-queen%E2%80%99s-speech\" title=\"\">a hostile environment for illegal migration</a>\u201d. Ms Rudd is on to it, announcing that the measures criminalising landlords who let property to illegal migrants and introducing compulsory immigration status checks on all taxi drivers will be in force by the end of the year. She made one positive announcement: a new \u201ccontrolling migration\u201d fund, at \u00a3140m nearly three times bigger than Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s proposal last week. But along with supporting hard-pressed public services, the fund will be used to help councils stamp down on wrongly claimed housing benefit and rough sleeping.</p> <p>Of the great humanitarian crisis engulfing millions of refugees, or the slow progress on uniting unaccompanied children with their British-based families, Ms Rudd said not a word. And every time a minister announces a crackdown on illegal migration, they add to the impression of an ill-defined, uncontrolled threat. Ms Rudd was a banker. She should know the value of robust evidence and reliable statistics. That is the only basis for policy.</p>",

  "<p>The pound has fallen to a 31-year low amid signs that the UK government is leading the country into a hard exit from the European Union. At the same time, the FTSE 100 \u2013 Britain\u2019s most prestigious stock market index \u2013 is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/ftse-100-near-record-high-pound-31-year-low\">close to reaching an all time high</a>. Why is Britain\u2019s currency suffering while shares in its biggest companies are soaring? </p> <h2>Why has the pound fallen?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/brexit-theresa-may-prioritises-immigration-curbs-over-free-movement\">Theresa May sent a strong signal on Sunday</a> that curbs on immigration were more important than remaining inside the EU\u2019s single market. Investors take a dim view of the UK pulling out of the EU\u2019s tariff-free zone. They also don\u2019t like the notion of restrictions on immigration that deny employers vital staff. Both policies will reduce GDP growth, they believe. </p> <p>Investors began to sell the pound soon after the speech and the momentum increased following a warning from the chancellor of the exchequer on Monday that the next two years will be a difficult time for the economy. On Tuesday, May repeated her warning that a hard Brexit was likely, which provoked another round of selling.</p> <h2>Why, at the same time, is the stock market rising?</h2> <p>There are two key reasons. The first is that many FTSE 100 firms earn their revenues in dollars. Among them are the largest on the London exchange: oil majors BP and Shell; the mining companies BHP Billiton and Anglo American; and banks such as HSBC. As the value of dollars rises versus the pound, the profits of these companies increase. They become more valuable and the stock market goes up as a consequence.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Second, share prices have been increasing all year in response to prevarication by the US central bank, which has struggled to raise interest rates despite signalling a willingness to do so. The Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are already offering zero or negative interest rates. If the Federal Reserve cannot increase rates from the current 0.5%, then investors must put their money into shares in order to earn a return. </p> <h2>Does it matter that the pound is falling?</h2> <p>The pound was worth $1.55 last October. Now it is hovering around $1.27. A year ago the pound bought \u20ac1.34. Like the dollar, the euro is also stronger and a pound will buy a little less than \u20ac1.12. According to some economists the 20% drop against the dollar and even bigger slide against the euro is a good thing, boosting exports and deterring the consumption of increasingly expensive imports. This gives manufacturing sales a lift and helps the balance of payments, which is in a significant deficit currently. It is also hoped that holidaymakers will want to stay at home, spending their money in British resorts and not continental destinations.</p> <p>The alternative view is that the pound\u2019s value is a measure of the country\u2019s worth relative to other nations and the recent falls means the UK is probably not the fifth largest economy in the world anymore, but the sixth or seventh.</p> <h2>Can the pound fall too far?</h2> <p>A trap door might open under sterling should the Tory messaging around a hard Brexit be taken as a sure sign that Britain will be shut out of the single market altogether. The pound almost reached parity with the dollar in the mid 1980s, but only for a brief period. It would be considered by most economists to be a huge vote of no confidence in the economy if there was a repetition.</p> <h2>Is the stock market too high?</h2> <p>The MSCI index of global stock markets is around the same level as before the 2008 financial crash. This is a huge worry, especially when much of the money in stocks and shares in the UK, the US, Japan and Frankfurt is invested by default. In other words, it is invested by fund managers who cannot get a decent return on other assets, especially corporate and government bonds. Therefore, the rising value of global stock markets is not related to profits, which are flat or declining, but just the welter of cash pouring into the exchanges. If there is an economic shock of some kind, it could trigger a panic, and then markets would have a long way to fall. </p>",

Fourth area: home control. If you have a smart home (you probably do not have a smart home) you can control it with your voice.

It can play music (in this case, YouTube music), and you can control that with your voice. It also does other streaming options, like Spotify and Google Play Music. Yes, Google has two streaming music options. No, I don\u2019t really know why either. You also can listen to podcasts, or cast audio to the Assistant.</p> <p>Current count of distinguishing features against the Echo: two.

If you want, Assistant will read your emails and calendar, and offer you a personalised precis of your day.

Yes, Google sold some consumer electronics with a few of its own phones and Glass. Yes, Google has a delivery business for local goods. (And, it will definitely be interesting to watch if Google looks to use Amazon as a distribution channel). But Google also doesn\u2019t have near the track record for mobile instant messaging that companies like Facebook and WeChat have. Platforms like Allo become essential when they have hundreds of millions of daily active users. The year 2016 is late to be starting with 0.</p> </blockquote> <p>E-commerce specialists Salmon think the launch marks the rise of \u201cprogrammatic commerce\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Like Amazon Echo and British Gas\u2019 Hive, Google is entering the increasingly competitive market of connected devices in the home.

It came tantalisingly close to beating that landmark before a last-minute spate of profit taking.</p> <p>However, the FTSE 250 mid-cap index closed at a new peak, as investors shrugged off the gloom that surrounded markets at the start of the year and in the aftermath of the UK\u2019s EU referendum in June.</p> <p>The share gains came as the pound dropped to its worst level since June 1985, falling to $1.2721, down 0.9%. Against the euro, sterling hit a three-year low of \u20ac1.1365, down 0.8%.</p> <p>The latest falls in the currency followed Theresa May\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws\">announcement on Sunday that the government would trigger the process of leaving the European Union by the end of March 2017</a>, as well as subsequent comments suggesting it would place a priority on restricting immigration into the UK, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/brexit-theresa-may-prioritises-immigration-curbs-over-free-movement\">even at the expense of leaving the single market</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-04T16:51:12/embed.html\" data-alt=\"FTSE100\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-04T16:51:12/embed.html\">FTSE100</a> </figure>  <p>The pound has also been hit by the Bank of England <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">cutting interest rates in August </a>and suggesting further reductions could come later in the year.</p> <p>May told the BBC that the UK\u2019s economy was strong and currencies \u201cof course go up and down\u201d.</p> <p>Many analysts believe the pound has further to fall. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at betting firm Spreadex, said: \u201cIt seems that it is going to be hard to provide a tourniquet for sterling\u2019s recent wounds given the solidity of the newly announced Brexit timeline ... and the firmness with which May stated her intention to chase border control even if it means relinquishing Britain\u2019s position in the single market.\u201d</p> <p>Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said: \u201cA move down to $1.25, and even $1.20 is now a possibility ... The all-time low for the pound/dollar from March 1985 is $1.05. We don\u2019t expect to return to these lows; back in 1985 the pound only briefly dipped to $1.05 before recovering sharply.\u201d </p> <p>But the weakness in the pound helped lift the international companies and exporters which dominate the FTSE 100, making their goods cheaper for foreign buyers and boosting their profits.</p> <p>Trevor Green, head of UK Equities at fund manager Aviva Investors, said the market was being driven by different factors to a year ago, when optimism over the health of the eurozone helped push shares upwards. He said: \u201cThe dynamics driving the index towards a record high are different from [2015], when we last witnessed the index go over 7,000. Then it was about falling oil prices and optimism on the eurozone recovery. This time, it materially revolves around currency ... Overseas earners benefit from the translation of these earnings back to sterling, leading to a succession of companies upgrading their earnings forecasts for currency alone.\u201d</p> <p>The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/ftse-100-near-record-high-pound-31-year-low\">index of Britain\u2019s 100 largest listed companies closed up 90.82 points or 1.3% to reach 7074.34</a>, a revival of 28% since it hit a 2016 low of 5537 in February. At that point, investors were unnerved by signs of a global slowdown, a plunge in the oil price and worries about the effect of low interest rates on bank balance sheets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-04T16:52:04/embed.html\" data-alt=\"FTSE 250\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-04T16:52:04/embed.html\">FTSE 250</a> </figure>  <p>The FTSE is also 18% higher than the 5982 level it fell to in June following the Brexit vote.</p> <p>The more domestically focussed FTSE 250 jumped 0.87% to 18,342.07. Again the pound\u2019s weakness helped make company valuations more attractive to both overseas investors and possible predators seeking takeovers.</p> <p>The index was also lifted by signs that dire warnings of recession made before the Brexit vote looked misplaced, at least for the moment. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/construction-sector-housebuilding-post-referendum-slump-brexit-vote\">UK construction bounced back in September</a></strong>, according to the latest Markit/Cips survey, with its purchasing managers\u2019 index rising to a better-than-expected 52.3 from 49.2 in August, the first increase since March.

Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cLower interest rates have also given the stock market a leg up, because with cash and bonds yielding next to nothing, equities are the natural alternative for anyone looking for a decent level of income.</p> <p>\u201cNor will there be any shortage of income-seekers at the moment, as millions of baby boomers are reaching retirement age, while the recent pension freedoms conveniently allow them to park their retirement funds in the stock market rather than buying an annuity.\u201d</p> <p>However, analysts also pointed out that if the weakness of the pound is taken into account and is balanced against the FTSE\u2019s performance last year when the pound was stronger, the index has actually fallen around 2% so far this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-04T16:52:34/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Pound v Dollar\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-04T16:52:34/embed.html\">Pound v Dollar</a> </figure>",

The all-time low from March 1985 is $1.05 to the pound. <br></p> <p>John Wraith, head of UK rates strategy at UBS, was equally pessimistic about a recovery of the pound, warning that it could suffer a fate similar to that during the financial crisis. <br></p> <p>\u201cWhen the global financial crisis entered its acute phase, sterling resumed its rapid decline, falling a further 20% by the end of 2008. Although different in its underlying causes, a similar pattern of decline, pause and fresh falls may be unfolding now,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p><strong></strong></p> <p>The vast patch of garbage floating in the Pacific Ocean is far worse than previously thought, with an aerial survey finding a much larger mass of fishing nets, plastic containers and other discarded items than imagined.</p> <p>A reconnaissance flight taken in a modified C-130 Hercules aircraft found a vast clump of mainly plastic waste at the northern edge of what is known as the \u201c<a href=\"https://marinedebris.noaa.gov/info/patch.html\">great Pacific garbage patch</a>\u201d, located between Hawaii and California.</p> <p>The density of rubbish was several times higher than the <a href=\"https://www.theoceancleanup.com/\">Ocean Cleanup</a>, a foundation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/22/dutch-prototype-clean-up-boom-brings-pacific-plastics-solution-a-step-closer\">part-funded by the Dutch government</a> to rid the oceans of plastics, expected to find even at the heart of the patch, where most of the waste is concentrated.</p> <p>\u201cNormally when you do an aerial survey of dolphins or whales, you make a sighting and record it,\u201d said Boyan Slat, the founder of the Ocean Cleanup. </p> <p>\u201cThat was the plan for this survey.

The north Pacific gyre has accumulated a soup of plastic waste, including large items and smaller broken-down micro plastics that can be eaten by fish and enter the food chain.</p> <p>According to the UN environmental programme, the great Pacific garbage patch is growing so fast that it, like the Great Wall of China, is becoming visible from space. </p> <p>Last year, the Ocean Cleanup sent 30 vessels to cross the patch to scoop up micro plastics in fine nets to estimate the extent of the problem. However, the new reconnaissance flights from California have found that large items of more than half a meter in size have been \u201cheavily underestimated\u201d.</p> <p>Slat said: \u201cMost of the debris was large stuff.

A prototype of the vulcanized rubber barrier will be tested next year, with a full-sized 100km (62-mile) barrier deployed by 2020 if trials go well.</p> <p>The boom will not be able to suck up all of the strewn rubbish, however, with Slat warning that plastic is \u201cquite persistent. We need to clean it up, but we also need to prevent so much entering the oceans. Better recycling, better product design and some legislation is all part of that. We need a combination of things.\u201d</p> <p>The full scale of plastic pollution <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/10/full-scale-plastic-worlds-oceans-revealed-first-time-pollution\">was revealed in 2014</a>, when a study found there were more than 5tn pieces of plastic floating in our oceans.

  "<p>Scotland stands to gain significant levels of independence over farming, fisheries and areas of industrial policy if it can strike the right deal with UK ministers after Brexit, the Scottish parliament has been told.</p> <p>Prof Alan Page, an expert on public law at Dundee University, told MSPs <a href=\"http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/CurrentCommittees/100259.aspx\">investigating the impact of leaving the EU</a> that Holyrood would be free to fix a minimum price for alcohol.

Other experts warn Scotland would need to be flexible on foreign fishing quotas in Scottish waters to avoid damaging UK trade deals. <br></p> <p>The advice will be seized on by opposition parties, particularly the Tories, and a handful of Scottish National party MSPs \u2013 including the former health secretary Alex Neil, now pressing the Scottish government to maximise the \u201cBrexit dividend\u201d.</p> <p>Neil said Page\u2019s report did not mention Holyrood\u2019s opportunity to take on VAT, which raises \u00a38.3bn a year in Scotland.

Scottish ministers would need to watch carefully to make sure that did not take away existing powers, Page said. </p> <p>\u201cIn my view, this represents a significant potential gap in the framework of Scottish parliamentary control over UK law making in the devolved areas, which the Scottish parliament should be alert to the need to close should UK ministers be given the power to revise EU law in the devolved areas,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The professor said Brexit would still leave Westminster and the UK government in control of the bulk of EU powers, including over trade, free movement of workers and employment law, banking and services within the UK.</p> <p>It was likely, he said, that the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/11/section/13/enacted\">Scotland Act, which sets out Holyrood\u2019s powers</a>, would need to be overhauled to clarify the extent of the Scottish parliament\u2019s autonomy and the need for UK approval after Brexit. </p> <p>Ministers will also need to invest heavily in new regulators and expertise in many of these areas, to take on policy areas currently controlled by the EU.</p> <p>Jackson Carlaw, the deputy leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said there was a risk that if Scotland was too out of step with the UK on some areas, it would damage trade deals. Even so \u201cthere are tremendous opportunities without the EU being a controlling authority, for the Scottish parliament to have much more control over many of the areas which come back to the UK\u201d, he said.</p>",

This, at least, suggests Continuity Osborne. The cuts ordered by the former chancellor are still there. Nothing Green said today suggested any material change to the broad thrust of Tory welfare strategy: the cuts to universal credit work allowances remain; nasty Cameron-era wheezes such as the benefit cap stay (though no longer warrant a mention); pensioner benefits will be protected.</p> <p>The centrepiece of Green\u2019s speech was work and disability. It\u2019s been18 months since the Tories ambitiously promised in their 2015 election general manifesto to halve the disability employment gap, but it is still not clear how they will achieve it. Halving the gap means getting over a million more disabled and chronically ill people into a job by 2020. Ministers no longer seem to mention that figure anymore. Duncan-Smith promised a disability employment white paper in January, but his successor Stephen Crabb halted it. Green promises a green paper \u201csoon\u201d.

And she delivered what was probably the most policy-rich speech delivered to the conference so far.</p> <p>Rudd mostly focused on immigration. She said people sent a clear message to politicians when they voted to leave the EU and she said the government was committed to getting net migration down to sustainable levels. \u201cThis means tens of thousands, not the hundreds of thousands,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Specifically she announced plans to cut the number of people coming to the UK to work or to study. (Until the UK leaves the EU these proposals would only affect migrants from outside the EU.)</p> <p>She also announced a controlling migration fund, an idea that has also been proposed by Labour.</p> <p>Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Rudd announced that she was setting up a new \u00a3140m controlling migration fund. </strong>Jeremy Corbyn is committed to bringing back the migration impact fund (created by Labour but scrapped by the coalition) and at the Labour conference last week he suggested it might be worth \u00a350m over two years. Rudd said her proposal would go further.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You might have heard that Jeremy Corbyn wants the government to bring back a migration fund Gordon Brown introduced after Labour let immigration spiral out of control ...</p> <p>Labour\u2019s fund was ineffective and focused funding on migrants rather than the pressures caused by migration ...</p> <p>We will deliver on our manifesto commitment and set up a new \u00a3140m controlling migration fund \u2013 designed specifically to ease the pressures on public services in areas of high migration.</p> <p>And at the same time it will implement strategies to reduce illegal immigration.</p> <p>The fund will build on work we have done to support local authorities \u2026to stop giving housing benefit to people that have no right to be in the country \u2026 to reduce rough sleeping by illegal immigrants \u2026 and to crack down on the rogue landlords who house illegal migrants in the most appalling conditions.</p> <p>And for those that are here legally, we will provide more English language support. And with it, the obvious benefits of being able to join the way of life in the country they have chosen to call home.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she would consult on plans to make it harder for firms to bring in foreign workers.</strong> The Home Office would soon be consulting on measures to curb immigration, focusing on changes to the rules for the work and study routes, she said. On work she said she would be \u201cexamining whether we should tighten the test companies have to take before recruiting from abroad.\u201d</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>British businesses have driven the economic recovery in this country, with employment at record levels.</p> <p>However we still need to do more \u2026 so all British people get the opportunities they need to get on in life.</p> <p>The test should ensure people coming here are filling gaps in the labour market, not taking jobs British people could do.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she wanted to toughen the immigration rules for foreign students studying at low quality colleges.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will also look for the first time at whether our student immigration rules should be tailored to the quality of the course and the quality of the educational institution.</p> <p>I\u2019m proud that we have world-leading centres of academic excellence. It\u2019s a testament to our country\u2019s proud history and our top universities\u2019 ability to evolve.</p> <p>But the current system allows all students, irrespective of their talents and the university\u2019s quality, favourable employment prospects when they stop studying.</p> <p>While an international student is studying here, their family members can do any form of work.</p> <p>And foreign students, even those studying English Language degrees, don\u2019t even have to be proficient in speaking English. We need to look at whether this one size fits all approach really is right for the hundreds of different universities, providing thousands of different courses across the country ...</p> <p>Our consultation will ask what more can we do to support our best universities - and those that stick to the rules - to attract the best talent \u2026 while looking at tougher rules for students on lower quality courses.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said the government would make it easier to deport foreign criminals. </strong>EU migrants who repeatedly commit so-called minor crimes will be deported, she said.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the first time, we will deport EU nationals that repeatedly commit so-called minor crimes in this country.</p> <p>So-called minor crime is still crime \u2013 its pain is still felt deeply by victims.</p> <p>Well, those criminals will face being banned from coming back to the country from between 5 and 10 years.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she would soon be implementing legislation already passed to tighten controls on immigrants in the UK.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today, I am announcing that from December, landlords that knowingly rent out property to people who have no right to be here will be committing a criminal offence. They could go to prison.</p> <p>Furthermore, from December, immigration checks will be a mandatory requirement for those wanting to get a licence to drive a taxi.</p> <p>And from next autumn, banks will have to do regular checks to ensure they are not providing essential banking services to illegal migrants.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she would be publishing the next phase of the government\u2019s counter-terrorism strategy later this year.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She said she would extend the unduly lenient sentencing scheme to cover all terrorism cases heard in the crown court.</strong> This scheme allows people to ask the attorney general to look again at sentenced deemed unduly lenient.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She said she would soon legislate to try to tackle the financing of crime and terrorism.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is an obvious point \u2013 but financial profit is the principal driver for almost all serious and organised crime.</p> <p>Our new legislation will give new powers to law enforcement agencies to track the criminals involved down \u2026 criminals who are laundering something in the region $1.6 trillion globally, every year.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae0d3c4cab96aef0d7d124850aa121e9f7d71595\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae0d3c4cab96aef0d7d124850aa121e9f7d71595/0_115_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amber Rudd addressing the Conservative conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amber Rudd addressing the Conservative conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-04T13:06:27.430Z\">at 2.06pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f391e2e4b05e7633c58514\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-04T11:27:27.672Z\">12.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is Boris Johnson out running in Birmingham this morning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"acb49618b3dc2dbdcd3d0b7a42036e9ab34a3ab7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acb49618b3dc2dbdcd3d0b7a42036e9ab34a3ab7/0_33_2517_1510/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson (centre) takes an early morning run at the conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson (centre) takes an early morning run at the conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>UPDATE: </em>Johnson was running with the Sun editor, Tony Gallagher, who is in front in the picture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/murrayf00te/status/783235743518949376\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tonygallagher\">@tonygallagher</a> did you train for that run? <a href=\"https://t.co/u025vkdHkg\">pic.twitter.com/u025vkdHkg</a></p>&mdash; Murray Foote (@murrayf00te) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/murrayf00te/status/783235743518949376\">October 4, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tonygallagher/status/783236233329868800\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/murrayf00te\">@murrayf00te</a> No idea who that strange blond bloke is in my wake</p>&mdash; Tony Gallagher (@tonygallagher) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tonygallagher/status/783236233329868800\">October 4, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-04T12:47:28.341Z\">at 1.47pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f38c9de4b0a497243b6d40\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-04T11:20:39.794Z\">12.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Liz Truss's speech - Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Liz Truss</strong>, the justice secretary, spoke after Michael Fallon.

On the Today programme Nick Robinson asked whether, in the light of her desire to help people on average incomes (who do not benefit from this cut), she would reverse it. May ignored the question. She also dodged questions from Robinson about whether she favoured building more council homes, or putting up public sector pay. (May probably does think the inheritance tax cut was a bad idea.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/08/grammar-schools-theresa-may-plans-for-inclusive-grammar-schools-slammed-politics-live?page=with:block-57d16d8ae4b07ac3d446a3ad#block-57d16d8ae4b07ac3d446a3ad\"> Nick Timothy, her highly-influential co-chief of staff, has strongly criticised it in the past.)</a></p> <p><strong>3 - When May thinks net migration will be cut below 100,000. </strong>May said she was still committed to this as a target, but she refused to say when it would be met.

May did not answer directly, although she did say that she had always argued that the sky would not fall in if Britain did leave the EU. She was now focused on the future, she said.

May said that was a comment about a specific policy. She refused to say who she wanted to win the US presidential election.</p> <p><strong>6 - What she regrets.</strong> Pointing out that she has just turned 60, Morgan asked her if she had any regrets.

I\u2019m accustomed to posting about the \u2018things we\u2019ve learnt\u2019 from events like this, but this morning I will do a post about all the things we did not learn from May\u2019s media round.</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t entirely unproductive. We did get something out of it. Here are six things about May that we did find out.</p> <p><strong>1 - May says injustice makes her angry.</strong> At the end of his Today interview Nick Robinson asked May what made her argument, saying that this was a question that often revealed what motivated people to go into politics. May did not have to think for long before giving a firm answer.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Injustice. What makes me angry? Child sexual abuse. Modern slavery. When we see the powerful abusing their position. That\u2019s what makes me angry.</p> </blockquote> <p>It would be wrong to say that she was fired up with emotion, but she did answer the question with a sincerity and directness that was lacking from her earlier answers. And it is not an answer that David Cameron would have given, at least not with the same level of conviction. Later, on LBC, May was also quite forceful when she explained that she was committed to the child abuse inquiry because she thought some victims had been denied justice for years.

May said she did not object.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, it is interesting that people focus on my shoes. I don\u2019t think they focus on Philip Hammond\u2019s or Boris Johnson\u2019s in quite the same way. But, look, do I regret that fact that people look at my shoes? Hey, it gives me an excuse to go and buy new shoes.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>4 - May seems to be playing down her commitment to building new grammar schools.</strong> She was asked about the policy in various interviews and, although she did not go back on anything previously announced, it was noticeable that she was keen to stress that the policy she is proposing is about much more than building grammar schools. She described the policy in terms of lifting the ban on selection, and said it was only one aspect of a plan to create more good school places. (Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary, has suggested<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimwaterson/nicky-morgan-suggests-theresa-may-is-about-to-water-down-gra?utm_term=.cedj8wNreO#.soBQw615D8\"> in a BuzzFeed interview that she thinks the government is about to compromise on its plans.)</a></p> <p><strong>5 - May can make a good impression on interviewers. </strong>At the end of the Good Morning Britain interview <strong>Piers Morgan</strong>, the presenter, said: \u201cShe\u2019s a nice lady, Theresa May.\u201d His co-presenter, <strong>Susanna Reid</strong>, added: \u201cShe\u2019s very open and honest.\u201d It is not the sort of thing John Humphrys would ever say on the Today programme, but it is interesting. I don\u2019t recall Morgan and Reid making comments like that about David Cameron. And at the end of his Sky interview, <strong>Eamonn Holmes</strong> told her he was leaving the show, before adding: \u201cI would like to thank you for all your courtesy through the years, putting up with my banal, inane questioning.\u201d</p> <p><strong>6 - May may not commit to \u201chard\u201d over \u201csoft\u201d regarding Brexit, but she does for cooking. </strong>On Good Morning Britain Morgan asked about cooking scones (May is keen on cooking, and the Sunday Times published a recipe for scones from her at the weekend) and he said she had caused a stir by saying people could use either butter or margarine. Was butter better, he asked. And should it be hard or soft? May replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, you have to rub it in with the flour, and it is often easier actually if it is hard, you can get a good rub in.

Everybody gets it wrong from time to time. Only the inveterate fence sitters are spared having egg on their face.</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund certainly knows what it is like to make a mistake. In the run-up to the EU referendum, the IMF made a series of interventions warning voters of the dire consequences that would follow a vote to leave.</p> <p>At first, the IMF stuck to long-term forecasts, saying investment and trade would eventually be weaker if the UK divorced from the other 27 members of the EU. But as the referendum neared and the vote was on a knife-edge, the warnings became more lurid. The UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/18/imf-says-brexit-would-trigger-uk-recession-eu-referendum\">would immediately start sliding into recession</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/13/imf-warns-stock-market-crash-house-price-fall-eu-referendum-brexit\">House prices would crumble. Shares would crash</a>.</p> <p>So what do you do if your forecasts turn out to be a little wide of the mark? Either you put your hands up and admit you were wrong. Or you brazen it out. You say that it is too early to say. You say that eventually you will come right.</p> <p>No prizes for guessing which option the IMF has taken. Its half-yearly world economic outlook (WEO) report says the UK will do fine in 2016 but is going to find the going a lot tougher in 2017.</p> <p>This is a perfectly respectable view, and one held by a host of academic, business and City economists. Had the IMF stuck to this sort of assessment throughout the referendum campaign, it would have saved itself embarrassment now. As it is, it will get some stick from those who thought the Washington-based fund had overstepped the mark in its support for the remain camp.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/imf-peak-pessimism-brexit-eu-referendum-european-union-international-monetary-fund\">IMF left shamefaced after peak pessimism over Brexit vote</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f3ac35e4b0d3973ef5f809\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-04T13:21:24.999Z\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The IMF singles out the UK\u2019s referendum as a key factor hurting global growth, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThere is a more subdued outlook for advanced economies following the June U.K. vote in favour of leaving the European Union (Brexit) and weaker-than-expected growth in the United States.</p> <p>These developments have put further downward pressure on global interest rates, as monetary policy is now expected to remain accommodative for longer.</p> </blockquote> <p>It also cites China\u2019s economic rebalancing, and a general slowdown in trade growth since 2012.

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business-call-to-action-partnerzone/2016/sep/22/increasing-effectiveness-of-inclusive-business-is-key-to-achieving-sdgs\">seventh annual Business Call to Action (BCtA) forum</a>, which took place two blocks from the 71st session of the United Nations General Assembly, also marked the unveiling of 42 new commitments by 38 new inclusive businesses now aligned with BCtA.</p> <p>Throughout a half day of panel sessions and informal dialogue, attendees compared notes on the ways in which inclusive businesses are delivering on the SDGs through their core business activities, striving to envision a clear path to success in 2030 - the stated deadline for achieving all 17 SDGs (and the 169 more specific target objectives between them).</p> <p>But amid a palpable sense of optimism over the potential of inclusive businesses to play a key role in meeting the goals a few critical questions loomed: <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business-call-to-action-partnerzone/2016/sep/22/increasing-effectiveness-of-inclusive-business-is-key-to-achieving-sdgs\">Increasing effectiveness of inclusive business is key to achieving SDGs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although the SDGs may be a helpful framework to focus the efforts of inclusive businesses, are there simply too many disparate goals? </p> <p>Are the individual goals themselves too broadly aspirational to be pragmatically meaningful, as some <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21647286-proposed-sustainable-development-goals-would-be-worse-useless-169-commandments\" rel=\"nofollow\">sceptics</a> have alleged? </p> <p>And in the absence of universally agreed-upon metrics, how can for-profit businesses, NGOs, and governments effectively track, share, and coordinate their results? </p> <h2>Diverse problems, holistic solutions</h2> <p>Jayanth Bhuvaraghan, chief mission officer of the French eyeglass manufacturer Essilor, which aims to provide low-cost vision correction to 550 million underserved Indian citizens by 2030, spoke to each of these concerns in his opening keynote, setting the tone for the conversations that followed. Addressing the first point, he observed that \u201cthe SDGs are not a checklist, but a holistic framework. Focusing on certain global issues can help advance multiple SDGs.\u201d In other words, because so many of the goals are interconnected, any given business shouldn\u2019t spread itself thin trying to approach 17 separate problems, but should rather leverage its core competencies to focus on just one or two areas where it can have the biggest impact.</p> <p>He cited the example of Essilor\u2019s work in India, explaining that uncorrected poor vision is \u201cthe world\u2019s largest disability\u201d and therefore a fundamental obstacle to the fulfillment of all of the SDGs. \u201cIt affects 2.5 billion people worldwide,\u201d he said, \u201cand according to the WHO costs the global economy $227bn [\u00a3176bn] each year in lost productivity.\u201d By helping adults to see, Bhuvaraghan said, millions more people will be empowered to perform the actions needed to help fulfill the 2030 agenda. </p> <h2>Idealists work better together</h2> <p>As for the charge that the SDGs may be too aspirational to be effectively addressed by the private sector in day-to-day business operations, many participants argued that SDG17 - \u201cPartnerships for the Goals\u201d - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business-call-to-action-partnerzone/2016/aug/15/why-sdg17-is-an-essential-sustainable-development-goal\">helps ensure</a> that the remaining SDGs aren\u2019t approached in nebulous terms. If the goals are openly discussed and made sufficiently concrete, the thinking goes, inclusive businesses can find financially compelling reasons to work with other organisations in support of the SDGs, creating win-win scenarios that combine mutually beneficial business growth with measurable results.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this yourself,\u201d said Laura Gitman, VP of sustainability nonprofit BSR. \u201cYou need to collaborate with a variety of different partners, and it has to be true collaboration, a genuine partnership approach, which is critical to really scale.\u201d</p> <p>Toshio Takanashi, a senior executive of Japan\u2019s Asahi Kasei Corporation, agreed: \u201cI think the single most important factor to focus on is relationship.\u201d <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5b847a3da72ea981d35a2d202206741e536c78b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5b847a3da72ea981d35a2d202206741e536c78b/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Spitzer and Teresa Law, CEO and CFO of Mountain Hazelnuts, Bhutan\u2019s largest private-sector employer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Spitzer and Teresa Law, CEO and CFO of Mountain Hazelnuts, Bhutan\u2019s largest private-sector employer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Business Call to Action</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet establishing trust and commitment in a business relationship, as in a marriage, takes time and patience, remarked Teresa Law, co-founder and CFO of Bhutan\u2019s largest private-sector employer, Mountain Hazelnuts. \u201cI think you need to have patience,\u201d she said, \u201cthat you\u2019re not going to get a divorce, that you\u2019re going to stick it out.\u201d</p> <p>Swedish telecom giant Ericsson\u2019s senior vice president and chief sustainability officer Elaine Weidman-Grunewald said that by continuing to establish regional partnerships her company aims to address \u201caffordability barriers\u201d to internet access, finding ways to connect \u201chalf the planet\u201d that still isn\u2019t online.

It is driven by market opportunities, but it seeks to target the people that most need to be included in the economy. It is driven by genuine and collective efforts to build a vibrant economy that all can benefit from, thus contributing to the achievement of the 2030 agenda\u2014an agenda that pledges to leave no one behind.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Content on this page is paid for and produced to a brief agreed with Business Call to Action, sponsor of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/series/role-business-development\">business and the sustainable development goals hub</a>.</strong><br></p>",

A month has passed since the winger\u2019s \u00a313m move from Nottingham Forest to RB Leipzig, a record fee for a Scottish player, and in case his international commitment left any doubt about the courage of his convictions it is fascinating to hear why he chose a seven-year-old club in a provincial German city ahead of significant offers from the Premier League.</p> <p>\u201cYou only can only look at your Chelseas and see the amount of talent they have but they\u2019re all out on loan and not getting used,\u201d Burke says, warming to a theme he touches on throughout the interview. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel wanted by a club when you sign for them for however much and all of a sudden you\u2019re there for two training sessions and they\u2019ve just bought someone for double the amount. You\u2019re thinking: \u2018Why would they play me when they\u2019ve just bought this guy that plays in my position, is more experienced, and has a higher profile?\u2019 For me, it was a no-brainer really.\u201d</p> <p>The thought process rarely seems to run that way but Burke, who will be 20 in April, stresses the extra \u201clove and care\u201d expended in persuading him to join a club whose name elicited blank responses from friends when he broke the news. \u201cIt was everything I\u2019ve been looking for \u2026 I looked at it and smiled,\u201d he says of the vision laid out before him on the plane that took him to Germany within hours of his final game for Forest on 27 August. Leipzig had met the asking price but Tottenham also had permission to speak with Burke and Manchester United were among others paying close attention. Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, the Leipzig manager, and their sporting director Ralf Rangnick got to Nottingham first and their in-flight presentation persuaded Burke there was no need to look closer to home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e74e63fc9e973bd73410dacc6b525a17c2e9e4fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e74e63fc9e973bd73410dacc6b525a17c2e9e4fc/0_0_3912_2726/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Burke runs at the  Brighton & Hove Albion defence earlier this season\" width=\"1000\" height=\"697\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oliver Burke runs at the Brighton &amp; Hove Albion defence earlier this season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t enough depth from the other clubs in terms of how much they wanted me and whether I was going to play,\u201d Burke says, comparing the packages set out by his Premier League suitors with the precision of the information he was given about his role within the Leipzig team and the facets of his game that needed improvement.</p> <p>It is quite a repudiation of the accepted career path for an outstanding Championship talent and, perhaps, a light thrown on the presumptuous and materialistic scramble among English clubs to hoard the best young players. The mutual confidence between Burke and Leipzig has been borne out in their first month together. Twenty minutes after making his debut from the bench against Borussia Dortmund, Burke set up Naby Keita for the club\u2019s first Bundesliga victory. Two weeks later he scored in a draw with Cologne and settling in has been swift for a player who, the day before completing his transfer, was beating two players to score against Leeds United with his last contribution for Forest.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m the chunky lad who just goes barge, barge, barge, but being strong is an advantage</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m playing football I\u2019m switched off to everything else \u2013 it frees my mind,\u201d Burke says. \u201cBut I was definitely a little bit emotional, because I\u2019d been at Forest all my life and knew it was coming to the stage where there was a lot of interest and something was bound to happen. I knew I\u2019d be heading to Germany to visit Leipzig and I couldn\u2019t turn it down.\u201d</p> <p>Burke had been with Forest since 2005, making his debut in September 2014 and being eased into the first team last season before an explosive start to this year under Philippe Montanier, scoring four times and standing out through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/20/nottingam-forest-production-line-arsenal-efl-cup-brian-clough-anniversary\" title=\"\">his pace, power and physique</a> in an entertaining but callow side. The friendships were firm and the happy memories many but the manner of the departure felt somewhat transactional and it is clear Burke feels things could have ended with a lighter touch.</p> <p>\u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t feel they really wanted to keep me,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel I was the main priority to be kept. I feel they were very happy to take the money and let me go. A lot of people are saying my agent [Craig Mather] forced the deal for the money but it was never forced. It just happened because Forest had accepted everything that came at them, even from other clubs. For my part, I knew it was the right time to leave if that\u2019s what was happening.</p> <p>\u201cI thought they could have at least pulled me aside and said: \u2018Look, this is going on,\u2019 and had a bit of a chat. I didn\u2019t know a lot of it and in a way the less I knew the better so that I could concentrate on my football. What we did know was they were accepting anything over a certain amount. In the end, making the decision was not difficult.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/20/nottingam-forest-production-line-arsenal-efl-cup-brian-clough-anniversary\">Nottingham Forest show the rewards of investing in the production line | Daniel Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The rights or wrongs of Forest\u2019s conduct are a question for their owner, Fawaz al-Hasawi, who spent much of the summer attempting to sell the club to the Greek businessman Evangelos Marinakis. Burke has swapped that environment for one whose management is markedly more secure, even if Leipzig have been Germany\u2019s most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/08/why-rb-leipzig-has-become-the-most-hated-club-in-german-football\" title=\"\">contentious football case </a>for several years. Their rise through the leagues, fuelled by the backing of Red Bull, has drawn plenty of opposition and the 15-minute delay to the match in Cologne, caused when 100 home fans blocked the arrival of the Leipzig team bus, suggests the issue will not fade away. The club points to its hugely successful awakening of the football community in a city that once hosted regular European football with Lokomotive Leipzig and to a youthful, forward-thinking attitude that has translated into an unbeaten first half-dozen games in the top flight.</p> <p>\u201cI turned up for training on my first day and thought these guys looked like the Forest Under-16s,\u201d Burke says of a first-team squad whose average age is 23 and a half. \u201cThen we started playing and it was like \u2018maybe not\u2019. The quality is really good; everybody is technically excellent, because in the Bundesliga you have to be.\u201d</p> <p>Burke holds his own on that front. The sharpness of those exchanges in training suits him but what really marks him out, and what set the Leipzig hierarchy in such hot pursuit, is the rare athleticism with which those Championship defences struggled in the season\u2019s early weeks.</p> <p>At the age of 13, Burke could run 100 metres in 11 seconds. He has certainly not slowed up despite knee problems earlier in his teens that almost led to his release from Forest and, while he is yet to time himself on the 50m track beneath Leipzig\u2019s training centre, anyone who has seen his 6ft 2in frame slip through the gears can draw their own conclusions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b36243b94a58e45f3a6b9f2b757be71198136f29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b36243b94a58e45f3a6b9f2b757be71198136f29/97_179_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Burke trains with Scotland in September\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oliver Burke trains with Scotland in September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Walton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m the chunky lad who just goes barge, barge, barge, but being strong is an advantage,\u201d he says. Rangnick has described him as a \u201cforce of nature\u201d; comparisons with Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo have come from elsewhere although there have been efforts to temper the excitement. After that assist against Dortmund, Hasenh\u00fcttl said Burke\u2019s \u201chard drive with regard to work off the ball is empty\u201d and it is a charge the player does not deny. Much of his training has resembled a crash course in pressing and all parties accept it will take time before he is a regular 90-minute player at the intensity Leipzig demand.</p> <p>Perhaps these are lessons others may learn abroad. There is too often a sense that, for all their well-trained utterances in favour of the orthodoxy, life as a Premier League star in waiting resembles a treadmill for some of Burke\u2019s age group. His bright, affable mien certainly differs from the guarded, eyes-down rote responses that can characterise his peers and you wonder why, with the right advice and an ounce of curiosity, this should not be a path pursued more often.</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier at this moment and don\u2019t regret anything at all,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t regret not going to the Premier League: that\u2019s there\u201d \u2013 he emphasises the latter word strongly \u2013 \u201cand all the other teams are there. I believe I\u2019m at the top here, the top league in the world. Why wouldn\u2019t you say this is the Premier League of Germany \u2013 if not better?\u201d</p> <p>Any further thoughts of England, whether at club or international level, would be nothing but a distraction.</p>",

  "<p>When you start working on a film, you make your plans. First, there\u2019s the script development, sharpening the screenplay, making sure that characters resonate and pop and are as colourful as they can be.

BP became a very effective disruptor and prevented us getting any access to any oil rigs. We couldn\u2019t even fly by one. At one point we were in a helicopter on a tour of a rig called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Nautilus\">Nautilus</a> and were told if we got any closer we would be perceived to be a threat and they were going to defend themselves. The companies exert so much power because they are such financial engines in that part of the country \u2013 anyone who worked with BP basically said they couldn\u2019t talk to us. We had consultants who would work with us for a day or two, but the third day they would call in sick and we would never hear from them again. We had contracts to film on the tenders that go back and forth to the rigs \u2013 then the day before, they would say we couldn\u2019t. It became obvious that BP was doing a great job of intimidating most of the people down in that community. We understood it; it wasn\u2019t a news flash. BP pays a lot of bills there, a lot of mortgages, sends a lot of kids to school, pays a lot of medical insurance. We realised our only option was to build our own rig \u2013 which we did.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96997de993b8624776526d73bfc897b587d4c538\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96997de993b8624776526d73bfc897b587d4c538/0_95_2936_1762/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deepwater Horizon on fire in 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deepwater Horizon on fire in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KPA/Zuma / Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We also found that several of the people who were involved in the real-life incident clearly had gag orders as a result of their settlement with BP; they told us they could not speak with us. The ones who did not have gag orders did speak to us. BP\u2019s two main rig supervisors, Donald Vidrine and Robert Kaluza (who were played by John Malkovich and Brad Leland), did not speak to us. But because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/03/manslaughter-charges-dropped-bp-employees-deepwater-horizon-oil-spill\">their testimony from the congressional and coastguard hearings is on record</a>, we were able to capture so much of their documented actions and conversations that we didn\u2019t really need to speak to them.</p> <p>The legal processes were something else. Lionsgate, our studio, had a team of independent lawyers who would review every word in the script, constantly. It didn\u2019t stop there: because I do a lot of improvisation, things change during the shoot. So in the final edits the lawyers were all over me; it was the first time in my career I have ever had to take mandatory edits from the studio. For example, we had a scene that might have suggested that workers were under pressure to say the rig was safe because BP managers wanted to move on to another oil well. It was 100% true and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/12/deepwater-gulf-oil-spill-hearing\">very well documented</a>, but the lawyers were concerned it was making BP look too responsible for the blowout.

If you asked 50 experts why the Deepwater oil rig blew up, you will get 50 different answers. Clearly, it was a confluence of events, not one single thing; but the one area pretty much everyone agrees on was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/29/bp-oil-spill-bp\">the issue with the cement pour at the bottom of the well</a>. They put it down in order to control the pressure of the well, and before it can be proclaimed safe they should do an inspection called a cement bond log. It\u2019s basically sending sonar signals down to make sure there are no hollow spots. BP sent the team home; they never did the test. That\u2019s fact, very well documented, and most people believe it was the beginning of the problem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6e9d16ca44d0db0414ecac8b5c5c890b79010aaf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e9d16ca44d0db0414ecac8b5c5c890b79010aaf/0_0_3744_5616/667.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018If you ask 50 experts why Deepwater blew up, you will get 50 different answers.\u2019\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If you ask 50 experts why Deepwater blew up, you will get 50 different answers.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerald Herbert/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s very likely BP either wanted to save the $125,000 (\u00a398,000) it would have cost \u2013 or, as my feeling is, they didn\u2019t want to know. If there was a problem they would have had to pull up all the cement and redo the job, which could take another three weeks at $1m a day. The lawyers\u2019 argument was: if you say the cement bond was cracked, the subcontractor who made the bonding solution will sue, and we can\u2019t prove the solution was faulty. If you say the test wasn\u2019t done, the company that was sent home will say that\u2019s slander. That was where we really dug in. It sounds trivial, but we argued for a week about how much we could say the cement pour was the catalyst that led to the blowout.</p> <p>The thing to remember is that BP don\u2019t own the rigs, they rent them. The way the rigs are organised, and the way the different companies work together, is fascinating. It\u2019s a complex social organisation of subcontractors, who have different jobs on the rig at a given time. For example, Transocean own the rig. Schlumberger were expecting to do the cement bond log.</p> <p>One small surprise: we were able to use actual BP logos in the film. It\u2019s one of those things where you scratch your head with the lawyers. Normally we\u2019re told we have to modify logos \u2013 but they are public domain, and to capture them on film is not illegal.</p> <p>What was behind it all was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_expenses_insurance\">litigation insurance</a>, to protect the studio from legal action. All the lawyers I was dealing with were themselves dealing with lawyers from the insurance company. As far as Lionsgate were concerned, any issue that was going to preclude the insurance bond from closing was non-negotiable. I was having to edit my film based on an insurance company, and that was crazy. BP may very well sue, but we believe we have defensible positions.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/mar/29/deepwater-horizon-mark-wahlberg-in-disaster-movie-trailer-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4tvej\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2480455\"            data-video-name=\"Deepwater Horizon: Mark Wahlberg in disaster movie trailer - video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56fa83f6e4b0465523578dd3\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/03/29/160329DeepwaterHorizon_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/03/29/160329DeepwaterHorizon_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/03/29/160329DeepwaterHorizon_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/03/29/160329DeepwaterHorizon_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/03/29/160329DeepwaterHorizon.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/mar/29/deepwater-horizon-mark-wahlberg-in-disaster-movie-trailer-video\">Deepwater Horizon: Mark Wahlberg in disaster movie trailer</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>At the end of the day, we might be the best thing that could happen for BP. Nobody thought the cement pour would have led to what it did. Vidrine and Kaluza were wrong, but there was no criminal intent there. We are clear on that. BP behaved as a company for profit, which it is \u2013 but we all participate in capitalist society. Every time we drive a car or fly in an airplane, we are all complicit in this relationship. BP isn\u2019t some great devil forcing us to live these lifestyles. BP had many problems drilling that well that certainly weren\u2019t all BP\u2019s fault \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/feb/25/deepwater-trial-justice-bp-warnings\">that was why it was called \u201cthe well from hell\u201d</a>. I think we made BP look reasonable in its reactions to events. That\u2019s not to say its two guys weren\u2019t on the rig; they were in charge, and made some big mistakes. If anyone had really understood that something this bad was going to happen, they would have stopped it for sure; no one realised what the price could be for the shortcuts. I\u2019ll bet you BP are not going to be so quick to cut corners in future.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Deepwater Horizon is now in cinemas</em></p>",
  "<p>The \u201ctwilight zone\u201d of Hawaii\u2019s deep coral reefs are home to vast algae meadows and support the highest rates of species found nowhere else in Earth\u2019s seas, scientists have discovered.</p> <p><a href=\"https://peerj.com/articles/2475\">A 20-year study</a> of the archipelago\u2019s poorly-explored mesophotic \u2013 middle light \u2013 coral zone also found the deep-reef habitats are home to many unique and distinct species not found on shallow reefs with vast areas of 100% coral cover.</p> <p>While much is known about shallow, tropical coral habitats, the richness, diversity and ecological importance of these deep sea ecosystems, found at depths of 30-150 metres, has only recently been understood. </p> <p>In one of the largest and most comprehensive studies of its kind, published on Tuesday in <a href=\"https://peerj.com/\">the journal PeerJ</a>, the entire 2,590km Hawaiian archipelago was covered over two decades using a combination of submersibles, remote-operated vehicles, drop cameras, data recorders and advanced diving techniques. <br></p> <p>A major focus of the study was to document extensive areas of 100% coral cover at depths of 90m (300 feet) or more off the islands of Maui and Kauai. Vast expanses of continuous coral cover were found extending for tens of square kilometres, dominated by stony, reef-building corals in the genus Leptoseris, a plate-like coral adapted for deepwater environments.<br></p> <p>\u201cThese are some of the most extensive and densely populated coral reefs in Hawaii,\u201d said Anthony Montgomery, a US Fish and Wildlife biologist and co-author of the study. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to find such rich coral communities down so deep.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/06/hawaii-marine-ocean-conservation-papahanaumokuakea\">Obama's Hawaii marine conservation area is just a drop in the ocean</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The study identified more than 70 species of macroalgae in extensive meadows that support unique communities of fish and invertebrates. Both corals and algae depend on sunlight for photosynthesis, and the study attributed the existence of many of the deep reef habitats to exceptionally clear water.</p> <p>\u201cWe found that the diversity of macroalgal species actually peaked at around 90m,\u201d said Heather Spalding of the department of botany at the University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa and a co-author of the study. \u201cThese extensive algae meadows represent a major component of the deep-reef communities, and play a fundamentally important role in the overall ecology.\u201d</p> <p>The team of 16 researchers also found that the rate of endemism \u2013 species that exist nowhere else on the planet \u2013 increased substantially on the deep reefs. While only 17% of the fish surveyed at depths less than 30m are endemic to the Hawaiian Islands, more than half of the species below 70m are endemic. This rate increased even more in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, where 100% of the fish are found only in Hawaii.</p> <p>\u201cThe extent of fish endemism ... is astonishing,\u201d said Randall Kosaki, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s deputy superintendent of the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea marine national monument and a co-author of the study. \u201cWe were able to document the highest rates of endemism of any marine environment on Earth.\u201d</p> <p>The study was not without its challenges for the multidisciplinary team of scientists including geologists, biologists, and botanists: Hawaii\u2019s \u201ctwilight zone\u201d reefs are deeper than conventional divers can safely venture, and also too shallow for most submersible vehicles to operate.<br></p> <p>The research group solved the problem by combining strategies: theymapped the seabed with sonar, towed cameras underneath boats along transect lines, sent remote operated cameras out and deployed divers using rebreather systems that allowed them to stay under longer alongside submersible vessels. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8fcd1b3578117e880261fc76436105c9b3bfaab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8fcd1b3578117e880261fc76436105c9b3bfaab/0_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rebreather diver and lead author Richard Pyle uses an advanced closed-circuit rebreather alongside the Pisces V submersible to explore deep coral reefs off Hawaii.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rebreather diver and lead author Richard Pyle uses an advanced closed-circuit rebreather alongside the Pisces V submersible to explore deep coral reefs off Hawaii.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert K.

Combining both together on the same dives allowed us to achieve tasks that could not have been performed by either technology alone.\u201d</p> <p>The results have important implications for conservation management, the authors say, with deep coral reefs potentially serving as a refuge for species from shallow coral reefs.</p> <p>\u201cWith coral reefs facing a myriad of threats, the finding of extensive reefs off Maui provides managers with a unique opportunity to ensure that future activities in the region, such as cable laying, dredging dump sites, and deep sewer outfalls, do not irreparably damage these reefs,\u201d said Kimberly Puglise, an oceanographer with NOAA\u2019s National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science.</p>",

She said that while an international student was studying in Britain, their family members could do any form of work.</p> <p>\u201cAnd foreign students, even those studying English language degrees, don\u2019t even have to be proficient in speaking English. We need to look at whether this one-size-fits-all approach really is right for the hundreds of different universities providing thousands of different courses across the country.

But a student immigration system that treats every student and university as equal only punishes those we should want to help.

Ministers need to take a very different approach and support universities by removing international students from the net migration target altogether.\u201d</p> <p>Nicola Dandridge of Universities UK responded to Rudd\u2019s proposed changes by stressing the quality and diversity of British university courses and saying that the overwhelming majority of overseas students went home at the end of their studies. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe diversity of institutions and the range of high-quality courses offered is one of the many strengths of our university sector. Any criteria must reflect that diversity. The criteria must also support the critical role that many universities play in their regions, where the impact of international students directly supports regional economies, supplies high level graduate skills and ensures the sustainability of many courses at regional level,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>\u201cPolling has shown that the British public does not see international students as long-term migrants, but as valuable, temporary visitors. International students come to the UK, study for a period, and then the overwhelming majority go home after their studies,\u201d she added, disputing their inclusion in the net migration target.</p> <p>Rudd said the process of bringing skilled workers to Britain from outside Europe had become a box-ticking exercise, allowing some firms to get away with not training local people. \u201cWe won\u2019t win in the world if we don\u2019t do more to upskill our own workforce. It\u2019s not fair on companies doing the right thing. So I want us to look again at whether our immigration system provides the right incentives for businesses to invest in British workers,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The review is likely to look again at the resident market labour test and ensure that job vacancies are advertised locally in Britain and not just abroad among potential migrant staff.</p> <p>Rudd said the \u201ccontrolling migration fund\u201d would be designed specifically to ease the pressure on public services in areas of high migration. It replaces a Labour migration impact fund, which was scrapped in 2010 as ineffective. The fund would also be used in the government\u2019s stated drive to \u201ccreate a hostile environment for illegal immigrants\u201d, she said.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s fund had spent money on translation services rather than English lessons, the home secretary said, and councils were given money to promote recycling rather than the support they needed to ease housing pressures.<br></p> <p>Labour\u2019s fund was financed by a \u00a350-a-head levy on visas. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said Labour\u2019sthe party\u2019s new proposal \u2013 an impact fund of \u00a350m over two years \u2013 would also be financed by a levy on citizenship applications. Rudd did not spell out where the \u00a3140m would come from.</p> <p>The Home Office said the \u00a3140m fund would be spent over the remaining three-and-a-half years of the current parliament. English local authorities would shortly be invited to bid for \u00a3100m of the fund to manage a range of issues associated with sudden and high levels of migration such as securing community cohesion, providing English language teaching or tackling overcrowded properties.</p> <p>The remaining \u00a340m would be set aside to fund immigration enforcement activity in areas of high migration, including targeting and removing illegal immigrants living in overcrowded accommodation or sleeping rough who are resistant to finding proper accommodation or returning home.</p> <p>The shadow home secretary, Andy Burnham, said it sounded as if the prime minister had had a heavy hand in drafting Rudd\u2019s speech. He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve heard these conference promises on net migration and child migrants before and they haven\u2019t come to anything \u2013 people will take them with a pinch of salt. On Theresa May\u2019s watch, net migration reached record levels. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6ab6fa93efae9832504584e714e6d380de40768\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6ab6fa93efae9832504584e714e6d380de40768/0_168_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Burnham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Burnham said it sounded as if Theresa May had a hand in drafting Rudd\u2019s speech.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAmber Rudd is right to introduce a scheme to help communities address the pressures of migration, as Jeremy Corbyn called for last week. But she had depressingly little to say about the largest humanitarian crisis since the second world war and failed to repeat the commitment to taking a share of adult refugees.\u201d</p> <p>The Institute of Directors also expressed disappointment at Rudd\u2019s announcement. \u201cThere are different ways to control immigration and we should see Brexit as a chance to design a system which addresses local concerns, without damaging business or universities,\u201d said Seamus Nevin, the institute\u2019s head of employment and skills.</p> <p>\u201cStaying on the current course will end up satisfying no one. Net immigration will likely stay above 100,000, while firms and the public sector struggle to fill skills gaps, making it harder for them to navigate the uncertainty of the coming Brexit negotiations.\u201d</p> <p>Addressing a fringe event, the Brexit secretary, David Davis, hinted that employers might be obliged in any future work permit system to seek a British national to fill a job before they could employ someone from overseas.</p> <p>\u201cMy job is not to write immigration policy,\u201d Davis said in answer to a question on the worries among businesses about finding sufficient unskilled labour. \u201cMy job is to get the powers back here so we can decide. That is the first thing to understand. Once you do that, the government will make its decision on how it runs its immigration policy.\u201d</p> <p>Davis said that any solution would not be immediate and would be up to May and Rudd. He said: \u201cIf they go down a route of having work permits for example, typically the way work permits work in other countries is you get to say, try to get a British citizen first and, if you haven\u2019t, then you have got to do that first. There will be tests like that.</p> <p>\u201cBut the other side of this is we have to make sure that our own population are ready and equipped to work, whether it is low-skilled work \u2013 and that is about motivation and about commitment to work. If it is higher skilled it is about education, which is why the other part of Theresa\u2019s concerns about society are very important in this context. But at the end of the day nobody is going to have an off switch.\u201d</p>",

He cited early research suggesting that drought in Syria may have contributed to the country\u2019s extreme civil unrest. </p> <p>Obama suggested Republicans who don\u2019t take climate change seriously are out of sync with the nation\u2019s military leaders. \u201cWe have members of Congress who scoff at climate change at the same time as they are saluting, wearing flag pins and extolling their patriotism,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not paying attention to our joint chiefs of staff and the Pentagon, who are saying that this is one of the most significant national security threats that we face in the next 50 years.\u201d</p> <p>With less than four months to go before the Obama era officially comes to an end, the president and his inner coterie are clearly already contemplating life after the White House. \u201cThe president is very interested in building momentum outside Washington through change that becomes sustainable.

Everybody gets it wrong from time to time. Only the inveterate fence sitters are spared having egg on their face.</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund certainly knows what it is like to make a mistake. In the run-up to the EU referendum, the IMF made a series of interventions warning voters of the dire consequences that would follow a vote to leave.</p> <p>At first, the IMF stuck to long-term forecasts, saying investment and trade would eventually be weaker if the UK divorced from the other 27 members of the EU. But as the referendum neared and the vote was on a knife-edge, the warnings became more lurid. The UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/18/imf-says-brexit-would-trigger-uk-recession-eu-referendum\">would immediately start sliding into recession</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/13/imf-warns-stock-market-crash-house-price-fall-eu-referendum-brexit\">House prices would crumble. Shares would crash</a>.</p> <p>So what do you do if your forecasts turn out to be a little wide of the mark? Either you put your hands up and admit you were wrong. Or you brazen it out. You say that it is too early to say. You say that eventually you will come right.</p> <p>No prizes for guessing which option the IMF has taken. Its half-yearly world economic outlook (WEO) report says the UK will do fine in 2016 but is going to find the going a lot tougher in 2017.</p> <p>This is a perfectly respectable view, and one held by a host of academic, business and City economists. Had the IMF stuck to this sort of assessment throughout the referendum campaign, it would have saved itself embarrassment now. As it is, it will get some stick from those who thought the Washington-based fund had overstepped the mark in its support for the remain camp.</p> <p>Sadly, the furore over the IMF\u2019s Brexit predictions may well overshadow the more interesting aspects of the WEO. It is true, for example, that the vote for Brexit was the result of almost a decade of flatlining average incomes since the financial crisis, which has bred hostility towards elites, globalisation and immigrants.</p> <p>Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, rightly noted: \u201cSimilar tensions afflict the US political scene, where anti-immigrant and anti-trade rhetoric have been prominent from the start of the current presidential election round. Across the world, protectionist trade measures have been on the rise.\u201d</p> <p>All this is quite true. The IMF identifies \u201cpolitical discord and inward looking policies\u201d as one of the two big risks to its prediction that global growth will increase slightly from 3.1% to 3.4% next year; the others being stagnation in advanced economies.</p> <p>These two factors are, of course, interlinked. If western economies continue to struggle, protectionist pressures are going to rise. They will also make it more likely that the other risks identified by the IMF \u2013 a sharper slowdown in China and financial trouble in the emerging markets \u2013 will crystallise.</p> <p>The solution, the IMF says, is a three-pronged approach rather than the continued reliance on central banks, with their ultra-low interest rates and money creation schemes. Governments have to loosen fiscal policy (cut taxes and increase spending) where there is scope to do so, and reallocate spending towards growth-enhancing sectors where there is not. </p> <p>Finally, there have to be measures aimed at supporting those harmed by economic change, whether as the result of globalisation or technological overhaul, such as stronger welfare nets and more progressive income tax regimes.</p> <p>One explanation for the IMF\u2019s hyperbolic warnings about the immediate impact of the Brexit vote is that it thought the expected remain vote would mean they would never have to be justified. Now that it has, the IMF is terrified because it sees the UK referendum as symptomatic of something deeply dysfunctional about the global economy it has helped to shape in the past four decades. Which indeed it is.</p>",

Without determined policy action to support economic activity over the short and longer terms, sub-par growth at recent levels risks perpetuating itself through the negative economic and political forces it is unleashing.\u201d</p> <p>He said slow growth and rising inequality was having a political impact: \u201cThe slow and incomplete recovery from crisis has been especially damaging in those countries where the distribution of income has continued to skew sharply toward the highest earners, leaving little room for those with lower incomes to advance. </p> <p>\u201cThe result in some richer countries has been a political movement that blames globalisation for all woes and seeks somehow to wall off the economy from global trends rather than engage cooperatively with foreign nations. Brexit is only one example of this tendency.\u201d</p> <p>The WEO predicted global growth of 3.1% this year, slightly lower than the 3.2% recorded in 2015. It expects a modest acceleration to 3.4% in 2017.</p> <p>Obstfeld said the Brexit vote left unclear the future shape of the UK\u2019s trade and financial relations with the other 27 EU member states, with a likely impact on investment and hiring across Europe.</p> <p>\u201cAlongside economic anxiety and other factors, the Brexit vote reflects a resentment of cross-border migration that has fuelled nationalist sentiment in Europe and called into question the way forward for EU integration,\u201d Obstfeld said. </p> <p>\u201cSimilar tensions afflict the US political scene, where anti-immigrant and anti-trade rhetoric have been prominent from the start of the current presidential election round. Across the world, protectionist trade measures have been on the rise.\u201d</p> <p>Apart from the sharp depreciation of the pound, the IMF said financial markets\u2019 reaction to Brexit vote had \u201cgenerally been contained\u201d, with shares up and the appetite for taking risk recovering after an initial plunge.</p> <p>The WEO noted that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/03/pound-falls-hard-brexit-deutsche-bank-manufacturing-data-business-live\">manufacturing in the UK</a> had bounced back after falling steeply in July and spending in the shops had held up.

Growth is forecast at 1.8% in 2016 and 1.1% in 2017, based on the assumptions of smooth post-Brexit negotiations and a limited increase in economic barriers.\u201d</p> <p>The IMF cut its medium-term growth forecast for the UK from 2.1% to 1.9% as a result of what it assumes will be barriers to trade, migration and capital flow.</p> <p>The IMF also backed Hammond\u2019s hints of extra government spending for public investment in next month\u2019s autumn statement.</p> <p>Noting that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">Bank of England\u2019s package of measures in August</a> was aimed at boosting confidence and limiting the downside risks to the economy, the IMF said: \u201cAs greater clarity emerges on the macroeconomic impact of the Brexit vote, the need for further near-term discretionary fiscal policy easing and the appropriateness of the medium-term deficit target should be assessed, possibly in the context of the forthcoming November fiscal review.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>There is a lot written out there about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/series/aid-worker-wellbeing\">internal conflicts</a> that aid workers face \u2013 what it\u2019s like to be constantly exposed to poverty, violence and injustice; how to balance professional and personal aspirations; and how to cope with the stress of being away from home so often. It can cause quite the existential crisis. <br></p> <p>For me, though, what I have come to ask myself, especially in the often difficult first month of being deployed somewhere new, is: do I actually like being an aid worker? <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/apr/26/secret-aid-worker-can-only-the-childless-and-unattached-manage-the-workwe-do\">Secret aid worker: can only the childless and unattached manage the work we do?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I think back to a field posting in south Asia a few years ago: cheap beer, delicious street food and the beautiful temples we would visit on weekends. In my memory it\u2019s all very positive. However, this wasn\u2019t always the case. <br></p> <p>That job was meant to signal the start of a fulfilling career as an aid worker on a constant roster of emergency deployments. But within my first week, I had told every single one of my family members, friends, and a man I was dating that I wanted to go home. Not in nine months, but now. <br></p> <p>There were nights where I was ready to call quits on my budding humanitarian career for sheer frustration at the job, social setting, and \u2013 let\u2019s be honest \u2013 crushing disappointment of the whole ordeal. I wasn\u2019t meeting others deployed in the country, trips out to project sites were few and far between, and I found myself working long hours every day, mostly on my own. This was by no means what I had imagined. Day one in that country was day one of an ongoing debate about how best to manage such an odd career choice.</p> <p>To outsiders, the decision to become an aid worker and give up on a \u201cnormal\u201d life might seem odd. You give them the speech that we all know so well \u2013 that this type of work is important, that this career is meaningful, and that you want to live a life that is intense and where you are constantly meeting new people and going to new places, all while supposedly saving the world. The speech is meant to convince this incredulous person that although you are making sacrifices to be an aid worker, it is worth it. You never wanted to settle down anyway. </p> <p>I\u2019ve noticed that even after multiple deployments, as soon as I arrive in-country I repeat such a speech to myself. Perhaps it\u2019s because I\u2019ve had a frustrating day of dodging red tape at the office, I haven\u2019t made friends as quickly as I\u2019d expected or I\u2019m missing loved ones back home. I\u2019ve found those days particularly numerous during my first month of any deployment, as I get my bearings. As a coping mechanism I use those same lines to convince myself that it\u2019s all worth it. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/02/secret-aid-worker-projectitis-dfid-civil-society\">Secret aid worker: the UK NGO sector is facing a funding crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I should admit to myself that on some days this choice to be an aid worker (one I have studied a number of years and endured many unpaid internships for) doesn\u2019t seem worth the sacrifice. I\u2019ve willingly chosen to work in some of the most difficult contexts in the world. But what happens when the work doesn\u2019t go as planned and you don\u2019t feel you are having the impact you should? <br></p> <p>In those dark times when I\u2019m struggling I don\u2019t admit there might be something wrong. Instead I play the game of rationalising. I tell myself that I\u2019m learning new skills by working in difficult \u2013 or near impossible \u2013 operational contexts; and that I\u2019m simply \u201cfocused on my career\u201d on those days I wish I was out with friends. We all do it, but why? Perhaps it\u2019s because surrendering to the unhappiness of those moments would lead us to questioning our entire lifestyle and choice of career \u2013 and that is too scary. </p> <p>As aid workers, we don\u2019t have any hesitation about spending hours complaining about X, Y, Z over one too many drinks. We commiserate together, we have deep philosophical conversations about whether or not humanitarian work is really having the impact on the world that we had hoped, but we never dare ask each other whether we are enjoying ourselves more than if we\u2019d opted for a more traditional career path. <br></p> <p>There is seemingly no space for such skepticism in this lifestyle. And I think that needs to change. Let\u2019s face it, there are some really great aspects of being an aid worker \u2013 I have met some amazing people, seen places in the world I otherwise would not have, and, yes, the work is fascinating and meaningful. But there are the bad days. Each deployment will have its own mix of each, and we can quickly forget those more negative periods of time and be hard on ourselves when we are finding the first month of a new deployment miserable. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/03/secret-aid-worker-regret-not-speaking-out-lgbt-colleagues\">Secret aid worker: I regret not speaking out for my LGBT colleagues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So, today, when I have one of those moments \u2013 alone in a new place, wishing I was back home \u2013 I try to cut myself a break. I\u2019m allowed to not love this life all the time. It\u2019s alright to question whether I want to be here, and whether I\u2019ll still want to be an aid worker in 10 years. Despite the sales pitch for humanitarian work leading us to mistakenly believe that this job has to be worth it, it\u2019s alright to wonder whether I even enjoy humanitarian work. That feeling eventually passes. The whole process would be a whole lot smoother if I could just admit to myself that, yes, overall I do enjoy being an aid worker.

She also dismissed attempts to improve environmental credentials of the project as tokenistic. She said: \u201cNew roads attract new traffic, pollute the air and are incredibly expensive so it\u2019s extremely disappointing that the mayor is pushing ahead with the damaging Silvertown tunnel.\u201d</p> <p>Her concerns were echoed by the <a href=\"http://www.silvertowntunnel.co.uk/\">No to Silvertown Tunnel</a> campaign. Its chair, Anne Robbins, said: \u201cFor Sadiq Khan to call this a \u2018greener Silvertown tunnel\u2019 hides the fact that Greenwich and the Royal Docks would be a dumping ground for the south of England\u2019s congestion and pollution. He talks a good game when it comes to pollution and congestion in central London, but communities in east and south-east London clearly don\u2019t seem to matter as much. They will be living with even worse traffic and poorer air.</p> <p>\u201cKhan promised a full review of the tunnel but has made no attempt to reach out to those who will have to live with the consequences [of the scheme].\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NoSilvertownTnl/status/783248807001673728\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sadiq Khan&#39;s &#39;greener&#39; Silvertown Tunnel is a betrayal, campaigners say <a href=\"https://t.co/7qOpyfKd8D\">https://t.co/7qOpyfKd8D</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hrIWDtfpQ2\">pic.twitter.com/hrIWDtfpQ2</a></p>&mdash; No Silvertown Tunnel (@NoSilvertownTnl) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NoSilvertownTnl/status/783248807001673728\">October 4, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The first stage of a planning inquiry into the project is due to begin next week.

Its head of policy, Christopher Snelling, said: \u201cThe shortage of road crossings beyond Tower Bridge is already holding back the economy in that part of the city. The congestion we currently have at crossings like Blackwall causes massive unnecessary local pollution and disruption for residents \u2013 we would all be better off with smoother flowing traffic. This new crossing will not be enough to solve everything, but it will be a big step forward.\u201d</p> <p>Khan also announced his commitment to several other river crossings in east London, including accelerated plans for a new pedestrian and cycle bridge linking Rotherhithe and Canary Wharf and a new Docklands Light Railway crossing at Gallions Reach. <br></p> <p>Khan said: \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that London has long needed more river crossings in the east. But we don\u2019t want these to have a damaging impact on our environment, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve reviewed and improved plans for Silvertown tunnel and why I\u2019m pushing forward with crossings that encourage public transport, walking and cycling. As we continue to unlock the massive economic potential of east London, we must secure the very best transport infrastructure that improves the quality of life for everyone living and working in the area.\u201d</p> <p>The Rotherhithe pedestrian and cycle bridge, which was one of Khan\u2019s manifesto commitments, will need to be opened up for passing ships. The mayor\u2019s office has yet to decide whether this should be by a conventional bascule bridge (drawbridge) or a more innovative swing bridge. A competition for designs will open next year. </p> <p>David Leam, the infrastructure director at London First, which represents businesses in the capital, said: \u201cBetter river crossings will help unlock the economic potential of east and south-east London and connect thousands of new homes in Newham, Barking, Greenwich and elsewhere. We\u2019re delighted the mayor has sped up these plans, aiming to deliver new ways of getting across the river within the next five to 10 years.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Countries that fail to tackle the malnourishment and poor growth of their children face being named and shamed at the World Economic Forum as part of a mission to rid the world of stunting, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/30/world-bank-name-and-shame-countries-fail-stunted-children\">the president of the World Bank told <strong>Sarah Boseley</strong></a>.</p> <p>Jim Yong Kim said that stunting, which refers to children with a height well below the average for their age, is a humanitarian disaster and an economic issue that holds back nations.

I still have not decided yet as to whether I will file criminal charges, and from a financial standpoint, they would be in the realm of felony charges.\u201d</p> <p> \u201cI have asked that the city consider criminal charges,\u201d said Lisa Herbold, a city councilwoman who represents West Seattle. \u201cAt the very least, I hope we don\u2019t negotiate it down, that we stick with the $1.6m.\u201d</p> <p>A woman who moved nearly a year ago next door to the Harrelsons, and who asked to not be identified, stood in her driveway on a recent afternoon. \u201cI left for a vacation in mid-January for a week,\u201d she said, \u201cand when I got back the trees were gone. I moved here because of the greenbelt, and now look at it.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p> Gazing down the quiet tree-lined street, the disgruntled neighbor cracked, \u201cI\u2019m happy to report I\u2019m not involved, but you are not going to get anyone to talk. Everyone\u2019s lips are sealed.\u201d</p> <p> Defendant Marty Reimer, a 30-year-long resident of West Seattle and a popular morning-show radio host in the city, is among those tight-lipped property owners. But he took time last week to come down the front steps of his $800,000 rambler-style home and talk briefly.</p> <p>\u201cWe have gotten sucked up into this whirlpool, and I wish I could say more,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been told by our attorney not to say anything.</p> <p> \u201cIt has been a shock to us that this happened. There is so much I\u2019d like to say, but I can\u2019t. Everyone around here is scared.\u201d</p> <p> Illegal tree removals is nothing new to Seattle, but usually it involves only a handful of trees. One has to go all the way to 2002 to find a case of this magnitude, when Jerome Ferris, a federal judge was slapped with a $500,000 fine after his gardener cut down more than 120 cherry and maples trees in the a Mount Baker neighborhood park near Lake Washington.</p>",

  "<p>I left England in 1972 for a two-year public accounting contract with Deloitte\u2019s in Lusaka, Zambia.

Would it not be better to concentrate on current practice, and concentrate on the top level of commercial art, where women actually are under-represented</em>? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/live/2016/sep/30/guerilla-girls-webchat-tate-modern-exchange#comment-84613788\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16787037\" title=\"View GuerrillaGirls\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/16787037\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for GuerrillaGirls\"> </a> <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16787037\" title=\"View GuerrillaGirls\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">GuerrillaGirls</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/84613788\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">04 October 2016 11:52am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>F: We do want new histories of art, because the history we have is not complete.

There was a time when kings, queens and emperors wrote the history of art, but hopefully we now live in a more democratic time. So why should we allow super-rich oligarchs to control art museums? There's a proliferation of private museums across the world, where the super-wealthy invest in art, put tons of money in art, open up their own private art museums which are often tax havens, and then tell us that they're high minded philanthropists. Do we want them to write our history for us? And can the history of art be written in the work of a few artists who have won the popularity contest with these rich people? How do we row back against it? To realise it, to realise that public institutions are the product of a manipulated market.

  "<p>More than four months into the lockout, Allan Enright and Jose DeLeon \u2013 both wearing T-shirts emblazoned with a bald eagle and the word \u201cSolidarity\u201d \u2013 were picketing outside the Honeywell factory that makes airline brakes. <br></p> <p> On a street without any traffic or pedestrians, the two were showing their defiance toward Honeywell, the aerospace plant in South Bend, Indiana, which locked out 316 union members here on 9 May after they voted overwhelmingly to reject a proposed contract that they say contained a significantly worse health plan. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/indiana-carrier-factory-workers-donald-trump-hillary-clinton\">'Trump talks a big game' on Indiana factories \u2013 but workers express doubt</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Honeywell says it locked out the members of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/01/united-auto-workers-reject-fiat-chrysler-contract\">United Automobile Workers</a> (UAW) \u2013 and brought in replacement workers \u2013 to assure continued production and meet customers\u2019 deadlines. Enright, 59 and soft-spoken, sees things differently. \u201cBottom line, they want to get rid of the union completely,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why they locked us out.\u201d</p> <p> Honeywell and the UAW resumed talks this week after reaching a stalemate but tempers are high. The company has embraced a weapon that has grown increasingly popular across corporate America as organized labor has grown weaker: locking out workers to throw the union on the defensive and perhaps break the union\u2019s and the workers\u2019 will. </p> <p> \u201cI really think they\u2019re just trying to hold us out, to make us hungry, to make the membership fold,\u201d said Bryan Rodgers, the recording secretary of UAW Local 9 in South Bend. Honeywell has also locked out 42 UAW members at a second airline brake factory, in Green Island, New York, just north of Albany.</p> <p> Notwithstanding on-again, off-again negotiations, the company and union have been deadlocked since May. Tensions have festered and the workers have grown restive as the clashing sides continue to present vastly different views of the situation. The UAW says the airline brake factory here has fallen badly behind in keeping up with customer orders, while Honeywell insists that production is going well, better than with its unionized workforce.</p> <p> The union asserts that Honeywell should not be demanding concessions on health coverage, seniority and other matters when the company had record profits of $4.77bn last year and income in its aerospace division rose. But Honeywell says it needs to rein in costs because the aviation industry has hit some turbulence.</p> <p> \u201cThe union is ignoring the stark economic realities currently facing the global aviation industry, which has lost approximately 35,000 jobs since 2015,\u201d said Scott Sayres, a Honeywell spokesman.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t persuade John Suher Sr, a 60-year-old millwright, who is furious about the lockout. \u201cIt\u2019s basically corporate greed,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to eliminate the middle class.\u201d</p> <p>The dispute\u2019s main sticking point is health coverage. Union members say Honeywell\u2019s proposal would make many of them pay several thousand dollars more each year for health coverage. They also complain that Honeywell is demanding the power to unilaterally change health coverage, premiums and deductibles without the union\u2019s approval.</p> <p> \u201cThe unilateral healthcare changes are unacceptable to us,\u201d said the UAW\u2019s Rodgers. \u201cThey want to be able to change healthcare any time they want.\u201d</p> <p>But Honeywell\u2019s Sayres defended the proposal. \u201cWe are offering the same healthcare benefits available to nearly all other Honeywell employees in the US, including those represented by unions,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On a recent afternoon, Enright and DeLeon carried placards with bright red letters saying \u201cUAW Locked Out\u201d, as they stood alongside a makeshift shelter \u2013 a grey tarpaulin held up by wooden poles stuck into concrete-filled plastic buckets. A previous shelter had literally blown away during a ferocious summer storm. </p> <p> Wearing a bandanna on his head to shield him from the sun, DeLeon, a Honeywell employee for seven years, acknowledged the lockout was taking its toll. \u201cIt\u2019s a struggle,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a daughter in college, and my wife is ill. She\u2019s only got a part-time job. Between that and unemployment insurance, we\u2019re making it.\u201d</p> <p> Many workers are getting by only because they receive $390 or so in weekly unemployment insurance. But they worry about what will happen when those benefits expire in November.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/01/united-auto-workers-reject-fiat-chrysler-contract\">United Auto Workers reject Fiat Chrysler contract by wide margin</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The Honeywell workers average $22 an hour, or $45,760 a year for a full-time worker before overtime. Honeywell, however, says average total compensation exceeds $80,000 a year, including overtime and benefits \u2013 a number the union disputes. The company\u2019s contract offer includes a 8% raise over five years. </p> <p> The UAW has sought to turn up the pressure on Honeywell. On 21 September, 100 union members and supporters demonstrated outside a federal building in Albany to protest against the government\u2019s recent decision to award Honeywell\u2019s South Bend factory an $18.3m contract to produce replacement brakes for the navy\u2019s F/A-18 plane. </p> <p>Julie Kushner, director of the UAW\u2019s New York region, said: \u201cWe believe the government should stop giving new contracts or extending old contracts to a deplorable company that is locking out its workers and destroying good, middle-class jobs.\u201d</p> <p>Barbara Fick, a labor law professor at Notre Dame University here, questioned how long the workers could hold out. \u201cThese workers were used to making pretty good money,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if they\u2019re out four or five months without wages, they have obviously got to be hurting.\u201d</p>",

Some are more to blame than others. The advertisers, the ineffectual and highly compromised regulatory bodies, the affluent profiteers, higher education that is often so myopic about the real world.</p> <p>I agree that there are many thoughtless and ignorant people.

I have seen that empire extinguished, along with that of the USSR, and it seems, on current trends, the more informal but universally acknowledged US empire is weakening. It now seems likely that the dormant Chinese empire is resurgent after many years in the background.</p> <p>So who do we believe as our Nostradamus of imperial dominance? George Orwell, who predicated three supreme powers competing on the surface by shifting alliances, but in essence cooperating by the use of fear and thought control to share in world domination? Or should we place our trust in the Rand Corporation, America\u2019s university of imperialism, with its eponymous connection with Ayn Rand\u2019s naive philosophy of the beneficent capitalist?</p> <p>The conclusion of their recent study, which indicates a no-win situation between the two great powers (with a pre-emptive advantage to the US if it comes to actual hostilities), is truly frightening.</p> <p>If the view of unthinking think-tanks like Rand prevails, we could be about to be embroiled in an even greater crisis than we faced in the 1960s. <br><strong>Noel Bird</strong><br><em>Boreen Point, Queensland, Australia</em></p> <h2><strong>More than books and testing</strong><br></h2> <p>Jonathan Freedland makes a good case against grammar schools <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-grammar-school-selection-middle-class\" title=\"\">(16&#xa0;September)</a> but is assuming that every child can benefit from an academic education. There are clearly some who are intelligent, determined and talented, but are not academically inclined. They thrive on making, fixing, and discovering. It is unwise to assume that all children are cast in a single mould, and wiser to recognise that, regardless of family or post code, children may have widely differing educational needs.</p> <p>There is surely a case for offering children the possibility of an academic education or a more practically oriented one, according to their abilities and aspirations. It is not a question of creaming off the clever kids and leaving the rest as \u201crejects\u201d, as Freedland writes.

If there is a mutual attraction there is the potential of a permanent arrangement. Every self-respecting sevens team in the world has enquired about his availability. Rumour has it that Japan were ready to shower him with yen, with even New Zealanders speculating as to whether he should take over from Sir Gordon Tietjens.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/12/rugby-is-our-religion-fiji-erupts-in-celebration-of-olympic-sevens-gold\">'Rugby is our religion': Fiji erupts in celebration of Olympic sevens gold</a> </p> </aside>  <p>En route back home to Brentford he stopped briefly in the US and encountered complete strangers in Austin and New York who insisted on buying him drinks. They had watched the Olympics on TV and wanted to say thank you to the ginger guru with the glasses. In addition to being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/12/rugby-is-our-religion-fiji-erupts-in-celebration-of-olympic-sevens-gold\" title=\"\">awarded Fiji\u2019s highest</a> honour and three acres of land, the island nation is also introducing a special seven dollar bill with his face on it. There is continuing interest being shown in the US and China in turning the extraordinary Fijian rags-to-riches story into a film. A Bob Marley-inspired remix \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqdolgnITpY\" title=\"\">Iron, Lion, Ben Ryan</a> \u2013 is already out there.</p> <p>Not bad for a 45-year-old former Newbury director of rugby who was let go from the Rugby Football Union in 2013 after a difference of opinion with the then elite rugby director Rob Andrew. So, as we sit in the hotel bar directly adjoining the RFU offices at Twickenham, how many offers has he had from Premiership clubs to sprinkle a little bit of South Sea stardust on their northern hemisphere skillsets? The answer is one tentative approach from a lower-ranked side seeking an attack coach, subsequently withdrawn because of budgetary constraints. Amid the debate about developing home-grown English coaches, the risk-averse instincts of their employers remains a major hurdle.</p> <p>There has in fairness been interest from Pro12 teams and the possibility of assistant coach roles with a couple of Super Rugby franchises but Ryan, who has long wanted to return to XVs coaching in some capacity, is clearly wavering. Helping basketball to instil a rugby-style culture would be lucrative and professionally stimulating. \u201cI might know nothing about basketball but I\u2019m looking at relationships; whether they\u2019re overcomplicating things. To be successful you have to play the long game, have good standards and stick with them.\u201d</p> <p>If the British and Irish Lions need an innovative skills coach next summer with a track record of beating New Zealand, they should look no further. Assuming, that is, the multifaceted Ryan is still available. What a waste it would be if one of England\u2019s brighter coaches were to be lost to another sport at the peak of his powers.</p> <p>The only consolation is he would love to coach at another Olympics: \u201cI\u2019d like to give XVs a crack and I think I\u2019m a better XVs coach but going to an Olympic Games was amazing. To know you can go to future Olympics is definitely a pull because it\u2019s just another level. Having had success there shows you how global the Olympics is and how small rugby is by comparison.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever he does next, Ryan can sense the entire sport changing. Sevens may not transform the world but, as with Twenty20 cricket and Test matches, it has the potential to reshape the rugby landscape. \u201cIn 2023, if the guardians of the game are doing the right thing, the ball will be in play longer. The sport will be more athletic and it\u2019ll mean you need multipositional players.\u201d It is Ryan\u2019s firm belief, for example, that Tom Mitchell and Dan Bibby, the playmaking energisers of GB\u2019s sevens side, could play in any Super Rugby midfield; most Premiership XVs coaches would declare them too small. \u201cThe clubs look at sevens here and think: \u2018We\u2019ll send someone if they\u2019re not very good or struggling to make it.\u2019 That\u2019s not the case in New Zealand, Australia, South Africa or Fiji. If it\u2019s for inferior players why do people like Sonny Bill Williams struggle in sevens?\u201d</p> <p>There is much, much more. Ryan fears for the future of Fiji 15-a-side rugby if urgent measures are not taken by World Rugby to stem the exodus of players to foreign leagues and international squads. He believes there should be a Pacific Islands franchise in Super Rugby, as there now is for Argentina, to develop players, coaches and administrators alike. \u201cAsk the players and the coaches if they would like a Pacific Islands franchise and they would say: \u2018Yeah.\u2019 But Super Rugby have been paying lip service to that idea for 20 years and it\u2019s never happened. It needs World Rugby to say: \u2018You\u2019ve got to do this\u2019 because that would be a game-changer. For the good of the game you don\u2019t want Fiji getting worse at 15s and better at sevens. If Eddie Jones had 95% of his team not playing in England and he only had them once in a blue moon they wouldn\u2019t be top of the tree. There\u2019s no way.\u201d</p> <p>Alternatively, Ryan has an even more radical plan, albeit with some logistical hurdles. \u201cIf a Super Rugby franchise can\u2019t happen, then transplanting a side into a domestic league in Europe \u2013 the Pro12 or the Premiership \u2013 would be the second option. Take a team of Fijian players, base them in Kent or Cornwall, and they would go. Look at somewhere like Cornwall. There isn\u2019t a Premiership team and the islanders would love it there.\u201d</p> <p>So, reckons Ryan, would neutrals worldwide if rugby\u2019s answer to the Harlem Globetrotters played together week in week out. \u201cThat\u2019s how I explain it to Americans. It\u2019s like the Harlem Globetrotters but they\u2019re in the NBA, winning games. It would be so exciting for the world game.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan has come a long way in every sense since his first meeting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/dec/03/rugbyunion.comment\" title=\"\">with the Guardian in Newbury over a decade ago</a>. If he is lured to basketball for a year or two and earns a truckload of dollars it could not happen to a nicer bloke. It would be even nicer to think that, one day, English rugby will wake up to the far-sighted coach right under its own nose.</p> <h2>Time to trust Slade as England No12? </h2> <p>England <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/01/eddie-jones-maro-itoje-england-autumn-internationals\" title=\"\">are back training</a> in Brighton, Eddie Jones\u2019s seaside home from home. Short of relocating everyone back to Coogee Oval in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs it is as close as you can get in the UK to the beachfront vibe he used to enjoy in his Randwick days. When it comes to identifying players at openside and inside-centre, however, recreating the grand old days of Wallaby plenty seems to be trickier. For whatever reason, Jones does not seem to be able to find many attack-minded English-reared 7s and 12s who fit his exacting criteria to play Test rugby in those positions. If Owen Farrell remains unavailable along with Manu Tuilagi, for example, will he trust Exeter\u2019s Henry Slade at 12 or plump for the harder-running former league man Ben Te\u2019o, regardless of the fact the latter has barely played this season following a concussion against Gloucester? A midfield of George Ford, Slade and either Jonathan Joseph or Elliot Daly would certainly cover plenty of creative bases, particularly with a powerful winger like Semesa Rokoduguni in the mix. Either way this is the autumn to take a closer look at England\u2019s attacking options as opposed to playing safe.</p> <h2>All Blacks break the mould</h2> <p>People are talking about the All Blacks\u2019 reserve XV being the second best team in the world. They may be right. What is beyond dispute is New Zealand, as the best sides do, are challenging the game\u2019s supposed orthodoxies. When Argentina kicked off deep with 15 seconds left in the first half of Saturday\u2019s 36-17 Test defeat in Buenos Aries, most teams would have caught the restart, taken the ball into contact and then booted it into Row Z to bring the first 40 minutes to a routine close.</p> <p>Instead the All Blacks launched a thrilling attack from their own 22 that ended with a wonderful try for TJ Perenara. The sequence should be compulsory viewing for every age-group coach and player, not to mention a few Premiership ones.</p>",

The world\u2019s greatest experiment with communism was coming to an end.<br></p> <p>In June that same year, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/24/us/global-warming-has-begun-expert-tells-senate.html?pagewanted=all\">a scientist would testify to the United States Senate</a> that another experiment was well underway. In explaining this experiment he presented evidence that painted a future as dystopian as any conjured up by the then President Ronald Reagan about the dangers of communism.</p> <p>\u201cGlobal warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and observed warming ... It is already happening now,\u201d he said.</p> <p>That scientist was James Hansen, who was to become one of the most prominent advocates for addressing global warming, both in his leadership of climate science as the head of Nasa\u2019s Goddard Institute, and in later years via activism and occasional peaceful civil disobedience.</p> <p>Global emissions of greenhouse gases have increased by 60% since 1988. While Hansen\u2019s testimony is responsible for a significant increase in people\u2019s awareness of climate change, the consequences appear yet to sink in. </p> <p>Twenty six years later, Hansen is now <a href=\"http://www.ourchildrenstrust.org/us/federal-lawsuit\">seeking to have his day in court</a> to effectively force the US government to significantly reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Next month the district court of Oregon will rule whether to allow Hansen\u2019s and 21 young American citizen\u2019s case against the US government to proceed to trial. </p> <p>\u201cIt seemed to me that, at least in the US, the most fundamental concepts on which our country was founded were equal rights, equal protection of the laws. All people should have equal rights to life, liberty, property, and pursuit of happiness. The same as for civil rights,\u201d says Hansen.</p> <p>By failing to rein in climate change impacts, the rights of young people alive today and those that will be born in the future are being disregarded. There is also a fundamental failure of governments to manage natural resources and so <a href=\"https://law.uoregon.edu/images/uploads/entries/atmo.pdf\">protect the public trust</a>.</p> <p>Hansen has <a href=\"http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abs/ha00410c.html\">long argued</a> that humanity should move towards a safe limit for CO2 in the atmosphere of 350ppm - a value that the organisation <a href=\"https://350.org\">350.org</a> takes its name from \u2013 moving that boundary up or down as new evidence comes in. CO2 is <a href=\"https://www.co2.earth\">currently above 400ppm</a> and rising. If we do nothing, then a child born today will never experience safe levels of greenhouse gases and we will be forcing future generations to suck out CO2 directly from the atmosphere in order to avoid dangerous climate change. </p> <p>Some of this could be achieved with better soil management and replanting trees, but the longer we delay the more reliant we become on negative emissions technologies such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/09/carbon-capture-and-storage\">carbon capture and storage</a> which is still effectively at the prototype stage. Hansen and an international team of scientists have recently attempted to calculate the costs of the range of negative emissions that would be required to avoid dangerous climate change \u2013 and came to $104-570tn this century.</p> <p>Compare that to the current total size of the global economy, which is a little under $80tn. One argument against cutting greenhouse gas emissions is that it may threaten economic growth. It may be better to leave it to future generations to clean up our fossil-fuelled mess as presumably they will have the smarts and technology to do so. But we have to consider how likely it is that future generations will be able to afford such sums, at the same time as figuring out how to feed, clothe and house more than 9 billion people.</p> <p>Hansen and his team\u2019s calculations are contained in a paper that is currently in review in the journal <a href=\"http://www.earth-system-dynamics.net/index.html\">Earth System Dynamics</a> - ESD - and so may well be revised, or potentially rejected. Here I must disclose that I am on the editorial board of ESD, but I write this independently and do not claim to represent the views of the other editors. It is usual practice to not publicly discuss a paper that is in review - even an <a href=\"http://www.earth-syst-dynam-discuss.net\">open access review</a> model that ESD operates in which the original manuscript is made available online, along with reviewer\u2019s reports, author\u2019s responses and editorial judgements. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/03/global-temperature-climate-change-highest-115000-years\">Planet at its hottest in 115,000 years thanks to climate change, experts say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I am a big fan of this process as everything is made transparent.

  "<p>It is 12 days since the British authorities confiscated the passport of the Syrian journalist, Zaina Erhaim, a prominent critic of Bashar al-Assad. </p> <p>And it is four days since press freedom and human rights groups launched a joint protest over a decision that is, to be frank, a disgrace.</p> <p>Sadly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/24/syrian-journalist-zaina-erhaim-passport-held-assad-request\">aside from the Observer</a>, there has been almost no coverage of this tawdry episode in which the Home Office appears to have acted on behalf of Assad\u2019s regime.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think the fact that Erhaim was one of my students five years ago amounts to a conflict of interest but I thought I\u2019d best mention it, even though it is not the reason I am outraged at her treatment. </p> <p>First, you need to know that, in April, Erhaim - who acts a co-ordinator for the Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR) in Syria - was <a href=\"https://iwpr.net/global-voices/iwprs-syria-coordinator-wins-landmark-freedom\">awarded the 2016 Index on Censorship freedom of expression award for journalism</a>.</p> <p>She risked her life in 2013 by entering her native Syria in order to train people to report on the war. Two years later, she made a documentary, Syria\u2019s Rebellious Women.</p> <p>I have no hesitation is describing Erhaim as a press freedom hero, a woman whose opposition to Assad should have gained her plaudits from the British government. </p> <p>Instead, here\u2019s what happened. On 22 September, she flew into Britain from her base in Turkey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/sep/20/war-reporting-bravery-channel-4-lindsey-hilsum\">to appear at the Write on Kew literary festival</a><a href=\"http://www.kew.org/visit-kew-gardens/whats-on/write-on-kew\"> </a>alongside the BBC\u2019s chief news correspondent, Kate Adie.</p> <p>She was detained at the airport by the UK border agency. After being questioned for an hour, the officials then confiscated her passport. </p> <p>They explained that the passport had been reported stolen by the Syrian authorities and the agency was therefore compelled to retain it and return it to Damascus.</p> <p>Compelled? Really? An agency of the British government, which is in a de facto state of war with Syria, thinks it should stick to the diplomatic book by acceding to a request from the Syrian government?</p> <p>As Erhaim told the Observer: \u201cI expect to be harassed inside my country... if I went home I would be killed, but now I find that Assad\u2019s arm can even reach to the UK. This is a dictator pursuing a journalist.\u201d<br></p> <p>No wonder the IWPR, Index on Censorship, Reporters Without Borders, the Council for Arab-British Understanding and the Frontline Club are up in arms about Erhaim\u2019s case.</p> <p>But they should not be alone in their protests. Newspapers should take up the case. The home office has tried to excuse its actions by saying that Britain had to comply with the Syrian request because passports are the legal property of the government that issues them. </p> <p>Would the home office have complied with such a request from Hitler\u2019s regime in the second world war? Would it have done so for the Soviet government during the cold war? Come off it. </p> <p>Jodie Ginsberg, chief executive of Index on Censorship, found it \u201castonishing that the UK would accede to a request from a government... only this week accused of being complicit in war crimes.\u201d Quite so.</p> <p>I recall that the home secretary, Amber Rudd, once worked as a journalist. She should look into this disturbing case and discover, first, why it happened and second, act to ensure our officials do not work at the behest of Assad\u2019s government.</p> <p>I emailed a series of question to the home office earlier today. Among them, given Britain\u2019s opposition to the Syrian government, I asked: \u201cIs it not extraordinary to act on its behalf?\u201d </p> <p>A spokesperson told me the matter was \u201cbeing looked into.\u201d Should any answer arrive, I will post it here.</p>",

Although the hamlet has been a regular stop on the northern cruise ship circuit for more than two decades, the Serenity eclipsed the small cruise vessels that have previously stopped there, said Vicki Aitaok, a local tour operator who coordinated the visit. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really know how it would impact us or how we would feel about the day.\u201d </p> <p>More than two years of planning went into the visit, during which tourists were brought in on Zodiac inflatable boats in groups of 150 so as not to overwhelm residents. The passengers \u2013 regaled with drum dancers, throat singers and the creations of local artisans \u2013 left more than C$100,000 in the community. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of employment opportunities in the community when the cruise ships come here,\u201d said Aitaok. \u201cAll the money stays in the community.\u201d </p> <p>The visit clearly demonstrated the role the burgeoning Arctic tourism industry can play in the region, said Aitaok \u2013 but within limits. The Serenity pulled into the hamlet just a day after another ship had visited, leaving many residents exhausted. \u201cThere just aren\u2019t that many people here,\u201d she said. \u201cFor us here, because we have such minimal resources, we need at least a day between each ship.\u201d</p> <p>Most communities in Nunavut have between 500 and 3,000 residents, said the government of Nunavut\u2019s MacIsaac, meaning visits by large cruise ships risk significantly disrupting daily life. \u201cThese types of disruptions must be mitigated and one way to do that is through regulations.\u201d</p> <p>Prospective rules being considered include limiting the number of passengers who can disembark in a community at a time or forcing ships to provide passengers with visitor guidelines.</p> <p>Authorities are mindful of the need to strike a balance between regulating tourists and ensuring communities can maximise the benefits of mass tourism. \u201cMore passengers visiting a community means more carvings, prints and other crafts are purchased, which means a substantially larger economic impact on a community from a single ship visit,\u201d said MacIsaac. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78f358679396e69224af26f244101f5e149c03fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78f358679396e69224af26f244101f5e149c03fd/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Crystal Serenity with 1,000 passengers on board rides at anchor just outside Nome, Alaska.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Crystal Serenity with 1,000 passengers on board rides at anchor just outside Nome, Alaska.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thiessen/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Echoing a conundrum <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2016/sep/27/dont-look-now-venice-tourists-locals-sick-of-you-cruise-liners\">facing tourist destinations around the world,</a> the government is also grappling with how best to ensure that cruise ship visits are worthwhile for the host community, he said. \u201cSeveral communities have expressed concerns that they are not receiving adequate economic return to warrant the amount of effort involved with cruise ship visits.\u201d </p> <p>Regulations being mulled include forcing cruise ship operators to report regularly to the government on what their passengers leave behind in each community they visit, he said. \u201cThis will allow the government to track the economic impact of ship visits and to shape policy accordingly.\u201d</p> <p>The tourist boom comes just as Inuit are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/10/paris-climate-change-talks-arctic-inuit-youth-cop21\">struggling to contend</a> with the effects of climate change, said Okalik Eegeesiak, chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Council. \u201cIn 2015, about 200,000 people went to the Arctic on cruise ships,\u201d she said. </p> <p>The Serenity took care to mitigate its environmental impact, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/20/inuit-arctic-ecosystem-extinction-tourism-crystal-serenity\">burning low-sulphur fuel and maintaining tight controls </a>on the ship\u2019s air, water and rubbish discharges.

It took 40 hours for a Canadian icebreaker to reach and evacuate the ship\u2019s passengers. The Canadian coast guard later filed a lawsuit seeking almost half a million dollars in damages over pollution, claiming that 13 tanks aboard the ship \u2013 holding fuel, freshwater and sludge \u2013 were breached during the grounding. </p> <p>The idea of mass tourism in the Arctic, said Eegeesiak, is woefully out of step with the region\u2019s glaring lack of infrastructure and limited capacity for search and rescue. \u201cOnce a disaster happens, it will have happened,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd is that the only time we\u2019re going to say we should have done it better.\u201d </p>",

Searching for meddling non-natives to blame is ultimately a distraction. The idea that the housing crisis can be pinned on foreigners is a politically convenient simplification that risks letting other culprits off the hook, while doing little to change the status quo.</p> <p>Focusing on overseas investors allows British policymakers to obscure their own role in producing the housing crisis. Over the decades, politicians at all levels of government have played an active part in creating this situation. Ministers promoted market-centric reforms such as the right to buy and more flexible tenancies, welcomed institutional investors into the housing market, and pushed through budget cuts in the name of austerity. These changes undermined council housing and weakened tenants\u2019 security while making housing a more liquid commodity. Councillors across greater London have given the green light to estate demolition and gentrification, and allowed developers to build expensive new projects without significant numbers of affordable housing units.</p> <p>Without these actions, we wouldn\u2019t even be talking about Russian or Chinese investors. National and local political elites in Canada, Australia, the US, and elsewhere likewise bear responsibility for promoting the financialisation of housing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Pointing at foreigners is a way to pretend to address the housing problem while ignoring the demands of activists</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Blaming overseas investors similarly ignores domestic ones. Foreign owners may be particularly disconnected from local knowledge and conditions, but if they were simply replaced by their native counterparts who pursue the same strategies, the housing crisis would remain.</p> <p>Pointing the finger at foreigners is also a way to pretend to address the housing problem while ignoring the demands of activists. The movements that have been mobilising in opposition to developers, councils and national government are fighting against displacement and in favour of establishing housing as a universal right.

Foreign ownership only matters because it is fuelling this broader process.</p> <p>Rather than lashing out at foreigners, who are an easy target, city-dwellers and politicians such as Sadiq Khan need to ask tougher questions.

WSUP\u2019s work with water services company Jirama in Antananarivo, Madagascar, for example, managed to increase the water supply to benefit 700,000 low-income customers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/mar/22/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-a-broken-water-pump\">How do you solve a problem like a broken water pump?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jeffery says that working on improving operating efficiencies is a useful point of engagement with utilities that have a negative perception of service provision for the poor. \u201cWe want to demonstrate in the same breath how the business can function better so that they can deliver to [the poor], but also how it can work better per se,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The World Bank found that the utilities that serve the poor well all had their houses in order \u2013 reduced non-revenue water, increased billing and collection efficiency, improved productivity \u2013 before investing in service extension to low-income customers. Tariffs were also set so that the companies can recoup their costs. Profits then allowed the utilities to pay for extensions to the network and added capacity.</p> <p>Following this model, the World Bank calculated that if Mowasco, Mombasa\u2019s struggling utility, achieved similar levels of efficiency as the continent\u2019s star performers, it could generate enough cash to provide universal piped water access across the city and annual tariff increases to a minimum. </p> <p>The other thing that set successful utilities apart was their ability to innovate, says Heymans. Cross-subsidising tariffs (where commercial consumers pay more than households) is one thing; accommodating irregular income or having to adapt services to informal settlements is another.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s genuinely helped enhance our knowledge base of our customers and get a sense of closeness with [them]</p> <footer> <cite>Rose Kaggwa</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>eThekwini, Durban\u2019s municipality, has developed electronic flow limiters to monitor water consumption: poor residents are entitled to a free water allowance of 300 litre per household per day and, to prevent them from going over their entitlement, flow slows down to a trickle.

  "<p>Leading shares have broken through the 7000 barrier for the first time since May 2015 as a plunge in the pound to a new 31 year low boosts the exporter-heavy FTSE 100.</p> <p>Banking shares are also receiving some support from a revival in <strong>Deutsche Bank</strong>. After a market holiday in Germany on Monday, the bank\u2019s shares have reopened up 2.55% on hopes that it will not have to pay as much as the $14bn demanded by the US Department of Justice in fines related to mortgage mis-selling.</p> <p>So <strong>Standard Chartered</strong> is up 17.3p at 651.5p, <strong>Barclays</strong> is 2.1p better at 170.3p and <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> has risen 2.3p to 181.6p.</p> <p>But the biggest riser in the leading index is <strong>Pearson</strong>, up more than 6% to 811p as analysts at Morgan Stanley dismissed suggestions the education specialist could issue a profit warning:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Down 25% from its highs and with an around 10% 2018 free cashflow yield versus a PE of 10 times the market is expecting another profits warning. We don\u2019t think Pearson will warn, meaning the shares could recover sharply on the third quarter results.</p> </blockquote> <p>In more detail the bank spelled out why it thinks Pearson shares are too cheap:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>(i) Pearson cut market expectations by \u00a335m-\u00a375m pre restructuring (and \u00a3355m-\u00a3395m post restructuring) in January. This covers a multitude of sins.</p> <p>(ii) Pearson\u2019s EBITA forecasts have a lot of flex allowing, for instance, an increase of \u00a3110m in incentive compensation in 2016 \u2013 18% of expected EBITA.</p> <p>(iii) Pearson strongly reiterated its 2016-18 guidance at the first half figures and has not rescinded it in subsequent public appearances, the most recent being September 21.</p> <p>(iv) There is better trading elsewhere at Pearson with good growth in the digital businesses and better than expected contract wins in Assessment. </p> <p>v) 2017 is an inevitable upswing year in US schools with a better environment in US Higher Education (enrolments close to flat) and US and UK assessment.</p> <p>(vi) With 66% of sales in the US and sub 10% in the UK, Pearson is a play on Brexit nervousness.</p> <p>(vii) We think Pearson won\u2019t warn at the third quarter (end October), the peak trading period. Given the underperformance, low rating and big dividend yield \u2013 almost 7% \u2013 we think the shares will bounce strongly on this. </p> </blockquote> <p>Testing equipment group <strong>Intertek</strong> has also received some broker support. Its shares have jumped 166p to \u00a337.08 after Jefferies raised its recommendation from underperform to buy on the basis of strong growth and possible acquisition activity:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our analysis of margin levers provides a strong case for profit growth faster than revenues, while strong free cashflow allows us to now formally model M&amp;A. We upgrade 2017 earnings per share by 10% of which 6% is underlying. Growth and margins in the main division - Products - look well supported by secular drivers. Double upgrade to buy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is currently up 88.30 points at 7071.82, with UK construction data also giving some support by coming in stronger than expected.</p> <p>The pound\u2019s new slide comes after UK prime minister Theresa May set the clock ticking on Brexit negotiations, and suggested the focus would be on immigration controls rather than the single market. Financial analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> It seems that it is going to be hard to provide a tourniquet for sterling\u2019s recent wounds given the solidity of the newly announced Brexit timeline (with March set to go down in the history books as when Article 50 was triggered), and the firmness with which May stated her intention to chase border control even if it means relinquishing Britain\u2019s position in the single market. </p> </blockquote> <p>Domestic focussed stocks and defensive shares were under pressure, with <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> down 2.2p at 323.8p and<strong> National Grid</strong> 2.5p lower at 1099.5p.<br></p> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Henderson Group</strong> is down 5.3p at 265.4p after Monday\u2019s surge in the wake of <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/03/janus-henderson-to-have-headquarters-in-london\">its proposed merger with Janus Capital,</a></strong> but specialist lender <strong>Onesavings</strong> has added 15.3p to 284p after Barclays moved from equal weight to overweight with a price target lifted from 235p to 340p.</p> <p>Continuing merger hopes among the mid-caps have helped the FTSE 250 soar to a new peak, up 1.6% to 18,474.70. Ian Williams, economist at Peel Hunt, told Reuters:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s quite a big chunk of globally diverse companies in that group [the FTSE 250] as well, and an agreed takeover bid for one of its constituents has helped... For foreign investors who are looking at sterling-denominated assets, they are continuing to get a bit cheaper.</p> </blockquote>",

  "<p>Silky sharks, thresher sharks and devil rays all won new protections at a global wildlife summit late on Monday.</p> <p>Sharks are the ocean\u2019s top predators and play a vital role in many ecosystems but many species have been decimated by uncontrolled fishing, particularly the trade in fins which are used in soup in Asia.</p> <p>The 182 nations of the <a href=\"https://cites.org/cop17\">Convention in the Trade in Endangered Species</a> (Cites), meeting in Johannesburg, voted to put in place its first measures to control the trade in these species. The move, along with protections for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/11/shark-species-greater-protection-finning\">five other sharks</a> at the previous Cites summit in 2013, suggest the tide is turning for sharks. </p> <p>About <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/01/100-million-sharks-killed-each-year\">100 million sharks are killed every year</a>, driven by a $1bn annual trade, and only a fraction have had any protection. Many of the predators are now among the most threatened creatures on the planet. But the new action by Cites has doubled to 20% the proportion of sharks targeted by the fin trade that are now regulated.</p> <p>All the species protected by Cites on Monday are slow to mature and produce only a small number of pups at a time, making them particularly vulnerable to overexploitation.</p> <p>The silky shark is now one of the most common fins seen in Hong Kong, the centre of the trade. \u201cThey have shot up and they are getting this huge pounding,\u201d said Luke Warwick, from the Pew Charitable Trusts. </p> <p>Thresher sharks have long sweeping tails, which they use to corral and stun their prey, and are particularly popular with divers. The big eye thresher had been hit particularly hard, but Cites also protected the two other thresher species. Where data is available, thresher and silky shark numbers have dropped 70-90% in recent decades.</p> <p>Devil rays can grow up to five metres wide and be a tonne in weight, but are harmless plankton-feeders. They swim slowly in groups, so are very easy to catch. Their gill plates have become popular as a supposed medicine in China, and numbers are crashing.</p> <p>The proposals to protect the species were made by a group of 49 nations, thought to be the largest for any Cites proposal ever. Sri Lanka, responsible for half the catch of silky sharks in the last decade, was part of the group, saying the fishery was important to its people and it wanted it to be sustainable. </p> <p>The Philippines, Bahamas and Maldives all argued that sharks were valuable tourist attractions. \u201cThresher sharks are worth more alive than dead,\u201d the Philippines delegate told the Cites summit.<br></p> <p>Strong opposition to the proposals came from Japan, who said there was little reliable evidence that protection was needed and that implementing the measures would be hard, creating \u201cconfusion and difficulty\u201d for national authorities. Iceland made the same arguments, while China said the silky shark proposal was \u201cmisleading and discriminatory\u201d and that the demand for fins was already falling. </p> <p>But most other nations thought the measures were needed and the proposals passed with overwhelming majorities, 79% for the sharks and 85% for the devil rays. The decisions still have to be confirmed in the final plenary session of the summit, but they are not expected to be challenged. The new protections will mean catches of the sharks and rays have to be monitored and are only permitted if they do not threaten the survival of the species.</p> <p>\u201cI am just elated,\u201d said Andy Cornish, at WWF and based in Hong Kong. \u201cIt\u2019s a big win for all these sharks and rays as governments around the world will now have to act to reduce the overfishing that threatens them.\u201d He said the lack of data on catches has been a serious problem in trying to conserve the shark species, but the new protections required nations to gather the vital information. </p> <p>Elizabeth Murdock, at the National Resource Defence Council, said: \u201cThe demand for these species is completely unsustainable and it is driving them towards extinction. [Today] is a huge step forward for sharks and rays and for the health of our oceans globally.\u201d</p> <p>Guy Stevens, from the Manta Trust, was delighted by the success of the devil ray proposal: \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s been years of hard work to get to this point.\u201d </p> <p>He said the argument that poor coastal communities relied on ray meat for food, made by some opponents of the proposal, did not stack up: \u201cThey would have been fished out a long time ago if they were tasty. But they taste like crap.\u201d<br></p>",

The show has been developed using anecdotes, opinions and experiences of older people in south London.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/03/loneliness-george-monbiot-ewan-mclennan-songs-tour\">George Monbiot: why I wrote an album of anthems for all the lonely people</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to research highlighted by the <a href=\"http://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org/loneliness-research/\">Campaign to End Loneliness</a>, more than half (51%) of all people aged 75 and over live alone, while two-fifths all older people (about 3.9 million) say the television is their main company. </p> <p>Beautiful Mess creative producer Chloe Osborne says the theatre company was inspired to create the project following a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/14/age-of-loneliness-killing-us\">Guardian article about loneliness</a>. Osborne adds: \u201cThere was a particular article which initially inspired artistic director Kati Francis to create the work. The article raised the question of how it\u2019s possible to have this rise in loneliness amid an ever-increasing population. In particular we wanted to explore why people can\u2019t \u2013 or don\u2019t \u2013 connect anymore.\u201d</p> <p>Between May and August this year, the Loneliness Street Cabaret was performed more than 200 times in south London, Liverpool, Devon and Italy. The two-person performance involves an eclectic mix of puppetry, live music and physical comedy, with audience interaction, \u201cin the best tradition of street theatre\u201d, says Osborne. Audience members are invited to help \u2013 or hinder \u2013 one of the characters, a businessman who is too busy on his mobile phone to engage with others, including another character, a woman who makes him think twice about his actions. </p> <p>The Loneliness Street Cabaret, funded by Arts Council England and supported by the Big Lottery Fund and Wandsworth, Greenwich and Lambeth councils, specialises in touring its outdoor work to arts festivals and \u201coverlooked municipal areas\u201d. Its mission is to \u201cmake theatre that champions the voices of the unheard\u201d and promote positive social change. Productions are developed in collaboration with the community and have a social issue at their heart. Founder and artistic director Kati Francis says the approach \u201cenables multiple and diverse voices to inform our professional work\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2014/nov/07/executive-officer-tackling-loneliness-older-people\">Tackling loneliness in older people, one cup of tea at a time</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Development of the performance involved collaborating with older people in Lambeth, community workers and care professionals through Age UK Lambeth. Development took around six months. Osborne explains: \u201cResearch began with some informal visits with older people at a community centre and a local care home, spending time with people and having conversations. This developed this into small group workshops with thoughts about archetypal people who might be isolated; how they behave \u2026 the characters developed from that.\u201d</p> <p>Older people, says Osborne, also raised fears about the rise of loneliness among the younger generation, a concern highlighted in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jul/20/loneliness-britains-silent-plague-hurts-young-people-most\">research from the Mental Health Foundation</a>. Osborne says: \u201cWhat came from the older generation was that they felt most sorry for the generation growing up now, because people were choosing to isolate themselves \u2013 through technology.\u201d</p> <p>The shows are performed in public spaces, from outside tube stations to public squares, in the hope that the shared experience of performance will spark the audience to have conversations and take action based on the show\u2019s themes. Osborne says the aim is to provoke people to consider the issues highlighted by the performance: \u201cIt\u2019s about your local community and how you fit within it, but also about what your responsibility is for ensuring that others belong in it too.\u201d</p> <p>The fact that the action always takes place in public spaces, says Osborne, means it might attract people who do not usually go to the theatre or participate in the arts. She adds: \u201cIt\u2019s performance provocation in overlooked public spaces. It is about really prompting people to explore their own feelings and emotional responses and think about their community.\u201d At a time when many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/20/privatisation-public-spaces-rip-out-heart-britains-cities\">public areas are being privatised</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/30/hundreds-of-thousands-call-for-legal-protection-of-uk-parks?CMP=share_btn_tw\">public green spaces are on the wane</a>, the theatre group is keen to champion and use the public shared environment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2014/may/12/answer-combating-loneliness-lies-community\">The answer to combating loneliness lies in the community</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kim Connell, Age UK Lambeth services manager, adds: \u201cAs people get older, they don\u2019t choose to be isolated but their circumstances change with age.

  "<p>When Eyeo, the company behind ad-blocking tool Adblock Plus, revealed it was launching an ad tech platform for publishers, it provoked a violent backlash. The press reported that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/13/adblock-plus-launching-platform-to-sell-acceptable-ads\">Adblock Plus would start selling ads to publishers</a>, effectively making it a poacher turned gamekeeper.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>On the face of it, what the company has actually done is extended its existing \u201cAcceptable Ads\u201d platform, which it launched in 2011, creating a more efficient way to whitelist ads. <br></p> <p>The new platform, which launched in beta last month, lets publishers and bloggers choose from a marketplace of pre-whitelisted ads, allowing them to drag and drop these on to their sites. In short, it is a slicker operation. \u201cInstead of publishers coming to us and giving us URLs of specific ad placements that they have and working with us to fit the criteria, we have been able to automate the process so they only have [whitelisted ads] to choose from,\u201d says Ben Williams, operations manager at Eyeo.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But this is not how many in the industry see it. The move effectively creates an ad network. As Johnny Ryan, head of ecosystem at PageFair, which helps publishers to overcome ad-blocking software, says, \u201cThere is a troubling conflict of interest in a business blocking ads on the one hand and offering to sell access for advertising on the other.\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Indeed, in addition to paying a licensing fee to have their ads deemed acceptable \u2013 and therefore whitelisted \u2013 larger publishers and ad networks will also see 6% of the total advertising revenue from these ads go to Adblock Plus. A common view is that Eyeo has erected a gate and now it is charging people to go through it.<br></p> <p>Nick Flood, head of product at Dennis Publishing, says the organisation has seen desktop ad-blocking across its portfolio increase to double-digit percentage levels. It is one of many publishers now grappling with how to address the challenge, implementing initiatives such as serving targeted messages to users.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Flood doesn\u2019t welcome Adblock Plus\u2019 news. \u201cEyeo have built a significant user base over the last few years by allowing users to block adverts across the web. They are a commercial organisation and are looking for their next revenue stream. They already make significant amounts of revenue by charging companies such as Google, Microsoft and publishers to get on their Acceptable Ads list . This is bad enough, but creating its own ad network moves it on a step further.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Williams argues that it is only larger entities \u2013 publishers who gain more than 10m additional ad impressions per month from the Acceptable Ads initiative \u2013 who pay a licensing fee, which amounts to 30% of the revenue. \u201cI should point out that 90% of the companies on the whitelist don\u2019t pay a dime.\u201d<br></p> <p>But it still sits very uncomfortably, in part because of the self-regulating nature of the Acceptable Ads initiative and the perceived lack of transparency. \u201cAcceptable Ads [programme] has no representation from recognised advertising and publishing industry bodies such as the IPA, IAB or ISBA,\u201d says Dominic Good, global advertising sales and strategy director at the Financial Times. \u201cIt does not have any endorsement from the industry and as such there is very little transparency around what is acceptable, why, to whom, and how these decisions have been arrived at.\u201d Ryan agrees: \u201cEyeo uses Adblock Plus and its other ad-blocking software as the engine of an opaque business model: it is not known who must pay what to appear where.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Williams argues that the company\u2019s move to hand over control of what is deemed to be an \u201cacceptable\u201d ad to an independent review board is all in the name of transparency. \u201cThe criteria will soon be out of our hands.\u201d He says the committee will include representatives from advertisers and publishers as well as users and privacy specialists. \u201cOnce we have finished recruiting we will list every representative on the board.\u201d </p> <p>But it doesn\u2019t tackle the issue of the gate and the gatekeeper. Bill Fisher, senior analyst at eMarketer, says hypocrisy is too strong a word for Eyeo\u2019s latest move. Instead he is realistic. \u201cIt\u2019s a business, and it needs to make money. Having control of its own SSP (Supply Side Platform) gives it another instant revenue stream.\u201d </p> <p>Richard Reeves, managing director of the Association of Online Publishing goes one step further, stating that while Adblock Plus\u2019 move was inevitable, it \u201cdoesn\u2019t make it any less hypocritical or applaudable. The driving force behind this move is not to create a fairer and more transparent value exchange between readers, advertisers and publishers, but to profit from the very companies it claims to support.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, Adblock\u2019s move does allow publishers to reach a valuable, tech savvy audience who have previously put themselves out of reach, and with ads that it deems to be non-intrusive. But Reeves believes this is at great cost. \u201cBoth publishers and readers are losing out, whether through reduced revenue or an unwelcome user experience.\u201d <br></p> <p>Fisher adds that serving ads to those who have opted out doesn\u2019t sound particularly \u201cprogressive\u201d. But as Williams is keen to point out, Adblock Plus does continue to give its users the option to block even ads that meet the \u201cacceptable\u201d criteria. \u201cUsers can opt out [of all ads] at any time. However, only about 8%\u201310% of our users choose to block them all. We think, after five years, that\u2019s pretty resounding proof of the concept.\u201d</p> <p>The industry remains hugely sceptical. Adblock Plus says it has over 1,000 publishers on board, with Williams commenting that \u201cpublishers got it and signed up in droves\u201d. Flood remains unimpressed. \u201cEyeo are strategically attempting to position themselves as part of the ad ecosystem and take an increased slice of the revenues but in reality they are damaging it. As things stand we won\u2019t be signing up to this product.\u201d<br></p> <p>Good takes a similar view. \u201cWe believe that it is for the publisher to develop an advertising proposition that is appropriate to its users expectations rather than leave it to a centralised body, with little or no accountability, to devise a standard that is applicable to all.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>PageFair works closely with publishers and publishers\u2019 trade organisations on a daily basis, and Ryan says he hasn\u2019t \u201cseen any willingness among publishers to pay for the privilege of reaching their own audiences.\u201d Or as Fisher says, \u201cIt\u2019s like feeding the hand that bites you.\u201d An odd move, in anyone\u2019s book.</p> <p><strong><em>To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox,</em></strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\"><strong><em>sign up free for Media &amp; Tech Network membership</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p> <p><em>All Guardian Media &amp; Tech Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled \u201cBrought to you by\u201d \u2013 find out more </em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2016/jan/25/content-funding\">here</a></em><em>.</em></p>",

  "<p>Visitors to the F54 <em>K</em><em>iezladen (</em>neighbourhood cooperative) in Berlin\u2019s Neuk\u00f6lln district are hit by the smell of chopped onions. Inside the kitchen, members are busy chopping vegetables to make a supper of <em>soljanka</em>, a Russian soup, for the stream of residents arriving for a beer and a chat \u2013 and, in some cases, to see the rental rights lawyer who is volunteering advice this evening.</p> <p>The cooperative \u2013 formally known as <a href=\"http://friedelstrasse54.blogsport.eu/\">Friedel Strasse 54</a> \u2013 was recently given notice to quit by the investor that had bought the apartment block in July, Pinehill sarl: a mailbox company registered in Luxembourg. The septuagenarian dental technician who occupied the ground-floor workshop here for decades has already been evicted.</p> <p>It is an increasingly common scenario in Neuk\u00f6lln, a sprawling neighbourhood that has become a magnet for young Europeans in recent years, and has found itself in the sights of international property developers as a result.</p> <p>Matthias Sander (his requested pseudonym for talking to the Guardian), a 32-year-old history and politics teacher, is a resident of one of the 20 flats that make up F54. \u201cThe cooperative is basically a squat now; we\u2019re just waiting to see what happens,\u201d he says. \u201cOur only hope is that our own initiative will kick in somehow, or the property market will collapse, allowing us to buy the building ourselves.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4b849a88240701807de4a13b65d844d9fcd7a7d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b849a88240701807de4a13b65d844d9fcd7a7d2/0_0_1217_1520/801.jpg\" alt=\"Friedel Strasse 54 in Neuk\u00f6lln, Berlin.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><a href=\"http://friedelstrasse54.blogsport.eu/\">Friedel Strasse 54</a> in Neuk\u00f6lln, Berlin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Connolly/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Until a few years ago, investors discovering Berlin ignored Neuk\u00f6lln as too scruffy and working-class. It has the largest number of migrants of any district in the city, and the highest number of social welfare recipients. But in recent years, as Berlin\u2019s housing market has boomed, investors have been seizing everything they can: \u201cI\u2019d say every second building has either been bought or is in the process of being bought,\u201d Sander says.</p> <p>Recognising that the city\u2019s Social Democrat government had minimal interest in bucking this trend (the mayor said she welcomed a middle-class influx), the Neuk\u00f6lln Tenants\u2019 Alliance set about collecting signatures in support of introducing \u201c<em>milieuschutz\u201d</em> in the area. Under this law \u2013 translated as \u201csocial environment protection\u201d \u2013 real estate is shielded against owners\u2019 attempts to renovate and modernise it to the extent that existing residents could be forced out. </p> <p>\u201cThe <em>milieuschutz</em> should ensure that neighbourhoods in Berlin remain lively and socially mixed, enabling anyone to live wherever he or she wants,\u201d says Hans Panhoff, a city councillor responsible for building, planning and environment in the neighbouring district of Kreuzberg, which has borne the brunt of Berlin\u2019s gentrification drive.</p> <p>Panhoff says the law can work in conjunction with other measures, such as new rent control regulations and the right of authorities to block sales, should they be able to raise the money to buy a building themselves. (Currently, there are two prominent examples of  tenement blocks in Kreuzberg-Friedrichshain whose residents would have faced eviction by the Luxembourg investor who was on the verge of snapping them up. Instead, the district authorities have provisionally secured both blocks under this \u201ccommunal right of first refusal\u201d rule \u2013 although Panhoff says the cases are in legal limbo, while experts agree this model will not offer a long-term sustainable solution due to a simple lack of funds.)</p> <p>Panhoff\u2019s department has produced a flyer to inform local residents of the city\u2019s housing<em> </em>laws: \u201cMany people are unaware about what they have to tolerate and what they don\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to increase awareness, and have seen a rise in the number of queries as a result.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7a0f99aa006b287f0ed0bf7162413401d51c090f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a0f99aa006b287f0ed0bf7162413401d51c090f/0_107_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the Friedel Strasse 54 cooperative protest the enforced closure of Berlin\u2019s legendary M99 corner shop.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of the Friedel Strasse 54 cooperative protest the enforced closure of Berlin\u2019s legendary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/berlin-m99-hans-georg-lindenau-corner-shop-revolutionary\">M99 corner shop</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NurPhoto via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <em>milieuschutz</em> laws are far from new \u2013 some German cities began implementing them more than 40 years ago \u2013 but their spread has never been as rapid as now: a time of unprecedented real estate price rises.</p> <p>In areas protected by the law, owners are forbidden from changing floor plans, merging two flats into one or splitting large flats up into several, adding balconies or terraces larger than four square metres, installing fitted kitchens or undertaking luxury bathroom renovations \u2013 or using the flat as a holiday let.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have bureaucrats on our side who are at least going to make their lives as difficult as possible</p> <footer> <cite>Andreas Haltermann</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe have been seeing a rapid increase in such modifications being carried out,\u201d says Andreas Haltermann of the Tenants\u2019 Alliance, \u201cprimarily so landlords can increase the rent \u2013 sometimes to an extortionate level \u2013 with the intention of pushing existing residents out, so they can either sell the flat or rent it out at a much higher rate.\u201d</p> <p>Haltermann claims the <em>milieuschutz</em> \u2013 which was passed by the Neuk\u00f6lln government in its \u201cmost urgent\u201d areas in the new year, and finally came into full force this summer \u2013 has already prevented planning permission on several building projects.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re aware that property companies are capable of many tricks to get conversions through regardless,\u201d he says, \u201cbut we have bureaucrats on our side who are at least going to make their lives as difficult as possible, and hopefully slow down the process so much that large investors are put off buying here.\u201d</p> <p>Martin, a 49-year-old arts promoter, is reluctant to give his full name because he is still in legal dispute with a Spanish businessman who recently bought the building in which he has lived with his wife for 12 years. Martin says the <em>milieuschutz</em> has so far ensured the string of modernisation measures the new owner wanted to carry out were not allowed to happen.</p> <p>\u201cHe wanted to put in under-floor heating, to change the floor plans, to insulate the walls, to install solar panels \u2013 you name it,\u201d he says. The measures would apparently have led to a more-than-threefold increase in his rent, from \u20ac600 to \u20ac2,000. \u201cMy wife and I both work, so we might have been able to afford it \u2013 but for our neighbour it would have meant paying 85% of her wages towards rent.

Rent rises are, in theory, capped \u2013 the longer someone has lived somewhere, the lower their rent is and the more rights they have. </p> <p>But if the owner upgrades the property, he is able to offset a considerable chunk of those costs on to the rent. Long-term, sociologists warn, this is likely to water down the healthy social mix in neighbourhoods that city residents often cite as one of the reasons life in Berlin is so pleasant and relaxed.</p> <h2>\u2018I don\u2019t want to go\u2019</h2> <p>The <em>milieuschutz</em> has done little to help the residents of Lenaustrasse 23 and Hobrechtstrasse 62, known collectively as <a href=\"http://lebrecht2362ev.de/\">Lebrecht 2362</a>, in Neuk\u00f6lln. On the day the Guardian visits, the new owner of the buildings, a Berlin developer, has sent his own inspector to compile an inventory of the 30-or-so apartments, ahead of a planned luxury upgrade.</p> <p>Henry, a social worker, nervously shows the inspector around his quirkily decorated flat, painted in shades of green, turquoise and yellow and with a sign above the toilet which reads: \u2018Free your mind and your arse will follow.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve lived here for 21 years,\u201d Henry says. \u201cI\u2019m quite happy with how it is.

Look at the number of lifts that are being installed in 19th-century buildings across the district. That speaks volumes for just how effective it is.\u201d</p> <p>Theinert says the residents have tried talking to the new owners: \u201cWe\u2019ve told them we\u2019re ready to go along with the modernisation measures, that we\u2019ll take rental rises on the chin within reason \u2013 but we just don\u2019t want the luxury refit they\u2019re planning.\u201d</p> <p>Criticism of the <em>milieuschutz</em> has also come from the home owners\u2019 association Haus &amp; Grund (House and Land), which has accused the authorities of \u201ctaking away from people the chance to buy, at a time when it has never been so easy to secure provision for old age due to the low borrowing costs\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile the Chamber of Industry and Commerce has described the measures as \u201ca renewed attack on the ownership rights of property owners, which is having a detrimental effect on the investment climate in the city without doing anything to keep rents under control on a mid-term basis\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fedd59a3a50cfcd2c05c5494e1d0abf4009f21a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fedd59a3a50cfcd2c05c5494e1d0abf4009f21a/0_186_1470_882/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graffiti on the outside wall of Friedel Strasse 54.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graffiti on the outside wall of <a href=\"http://friedelstrasse54.blogsport.eu/\">Friedel Strasse 54</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Connolly/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back at Friedel Strasse 54, Sander the teacher sits amid graffiti reading \u201cWe\u2019re here to stay\u201d and \u201cNo bling in the hood\u201d.

So if women are achieving academically, what is holding them back in their careers?</p> <p>It starts in the teen years. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-36869186\">Research from Girlguiding</a> shows that most girls\u2019 career confidence plummets during adolescence. And these insecurities continue into working life: a survey showed that almost 50% of women believe they would be further in their career if they had more self-belief \u2013 with half of women saying they have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/careers-blog/lack-of-confidence-holding-back-womens-careers\">burdened by these insecurities</a> since school (only one in 10 said it started in the workplace). This lack of self-confidence could be preventing young women from excelling in their careers and securing the same high-level positions as men.</p> <p>Some women also experience a drop in confidence mid-career. For example, returning to work after maternity leave can leave many feeling concerned that they have missed too much \u2013 with <a href=\"http://www.stylist.co.uk/stylist-network/maternity-%20leave-mumsnet\">one in three women</a> returning to find their job \u201cunrecognisable\u201d to the one they left. So, what should women do to boost confidence and get ahead at work? Here\u2019s three tips women can use in the workplace:</p> <h2> <strong>Focus on what you\u2019re good at</strong></h2> <p> \u201cFollow your passion\u201d is a cliche, but for women it might be better to choose a career that uses their best skills \u2013 instead of their passion. Success can come from refining the skills that you already possess, rather than worrying if your job is right for you. Focusing on your best skills and drawing confidence from knowing that you are good at your job can help you thrive at work.</p> <p> We know we can\u2019t be good at everything, so it is still a good idea to practise doing things you lack confidence in. But when it comes to putting yourself forward for an opportunity, whether you are negotiating a promotion, training or more responsibility \u2013 lead with your best skills and then talk about the skills you are developing. You will naturally have more confidence in discussing the areas that you know you are good at, and those you have repeatedly practised.</p> <h2><strong>Recognise the value of your soft skills</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://gulfnews.com/news/europe/uk/women-are-better-listeners-study-says-1.1290574\">Research shows</a> that women are likely to be better listeners and collaborators \u2013 so you should make the most of these skills in the workplace. Being welcoming and sociable is essential to sustain strong business relationships, so focus on building a social network at work to highlight these skills.</p> <p>Likewise, when it comes to interviews and appraisals, focus on emphasising your soft skills such as being a strong communicator, or a good team player \u2013 and make sure you are able to explain why they are valuable to the business.<br></p> <p>Life skills count for a lot and an employer will not necessarily just be looking for someone who can get the job done, but will also fit in with their culture and gel with work colleagues. So draw confidence from emphasising social skills to show you are a well-rounded individual.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2015/oct/28/what-does-success-look-like-for-you\">What does success look like for women today?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Put yourself forward</strong></h2> <p> In the workplace, women are less likely to put themselves forward for opportunities, as they doubt their capability more so than men. When it comes to appraisals, this can mean that they are overlooked for progression. </p> <p>To counter this, it\u2019s a good idea to consciously put yourself forward for opportunities \u2013 whether it is leading on a new project, attending an event or organising the office party. Doing this means you are more likely to be noticed, and it will give you tangible examples to draw on during job interviews and appraisals, meaning you\u2019re more likely to stand out and succeed.</p> <p>We know the world needs more female managers, leaders and chief executives. However, we also know that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/05/women-ambition-top-jobs-men-saatchi\">not everyone wants a top job</a>. The point is, regardless of what people\u2019s aspirations are, we need to help women of all ages reach their goals, and I believe the key to that is by building career confidence.</p> <p><strong>Looking for a job?

What ministers really mean when they say they are putting students \u201cat the heart of the system\u201d (where they have always been) is that students are to be regarded almost exclusively as consumers who are purchasing their higher education.</p> <p>The flaw in the argument is that higher education is not a finished product that can be bought, but a complex process, where the supposed \u201cpurchasers\u201d are also partly responsible for their own satisfaction and success.</p> <p>The key problem is that the system is being designed by 20th-century politicians for 21st-century students. The politicians grew up when neoliberalism was in the ascendant, where complex social and political relationships were reduced to simple market exchanges. They knew no other model of public policy, except guilty nostalgia for old welfare-state ways.</p> <p>But most students, unlike their policy elders, have noticed that neoliberalism crashed and burned after the 2008 global banking crisis, and has been replaced by a bizarre mix of nasty rightwing populism (Brexit-and-all-that) and leftist social movements (the Corbynista Labour party?) united only by mistrust of global markets and global elites.</p> <p>Their world is not that of clockwork markets and rational consumer choice imagined by their elders. Their daily experience is of a bombardment of \u201cmarket\u201d information \u2013 ruthlessly gamed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/oct/06/students-university-education-experience-customer\" title=\"\">satisfaction surveys</a>, flakey university league tables and even flakier zero-to-five star \u201creviews\u201d on consumer websites.</p> <p>Students are a heterogeneous bunch. Maybe on a few IT, business and more focused vocational courses they can be regarded as consumers. But others resist being reduced to this stereotype and espouse more social and community values \u2013 public service and altruism are not dead yet \u2013 or are simply focused on savouring a student lifestyle.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/oct/06/students-university-education-experience-customer\">Once students went to university for education. Now it\u2019s an \u2018experience\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If most students don\u2019t fit the mould of the outcome-optimising consumer, the market in which they are supposedly operating also looks distinctly odd. Everything has the same price \u2013 not set by supply and demand but by the state (with a little help from cartel-inclined universities) \u2013 which bears no relation to the cost of production. For-profit \u201cchallenger\u201d institutions will not affect prices significantly because most will operate on the fringes rather than in the university heartland.</p> <p>So-called fees flit briefly through students\u2019 bank accounts as they pass from the state-owned Student Loans Company to institutions. And it\u2019s a funny kind of \u201cloan\u201d, the terms of which can be unilaterally varied by one party (the government, of course, when it shamefully \u2013 and retrospectively \u2013 worsened the terms). These \u201cloans\u201d also feature quite a lot on HMRC tax forms, which rather gives the game away. More honest, perhaps, to call them a graduate tax.</p> <p>Opposition to the government\u2019s changes would be more effective if it concentrated on these fundamental flaws in their construction rather than focusing on \u201cimproving\u201d the TEF, or trying to make it just a little more difficult for the worst of the for-profits to pillage public higher education.</p>",
  "<p>When six senior Italian detectives arrived in Cairo in early February, following the discovery of the brutally battered body of 28-year-old Italian PhD student Giulio Regeni, they faced long odds of solving the mystery of his disappearance and death.

The Italians requested the video footage from the metro station where Regeni last used his mobile phone, but the Egyptians allowed several days to elapse, by which time the footage from the day of his disappearance had been taped over.

But in the digital age, getting away with murder has become more difficult.</p> <p>About 10 days after the recovery of Regeni\u2019s body, Italian prosecutor Sergio Colaiocco and a couple of police officers travelled to Regeni\u2019s hometown of Fiumicello, in north-eastern Italy, to attend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/12/giulio-regeni-funeral-in-italy-for-student-found-dead-in-cairo\">his funeral</a>. It would be a rare opportunity to question many key witnesses in the case, gathered in one place.</p> <p>The family had asked guests not to bring cameras, or to carry signs of protest, preferring a simple, sober ceremony. But more than 3,000 mourners attended the service, most of them spilling out of a school gymnasium into the street.

In a gesture of astonishing openness, Giulio Regeni\u2019s grieving friends and relatives handed over their phones and laptops to the Italian police. As members of the Facebook generation, they were used to living transparently, ceding chunks of their privacy as the price for living in a connected world. If it could shed some light on the circumstances of Giulio\u2019s death, they were prepared to share their personal data.</p> <p>Regeni\u2019s parents also gave the police his computer, which they had taken from his Cairo apartment after he disappeared. This, together with the mass of emails and text messages collected from his friends, has allowed Italian prosecutors to work around the holes in the evidence provided by the Egyptian government, and to reconstruct Regeni\u2019s world.</p> <p>The prosecutors also obtained another vital piece of evidence: Regeni\u2019s battered corpse, which, after an extremely thorough autopsy in Italy, has told them volumes about the final nine days of his life, from the time of his disappearance to the time his body was dumped in a concrete channel beside the road from Cairo to Alexandria.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"53ee9ab2162a79285cde5fd35da0d4ef582cab7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53ee9ab2162a79285cde5fd35da0d4ef582cab7a/211_0_864_864/500.jpg\" alt=\"Giulio Regeni.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giulio Regeni.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While this evidence will almost certainly not be enough to help Italian investigators identify Regeni\u2019s killers by name, it has<strong> </strong>allowed them to refute a series of lies from the Egyptian government about Regini\u2019s murder \u2013 and keep up pressure on Egypt for hard information about his killing.</p> <p>Italian prosecutors recently made an important breakthrough: the Egyptian government agreed to hand over mobile phone records from both the area where Regeni was last seen, and the place where his body was found.<strong> </strong>Perhaps even more important, during a visit to Rome in early September, Egyptian prosecutors admitted for the first time that Regeni had been under police surveillance before his disappearance.</p> <p>The Egyptian government continues to deny that it had any involvement in Regeni\u2019s death.

It is, in fact, a crucial clue to understanding his disappearance and murder. It was the fifth anniversary of the Egyptian revolution of 2011, and the massive demonstrations in Tahrir Square that brought the Arab Spring to Egypt and led to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/11/hosni-mubarak-resigns-egypt-cairo\">ousting of President Hosni Mubarak</a>. The date has a totemic significance for the regime of Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, for whom it represents a traumatic climbdown \u2013 a moment in which the military\u2019s apparently unassailable grip on power seemed to slip. As a result, the army had been forced to accept the trial of Mubarak and the election of Islamist leader Mohammed Morsi, posing a serious threat to its position in Egyptian life. Such a thing could never be allowed to occur again.</p> <p>When Sisi and the military took control of the government and arrested Morsi in July 2013, Morsi supporters occupied two public squares and staged sit-ins, hoping for a repeat of the peaceful revolution in Tahrir Square. But this time Sisi sent in tanks and soldiers and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/08/egypt-braced-violence-morsi-supporters\">massacred at least 1,000 people</a>.</p> <p>Although Sisi came to power himself in the wake of mass demonstrations against Morsi, he seems to live in terror of the crowd. One of his first official acts was to ban any unauthorised assembly of more than 10 people. And each anniversary of the Tahrir Square uprising has brought bloodshed. In 2014, Sisi\u2019s government killed more than 60 protesters around the country at the time of the anniversary. A year later, 25 people were killed, including a woman poet who tried to lay a wreath of flowers in the square.</p> <p>In the days before his disappearance, computer records show that Regeni had laid low, mostly staying inside his apartment. He probably knew that the Egyptian authorities were working themselves up to a fever pitch in anticipation of the anniversary. Police had reportedly searched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/21/egyptian-police-raid-cairo-homes-2011-uprising\">5,000 apartments in Cairo</a>, in an effort to intimidate anyone who might be planning a demonstration. The raids were mostly concentrated in downtown Cairo, and did not include Regeni\u2019s apartment in the Dokki neighbourhood of Giza, a separate city that includes the site of the ancient pyramids.</p> <p>Although Regeni\u2019s mother had asked him to remain at home, where it was safe, he decided to attend the birthday party of a friend on the evening of 25 January. Downtown Cairo appeared to have returned to normal by nightfall and he and another<strong> </strong>friend agreed to meet at their usual place, not far from Tahrir Square. And so, Regeni walked into the force field of police activity in central Cairo, at its point of greatest alert.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"404bcab5e086e105b1fd3a399ed7d05707635795\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/404bcab5e086e105b1fd3a399ed7d05707635795/0_81_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tahrir Square is almost deserted and heavily policed on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the 25 January uprising.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tahrir Square is almost deserted and heavily policed on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the 25 January uprising.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Khaled Elfiqi/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On 21 April, Reuters reported that Regeni had been picked up on the night of his disappearance by Egyptian police in downtown Cairo, near the Nasser metro stop. The news agency claimed that he was taken to a local police station for half an hour, then transferred to a Homeland Security compound in the area. The Egyptian government categorically denied the story, insisting that Regeni had never been in police custody. Reuters has stuck by its story, citing six independent but anonymous sources \u2013 three in the police and three in the security services. After publishing the report, Reuters\u2019 Cairo bureau chief was threatened with criminal prosecution and left the country. Egyptian police recently detained an Egyptian Reuters reporter for unspecified reasons.</p> <p>In May of this year, the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior accidentally leaked an internal memo proposing a ban on all press coverage of the Regeni case.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>It is unclear whether Regeni\u2019s arrest was planned, or the result of a random sweep, but once they had him in custody, Egyptian authorities would have been quick to realise that they already had a file on him. \u201cThere is no question that he would have been monitored,\u201d said Marie Duboc, a French scholar who now teaches at the University of T\u00fcbingen, in Germany. Like Regeni, she has studied Egyptian labour unions. \u201cEven historical research that would seem harmless to any outsider, is still extremely sensitive in Egypt.\u201d</p> <p>Duboc lived under surveillance from 2008 to 2010, when she was in Cairo, working on her own PhD. \u201cI would get strange phone calls from the Ministry of Higher Education, asking about my research,\u201d she told me. Later, when she visited Egypt to do follow-up work, she was turned away at the airport and barred from entering the country. Clearly, her name had been placed on a blacklist. (She has subsequently been allowed to return, she said.)</p> <p>Independent labour unions are a particularly sensitive topic in Egypt under the Sisi government, because unions were seen as a key galvanising force in the 2011 revolution. Traditionally, labour unions were government-run \u2013 more a means of controlling workers than representing their interests. The first independent trade union was formed in 2009, but the movement truly took flight after Tahrir Square. A thousand independent labour unions sprouted up after the fall of Mubarak and<strong>,</strong> within days of the 2011 revolution, the first federation of independent unions was formed. Many democracy advocates in and outside Egypt, including Giulio Regeni and his Cambridge supervisor, the Egyptian political scientist Maha Abdelrahman, regarded the independent trade union movement as a positive development, with the potential to strengthen civil society, democratic participation and workers\u2019 rights \u2013 all things that seem threatening to a military regime determined to repress autonomous sources of power.<strong> </strong></p> <p>On 11 December, six weeks before he disappeared, Regeni attended a public meeting of the independent unions. He was impressed by their combative energy and wrote an enthusiastic article about it, together with a friend, which they published (in Italian) under a pseudonym. But something disconcerting happened at the meeting: although Regeni sat to the side and was not on the roster of speakers, a woman in a headscarf came over and photographed him. Regeni was shaken and told several friends about it. It was the first sign that he might be being watched.</p> <p>Regeni\u2019s particular area of research was a nascent independent union of street vendors, a large group that was difficult to control and a cause of considerable concern to the government. Egypt has an estimated five million street vendors, who sell everything from snacks and drinks to cheap clothes and kitchen utensils. In a country of 80 to 90 million people, as many as a quarter of Egyptian families depend to some degree on the income of a street vendor.</p> <p>The Sisi government regards these workers with clear suspicion. Street vendors moved rapidly into Tahrir Square during the massive demonstrations of 2011. Most were simply looking to make a little money, selling food and drink to protesters, but their very presence was viewed by the authorities as aiding and abetting the revolution. Since then, the government has sought unsuccessfully to remove street vendors from the centre of Cairo, using fines, prison sentences and violence.</p> <p>\u201cAfter repeated failures to clear Cairo\u2019s city centre of street vendors \u2026 the Cairo governorate issued a shrewd decree,\u201d wrote Abdelrahman, in an article she published last year. The decree required store owners to report any street vendors working near their shops, or risk losing their own trading licenses. This served a dual purpose of forcing shopkeepers to keep tabs on street vendors for the government and pushing the vendors into the hands of the police.</p> <p>In order to remain on the street and avoid police harassment, street vendors were themselves expected to let police know of anything or anyone unusual or suspicious.<strong> </strong>\u201cOne of the things that has happened in Egypt in the past few years, which we didn\u2019t fully recognise, is that the street pedlars are frequently used as police informants,\u201d said one Cambridge scholar, who preferred not to be named.<strong> </strong>Scattered around the city, present on nearly every block and square, the street vendors form a natural surveillance network.</p> <p>For his doctorate, Regeni was engaged in what is known as \u201cparticipatory research\u201d \u2013 a method that involves spending substantial amounts of time in the field with one\u2019s subjects. While this is standard practice, a young Arabic-speaking foreigner, hanging out for hours in street markets, and asking about unionisation, future organising plans and attitudes toward the government, is likely to have looked extremely suspicious to most Egyptians \u2013 who have been told over and over to be on the lookout for foreign agents.</p> <p>Regeni\u2019s good intentions may also have blinded him to how his actions could have been interpreted. During the autumn of 2015,<strong> </strong>he had learned of a grant of up to \u00a310,000 issued by a British foundation to fund a development project. He was interested in applying because he could use the money to support his own PhD research and help the people he was studying. He mentioned his idea to a leader of the independent street vendors\u2019 union, Mohamed Abdallah. Abdallah\u2019s level of interest \u2013 in the money, rather than the project \u2013 worried Regeni. As a result, Regeni dropped the idea. Still, news of a young well-funded foreigner, ready to finance an internal Egyptian movement, may have struck police as exactly the kind of foreign conspiracy they wanted to stamp out.</p> <p>Those most familiar with Regeni\u2019s work in Egypt dismiss the idea that he could have discovered anything valuable or threatening to the Egyptian government. \u201cGiulio had been out doing field work, talking to street pedlars, maybe six or seven times,\u201d says one of his close friends in Cairo. \u201cHe would have known only a fraction of what any of the Egyptian government\u2019s informants would have been able to tell them.\u201d Even the independent union meeting that he attended and wrote about was a well-publicised event, authorised and monitored by the authorities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"edbfbf755b25d3d9eaac61083f8a0321e4f734b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edbfbf755b25d3d9eaac61083f8a0321e4f734b6/0_0_4832_2899/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A street vendor near Tahrir Square, in 2013.

One of Sisi\u2019s first moves was to make the chief of the federation of independent unions his minister of labour, an appointment intended to co-opt the movement and bring it under government control. Just this summer, in a further threat to their independence, a new measure was introduced, forcing the independents to re-register or risk decertification.</p> <p>And yet, to a government on constant alert to security threats, there may have been much in the meeting that Regeni attended \u2013 and in the article he wrote about it \u2013 that the government would have found alarming. One of the proposals was for a \u201cseries of regional conferences that lead after a few months to a large national assembly and perhaps a unitary protest (\u201cTo Tahrir!\u201d said several of those present.)</p> <p>Regeni\u2019s article ends with a few sentences that look like fighting words. \u201cIn the repressive context of the Sisi government, the fact that there are popular and spontaneous initiatives that break the wall of fear is significant and represent in and of themselves an important push for change.</p> <p>\u201cTo challenge the state of emergency, the government\u2019s appeals to stability and social harmony in the name of the \u2018war on terrorism\u2019, means today, even indirectly, to challenge the very basis on which this regime bases its existence and its repression of civil society.\u201d</p> <p>On 7 January, just a month after the union meeting, Mohamed Abdallah denounced Regeni to the authorities. After Regeni\u2019s death, he told the Arabic-language newspaper Aswat Masriya that he became suspicious of Regeni because his questions \u201cwere not about street vendors \u2026 and had other intentions \u2026 I am not an informant but I believe I am protecting my country.\u201d</p> <p>The Egyptian government says that as a result of Abdallah\u2019s tip-off, it placed Regeni under investigation, but decided after a few days that his research was of \u201cno interest to national security\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>During the nine days after his disappearance, Regeni\u2019s case became an international cause celebre, inspiring the Twitter hashtag #whereisgiulio? It was also a source of serious concern at the Italian Embassy in Cairo, which was preparing for the visit of a major business delegation, led by the Italian minister of economic development, Federica Guidi. On 3 February, while Guidi was meeting with Sisi and other Egyptian officials, a mini-van driver got a puncture on the road from Cairo to Alexandria. While fixing his flat tyre, he discovered Giulio Regeni\u2019s body.</p> <p>The Egyptian forensic expert who first examined the corpse initially said that the multiple signs of torture suggested Regeni had suffered a \u201cslow death\u201d. This claim, however, was quickly retracted. The deputy head of criminal investigations in Giza, the city where the body was found, told the Associated Press that initial investigations showed Regeni was killed in a road accident.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Regeni case had become a huge story in Italy. In the following days, as pressure mounted, Egyptian officials began floating various theories in the local press: that Regeni was gay and the victim of a crime of passion, that he was involved in a drug deal gone bad, or that he was a foreign spy.</p> <p>Upon further investigation, these theories fell apart. The digital record in the possession of Italian investigators showed that Regeni had a girlfriend in Ukraine, and there were Skype logs, emails and texts to prove it. His computer, email and bank records showed no trace of contact with any intelligence services. \u201cWe had his bank accounts, which showed he had almost no money,\u201d said Alessandra Ballerini, the lawyer for the Regeni family. \u201cThis is a boy who wore his father\u2019s old bathing suit and used his mother\u2019s old backpack because he didn\u2019t want to be a financial burden to his family.\u201d</p> <p>Most important was the rigorous second autopsy carried out in Italy, using Cat scans and tissue analysis. The Egyptian pathologist\u2019s report had said that Regeni was killed by a blow to the head. More detailed analysis in Italy showed that he had been hit repeatedly on the head, but that these blows were not fatal. Blood had coagulated around the points where he had been hit, and other cuts, bruises and abrasions on his body showed different stages of healing. This indicated that Regeni had been tortured more than once \u2013 and that days had passed between his initial torture, later sessions, and the moment of his death. He was covered with cuts and burns, and his hands and feet had been broken. Even his teeth were broken. His torturers appear to have carved letters into his flesh, a well-documented practice of the Egyptian police.</p> <p>The forensic doctors at the University of Rome used a highly accurate technique for determining time of death, which measures potassium levels in the vitreous fluid of the eyes. They established that Regeni died between 10pm on 1 February and 10pm on 2 February. \u201cThis is important because it means that he was alive for at least six or seven days and tortured repeatedly during that time,\u201d said one Italian investigator. The cause of death was a broken neck. Regeni\u2019s mother believes that this was the work of professional torturers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f3b395fa54414c17628221af1275c57cdc032393\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3b395fa54414c17628221af1275c57cdc032393/1649_116_1602_2003/800.jpg\" alt=\"Giulio Regeni\u2019s mother, Paola, believes he was murdered by professional torturers.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giulio Regeni\u2019s mother, Paola, believes he was murdered by professional torturers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Remo Casilli/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The strength of the autopsy evidence forced the Egyptian authorities to abandon the implausible theories of accidental death and begin a new public relations offensive. Sisi suddenly granted an interview to the editor-in-chief of the Rome newspaper La Repubblica, which was published on 16 March and dominated by the Regeni case. As the autopsy evidence implicated the Egyptian police, Sisi seemed to suggest that Regeni\u2019s death was part of an elaborate conspiracy.</p> <p>\u201cWhy was the body found right when the minister of economic development and the Italian delegation were here to strengthen our cooperation?\u201d he asked. Sisi also mentioned the shooting down of a Russian tourist airliner in October 2015. \u201cRussian tourism and Italian tourism [in Egypt] have collapsed to nothing \u2026 Fill in the dots of these different episodes and you have a clear picture of an attempt to strike the Egyptian economy and isolate Egypt.\u201d</p> <p>Just days later, in early March, a witness stepped forward with a new hypothesis. An Egyptian engineer claimed that he had seen Regeni, on the afternoon before his disappearance, having a furious argument with another foreigner near the Italian consulate. The engineer, Mohammed Fawzy, then appeared on a popular Egyptian TV programme to say that he thought that the Italian government knew who killed Regeni, but was hiding the evidence. Echoing Sisi, Fawzy speculated that whoever killed Regeni was trying to sabotage commercial relations between Egypt and Italy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Relatives of the alleged criminal gang have insisted that its members were killed in cold blood at close range</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The engineer\u2019s story collapsed when the Italian prosecutors\u2019<strong> </strong>digital archive showed that Regeni had been at home all afternoon on 24 January. He had been on Skype with his girlfriend, chatting as they streamed the same movie and watched it together, 3,500km apart. Mobile phone records also showed that the engineer was not in the neighbourhood of the Italian consulate in Cairo at the time of the alleged quarrel.</p> <p>And then, suddenly, on 24 March, the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior announced a definitive resolution to the case. The ministry announced on its Facebook page that the perpetrators were a gang of four men \u201cspecialised in impersonating policemen, kidnapping foreigners and stealing their money\u201d.</p> <p>As proof, the government displayed a tray of objects that included Regeni\u2019s passport, Italian identity card, a credit card and his ID card from Cambridge University. Not only had the Egyptian police found the culprits, they had already killed them. \u201cIn an exchange of fire between police forces and the men,\u201d the ministry explained, \u201call the gang members were killed.\u201d</p> <p>However, phone records placed the leader of the gang more than 100km away from Cairo at the time of Regeni\u2019s disappearance. Relatives of the alleged criminal gang have insisted that its members were killed in cold blood at close range, rather than in a shootout. The government\u2019s scenario also made little sense: why would a band of thieves keep Regeni\u2019s identity cards, given that they would provide incriminating evidence that tied them to the crime? Why would they torture a robbery victim for a week without ever asking for ransom money or using his credit card? Egyptian officials have now accepted that it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/24/new-twist-in-case-of-italian-student-giulio-regenis-in-egypt\">is unlikely the dead men had anything to do with Regeni\u2019s death</a>. In fact, by producing Regeni\u2019s passport and identity cards, the Egyptian police have apparently incriminated themselves.</p> <p>The string of improbable cover stories was becoming an embarrassment even in Egypt. In a rare public rebuke, Mohammed Abdel-Hadi Allam, the editor-in-chief of al-Ahram, a government-owned newspaper, wrote: \u201cThe naive stories about Regeni\u2019s death have hurt Egypt at home and abroad and offered some people grounds to judge what is going on in the country now to be no different from what went on before the 25 January revolution.\u201d He compared the Regeni case to that of Khaled Said, a young Egyptian who had been seized by police in an internet cafe in 2010, and beaten to death. Photographs of Said\u2019s body taken by his brother were posted on Facebook and became an important rallying cry for the protesters who helped bring down Hosni Mubarak.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Despite clear indications of involvement by the nation\u2019s security forces, the Egyptian government is left with what might be called the stupidity defence. As the Egyptian ambassador to Rome put it: \u201cWe\u2019re not so naive as to kill a young Italian and throw away his body the day of Minister Guidi\u2019s visit to Cairo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are two theories,\u201d said Karim Abdelrady, an Egyptian human rights lawyer. \u201cOne is that there is a feud between the Egyptian secret services, and one branch dumped the body in order to embarrass the other.\u201d A long, detailed anonymous letter that was sent to the Italian embassy in Bern, Switzerland and published by La Repubblica described complicated machinations within different branches of the Egyptian secret services, and reported that Regeni\u2019s body had been wrapped in an Egyptian army blanket, as if to direct suspicion towards the military police. But Italian investigators say that they have no way to confirm or deny the information in this document.</p> <p>\u201cThe other theory,\u201d explained Abdelrady, \u201cis that the Egyptian police thought they could get away with it by blaming a band of criminals, and that people would not think the Egyptian police would be so stupid as to leave the body where it could be found.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis case cannot be understood without understanding the context of generalised paranoia in the country,\u201d said one foreign scholar who has lived in Cairo for many years. \u201cFor the last three years, many high-level government officials, including members of the military, have spoken publicly about foreign conspiracies to undermine Egypt.

Between late January and November 2015, Egypt\u2019s Al Nadeem Center for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence documented 281 extrajudicial killings, 119 murders of prisoners in detention, 440 cases of torture in police stations,<strong> </strong>and 335 forced disappearances. After documenting these cases, the Nadeem Center was forced to shut down, allegedly for violating its charter as a medical organisation.</p> <p>While in the past, Egypt had tried to avoid trouble with foreigners, it now seemed intent on making public examples of them. \u201cGiulio died like an Egyptian,\u201d says Ballerini, the Regeni family\u2019s lawyer.</p> <p>The climate of xenophobia and police brutality in Egypt has raised questions for Italian prosecutors as to whether it was appropriate for Cambridge University to allow a young foreign student<strong> </strong>to go Cairo and undertake field research into such a delicate topic. Regeni\u2019s supervisor, Maha Abdelrahman, is very knowledgeable on this subject: she has been a vocal critic of Egypt\u2019s military governments and has written extensively about the country\u2019s unions and protest movements. In early 2015, she wrote about the tendency of turning ordinary citizens into police informants and the increasing criminalisation of previously harmless activities.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Relations between the Italian investigators and Cambridge University got off to a bad start when Abdelrahman declined to hand over her emails and text messages after the funeral. She also kept the police waiting for three hours, turning up for her interview at the police station at 10pm. Abdelrahman\u2019s reluctance to hand over her personal data is understandable, given her background \u2013 she had grown up in Egypt under a military regime, when a person would never have given anything to the police if they could help it. Abdelrahman has chosen not to speak to the press since Regeni\u2019s death, but told colleagues at Cambridge that she cooperated with the Italian police the day of the funeral.</p> <p>The Italian prosecutors have been keen to find out whose idea it was that Regeni should write his PhD dissertation on independent unions, and the street vendors\u2019 union especially. When detectives asked her whether she had pushed Regeni to pursue his research into that particular topic, or if she had been aware that he might have felt in danger, Abdelrahman felt that she was being treated like a suspect.</p> <p>The lead prosecutor, Sergio Colaiocco, travelled to England in June, having sent a request to two Cambridge professors for an interview. The university says it received no notification from the Italian government, but learned of the request informally from Cambridge police. The two professors initially agreed to meet with the prosecutor, but then declined to be interviewed. This prompted a brief firestorm, with the Italian deputy foreign minister, Mario Giro, taking to Twitter to shame Cambridge for its lack of cooperation. An Italian professor who teaches at Oxford, Federico Varese, also criticised Cambridge in an interview with La Repubblica: \u201cThe university bears some measure of moral responsibility for not protecting [Regeni] and not grasping that the kind of \u2018participatory research\u2019 he was doing increased the risk. It seems that their priority is only to protect Cambridge from possible legal responsibility and a request for damages.\u201d</p> <p>In June, Cambridge\u2019s vice-chancellor and a number of academics signed a letter stating that the university had not received any request for help from the Italian authorities, and that Regeni had no particular reason to be afraid for his safety, since \u201cno foreign student, researcher or academic\u201d had ever been murdered in Egypt. The university subsequently hired an Italian attorney to facilitate relations with the Italian government and has received, and fully complied with, a request for various documents in the Regeni case.</p> <p>\u201cI think this polemic with Cambridge has been overblown,\u201d said one close friend of Regeni\u2019s in Egypt. He pointed out that Abdelrahman had continued to do the same kind of field research that Regeni was pursuing. \u201cShe was not a professor who remained in the library and sent out her students to do field work. The truth about Giulio\u2019s murder is in Egypt, not Cambridge, in the increasing paranoia of the regime.\u201d</p> <p>In December, 2015, he said, Egyptian police detained a young French scholar who was conducting research on a workers\u2019 movement, keeping her in jail overnight. \u201cThese kinds of things had been happening more often \u2013 but they go unreported because the scholars don\u2019t say anything, so that they can return to Egypt in the future.\u201d</p> <p>The Egyptian government\u2019s softer and more cooperative approach in the last few months suggests, however, that it now accepts an urgent need for reputation management. The government and the Regeni family have agreed, in principle, to meet, which the family hopes will push the investigation another few steps closer to the truth.</p> <p>Regeni\u2019s death is a mystery hiding in plain sight: his seemingly inexplicable, brutal torture and killing reflects the demise of Egyptian democracy, the stripping away of already limited liberties and protections, the brutal crackdown on dissent, the increase in torture and forced disappearances, the tendency to blame the country\u2019s problems on outside conspiracies. In this closed world, Giulio Regeni, with his ability to speak five languages, his mobile phone full of foreign and Egyptian contacts, might look like a spy, and police, in a system with little or no accountability, might make reckless mistakes.</p> <p>The Egyptian prosecutors seemed unable to understand why their Italian colleagues did not accept the evidence they were given. \u201cThe Egyptian authorities seemed shocked that our police kept asking questions after they came up with the \u2018gang\u2019 of killers and the tray with Regeni\u2019s documents,\u201d said one Italian investigator. \u201cTheir attitude seemed to be: \u2018hey, we found the criminals, we have even killed them. This should put an end to it.\u2019\u201d Surely, they thought, concerns of state \u2013 the close relations between two nations, billions of dollars of commercial ties \u2013 should count more than the life of one person, who had been killed by mistake. They seemed to find it impossible to understand that the Italian government would have to account to public opinion and could not, even if it had wanted to, accept a flimsy, implausible account of Regeni\u2019s death.</p> <p>\u201cThis didn\u2019t happen in a vacuum,\u201d Heba Morayef, an Egyptian human rights advocate, said. \u201cIt came after three years of almost constant rising xenophobic propaganda, fed by the security services, encouraging citizens\u2019 arrests of foreigners, and so on \u2026 There are so many people in the Egyptian security forces that talk about this foreign conspiracy, that more and more people start to believe it.

  "<p>A record number of people and organisations have been nominated for the 2016 Nobel peace prize, which will be announced on Friday. This year 376 candidates \u2013 228 individuals and 148 organisations \u2013 are in contention for the award. </p> <p>The selection of Nobel prizewinners is always shrouded in secrecy \u2013 the names of nominees are not released until 50 years after the decision is made, which makes predicting difficult, but here are some of those that Guardian writers think have a greater chance.</p> <h2>Syrian White Helmets</h2> <p>During the past five years of war in Syria, the White Helmets, a group of volunteer rescue workers, have run towards bombs in opposition-held areas to rescue tens of thousands \u2013 by some estimates up to 60,000 people \u2013 from the ruins and battlefields.</p> <p>There has been no more dangerous place in the world to be a first responder for most of that time. The ranks of the group, made up of pre-war Syria\u2019s middle classes, have lost 160 of their own, most killed by jets that have returned to target buildings they had already bombed.</p> <p>They are often the first on the scene of any airstrike, picking through rubble and cradling the dead and injured, wearing the distinctive white helmets that gave them their name. Their motto throughout Syria\u2019s withering conflict has been \u201cto save one life is to save all of humanity\u201d.</p> <p>The volunteers have been one of the few signs of hope in a desperate and destructive war that otherwise shows little mercy. They have been hailed across rebel areas of Syria and in Europe as a model of community cooperation and coexistence \u2013 and of success. Russian and Syrian attacks on medical centres have tried to deny care to the dying, but the White Helmets have defied that, giving comfort and life-saving care where no one else can.</p> <p>Their work has made them a prized military target for pro-regime forces, who regularly attack ambulances as soon as they arrive at the scene of a strike. The lethal threat has not been a deterrent; to many among the White Helmets it has instead been an incentive to continue serving. <em tabindex=\"-1\">Martin Chulov</em></p> <h2>Angela Merkel</h2> <p>Were Angela Merkel to win the Nobel peace prize it would hang like an albatross around her neck.

They also worry about the impact of refugees on integration, gender equality, public services and the labour market.</p> <p>Merkel is under huge pressure to show her government is able to deal with such concerns. In his speech to the UN refugee summit in New York in September, Barack Obama thanked Merkel and the Germans for their efforts in dealing with the refugee crisis, an example of the moral pressure Merkel is under to ensure she does not do a U-turn despite growing domestic pressure.</p> <p>Merkel would be the first to agree she does not need a Nobel peace prize to add to the pressure, and the jury should do her and Germany a favour by waiting, at the very least, until she retires. <em tabindex=\"-1\">Kate Connolly</em></p> <h2>Pope Francis</h2> <p>No pope has ever won the Nobel peace prize before, but Francis is seen as a frontrunner for the accolade this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6c111f4b0d777fa9981e8cd0bbdac25c5b6b9a29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c111f4b0d777fa9981e8cd0bbdac25c5b6b9a29/0_0_2141_2674/801.jpg\" alt=\"Pope Francis.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pope Francis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ivan Sekretarev/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since becoming pontiff three-and-a-half years ago, he has won the hearts of millions of people \u2013 not only Catholics \u2013 across the world for his strong stance on issues such as refugees, poverty and climate change. </p> <p>Francis has repeatedly implored politicians and citizens to offer a generous welcome to refugees.

A deal was finally made between Santos, who has been president since 2010 and staked his political legacy on negotiating an end to the country\u2019s internal conflict, and Londo\u00f1o, who took over as leader of the rebels in 2011, and at one point had a $5m bounty on his capture from the US. <em tabindex=\"-1\">Sibylla Brodzinsky</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39273ee4aefd9367069d7efc4066b9dff98ae6aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39273ee4aefd9367069d7efc4066b9dff98ae6aa/0_174_2360_1416/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Juan Manuel Santos, and the head of the Farc, Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o, aka Timochenko, shake hands during the signing of the historic peace agreement.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colombia\u2019s president, Juan Manuel Santos, and the head of the Farc, Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o, aka Timochenko, shake hands during the signing of the historic peace agreement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luis Acosta/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Who do you think should win and why?

No evidence of this belief has been presented, however; it is nightmare speculation,\u201d Judge Richard Posner wrote in the <a href=\"http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2016/D10-03/C:16-1509:J:Posner:aut:T:fnOp:N:1838881:S:0\">opinion</a>.</p> <p>\u201c[Pence] provides no evidence that Syrian terrorists are posing as refugees or that Syrian refugees have ever committed acts of terrorism in the United States. Indeed, as far as can be determined from public sources, no Syrian refugees have been arrested or prosecuted for terrorist acts or attempts in the United States. And if Syrian refugees do pose a terrorist threat, implementation of the governor\u2019s policy would simply increase the risk of terrorism in whatever states Syrian refugees were shunted to.\u201d</p> <p>Like Trump, Pence has taken the draconian position that the US should stop taking refugees from Syria because vetting processes are inadequate, in their eyes. A refugee who wants to come to the US must pass through interviews, background and medical checks by the Department of Homeland Security, US security agencies, immigration services and the UN, and the process takes 18 months to two years.</p> <p>Posner wrote that Pence\u2019s idea of exclusion by nationality is: \u201cthe equivalent of his saying (not that he does say) that he wants to forbid black people to settle in Indiana not because they\u2019re black but because he\u2019s afraid of them, and since race is therefore not his motive he isn\u2019t discriminating. But that of course would be racial discrimination, just as his targeting Syrian refugees is discrimination on the basis of nationality.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/03/indiana-refugee-resettlement-mike-pence-court-decision\">Court rejects Pence's efforts to deter refugees as 'nightmare speculation'</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f2e4ebe4b01506cbf24df9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/adam-gabbatt\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T23:10:16.416Z\">12.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Prepare for the clash of veeps</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Like the Gulf stream, or a young Republican who doesn\u2019t wear beige chinos, we know <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence\">Mike Pence</a> and Tim Kaine exist \u2013 we just don\u2019t really see them.</p> <p>With the media focused on Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/01/us/politics/donald-trump-interview-bill-hillary-clinton.html\">near daily</a> <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/30/politics/trump-overnight-media-tweets/\">indiscretions</a>, and Hillary Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/01/hillary-clinton-twitter-national-service-scholarships-trump\">various</a> <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/trump-clinton-affairs-joel-benenson-229046\">responses</a> to those indiscretions, both the Republican and Democratic vice-presidential nominees have been forced into the shadows.<br></p> <p>But no more.

This year, the Trump Foundation made its most wide-ranging request for donations yet: It set up a public website, donaldtrumpforvets.com, to gather donations that Trump said would be passed on to veterans\u2019 groups.</p> <p>But the Trump Foundation never registered under article 7A of New York\u2019s Executive Law, as is required for any charity soliciting more than $25,000 a year from the public.

The president sat down with Jonathan Chait to discuss five key situations during his presidency: the Republicans, Obamacare, BP oil spill, Cuba and drones.</p> <p>It\u2019s a very in-depth chat with Obama, who delves into what sort of legacy he\u2019ll leave behind. Here he is on drone strikes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I will say, though, is that the critique of drones has been important, because it has ensured that you don\u2019t have this institutional comfort and inertia with what looks like a pretty antiseptic way of disposing of enemies. I will say that what prompted a lot of the internal reforms we put in place had less to do with what the left or <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/donate-now?ea.tracking.id=ED2016EVSCgl&amp;gclid=CJuEsvCouM8CFQEkhgodwA4PCA\">Human Rights Watch</a> or <a href=\"http://www.amnestyusa.org/\">Amnesty International</a> or other organizations were saying and had more to do with me looking at sort of the way in which the number of drone strikes was going up and the routineness with which, early in my presidency, you were seeing both DOD and CIA and our intelligence teams think about this. And it troubled me, because I think you could see, over the horizon, a situation in which, without Congress showing much interest in restraining actions with authorizations that were written really broadly, you end up with a president who can carry on perpetual wars all over the world, and a lot of them covert, without any accountability or democratic debate.</p> <p>But I will say that having these nonprofits continue to question and protest ensured that, having made that initial decision, we kept on going and that it got pushed all the way through. And it\u2019s not \u2014 as I announced when we released our best estimates of the civilian casualties \u2014 it\u2019s not a perfect solution. I think America will continue to have work to do in finding this balance between not elevating every terrorist attack into a full-blown war but not either leaving ourselves exposed to attacks or, alternatively, pretending as if we can just take shots wherever we want, whenever we want, and not be answerable to anybody.
