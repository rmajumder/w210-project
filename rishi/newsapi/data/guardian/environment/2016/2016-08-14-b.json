  "<p>Teachers awaiting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/alevels\">A-level results</a> on Thursday are bracing themselves for turbulence as the impact of sweeping changes to the curriculum begin to be felt.</p> <p>For the past year, schools have been getting to grips with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jan/16/ucas-warns-students-disadvantaged-a-level-reforms\">new curriculum</a> in a wide range of subjects at AS-level \u2013 taken at the end of the first year of sixth form \u2013 while continuing to teach the old curriculum to year 13s.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a very stressful year,\u201d said Julia Neal, manager of a sixth form in a high-achieving school in the West Country. \u201cAll these changes come thick and fast. We are not always given enough time to get ready for them.\u201d</p> <p>Exams regulator <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofqual\">Ofqual</a> has warned that performance in the new AS exams \u2013 which have been stripped out from A-levels and will no longer count towards the final grade \u2013 will dip because both students and their teachers are less familiar with the new material.</p> <p>Though exam boards will adjust to ensure students of the new qualifications are not put at an unfair disadvantage, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/526431/Letter_to_schools_26_May_2016.pdf\">Ofqual says there will still be variability at school level</a>. \u201cWhile nationally results may remain steady, we know that schools and colleges can see variability in their results year to year even when qualifications do not change,\u201d Ofqual said in a letter to schools in May.</p> <p>\u201cBut we also know that when qualifications do change, schools and colleges can typically see more variability in their results. As a result, we expect this summer\u2019s changes to AS-levels will mean that individual school or college results will be more variable than in recent years.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/10/getting-your-a-levels-next-week-share-your-stories-with-us\">Getting your A-Levels next week? Share your stories with us</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Universities admissions staff, who spent the weekend studying this year\u2019s results and matching students to courses, were also bracing themselves for some volatility. Mike Nicholson, head of student recruitment and admissions at Bath University and a member of the AQA exam board council of trustees, said: \u201cFor teachers in England there\u2019s an awful lot of change with a whole range of new qualifications. I would expect some turbulence.</p> <p>\u201cThere are enormous pressures on schools, finishing off A-levels with the current year 13, while worrying about new A-levels and new GCSEs. You are spreading yourself thinner as a teacher and there may be some consequences.\u201d</p> <p>There is an additional layer of uncertainty as students who sat exams this summer will find it harder to successfully <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/26/gcse-a-level-exam-appeals-remarks-change-tougher-challenge-results\">appeal</a> against results following changes to the rules governing exam re-marks and appeals.</p> <p>In recent years there has been a sharp increase in the number of requests for re-marks and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/changes-to-enquiries-and-appeals\">Ofqual</a> believes too many students have been getting extra marks, and possibly a higher grade, when the original mark was \u201cperfectly appropriate\u201d.</p> <p>Geoff Barton, headteacher of King Edward VI school, a Church of England comprehensive in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, said: \u201cI\u2019ve been an English teacher since 1985. I used to know what a C in English looked like and a grade A. Now it feels as if someone somewhere, in an obscure back office, makes the decision.<br></p> <p> \u201cThis year the new uncertainty is what the decoupling of AS- and A-levels might mean for schools and colleges. It\u2019s all deeply confusing and concerning, and another reason that so many of us resent the unleashing of a volley of reforms without the time to explore the consequences on students, teachers and schools.\u201d</p> <p>For those students, however, who are hoping to secure a place at university this week, it is a \u201cbuyers\u2019 market\u201d, with competition mounting between higher education institutions around the UK to fill a growing number of places.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/13/uk-universities-take-increasing-battle-for-students-into-virtual-world\">UK universities take increasing battle for students into virtual world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>School leavers are in a stronger position than ever before as they make their choices. Because of the prevailing demographic, there are fewer 18-year-olds at a time when the cap on numbers has been lifted in universities, who are now free to recruit as many students as they wish.</p> <p>As a result, school leavers are being lured by universities offering a variety of \u201cfreebies\u201d, ranging from free postgraduate study in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/shortcuts/2016/aug/08/buy-one-get-one-free-degrees-higher-education-discount-pricing\">buy-one-get-one-free (bogof) degree deal</a>, free iPads, \u201cmoney cards\u201d with \u00a3300 credit, free books, scholarships and free gym membership.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a buyers\u2019 market,\u201d said Nick Hillman, director of the <a href=\"http://www.hepi.ac.uk/\">Higher Education Policy Institute</a>. \u201cThe point of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/sep/18/removing-cap-student-numbers-six-questions-hepi-report\">removing student number controls</a> was to make a more competitive environment. Students can afford to be a bit pickier than maybe they have been in the past. It\u2019s how the system is meant to operate now.\u201d</p> <p>Students who have dropped a grade or two will stand a better chance of getting in to their university of choice, while lower-tariff universities seeking to fill undersubscribed courses are likely to accept lower grades than their previously stated requirements.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/clearing\">clearing</a> process, meanwhile, by which universities fill remaining places on their courses, is expected to be frenetic once school leavers pick up their results, with universities deploying hundreds of telephone operators and admissions staff in a race to snap up the best students. Last year a record 64,300 students found universities places via clearing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ed5ff2612356fa45f6c323627747c992d1d94d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ed5ff2612356fa45f6c323627747c992d1d94d6/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Curzon Building at Birmingham City University\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Birmingham City University\u2019s Curzon Building.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Birmingham City University</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Birmingham City University is planning to keep clearing lines open all night to fill places, with their hotline running from 7am on Thursday to 8pm on Friday. \u201cWe have no idea what the volume of calls will be,\u201d said the head of admissions, Julie Mason, \u201cbut we are there if they need to speak to us.\u201d</p> <p>Bedfordshire University \u2013 which is offering undergraduates \u201cthe Bedfordshire money card\u201d with \u00a3300 credit \u2013 will have 100 telephone operators and 50 admissions staff on hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stand out from the crowd,\u201d a spokesperson said.</p> <p>The University and College Union (UCU), whose members have been locked in dispute with their employers over pay and conditions, is increasingly concerned, however, about the changes in UK higher education and is using Facebook adverts to appeal to prospective students to check how different universities measure up when it comes to equal pay and whether lecturers are on zero-hours contracts.</p> <p>\u201cUniversities are doing their best to recruit students, but the slightly unedifying nature of freebies being thrown at students, bogof deals and the talk of a \u2018buyers\u2019 market\u2019 lift the lid on how recent governments\u2019 policies have transformed our campuses,\u201d a UCU spokesperson said. \u201c\u2018The problems of the post-Brexit world are felt acutely in higher education at the moment and universities would benefit from some stability and clear direction from government.\u201d</p> <p>Universities that attract large numbers of EU students \u2013 the fastest-growing market for UK institutions in recent years \u2013 are anxiously waiting to see what the impact of the Brexit vote will have on this year\u2019s uptake.</p> <p>Prof Michael Arthur, president and provost of University College London \u2013 which with 4,500 EU students has the highest number of any UK institution \u2013 said the university was not aware of prospective European students pulling out. \u201cWe\u2019ve had very little disturbance. We are trying to be confident and behaving as normal,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb6f8e1bc057c024f29ef2b64902cfb50fc6fc55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb6f8e1bc057c024f29ef2b64902cfb50fc6fc55/566_739_4717_2830/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prof Michael Arthur, president and provost of UCL\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prof Michael Arthur, president and provost of UCL</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elsewhere, there was speculation that EU student numbers might even go up this year, as students try to sneak in before existing terms and conditions change, though fears about the more long-term impact of Brexit remain.</p> <p>Lynsey Hopkins, head of admissions at the University of Sheffield , said: \u201cThere\u2019s a chance we might get a slight increase because the funding has been guaranteed for students coming this year so it\u2019s possible, if they are particularly clued up and following the news, that they\u2019ll think, well actually, I\u2019ll get in this year rather than deferring for next year. Until it comes to registration we won\u2019t know for sure.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p> Paul Teulon, director of admissions at King\u2019s College London, added: \u201cFor this summer, I think we\u2019re in a relatively sound position. I think the challenge will come when we start to see application numbers in October, November, December the following year. That will depend on what the government is able to confirm in that interim period.\u201d</p> <p>This year is also likely to confirm a growing trend in unconditional offers, where universities offer a place regardless of results. There were 12,100 such offers in 2014 and almost double that in 2015 (23,400) \u2013 the trend is, however, deeply unpopular with schools, which fear students may sit back and underperform at A-level.</p> <p>\u201cAll of us are concerned about the demographics, with fewer 18-year-olds in the population,\u201d said Hopkins, \u201cso, as we have been saying over the past couple of years, we think it\u2019s going to be more competitive than ever.<br></p> <p> \u201cBut it\u2019s a good time to be an applicant because there are more opportunities and chances than there have ever been. And because of that I think there will be a lot of opportunities in clearing as well and adjustment, so if people want to make a late decision or a late change they\u2019ll be able to.\u201d</p> <p> The University of Sheffield was last week reported to be offering buy-one-get-one-free degrees in a deal that guaranteed free postgraduate study after signing up to an undergraduate course. \u201cIt was slightly misreported, it\u2019s not an incentive at this time of year, it\u2019s a scholarship programme that runs alongside the main application cycle,\u201d said Hopkins.</p> <p> \u201cIt\u2019s simply trying to find inventive ways to help students who are going to have considerable debts, financial debts, thinking about further study.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Not for 108 years have British swimmers enjoyed a more productive time in the pool at an Olympic Games. Six medals \u2013 one gold and five silvers \u2013 may not sound much compared to the US\u2019s stash of 33 medals but it represents a sharp improvement on four years ago and, historically, has been exceeded only once, in London in 1908.</p> <p>As well as outpacing the target of three to five medals set by UK Sport prior to the Games, GB\u2019s head coach Bill Furniss and performance director Chris Spice are also presiding over a young team with much improvement still to come.

It was absolutely amazing just to get that split because a lot of people have been saying online I couldn\u2019t do it [go under 57 seconds]. It wasn\u2019t a 56.9, it was a 56.5.

I wasn\u2019t on those teams but, with this young talent now coming through, we are showing we are hungry, we can take on the world and we are not scared of anything. That\u2019s the mentality in British swimming now. Hopefully that will&#xa0;continue.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>This is the time of year in England when thunderstorms can get so intense that they turn into disasters. The worst was on this date in 1952 on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.exmoor-nationalpark.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/579317/The-1952-Flood-Disaster-in-Context.pdf\">Exmoor</a> in Devon when 34 people died, 16 at Lynmouth and 12 at Barbrook. Up to five inches of rain fell in an hour on the moor, on already saturated ground. The East and West Lyn Rivers converged into a torrent.</p> <p>In all 93 buildings were destroyed or damaged and 132 vehicles carried out to sea. More than 114,000 tons of debris were removed.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2004/aug/18/weather.climatechange3\">Boscastle flood in Cornwall</a>, exactly 52 years later in 2004, had similar causes. After 2.4 inches of rain, three rivers off the moors joined in one flood. The destruction was severe but fortunately no one died. Many people were rescued by helicopter as the waters destroyed homes and swept cars into the harbour.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2011/aug/11/weatherwatch-cornwall-boscastle-floods\">Weatherwatch: Cornwall</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although they were both \u201cnatural\u201d disasters they were both made worse by man\u2019s intervention. In Lynmouth the river had been diverted to allow development and in Boscastle change in land use above the village meant the rain drained rapidly into the rivers. In both cases debris building up behind bridges effectively dammed the rivers until they overtopped their banks and the bridges collapsed under the weight of water and debris. In Lynmouth this caused immense damage.</p> <p>Afterwards the river in Lynmouth was given a great deal more respect and allowed to keep the new course it carved out for itself in the flood. Boscastle also took measures to keep its residents safe. But both places, and other quaint holiday towns and villages on the coast, remain vulnerable to big thunderstorms on the moorland above them. </p>",
  "<p>First seabirds started falling out of the sky, washing up on beaches from California to Canada.</p> <p>Then emaciated and dehydrated sea lion pups began showing up, stranded and on the brink of death.</p> <p>A surge in dead whales was reported in the same region, and that was followed by the largest toxic algal bloom in history seen along the Californian coast. Mixed among all that there were population booms of several marine species that <a href=\"https://swfsc.noaa.gov/news.aspx?ParentMenuId=54&amp;id=20615\">normally aren\u2019t seen surging in the same year</a>.</p> <p></p> <p>Plague, famine, pestilence and death was sweeping the northern Pacific Ocean between 2014 and 2015.</p> <p>This chaos was caused by a single massive heatwave, unlike anything ever seen before.

It may have been the worst but wide-scale disruption from marine heatwaves is increasingly being seen all around the globe, with regions such as Australia seemingly being hit with more than their fair share.</p> <p>It might seem strange given their huge impact but the concept of a marine heatwave is new to science.

This year at least three parts of the coast have been devastated by extreme water temperatures.</p> <p>Australia, it seems, could be smack in the middle of this global chaos. According to <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11160-013-9326-6\">work published in 2014</a>, both the south-east and south-west coasts are among the world\u2019s fastest warming ocean waters.</p> <p>\u201cThey have been identified as global warming hotspots,\u201d says Eric Oliver, an oceanographer at the University of Tasmania. \u201cThe seas there are warming fast and so we might expect there to be an increased likelihood or increased intensity of the events that happen there. </p> <p>\u201cCertainly attention is being focused on ocean changes on the south-east and south-west of Australia.\u201d</p> <p><strong></strong></p> <p><strong></strong></p> <h2>A field born in the death of a forest</h2> <p>It was <a href=\"http://www.fish.wa.gov.au/Documents/research_reports/frr222.pdf\">in the study of a marine heatwave </a>in south-west Australia that the term was coined just five years ago. <a href=\"http://www.fish.wa.gov.au/Documents/research_reports/frr222.pdf\">In a report</a> that still used the term \u201cmarine heatwave\u201d in scare quotes, scientists from the West Australian department of fisheries found the heatwave off the state\u2019s coast was \u201ca major temperature anomaly superimposed on the underlying long-term ocean-warming trend\u201d.</p> <p>That year, the researchers found, Western Australia had an unprecedented surge of hot water along its coast. Surface temperatures were up to 5C higher than the usual seasonal temperature. The pool of warm water stretched more than 1,500km from Ningaloo to the southern tip of the continent at Cape Leeuwin, and it extended more than 200km offshore. Unlike a terrestrial heatwave that will normally last a couple of weeks at most, this persisted for more than 10 weeks.</p> <p><strong></strong></p> <p>But five years later the full impact of that marine heatwave have are beginning to be more fully understood.</p> <p>Thomas Wernberg, an ecologist from the University of Western Australia, examined the impact on the gigantic kelp forests that line the western and southern coast of Australia, <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6295/169\">publishing his results</a> in the prestigious journal Science.</p> <p>\u201cIt got so hot that the kelp forests died,\u201d Wernberg says. For hundreds of kilometres, magnificent kelp forests that line the coast and support one of the world\u2019s most biodiverse marine environments simply died in the heat</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t just their death that was the problem. While heatwaves on land can kill and destroy large sections of terrestrial forests \u2013 usually by allowing fires to spread \u2013 those trees normally grow back. What was disturbing about this marine heatwave was that many of the vast underwater forests never came back. The warming climate created changes that meant the kelp didn\u2019t recover. About 100km of kelp forests just disappeared, probably forever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"233e83c9307d1364ac49e367ebef33bca5b176cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/233e83c9307d1364ac49e367ebef33bca5b176cc/0_168_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mangrove die-off\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aerial footage of \u2018unprecedented\u2019 mangrove die-off in the Gulf of Carpentaria in Australia.

He saw it as an exciting new field of study.</p> <p>That was timely, as less than a year later Australia would find itself virtually surrounded by pools of warm water that caused widespread and unprecedented destruction.</p> <p>They were spurred on by a large El Ni\u00f1o, which spreads warm water across the middle of the Pacific Ocean. But El Ni\u00f1os had been seen before and these marine heatwaves appeared to be unprecedented.</p> <p>Perhaps most dramatically, 2016 saw the Great Barrier Reef blasted by a marine heatwave that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/03/agencies-say-22-of-barrier-reef-coral-is-dead-correcting-misinterpretation\">killed 22% of the coral there</a> in one fell swoop. In the pristine northern sections, about half the coral is thought to have died.</p> <p></p> <p>The hotter water that bathed the reef has now subsided but the full damage is still being tallied. The immediate death of the coral is one thing but the after effects are starting to be seen, with a decline in fish numbers being reported.</p> <p>And, unusually, there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/21/sections-of-great-barrier-reef-suffering-from-complete-ecosystem-collapse \">continued bleaching in parts of the reef</a>, even now as the southern hemisphere moves past the middle of winter.<br></p> <p><strong></strong></p> <p>Justin Marshall, of the University of Queensland, has been studying the reef ecosystem around Lizard Island in the remote northern part of the Great Barrier Reef and warns that there appears to be \u201ccomplete ecosystem collapse\u201d there.</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t have the final numbers from the surveys he is conducting but he says there are easily half as many fish there after the bleaching as there were before, and there are some species that were common before that are completely missing now.</p> <p>Marshall says that could be the beginning of a \u201cregime shift\u201d there \u2013 where the once magnificent and resilient coral is replaced permanently by a bed of seaweed.</p> <p>But as if disappearing coral reefs and kelp forests aren\u2019t enough for one country, a marine heatwave in Australia in 2016 was also responsible for an unprecedented mangrove die-off.</p> <p>On the other side of Cape York from the Great Barrier Reef, a related heatwave in the Gulf of Carpentaria spurred along what one expert studying said was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/11/massive-mangrove-die-off-on-gulf-of-carpentaria-worst-in-the-world-says-expert\">worst mangrove die-off seen anywhere in the world</a>.</p> <p>After hearing reports of the mangrove die-off, Norm Duke, an expert in mangrove ecology from James Cook University, got a helicopter and flew over 700km of coastline, to see what was happening.</p> <p>He says he was shocked by what he saw. He calculated dead mangroves now covered a combined area of 7,000 hectares. That was the worst mangrove mass die-off seen anywhere in the world, he says.</p> <p>\u201cWe have seen smaller instances of this kind of moisture stress before but what is so unusual now is its extent, and that it occurred across the whole southern gulf in a single month.\u201d</p> <p><strong></strong></p> <p>Duke is assessing the precise structure of the die-off to figure out what the exact drivers were. By examining exactly which mangroves died, and measuring how far they were from the high-tide line, Duke hopes to figure out how much of the die-off is attributable to hot water and air, and how much to the dry weather. But, for now, Duke thinks all are to blame. \u201cThis is all correlated, so it\u2019s hard to separate,\u201d Duke says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"903377db73d1eace286907c89f2ae5e606a909c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/903377db73d1eace286907c89f2ae5e606a909c1/0_281_540_324/500.jpg\" alt=\"NASA\u2019s image of the algal bloom.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">NASA\u2019s image of the algal bloom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NASA images/SeaWiFS Project, NASA/Goddard Space Flight Centre and ORBIMAGE.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Greg Browning from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology says with all these changes in the water temperature and the rainfall, big changes in ecosystems would almost be expected. \u201cIn a nutshell, there have been significantly below-average rainfall totals in the last two wet seasons ... and very warm sea surface temperatures,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/11/massive-mangrove-die-off-on-gulf-of-carpentaria-worst-in-the-world-says-expert\">told the Guardian in July</a>. \u201cWhen you have those departures from average conditions, it\u2019s bound to affect the ecosystem in some way.\u201d</p> <p>Just like the kelp forests and the coral reef, there is a distinct possibility some of these mangroves will be lost forever. Duke says if the disruption is severe enough, the mangrove-dominated regions can become salt pans \u2013 flat, unvegetated regions covered in salt.</p> <p>And he says the most recent satellite images show the mangroves still haven\u2019t recovered their leaves, suggesting they really are dead.</p> <p>And last, but not least, Tasmania has been virtually poached this year.</p> <p>Tasmania was bathed in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/22/tasmania-marine-heatwave-salmon-global-warming-climate-change\">unprecedented pool of warm water</a> that was 4.5C higher than average, <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-13/fee-relief-for-tasmanian-oyster-growers-as-disease-spreads/7165744\">devastating lucrative oyster farms</a>, causing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/22/tasmania-marine-heatwave-salmon-global-warming-climate-change\">drop in salmon catches and killing swathes of abalone</a>. </p> <h2>Are marine heatwaves on the rise?</h2> <p>With two of the world\u2019s global warming hot spots sitting just off the coasts of Australia, the country is likely to continue seeing these marine heatwaves bring chaos and destruction.</p> <p>But the big question facing researchers is if they are increasing in frequency or severity or both, as a result of global warming.</p> <p>Wernberg says it\u2019s the apparent increase in the effects of marine heatwaves that has driven him and others to study them in more detail than ever before. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019ve been understudied in the past,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s that they didn\u2019t occur to the extent they are now.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems like there are more and more extreme impacts attributed to them.\u201d </p> <p>Wernberg says it\u2019s difficult to say \u201cbecause you have one, then you have another one and then eventually you realise you are having more than you used to\u201d.</p> <p>Di Lorenzo, an oceanographer at Georgia Institute of Technology in the US, conducted a <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate3082.html\">major study of \u201cthe blob\u201d</a>, which, at least by some measures, was the worst marine heatwave ever seen.</p> <p>He says his study suggested it was made about 16% more likely as a result of climate change \u2013 but he warns that while he\u2019s confident that the results show it was made significantly more likely by climate change, he\u2019s not very confident with the precise figure. \u201cI would feel comfortable with the sign of the effect, not necessarily with number.\u201d</p> <p>But generally, Di Lorenzo says, looking at what is happening, he thinks climate change is increasing both the frequency and severity of marine heatwaves. So much so, he wonders if climate models are wrong, and underestimating the fluctuations in temperature that will occur as the globe warms.</p> <p>\u201cThe real system \u2013 if you look at the observations, and this is a paper I will publish very soon \u2013 the increase in variance is much much stronger than what models are predicting,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe our models are too conservative.\u201d</p> <p>Di Lorenzo says this sort of \u201cvariance\u201d \u2013 including things like heatwaves \u2013 will always be stronger in the ocean, because the ocean has a kind of \u201cmemory\u201d that means events build on top of each other, multiplying their effects.</p> <p>That memory is a result of temperature changing much more slowly in the ocean, as well as the ocean being able to absorb more heat in general.</p> <p>Oliver, from the University of Tasmania, would not discuss the results because they were under review at a journal but data <a href=\"http://scientell.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Selected-abstracts-media-interest.pdf\">he presented at a conference</a>, he and colleagues including Wernberg, found \u201cmore, longer, and more intense\u201d marine heatwaves over the past century.</p> <p>The results have not yet undergone peer-review but they found the same trend in many parts of the world. Since 1920, they found some regions were seeing an increase in frequency of about one extra marine heatwave every 20 years. But the plots show most of that increase happened in the past 30 years.</p> <p>They also found they\u2019re becoming hotter, increasing by almost 0.4C per decade in some regions. And they\u2019re lasting longer \u2013 an extra 0.4 days per decade.</p> <p>Putting it all together, the results globally were even more significant. Around the world, marine heatwaves were increasing by two days every decade since 1900.</p> <p>Over that time, he found the frequency and duration had doubled. As a result, the number of days in which there was a marine heatwave somewhere in the world had increased four-fold.</p> <p>\u201cOn average, there are 20 more [marine heatwave] days per year in the early 21st century than in the early 20th century,\u201d the presentation concluded.</p> <p>Oliver and Wernberg declined to comment on the results, since some scientific journals refuse to publish results if the authors have already discussed them with the media. </p> <p>But Di Lorenzo, who wasn\u2019t involved in Oliver\u2019s study, said the increasing frequency of these events is well outside of what anyone predicted, and he\u2019s excited to see how it turns out.</p> <p>\u201cI personally, as a scientist, I\u2019m curious to see what happens. I hope to live long enough \u2013 maybe 20 or 30 years \u2013 to see what this experiment is going to turn into.\u201d</p> <p>He said the situation is very grave for humanity but exciting for scientists. He compared the situation to a surgeon being faced with a sick patient. \u201cIf he has a very complicated surgery, of course he cares for the patient, but on the other hand he is very excited about trying a new surgery and potentially solving it.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>While it is true that in the mid-1960s Labour\u2019s youth movement massively declined (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/11/tom-watsons-portrayal-of-new-labour-members-is-not-one-we-recognise\">Letters</a>, 12 August), the Labour Party Young Socialists grew dramatically in the 1970s and 1980s when it was led by supporters of Militant who had become its leadership in 1970. This revival came from a combination of increasing class struggle, radicalisation in society and serious campaigning. Soon nearly 2,000 young people were attending the LPYS\u2019s annual conferences. This growth continued and the LPYS reached a high point of 581 branches in 1985, the time of the miners\u2019 strike, youth protests against Thatcher etc.</p> <p>However, the growing offensive against the left by the pro-capitalist wing of the Labour party inevitably had a damaging impact on the LPYS. As it became clear that expulsions of individuals would not tame the LPYS the Labour party right wing resorted to rule changes. In 1987 the LPYS\u2019s age limit was cut from 26 to 23 and most of its democratic structures were removed, with the result that by 1990 it only had 52 branches left, a reduction of 90% in five years. Tom Watson, then the Labour party\u2019s youth officer, presided over the LPYS\u2019s final liquidation and its replacement by Young Labour, an organisation without fully democratic structures and controlled by the party leadership. Watson\u2019s support now for limiting the franchise for Labour\u2019s leadership election shows his preference for top-down methods when he and his supporters cannot build grassroots support.<br><strong>Bob Labi</strong><br><em>Editor of Left, the LPYS paper, between 1971 and 1977</em></p> <p>\u2022 I became a Trotskyist after leaving grammar school but have continued to share the values and perspective of the socialist pioneer. I remain committed to the abolition of all grammar schools too. In 1974 I joined the local Labour party on the very day Ted Heath called a general election. I have remained a party member and avowedly a Trotskyist. During 42 years\u2019 Labour party membership I have been (inter alia) constituency secretary, and ward political activities officer. I served eight years as a Camden councillor (for some time as deputy leader) and for 11 years as an elected member of the Inner London Education Authority (for three years as leader).</p> <p>Over the years I have never wavered in my belief that international socialism is crucial if the people are to take power away from the wealthy, the global corporations and the corrupt bigots who hate workers, the poor and the disadvantaged. Trotsky remains an inspiration. He detested Stalin and his violent abuse of state power; he was as a result murdered by a Stalinist assassin; he loved literature and was a believer in its power to elevate culture above social elitism. Trotsky wrote that the \u201cmoral grandeur of the proletarian revolution consists in the fact that it is laying the foundations of a culture which is above classes and which will be the first culture which is truly human\u201d (Introduction to Literature and Revolution). Not bad, eh? He was probably a Guardian reader too.<br><strong>Neil Fletcher</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The co-founder of Militant, Peter Taaffe, displays the usual disposition of the authoritarian left: the need to completely rewrite history (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/10/leader-expelled-leftwing-group-militant-peter-taaffe-readmission-labour-corbyn\">Report</a>, 11 August). His claims that the Militant Tendency \u201cfought Thatcher in Liverpool and defeated her\u201d are ludicrous. A Militant-led Labour party came to power in Liverpool in 1983 with a relatively progressive social programme. I remember, however, a tactical ineptness with, among other idiocies, the issuing of redundancy notices to 30,000 Liverpool city council workers resulting in mass anti-Militant protests by these workers in defence of their jobs; and the setting of an illegal budget that Militant then backtracked on by going cap in hand to the Thatcher government for permission to obtain a large loan in order to set a subsequent legal budget. In 1985, the illegal budget resulted in the barring from office and surcharge of 47 Labour councillors to the tune of \u00a3348,000 which I and many other trade unionists had to help pay through donations.</p> <p>The Thatcher government set Militant one trap after another which it blindly blundered into with all the tactical nous of a horny bull elephant in must. Far from being defeated by Militant, the Thatcher government had Militant on a string. Its legacy was also disastrous. In fact, you could attribute Labour\u2019s loss of overall control in Liverpool from 1992 onwards and 12 wasted years of Liberal control from 1998 to 2010 in part to Militant\u2019s inept period in power. The fantasy version of history is Peter Taffe\u2019s but the reality is that the Thatcher government roundly defeated Militant in Liverpool.<br><strong>John Hoggart </strong><br><em>Little Neston, Cheshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Re <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/12/corbyns-team-incensed-as-new-members-denied-labour-vote-again\">New members denied Labour vote again</a> (13 August) and Lord Justice Sales, would this be the same Philip Sales who in 1997 was recruited by Tony Blair from his own chambers, 11KBW, causing something of a storm over accusations of cronyism?

Studying orcas in the wild has shown that females live unusually far beyond their fertile years because of the benefits their accumulated knowledge bring to the group, as well as the lifelong support they give their sons.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/10/the-guardian-view-on-granny-orcas-nothing-to-do-with-humans\">The Guardian view on granny orcas: nothing to do with humans | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Evolutionary researchers have been quick to draw comparisons between orcas and humans. Could early human societies also have evolved to rely on the invaluable wisdom and help of female elders?</p> <p>These comparisons, though, have been a little too quick for some. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/10/the-guardian-view-on-granny-orcas-nothing-to-do-with-humans\">A Guardian leader</a> column, for example, concluded that scientific conundrums like these are \u201cirrelevant\u201d to feminist theory. Human values have nothing to do with what science tells us about how we evolved. And whale research tells us only about whales.</p> <p>Feminism and science have long had an uneasy relationship. That\u2019s hardly surprising. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/charles-darwin\">Charles Darwin</a> expressed as scientific theory his opinion that women are the less evolved sex, and other Victorian biologists claimed women could never catch up to men in the evolutionary race to higher intelligence and creativity. Likewise, through the 20th century, male scientists suggested that women had tiny sex drives, that the orgasm was an evolutionary vestige of male anatomy, and that women had smaller brains corresponding to smaller intellects.</p> <p>Scientists have often looked at women as the inferior sex (some still do), threatening the cause of women\u2019s rights with biological determinism. So it makes sense that feminists have returned their gaze with suspicion.</p> <p>The problem is that dismissing science as a body of knowledge means ignoring the best means we have of understanding ourselves. Like all sets of ideas, we need to see science for what it is: an imperfect but promising road to the facts. Correcting itself along the way \u2013 and there\u2019s no doubt that corrections are needed \u2013 it explains our bodies, minds and place in the universe.</p> <p>Far from irrelevant, then, science should be a useful resource for feminists. When we are told that women are natural homemakers, it can tell us what \u201cnatural\u201d really means. When people claim women are intellectually less able, science can expose this as nonsense. The more research, the more we learn just how much the gaps we see are rooted in society and culture, not in biology.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Scientists have often looked at women as inferior, threatening the cause of women\u2019s rights with biological determinism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Evolutionary biology offers us the long view. Animal data is important because humans didn\u2019t evolve independently. We share common ancestors with other species. When the menopause \u2013 practically unknown among other species \u2013 happens to orcas as well as to us, we must pay attention. They provide clues that may help explain how we adapted to our ancient environments. They are part of our history. Very distant history, maybe, but history nonetheless.</p> <p>Being as far removed as we are now from how our earliest ancestors lived, we may assume our evolutionary story doesn\u2019t matter. The societies we\u2019ve constructed, which bear testament to humankind\u2019s mastery over nature, have nothing to do with hunting, gathering, or cavewomen crouched over fires. But the story does have the power to answer that dark, niggling question that is still asked: is the sexual inequality we see today rooted in something biological? Is it an essential difference, dating back to the dawn of human life?</p> <p>The old ideas of Darwin\u2019s time are already giving way to more accurate accounts of our evolutionary history. The menopause represents one of the most exciting areas of research about women. Here, we see cruel notions about older women being useless to society, or sexually unwanted, are being superseded by compelling new theories. According to anthropologist Kristen Hawkes at the University of Utah, who has done the most work on this, women evolved to survive so far past menopausal age because, in our past, they were crucial to our survival \u2013 much like female orcas. The evidence so far backs her up.</p> <p>Science can help rewrite the story of woman. This is where the final frontier of feminism really lies. As Hawkes says: \u201cIf you\u2019re really paying attention to biology, how can you not be a feminist?\u201d</p>",

That seems to have been the moment when she asked herself when it was going to be <em>her</em> year: although her bonus was a lavish $1.5m, more than most of us can expect to earn in a decade or more, she says the bank\u2019s \u201cbros culture\u201d ensured she wasn\u2019t taken seriously. Her first conversation with her new boss, according to a lawsuit she filed, included him <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2016/05/17/bank-of-america-accused-of-running-a-bros-club-that-underpaid-female-executives/\">asking her whether she colored her hair</a>. </p> <p>Just how many gender bias cases does Wall Street want to settle? In 2013, Bank of America <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/bank-of-america-to-pay-39-million-in-gender-bias-case/\">forked over $39m to women who had worked at Merrill Lynch</a>, in the latest in a long string of discrimination cases involving women and racial minorities dating back decades. </p> <p>Many other cases are settled out of the public eye, through mandatory arbitration. But discrimination, whether it\u2019s subtle (the result of a woman wearing a dress that somehow, inexplicably, a client dislikes) or overt (a woman being forced to share her commissions and clients with a younger man) is still a reality. So, too, is harassment. </p> <p>It\u2019s also worth noting that when most of these women make it big, they don\u2019t do so within big Wall Street firms. Maria Elena Lagomasino was chairman and CEO of the JP Morgan Private Bank, and became CEO of WE Family Offices, a global wealth management firm. Sallie Krawcheck became chief financial officer of Citigroup, then moved to Bank of America Merrill Lynch to head its asset management division. </p> <p>When the bank\u2019s CEO, Brian Moynihan, eliminated her position \u2013 in spite of the fact that Krawcheck had produced profits for the then struggling bank \u2013 she moved on to acquire a professional women\u2019s networking group that began as a Goldman Sachs alumnae organization, and now is launching Ellevest, <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/11/the-11-trillion-women-investment-market-sallie-krawcheck-is-betting-on.html\">a new investment platform aimed at women</a>. Another high flyer, Blythe Masters, left JP Morgan Chase to <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/06/blockchain-in-banks-a-reality-in-less-than-2-years-blythe-masters.html\">launch her own blockchain company</a>, Digital Asset Holdings. </p> <p></p> <p>In Sherry\u2019s view of the world, a few smart women on Wall Street\u2019s risk committees might have prevented some of the mayhem of the financial crisis. In Equity, Bishop is the principled investment banker who wants to do what it takes to raise capital for her clients to get money from investors to entrepreneurs. Traders\u2019 greed and her colleagues\u2019 games bemuse her.</p> <p>Maybe, just maybe, all this will trigger a serious discussion about women on Wall Street, rather than more propaganda. It\u2019s not likely to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-lefevre/why-women-dont-get-promoted-on-wall-street_b_7812038.html\">change attitudes</a> on a day-to-day basis, but in this kind of environment, doing away with mandatory arbitration, so that the worst offenders can be publicly named and shamed in lawsuits, would be a fine start. </p> <p>Because at some point, it has to be their fucking year.</p>",
  "<p>It took a little over an hour, and the rasping contribution from the ego leading his team\u2019s line, before Jos\u00e9 Mourinho let the rather snarling facade slip and his true emotions show. The Manchester United manager had watched his new side establish a lead which already seemed insurmountable when Zlatan Ibrahimovic collected possession around 25 yards out and, with Bournemouth\u2019s players still dizzied by Anthony Martial\u2019s sprint, skimmed a shot through Steve Cook, across Artur Boruc and into the far corner.</p> <p>The attempt was invited by the lack of a challenge but executed with pinpoint accuracy, and all from a move the forward had kickstarted deep inside United territory. While Ibrahimovic was mobbed by team-mates out on the turf, the manager sprinted out of the technical area screaming his own celebration with the coaching staff close behind. Maybe Mourinho had simply been eager for a dash of real class to supply gloss to a first Premier League game in charge. Certainly he was convinced it was a goal which confirmed success and a positive start. Regardless, that conversion from distance ensured the scoreline reflected his team\u2019s overall dominance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/aug/14/bournemouth-v-manchester-united-premier-league-live\">Bournemouth 1-3 Manchester United: Premier League \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These remain early days and this side, once Paul Pogba and Henrikh Mkhitaryan have been properly integrated, will become even more efficient in time. The perfectionist in the Portuguese manager will ensure as much. But a new era has still begun in hugely encouraging fashion and Mourinho departed satisfied with plenty he had witnessed on the south coast.</p> <p>Eric Bailly, the \u00a330m addition from Villarreal, was aggressive and authoritative despite having missed training all week with an injury sustained in the Community Shield win. Juan Mata and Ander Herrera offered flashes of incision and invention, Martial contributed from wide, while Ibrahimovic retains the strut that so terrified French club defences last season.</p> <p>He was not always a presence in the penalty area, where he did not muster a touch before the break, but he has now scored on his bows in Serie&#xa0;A, La&#xa0;Liga, Ligue&#xa0;1, the Champions League and Premier League. His scripts continue to be expertly written. \u201cIt is not easy,\u201d the Swede said. \u201cEverything is new for me, from my team-mates to the club, the environment, the new stadiums. But slowly I am getting settled in and I just play my game and make the team win.\u201d</p> <p>The influence he can have on this dressing room can be pivotal and, even if his combination with Wayne Rooney may instinctively appear awkward, they could each point to rewards here and even the odd glimpse of a proper partnership.</p> <p>Yet, in keeping with true Mourinho pragmatism, this was only really about the result in an arena where United had succumbed under Louis van Gaal last season. The satisfaction was born of a rusty initial display eventually yielding a commanding win. Those early exchanges, where opportunities were spurned in overhit passes or scuffed attempts, appeared forgotten once a three-goal advantage was established. \u201cTo control the game without having problems makes this a good victory,\u201d the manager said. He has never lost his first Premier League game of a season and, once his side were ahead, that sequence was never threatened by Bournemouth.</p> <p>Eddie Howe could justifiably bemoan a lack of fortune in that opening concession, which served to puncture local optimism whipped up by 40 minutes of parity. Then, from nothing, Simon Francis\u2019s back-pass was ill-judged, underhit and collected by a galloping Mata. His clipped shot was blocked by an on-rushing Artur Boruc, only for the ball to rebound off the stumbling Francis\u2019s shins and back into the Spaniard\u2019s path. He thumped the ball gleefully into the empty net.</p> <p>Mata had never scored a Premier League goal for Mourinho having featured 13 times for him at Chelsea in 2013\u201114. After the humiliation at Wembley last week, when the substitute was substituted in stoppage time apparently due to a lack of height in the side, this was a more satisfying intervention.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/13/paul-pogba-adnan-januzaj-manchester-united\">Paul Pogba and Adnan Januzaj are two sides of the same coin | Daniel Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The goal did also perhaps illustrate why Howe is still seeking defensive recruits. The Stoke utility player Marc Wilson is expected to return to the south coast \u2013where he had previously played for Portsmouth \u2013 in a deal worth an initial \u00a32m this week, and Cook was almost exposed as Ibrahimovic\u2019s flick sent Rooney bustling through before Boruc blocked smartly.</p> <p>That proved to be a brief respite. Antonio Valencia was soon barging beyond Charlie Daniels to clip over a cross which was met by a wild attempt from Martial. True to the home side\u2019s ill luck, the mis-hit bounced kindly for Rooney, alone on the edge of the six-yard box, who simply guided his header down and back across the Pole to double the lead.</p> <p>Bournemouth, with Lewis Cook quietly impressive in central midfield, lacked the bite to wound the visitors, their forward players prone to over-elaborate in promising positions. Jordon Ibe, Joshua King and Callum Wilson may be more potent threats on the counter-attack away from home, but the substitutes Lewis Grabban and Benik Afobe at least ruffled United once Ibrahimovic had enjoyed his moment. It was Grabban\u2019s pass which was collected by Adam Smith, the full-back thumping a fine consolation beyond David de Gea. The Spaniard had to save well from Andrew Surman, too, in stoppage time.</p> <p>\u201cWe were well in the game up to that first goal,\u201d Howe said. \u201cIt was out of nothing: it wasn\u2019t like they\u2019d broken our shape and scored an outstanding goal. It was scrappy.\u201d Mourinho will hardly care. There was a punch of the air at the end, apparently aimed towards, and returned by, Ed Woodward up in the stand. His tenure at United is up and running.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Eric Bailly (Manchester United)</p>",

The study, Organic Agriculture in the 21st Century, published in Nature Plants, is the first to compare organic and conventional agriculture across the<a href=\"http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12832/toward-sustainable-agricultural-systems-in-the-21st-century\"> four main metrics of sustainability</a> identified by the US National Academy of Sciences: be productive, economically profitable, environmentally sound and socially just. Like a chair, for a farm to be sustainable, it needs to be stable, with all four legs being managed so they are in balance.</p> <p>We found that although organic farming systems produce yields that average 10-20% less than conventional agriculture, they are more profitable and environmentally friendly. Historically, conventional agriculture has focused on increasing yields at the expense of the other three sustainability metrics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9046f568e2486f45e3b371a08f436ea1a4ee5bd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9046f568e2486f45e3b371a08f436ea1a4ee5bd1/0_0_576_276/500.jpg\" alt=\"The flower petals and the labels represent different sustainability metrics that compare organic farming with conventional farming.

Biodiversity loss, environmental degradation and severe impacts on ecosystem services \u2013 which refer to nature\u2019s support of wildlife habitat, crop pollination, soil health and other benefits \u2013 have not only accompanied conventional farming systems, but have often extended well beyond the boundaries of their fields, such as fertilizer runoff into rivers.</p> <p>Overall, organic farms tend to have better soil quality and reduce soil erosion compared to their conventional counterparts. Organic agriculture generally creates less soil and water pollution and lower greenhouse gas emissions, and is more energy efficient. Organic agriculture is also associated with greater biodiversity of plants, animals, insects and microbes as well as genetic diversity.</p> <p>Despite lower yields, organic agriculture is more profitable (by 22\u201335%) for farmers because consumers are willing to pay more. These higher prices essentially compensate farmers for preserving the quality of their land.</p> <p>Studies that evaluate social equity and quality of life for farm communities are few. Still, organic farming has been shown to<a href=\"http://www.sustainablebusiness.com/index.cfm/go/news.display/id/23642\"> create more jobs</a> and reduce farm workers\u2019 exposure to pesticides and other chemicals.</p> <p>Organic farming can help to both feed the world and preserve wildland. In a study published this year, researchers modeled <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160419/ncomms11382/full/ncomms11382.html\">500 food production scenarios</a> to see if we can feed an estimated world population of 9.6 billion people in 2050 without expanding the area of farmland we already use. They found that enough food could be produced with lower-yielding organic farming, if people become vegetarians or eat a more plant-based diet with lower meat consumption. The existing farmland can feed that many people if they are all vegan, a 94% success rate if they are vegetarian, 39% with a completely organic diet, and 15% with the Western-style diet based on meat.</p> <p>Realistically, we can\u2019t expect everyone to forgo meat. Organic isn\u2019t the only sustainable option to conventional farming either. Other viable types of farming exist, such as integrated farming where you blend organic with conventional practices or grass-fed livestock systems.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jun/25/hemp-farming-legalization-bill-marijuana-industry-california\">Hemp is eco-friendly.

The challenge facing policymakers is to develop government policies that support conventional farmers converting to organic systems.

The summer\u2019s word-of-mouth hit has been 80s nostalgia-heavy supernatural thriller Stranger Things, and there was a buzz too about last week\u2019s launch of Baz Luhrmann\u2019s hip-hop history The Get Down.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/05/stranger-things-netflix-season-two-winona-ryder-us\">Stranger Things: Netflix boss says it would be 'dumb' not to do season two</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not that we know how many people actually watch the shows, because Netflix won\u2019t tell anyone. In contrast to most traditional TV channels, the information doesn\u2019t need to be given to advertisers (because Netflix doesn\u2019t have any) and, in any case, the raw numbers are less important than the number of subscribers each show brings in.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s competitive information. It tells HBO what kind of shows to produce,\u201d says Hastings. \u201cBecause we don\u2019t have advertising chopping up the content, we are under a whole different model where we get the freedom to not compare all the shows and rank all the shows. Because it kind of doesn\u2019t matter what everyone else loves the most, it matters what you or I love the most.\u201d</p> <p>However many people are watching, chatter around Netflix will only get more intense in the UK later this year when it premieres The Crown, a multi-part biopic of Elizabeth II originated in Britain and costing a reported \u00a3100m to make. While it\u2019s one of the more expensive shows commissioned by Netflix, the budget is just part of a $6bn (\u00a34.6bn) pot of money the company plans to spend this year on content.</p> <p>That plan has got some in the industry worried. Just a year ago, John Landgraf, chief executive of Fox-owned US network FX, said there was \u201ctoo much TV\u201d and there is talk of a dangerous bubble in spending on quality drama, with much of the blame laid at Netflix\u2019s door. Hastings is unrepentant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"adec4bf69837eacbe2a8e079f58832c3f64a96c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adec4bf69837eacbe2a8e079f58832c3f64a96c5/128_293_5381_3228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Netflix\u2019s Reed Hastings: \u2018The key in success is thinking long term and not worrying one quarter.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Netflix\u2019s Reed Hastings: \u2018The key in success is thinking long term and not worrying one quarter.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe thinks there is too much, he can do something about it,\u201d says Hastings of Landgraf\u2019s comment. \u201cHe can produce less, but we are going to produce more.\u201d Could it become unsustainable for traditional media companies to up what they pay for content under pressure from new entrants? \u201cI\u2019m not sure for them, they might have to cut back, but we are going to grow. It\u2019s sustainable because the new content helps us grow ... I\u2019m not sure about in their model, if they are complaining about it they can fix their side, our side is working fine.\u201d</p> <p>Netflix is not the only new player in town pushing up prices, and when it came to the show being made by the former Top Gear trio Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond the company was outbid by someone with far, far deeper pockets, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos. A Netflix executive last year said Amazon had spent too much, before backtracking rapidly. Is Hastings worried about losing out?</p> <p>\u201cWe bid on Jeremy Clarkson\u2019s show and they bid more,\u201d says Hastings. \u201cBy the time they won it, we were like \u2018Wow, that\u2019s a lot of money.\u2019 Maybe it\u2019ll work for them, it might well. It could be a great show. You can\u2019t tell until you\u2019ve seen it. We lost on that one, there\u2019s other ones we won. They are in the bidding, but so is Hulu in the US, so is HBO, we were bidding [against] Channel 4 for Black Mirror.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur spending the $5bn or $6bn is a fraction of the total industry spend. If Amazon spend a couple of billion it\u2019s in a pool that is very large when you add up all the different networks and what they are spending on scripted entertainment around the world. I use Amazon all the time \u2013 I am a Prime user, when they have a good show I\u2019ll watch that \u2013 but my sense is that they are just one more competitor amongst many.\u201d</p> <p>That Hastings jokes with Page and competes with Bezos is not entirely surprising. Though Netflix started out as a mail order rental service, he is very much a techie. He founded software company Pure in the 90s and sits on Facebook\u2019s board. He is also part of the Giving Pledge campaign championed by Microsoft\u2019s founder Bill Gates and Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, which commits some of the world\u2019s richest people to donate most of their wealth to good causes during their lifetime (education is Hastings\u2019 chosen cause).</p> <p>And at Netflix it is not Hastings but Ted Sarandos, the company\u2019s chief content officer with what Hastings calls a \u201cgolden gut\u201d, who makes the calls on which shows to buy, even if he is guided by algorithms and the occasional bit of data insight from his CEO.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb9dfbdbb02adacc570d3964fbf5ce950868f044\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb9dfbdbb02adacc570d3964fbf5ce950868f044/0_0_4240_2545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stranger Things: the Winona Ryder thriller has been one of the hits of the summer in the US.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stranger Things: the Winona Ryder thriller has been one of the hits of the summer in the US.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: /Photoshot/Photoshot</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another thing Hastings shares with his tech peers is his belief in constant growth. His content costs from both original commissions and the many billions in commitments to licences for older shows will be familiar to any long-serving LA TV exec, but his faith that as long as his subscriber numbers keep growing he\u2019ll be able to keep spending is straight out of Silicon Valley.</p> <p>It\u2019s not an unreasonable strategy, but recent numbers have disappointed. In its second quarter Netflix added just 160,000 memberships in the US and 1.52m internationally \u2013 compared with a forecast of 500,000 extra US members and 2m internationally \u2013 taking it to a total of 83 million members worldwide. The markets were unimpressed and the company\u2019s share price dived.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been volatile since we started,\u201d he says of the share price. \u201cThe initial thing is we went public on the dollar, within six months we were down to 50c. We are trading about where we were before earnings. Everyone realises that internet video is the future. I don\u2019t think [the markets] are worried, but there was disappointment about us having less growth than we expected. That\u2019s definitely true, but it\u2019s just one quarter. The key in success is thinking long term and not worrying over one quarter.\u201d</p> <p>While growth in the US is slowing, its international expansion is doing well, and though it may not have many subscribers in Syria or North Korea, it claims to be in all but one market globally. But that market is the world\u2019s largest, China, where it has faced the same political barriers as other western media and technology companies.</p> <p>\u201cThe Chinese government just closed down the Disney movie service. And they closed down Apple\u2019s movie service. Those are two pretty sophisticated, relative to China, companies. It looks like the government just doesn\u2019t want the foreign content distribution. Maybe someday in the future there\u2019ll be an opportunity for us in China, it\u2019s possible. We are continuing to work on it.\u201d</p> <p>Another growth area often mooted for Netflix is sports and news, yet Hastings is dismissive of both. \u201cEvery incremental million dollars we spend, we want to strengthen our movies and TV shows. No to sports, and no to news. We want to do better movies and TV shows.\u201d It\u2019s a tactic that has worked so far, and Hastings is banking on the world\u2019s appetite for top-notch TV being far from sated.</p>",

Perhaps not realizing what he was saying also applied to the game designers, he added: \u201cThe game is basically letting us all do the things we have been imagining for years.\u201d</p> <p> The game focuses on some core mechanics often overlooked by western developers \u2013 collecting, sorting, cataloging \u2013 allowing players to learn complex rules and mechanics driven through the discovery of a brand new world. World-building, 18 races of Pok\u00e9mon, multiple ways to evolve creatures, multiple in-game currencies and running in countries around the world.</p> <p> But to keep Pok\u00e9mon performing at solar levels, there are number of things the developers will need to focus on, including upping the person-to-person experience.</p> <p> </p> <p> At the moment, Pok\u00e9mon Go is a very single-player-focused experience. Collect, wander, leave Pok\u00e9mon in gyms, look through inventory. Games really start to leave footprints on a soul once a person-to-person experience is felt.</p> <p> Trading, sharing and battling Pok\u00e9mon between players is going to be key to the next wave of success. Complementing the discovery of Pok\u00e9mon will be in-the-moment trials and tribulations of connecting with people: in cafes, at the bar, at work, and \u2013 the game launched just in time for summer holidays and long walks \u2013 in the schoolyard.</p> <p> These more in-person connections will demand in-game communication, such as chats, likes, pokes, seeing another person\u2019s profile and person-to-person communication.</p> <p> Once there\u2019s interaction, then we\u2019ll have clans, clubs, and teams, which will lead to leaderboards, competition and collaboration.</p> <p> And as developers get better at layering objects, people and information on to the physical world, they need to build mechanics that are interesting and engaging. </p> <p> It would be similar to what happened with Foursquare. Other companies tried to replicate the social network using similar check-in ideas and brand partnerships because they thought it was a singular phenomenon.</p> <p> But it wasn\u2019t about the specific check-in. It was that Dennis Crowley of Foursquare knew the value of location-based services. Messages that connect to you when it matters \u2013 recommending where to look, suggesting where to go.</p> <p> Commercially, the scene looks ready to include some form of advertising, whether attached to Pok\u00e9stops or connected to points of interest. It is only a matter of time before we see McDonald\u2019s Gyms or Pepsi Stadiums. Generation Z may ignore these \u2013 they\u2019re already used to skipping ads and avoiding in-game promotions, and they are generally immune to display ads. But will the pausing of the Pok\u00e9mon game to watch a mini-game push these players away, or drive advertisers into new spaces?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/12/pentagon-pokemon-go-restrictions-security-concerns\">Pentagon's Pok\u00e9mon orders: game must go (outside) for security reasons</a> </p> </aside>  <p> And what if Niantic Labs makes the physical world shine brighter in the game?

  "<p>An ambitious, almost fantastical, manifestation of agricultural technology is expected to come to fruition this fall. From the remains of an abandoned steel mill in Newark, New Jersey, the creators of AeroFarms are building what they say will be the largest vertical farm, producing two million pounds of leafy greens a year. </p> <p>Whether it even qualifies as a \u201cfarm\u201d is a matter of taste. The greens will be manufactured using a technology called aeroponics, a technique in which crops are grown in vertical stacks of plant beds, without soil, sunlight or water.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/06/vegetable-garden-submarines-navy-research\">US navy researchers conduct tests to grow vegetables on submarines</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI ate some of the arugula here,\u201d said New Jersey governor Chris Christie after a recent visit to a smaller AeroFarms facility in the neighborhood. \u201cIt tastes fabulous. No dressing necessary.\u201d</p> <p>The farm, built in the economically depressed New Jersey city promises new jobs, millions of dollars in public-private investment, and an array of locally grown leafy greens for sale. The company has spent some $30m to bring to reality a new breed of \u201cgreen agriculture\u201d that seeks to produce more crops in less space while minimizing environmental damage, even if it means completely divorcing food production from the natural ecosystem.</p> <p>AeroFarms and other companies developing similar controlled growing climates claim to be transforming agriculture. Proponents of vertical farming call it the \u201cthird green revolution\u201d, analogizing the developments to Apple and Tesla. They tout the potential of such technology to address food shortages as the world population continues to grow. </p> <p>AeroFarms touts their products as free of pesticides and fertilizer, an attribute that investors think will attract customers who buy organic produce. \u201cWe definitely see the need for healthy food in the local area and Newark in particular,\u201d said Lata Reddy, vice-president for corporate social responsibility at Prudential Financial, one of the investors in the project. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0df60db9ff2a4798dcfee5b55ba1c64ba4eae4ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0df60db9ff2a4798dcfee5b55ba1c64ba4eae4ad/0_103_1440_864/1000.jpg\" alt=\"produce bowls\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Is the arugula edible? Proponents say yes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Malavika Vyawahare</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But, food that is not grown in soil may not be palatable to many, even those who are opting for organic substitutes. \u201cIf you take the soil out of the system, is it a legitimate organic system?\u201d questioned Carolyn Dimitri, director of the food studies program at New York University. The US Department of Agriculture does not consider the question of organic certification for growing methods that do not use soil, according to AeroFarms\u2019 website.</p> <p>\u201cUrban farming is trendy,\u201d Dimitri said. It remains an open question, she said, whether it will be economically viable. Prudential Financial has invested \u201cpatient capital\u201d in the venture, which is used to finance social impact projects that are unlikely to yield benefits right away. There are no aeroponics projects of this scale but AeroFarms has piloted the technology at Philip\u2019s Academy charter school in Newark, where students are served greens grown at the school.</p> <h2>Seventy times the yield of traditional farms</h2> <p>Marc Oshima, the chief marketing officer at AeroFarms, yanked open a tiny grey door in a back alley in downtown Newark that leads into an old nightclub with vividly painted walls. In 2014, AeroFarms converted the space into a research and development facility. \u201cOut there, in nature, we don\u2019t have control over sunlight, rainfall,\u201d Oshima said, \u201chere, we are giving plants what they need to thrive.\u201d</p> <p>The moist sanitized air that envelops the R&amp;D lab is missing one ingredient: the earthiness that permeates any agricultural operation. </p> <p>At the repurposed sites, AeroFarms is pushing the limits of what David Rosenberg, the company\u2019s CEO, calls \u201cprecision agriculture\u201d. The scheme ditches the romanticized ideal of farming, acres and acres of open fields dotted with men and women toiling in the sun, getting their hands dirty, in favor of enclosed urban spaces where engineers, electricians and harvesters mill about, wearing protective clothing, masks, and gloves.</p> <p>With its multicolored LED lights, computer screens lining the walls, and faithful preservation of club decor, AeroFarms\u2019 research facility could easily pass off as a sci-fi themed club. It makes a befitting setting for a company that is promising to increase crop yields by as much as 70 times compared to traditional field farms, without using any pesticides or fertilizers.</p> <p>The fine print is that the productivity is calculated using square footage occupied and not the vertical space utilized, making comparisons with ground floor-only traditional farms fraught. And critics point out that no traditional farm that size comes with a price tag of over $30m.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f7bc8b399e4eea336d2783c032dddc763ebb95fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7bc8b399e4eea336d2783c032dddc763ebb95fd/24_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"verfarm3\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The leafy greens nurtured under multicolored LED lights.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Malavika Vyawahare</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much of the funding is coming from impact investing arms of big-ticket investors like Goldman Sachs and Prudential Financial. AeroFarms has leveraged its social impact goals to attract investments, promising to create jobs in a languishing economy and supplying fresh local produce to the community in Newark.</p> <p>For New Jersey, where unemployment rates have been persistently above the national average, the promise of new jobs and fresh investment has ensured buy-in from the state. Christie, visiting the smaller aeroponics facility in March lavished praise on the \u201cpublic-private\u201d partnership.</p> <p>The New Jersey Economic Development Authority provided nearly $9m in incentives, stretched over 10 years, which includes a $2.2m grant under the Economic Redevelopment and Growth program and $6.5m in tax credits.</p> <p>AeroFarms currently employs close to 100 people, and is promising more jobs in the months to come as the company grows. Like other companies in this space, it is relying on productivity gains to offset high cost of expensive technology and emerge as a successful business.</p> <p>But even growing success isn\u2019t a sure thing, let alone profit margins.</p> <h2>\u2018More like a factory than a farm\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ef13a89b6b455fca8e0c8eef7cd7581542284d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ef13a89b6b455fca8e0c8eef7cd7581542284d3/0_120_1440_864/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A growing unit under construction in the Newark facility.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A growing unit under construction in the Newark facility.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Malavika Vyawahare</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>AeroFarms has grown over 250 types of leafy greens and sells more than 20 varieties of greens such as arugula, kale and spinach but hopes to expand their offering in the future. The scheme imposes height constraints; as of now, everything grown at vertical farms is a type of short-stemmed leafy green. And while controlled growing allows year-round production and protects these new-age farmers from the vagaries of nature, they still contend with the possibility of crops dying from human error or technological malfunction.</p> <p>Rising from the middle of what used to be a dance floor is a gargantuan growing machine about 20-feet tall. The rectangular apparatus is a stack of growing beds, each about 20-feet long. It resembles a gigantic fridge missing its outer casing, but instead of being used to store greens, they are growing inside. Inhabiting patches on the seven-tier machine, are leafy greens of all ages: seedlings, shoots and fully grown plants. Freshly minted leaves fluttering gently in an artificially conditioned breeze. </p> <p>Above each bed are columns of LED lights, bathing the plants in a sharp white glow. When plants photosynthesize they convert light of certain wavelengths into chemical energy, and store it for future use. This light does not necessarily have to come from the sun, Oshima explained.</p> <p>Under the bright lights the plants appear to be embedded in crumpled soggy blankets. The use of growing mediums other than soil is not unique to aeroponics; planting seeds in cotton has been a popular idea for many a school science project. In recent years a related technology called hydroponics, that uses water as a medium to grow plants, has caught on. But Oshima is quick to distinguish aeroponics from hydroponics emphasizing that their technology is superior. And the key to the technology, is what happens under the microfleece membrane. If peeled it would reveal bare roots enveloped by nutrient-rich mist.</p> <p>Farming in artificially created conditions is itself not an entirely novel idea. Similar techniques are used in extreme environments where growing food the traditional way is not possible, including the <a href=\"http://ceac.arizona.edu/south-pole-growing-chamber\">United States South Pole Station</a>, where researchers live in a isolated hostile conditions for months at a stretch, and the International Space Station has its own space garden deploying a growing system called <a href=\"http://spaceflight101.com/iss/veggie/\">Veggie</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f3df32f1080158de20894bb2ae9e50dfc650b3ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3df32f1080158de20894bb2ae9e50dfc650b3ef/57_0_919_687/500.jpg\" alt=\"Breaking down the process.\" width=\"500\" height=\"374\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Breaking down the process.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The rationale for using similar methods in places where land has for centuries been tilled to grow food emerged at the turn of the century in response to urbanization and population growth. The world\u2019s population will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/29/un-world-population-prospects-the-2015-revision-9-7-billion-2050-fertility\">bloat to 9.7 billion by 2050</a> and 70% of people will reside in urban areas, according to the World Health Organisation. Using large swathes of land for growing food will not be an option, supporters of vertical farming argue.</p> <p>Dickson D Despommier, a microbiology professor and a top proponent of vertical farming, sees the agricultural technology not just as a response to food crisis but also as a means of returning land that was previously used for agriculture to its natural state.</p> <p>\u201cWe are just academics, we just sit here and watch these ideas grow,\u201d Despommier said on a podcast he hosts on urban farming, marveling at the scale of the new operation. </p> <p>AeroFarms has built its sales pitch to investors around more pressing and concrete concerns like land and water shortages, meeting the demand for locally grown greens, and climate change. Growing and selling locally means emissions associated with transportation are reduced. What remains unclear is how the company accounts for emissions arising from the farm\u2019s substantial energy needs. </p> <h2>Vertical farming cropping up around the world</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6ff21f1001be91fe5a6bccfdd331c4dafbfe5e1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ff21f1001be91fe5a6bccfdd331c4dafbfe5e1b/0_74_1623_974/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The facility is still under construction on Rome Street in Newark.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The facility is still under construction on Rome Street in Newark.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Malavika Vyawahare</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the last decade a few bold schemes have built on this seminal idea, with the first commercial vertical farm set up in Singapore in 2012.

  "<p>The former Republican, marijuana-smoking, Everest mountaineering ex-governor of New Mexico and presidential nominee of the Libertarian party has a problem: he\u2019s barred from the presidential debates. To appear on stage with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump this autumn, Gary Johnson needs to boost his national polling numbers to 15% from <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson-5949.html\">around 8%</a> now. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/11/libertarian-candidate-gary-johnson-anti-trump-republicans\">Libertarian Gary Johnson: Jeb Bush and anti-Trump Republicans will vote for me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Without that national exposure, and the blockbuster ratings the three scheduled Clinton-Trump dust-ups are likely to produce, it\u2019s hard for anyone to see how Johnson, 63, or either of two other minor-party candidates, the Green party\u2019s Jill Stein or even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/republican-evan-mcmullin-presidential-run-trump\">Evan McMullin, a 40-year-old former CIA counterterrorism officer</a>, could ever become more than mere electoral curiosities.</p> <p>But the emergence of three independent candidates, during a year of record dissatisfaction with the major party candidates, may still make for an unpredictable twist to the story. Polling data suggests libertarians on both sides of the political divide are giving independent candidates a second look, and in Las Vegas on Friday, Johnson and Stein spoke before a gathering of Asian American and Pacific Islander voters to press their cases. </p> <p>Soft-spoken and wearing Nikes, Johnson presented a platform of social libertarianism, fiscal conservatism and non-interventionism in foreign affairs. He argued at the gathering that in this, \u201cthe craziest election of all time\u201d, he had a chance: \u201cI might be the next president of the United States.\u201d</p> <p>A just-released <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/polls-clinton-ahead-trump-midwest-battlegrounds-n626541\">WSJ-NBC poll </a> gave Johnson 15% in the crucial swing state of Colorado, and Stein 6%. In Las Vegas, he was asked repeatedly if a vote for him or any third-party candidate was somehow wasted. </p> <p> \u201cA wasted vote is voting for somebody you don\u2019t believe in. That\u2019s a wasted vote,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cVote for the person you believe in \u2013 that\u2019s how you bring about change. I hope after having made my pitch today that you\u2019ll realize, if you want to waste your vote on Clinton or Trump, have at it.\u201d</p> <p>Stein, who spoke separately at the event, similarly argued that many Americans were looking for an alternative to Trump and Hillary Clinton, whom she dubbed as \u201cthe most disliked and untrusted\u201d major-party nominees in US history. <br><br>\u201cDemocracy needs a moral compass,\u201d she told a gathering of Asian American and Pacific Island groups. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about who you don\u2019t like the most or who you are most afraid of.\u201d <br></p> <p>Stein, who like Johnson represented her party in 2012, has outlined policy positions that include a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d, focused on renewable energy jobs and aimed at making the United States transition to 100% renewable energy complete by 2030. Stein has also proposed a reduction in the military budget by a third and the creation of a regional food systems based on sustainable organic agriculture.<br></p> <p>On the Republican side, Evan McMullin, a beneficiary of the grounded \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement, failed to get on the ballot in 26 states before he\u2019d even sent out his first campaign release. McMullin nonetheless tried to give disaffected conservatives an alternative to the Republican nominee who, he says, has tapped into \u201cpeople\u2019s darkest prejudices and deepest fears\u201d.</p> <p>McMullin\u2019s best hope \u2013 and likely his only one \u2013 to make an electoral dent would require Trump\u2019s departure from the race, though the nominee has made no overt sign that he wants to quit. \u201cLike millions of Americans, I had hoped this year would bring us better nominees who, despite party differences, could offer compelling visions of a better future,\u201d McMullin said in his announcement. </p> <p>\u201cInstead, we have been left with two candidates who are fundamentally unfit for the profound responsibilities they seek.\u201d</p> <p>But can they begin to make a difference? Only once in recent election cycles have third party candidates had any significant influence, when in 1992, Texan businessman Ross Perot took <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/04/us/1992-elections-president-overview-clinton-captures-presidency-with-huge.html?pagewanted=all\">18% of the vote</a>, carving into the support for incumbent Republican George HW Bush and helping Arkansas governor Bill Clinton to victory. Some Democrats blamed third-party candidate Ralph Nader for delivering George W Bush the election in 2000, but the third-party candidate <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2000\">won a paltry 2.74%</a> of the vote, and his supporters were <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-states-that-love-and-hate-third-party-candidates/\">split</a> between Republicans and Democrats.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s running mate, former Massachusetts governor William Weld, said he\u2019d seen interest and fundraising pick up as Trump\u2019s campaign has floundered. Their campaign recently reported a $1m one-week fundraising haul and has reported that more than 40,000 people have pledged to donate at least $15 to his campaign on 15 August.</p> <p>But that was in a relatively tight race. With Clinton now leading Trump by double digits in some key battleground states, the impact of any third-party candidate could be limited. </p> <p>\u201cAt the moment it doesn\u2019t look like they can have much impact at all,\u201d said Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran Democratic adviser. \u201cBut if the race gets closer, they could throw it either way.\u201d</p> <p>Sheinkopf reasoned that this election has become more about personalities and less about what party leaders want. The long-term impact may be a significant shift in how people view Democrats and Republicans, he said. As it now stands, Stein, Johnson and McMullin could act as a convenient parking spot for voters disgusted with both candidates.</p> <p>Earlier this month, a federal judge rejected a challenge brought by Johnson and Stein arguing that the bar for inclusion is set artificially high. Yet there are signs the ground could be shifting. Mike McCurry, now co-chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates and a former press secretary for Bill Clinton, hinted that a third podium might be needed.</p> <p>\u201cSome of our production people may have said, \u2018Just in case, you need to plan out what that might look like,\u2019\u2019 McCurry <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/debates-clinton-trump-johnson-stein-226806\">told Politico</a>. \u201cWe won\u2019t know the number of invitations we extend until mid-September.\u201d</p> <p>Ron Faucheux, president of Clarus Research Group, a nonpartisan polling company, said there was broad support for including even minor candidates. \u201cPolls show that voters think third party candidates should be included,\u201d he said, \u201cand in an election like this, where polls show a majority of voters dislike both main party candidates, there is a good reason to give them the opportunity to at least look at other options.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/green-party-convention-jill-stein-bernie-or-bust-clinton\">'The only other option': Bernie Sanders backers turn to Green party's Jill Stein</a> </p> </aside>  <p> But even Johnson and Stein were somewhat wistful about their prospects, casting themselves as agents of change who, at best, could represent the beginning of a break with the current two-party system.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest message is \u2018consider us\u2019 as a very, very viable alternative to this two-party system that has become so polarized that they\u2019re not able to do anything,\u201d Johnson has said. </p> <p>Stein advanced a similar argument. \u201cWe\u2019re having a political reorganization in this election because the Republicans are kind of falling apart,\u201d she said, \u201cand the Democrats have kind of split with a lot of the Bernie Sanders supporters just not happy with the alternative.\u201d </p> <p>She argued that it was by elections about \u201cthe lesser of two evils\u201d that the country inherited many of its problems. </p> <p>But first, the two have to get on TV. </p> <p> </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to win the presidency if I\u2019m not in the presidential debates,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI do believe anything is possible given that right now, arguably the two most polarizing figures in American politics today are running for office.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>We\u2019ve had all the surveys. There have been forecasts and predictions by the score. Every thinktank, every City analyst, every international body has a view about whether the UK economy is going to drop into recession following the EU referendum on 23 June. Some of them have sophisticated models of the economy to help them, but the truth is nobody really knows.</p> <p> This week will see the first piece of hard evidence of how the economy has fared in the period after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> vote. Thursday\u2019s retail sales report from the Office for National Statistics will show what happened to spending in the shops and online in July.</p> <p>The ONS data is eagerly awaited because the survey evidence has been so mixed. Reports from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/27/cbi-blames-post-brexit-caution-for-slump-in-high-street-spending\">CBI </a>and the polling company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/29/uk-sees-biggest-fall-in-consumer-confidence-for-26-years-after-brexit-vote\">GfK </a>have been downbeat, but those from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/09/uk-retail-sales-rebound-july-heavy-discounts\">British Retail Consortium (BRC)</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/10/uk-businesses-expect-brexit-vote-to-weaken-investment-and-hiring-bank-finds\">Bank of England\u2019s regional agents </a>have been more positive. Interestingly, both the BRC and Threadneedle Street found that consumer behaviour seemed more affected by the weather than it was by the referendum.</p> <p>If the UK is to steer clear of recession over the coming months, it is important for the tills to keep jangling in the high street. In part, that\u2019s because consumer spending accounts for around two-thirds of national output. But it is also because one of the other big components of GDP \u2013 investment \u2013 is likely to be weak. By and large, businesses were in favour of remaining in the EU and it may take them some time to get over the shock of the result. The report from the Bank\u2019s agents suggested that investment over the next year will now be lower than it would have been, although not dramatically so.</p> <p>Companies will only consider investing if they think demand is going to be strong enough to warrant extra spending on buildings, plant, machinery and training. For those that export, the fall in the value of the pound should help, but the strength of consumer spending will be crucial for those that cater for the domestic UK market.</p> <p>There are umpteen factors that affect consumer behaviour, but the two big ones are the state of the labour market and spending power once the mortgage or rent has been paid. Put simply, people will spend less if they think they are about to lose their jobs or if the value of their wages and salaries is being eroded by higher prices or the rising cost of housing. The recession of the 1990s was caused by a combination of these two effects: a doubling of interest rates to 15% led to much higher unemployment and a sharp reduction in disposable income. Consumer spending fell off a cliff.</p> <p>The recession of 2008 to 2009 was different from those of the early 1980s or early 1990s. In those episodes, interest rates were raised aggressively to combat rising inflation. Last time round, the trouble was not excess consumer demand, it was a crisis in the financial sector, which led to a global credit crunch.</p> <p>In terms of the hit to national output, the last recession was more severe than those of the early 1980s and early 1990s. As such, it was reasonable to assume that unemployment would rise even more sharply than it during those previous downturns. <br></p> <p>But it didn\u2019t. The labour market felt the strain, but the effects came through in different ways: through under-employment, an increase in self-employment and a sharp drop in productivity growth. People were prepared to accept pay cuts or freezes in order to hold on to their jobs. This was far from an ideal outcome, but better than mass unemployment. The problems that those parts of the UK that suffered de-industrialisation in the 1980s still faced is proof of how joblessness leaves deep and permanent scars. <br></p> <p>The labour market looked pretty healthy before the referendum. In the three months ending in May, unemployment was at its lowest level since 2005, a year when the economy was booming ahead of the financial crisis. </p> <p>The percentage of the population in work has not been higher since modern records began in 1971, but wage growth has remained stubbornly weak. Average earnings are rising at just over 2%, well down on the levels seen in the years leading up to the financial crisis. One explanation is that there is more slack in the labour market than the official figures suggest. Another is that the dice are loaded in favour of employers in pay negotiations, and that the part of the economy where trade unions have a significant presence \u2013 the public sector \u2013 has borne the brunt of austerity.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/\">Resolution Foundation</a> provides a third explanation in its latest earnings outlook. Researcher Laura Gardiner says earnings growth for those people who stayed in the same job fell from 4% to 2% between 2008 and 2010 and has never recovered. By contrast, the average pay rise for those who change jobs has risen steadily since the economy started to recover and stood at 7.5% in 2015. </p> <p>Gardiner says that previous experience would have led her to expect a \u201cknock-on effect on pay settlements for the \u2018static\u2019 workforce, via mechanisms such as firms experiencing resignations raising the pay of those who remain for fear of losing them too.\u201d</p> <p>There has, though, been little sign of such effects. Gardiner speculates that the reason could be that job mobility is still below its peak, that firms don\u2019t think the stayers need higher pay awards to command their continued loyalty, or that the stayers crave job security in what seems like a tentative recovery.</p> <p>Brexit, she says, may further delay any take off in wage growth, and that seems a reasonable assumption. Even if unemployment holds steady at its current levels, it is hard to envisage average earnings rising at much more than their current level.</p> <p>This won\u2019t matter much in the short term, because with inflation so low spending power is increasing. The Bank of England\u2019s decision to cut interest rates \u2013 and, just as importantly, signal that they will stay low for a prolonged period \u2013 means that households have the reassurance that the cost of housing is not going to shoot up.</p> <p>The fall in the pound will lead to dearer imports and higher inflation. That will eat into real income growth and is likely to lead to slower consumer spending growth. The process, however, will probably not be immediate and it probably won\u2019t be as dramatic as some fear. Policy stimulus and a willingness to accept low pay awards will support employment, but productivity and living standards will be squeezed. Life for most people will go on in much the same way as it has ever since the financial crisis.</p>",

But it isn\u2019t, obviously, for reasons that are as literally legal as they are figuratively criminal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d7a40e8f7968b399ccb637b81f2a87f7b7a9819\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d7a40e8f7968b399ccb637b81f2a87f7b7a9819/0_0_1344_1539/873.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by David Foldvari of a tree growing over a headstone.\" width=\"873\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by David Foldvari.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: David Foldvari</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>2) Of the late duke\u2019s approximately \u00a39bn, approximately \u00a30bn goes to his three daughters.</p> <p>3) Of the late duke\u2019s approximately \u00a39bn, approximately \u00a39bn, and the titles of Duke of Westminster, Marquess of Westminster and Viscount Belgrave, go to his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/10/new-duke-of-westminster-hugh-grosvenor-inherit-fortune\" title=\"\">third child and only son, Hugh</a> (25).</p> <p>A lot of people don\u2019t like inheritance tax. It feels like stealing from the dead. It isn\u2019t, but it feels like it. The reasoning goes: I worked hard for my money, I paid tax on it when I earned it (not all of the above quite applies to the late duke), so why shouldn\u2019t I be able to leave it all to my children? Why should the taxman&#xa0;get&#xa0;any?</p> <p>The answer is that, in order to pay for public services, the government should take money out of the economy where it\u2019ll be least missed, where its absence is least likely to plunge people into poverty or reduce consumer spending. The money of the dead is therefore ripe for taxation: the owner no longer needs it, and his or her heirs have been doing OK without it up to now. Inheritance tax doesn\u2019t discourage earning, it discourages dying, which I think we can all get behind.</p> <p>But I understand why many people balk at that tax. I find it harder to understand where the late duke is concerned. What if \u00a33.6bn were paid in tax? That would still leave unimaginable wealth for the next generation. Even at the same rate of tax, their children would also be stratospherically well off. The financial wellbeing of his family would be assured as far into the future as he could meaningfully look. Meanwhile, his country would benefit from a significant windfall that would help millions today. That\u2019s just not the same as bereaved kids having to sell the house they grew up in to meet a tax demand.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk\">Sign up to the Guardian's daily email</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The late duke doesn\u2019t strike me as greedy. \u201cGiven the choice I would rather not have been born wealthy, but I never think of giving it up. I can\u2019t sell it. It doesn\u2019t belong to me,\u201d he once said. And I believe him. This was not a Philip Green figure, cavorting on a yacht. He was a quiet man, obsessed with the Territorial Army and duty. But what duty? A duty to humanity, a duty to those he loved? No, a duty to the longevity of the Grosvenor family\u2019s prominence.</p> <p>So he denied both his country and his daughters significant portions of his wealth, just to keep it all together, to increase its chances of lasting, like one big ice cube instead of several smaller ones \u2013 to maximise the length of time for which people of his name will still be rich, even though they are as distant strangers to him as his ancestor, the original \u201cGros Veneur\u201d (fat huntsman), who came over with William the Conqueror.</p> <p>Those remote, theoretical Grosvenors with whom he\u2019ll share a fleck of DNA mattered more to him than his own daughters, never mind the patients of the NHS. That\u2019s not insincere and it\u2019s not selfish. But it is&#xa0;bonkers.</p>",
  "<p>The pounding of the heart echoes throughout Margaret Atwood\u2019s engrossing 56th book, beating in fear that it will soon beat no more. Charmaine and her husband, Stan, live in their cramped car, having lost their home and jobs in a financial collapse that has turned the north-east of the US into \u201ca festering scrapheap\u201d.</p> <p>Survival is all for our protagonists. People have been reduced to selling their bodies, souls, even their blood. Dystopias have been brilliantly evoked by Atwood, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/20/handmaids-tale-margaret-atwood\"><em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em></a> to the MaddAddam trilogy, and her latest pulses with profound questions: what lengths would you go to survive? What compromises would you make? What would make someone kill the thing they most love?</p> <p>One day, Charmaine sees an advert for the Positron Project, promising she \u201ccan be the person she\u2019s always wanted to be\u201d. Having barely read the terms and conditions, the couple sign the binding \u201ccommitment papers\u201d and relocate to the town of Consilience, \u201cbecause Charmaine has her heart set on it\u201d. Here is a story showing what desperation does to the human heart.</p> <p>Prohibitions abound here. Everyone must live two lives: one month they have a home and job but the next they must live in a prison, swapping with their \u201cAlternates\u201d. Although there is a \u201cstrict Consilience taboo against contact with Alternates\u201d, Charmaine and Stan cannot help imagining alternative lives with alternative partners and are so tantalised by the possibilities that they pursue them to devastating effect.</p> <p>In the tightly controlled environment (where \u201cthey censor anything too arousing or disruptive\u201d, including rock music and hip-hop), characters nevertheless lose control, governed by their \u201ctormented desires\u201d.</p> <p>The increasingly bizarre plot takes in subterfuge, sex slaves, human organ trafficking and identity erasure. But it is the details that are most emotionally engaging, as characters cling on to their last vestiges of humanity: the moment, on realising the truth, when \u201cCharmaine\u2019s heart sinks\u201d; the moment her husband\u2019s \u201cheart beats like percussion under her fingertips\u201d; the moment a serial adulterer assures his wife \u201che\u2019s loyal to her in his heart\u201d.</p> <p>This visceral study of desperation and desire journeys into the dark heart of greed, exploitation and brutality, as it portrays a project that is \u201can infringement of individual liberties, an attempt at total social control, an insult to the human spirit\u201d. It is filled with passages of great intellectual and emotional acuity, appealing both to the head and to the heart.</p> <p><em> The Heart Goes Last is published by Virago (\u00a38.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/heart-goes-last.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\"><em>Click here to a copy for \u00a37.37 </em></a></p>",

  "<p>When Kate Mara was 19 she skipped college \u2013 a place at the highly respected <a href=\"http://tisch.nyu.edu/\">Tisch School of Performing Arts</a> at New York University \u2013 and bought a dog, Bruno, a Boston Terrier with one blue eye. \u201cI knew I would need the company,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause where I was going, I knew literally no one.\u201d</p> <p>Rather than remain at home with her big Irish family in New York, she was headed to Los Angeles to be a star. Fourteen years later, we\u2019re at the Broome Street General Store, a small coffee shop in Silverlake, to talk about her latest movie. But Mara\u2019s is not a sentimental story \u2013 it\u2019s about ambition. She was a painfully shy girl who loathed school and couldn\u2019t bear the thought of college. \u201cI look back and think, wow, that\u2019s how ambitious I was,\u201d she says. \u201cI was prepared to go through all that. But I\u2019m glad I did. It was worth it.\u201d</p> <p>Today, Mara and her arguably better-known actor sister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/rooney-mara\">Rooney</a> are arm in arm on red carpets, A-listers both. But it was Kate, 33, the elder by two years, who first made the leap. Today, wearing a red sundress, she directs me to a shaded table outside. \u201cI\u2019m Irish,\u201d she says. \u201cI burn.\u201d She doesn\u2019t seem the carefree, sundress type \u2013 there\u2019s a steeliness to her; precise and clear, with an almost clinical intelligence behind the eyes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWlJqsF_WVw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rWlJqsF_WVw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Ice queen: Kate Mara in her latest film, Morgan.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>As Zoe Barnes in <em>House of Cards</em>, she shone as the ruthlessly ambitious political reporter who stops at nothing until Kevin Spacey shoves her in front of a train. This part has made her a global name. \u201cI was just in London,\u201d she explains, \u201cand every time I took the tube, people would stare.\u201d In last year\u2019s Oscar contender <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/04/the-martian-review-matt-damon-shines-stranded-astronaut\"><em>The Martian</em></a>, she was a computer expert in a crew of astronauts, a nerd among nerds. In <em>Morgan</em>, her latest project, she is excellently cast as Lee Weathers, an icy executive \u201cfrom corporate\u201d who has been sent to shut down an AI research project that has gone awry. The android (Morgan) has turned violent, and while the scientists who raised \u201cher\u201d (Toby Jones and Rose Leslie) insist that she ought to be given another chance, their heartfelt appeals bounce uselessly off Mara\u2019s pinstriped trouser suit and heels. She\u2019s so tough that, though it seems improbable at first, the petite Mara spends the last third of the movie in a series of brutal fight scenes, getting hurled through windows and suchlike.</p> <p>\u201cI got a lot of bruises,\u201d she grins. \u201cBut it was fun. I think when you have a tense movie like this, and you spend all day in a dark house in life-and-death scenarios, you become delirious. We\u2019d be crying with laughter at the most stupid things.\u201d</p> <p>In person, Mara is a good deal warmer than Weathers. When she learns that I, too, have a Boston Terrier, she coos over photos of the dog on my phone. She\u2019s not a reclusive celebrity. They know her here at the general store; regulars come up to say hello, and she\u2019s often seen walking her dogs with her boyfriend, the British actor Jamie Bell. \u201cIt\u2019s really therapeutic,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"576f59ee2859c588672a6921de94cf403795f8ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/576f59ee2859c588672a6921de94cf403795f8ed/0_86_1392_835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young at heart: in Brokeback Mountain (2005).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Young at heart: in Brokeback Mountain (2005).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Focus/Everett/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It wasn\u2019t fame that propelled Mara, unlike Bell, to a life of privilege \u2013 she was born that way. Her father and his siblings own the New York Giants (estimated worth $2.1bn), and her mother\u2019s side of the family owns the Pittsburgh Steelers (estimated worth $1bn). With sister Rooney she is one of four siblings who enjoyed an idyllic upbringing of football and church and huge family gatherings \u2013 her father is one of 11, and there are 22 aunts and uncles in all. She tells me they grew up about an hour north of New York city, in a suburb called Bedford \u2013 not to be confused with Bedford-Stuyvesant, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jun/18/michael-lavines-best-photograph-biggie-smalls-notorious-big\">Biggie Smalls</a> grew up. \u201cHaha! No, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/martha-stewart\">Martha Stewart </a>lives in Bedford. It\u2019s a bit different,\u201d she says. \u201cMind you, she went to prison too\u2026\u201d Her greatest challenge growing up was remembering the name of the new baby at Thanksgiving. \u201cThere\u2019s always a new baby in our family.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you have a tense movie like Morgan, you become delirious, crying with laughter at stupid things</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When they were young, their mother would regularly take her two daughters to Broadway shows and the movies. At nine years old, Mara decided she would act. \u201cRooney was different,\u201d she explains. \u201cShe explored other interests. Also, she was much better at school than me.\u201d</p> <p>She was successful even as a 14-year-old, with a bit part on <em>Law &amp; Order</em>, one of the tried-and-tested stepping stones for an emerging actor. But she says she learned a valuable lesson as a teenager: that if one door closes, maybe it was meant to be, because another will surely open. \u201cI was up for a part in <em>The Sound of Music</em> on Broadway, and I was completely devastated when I didn\u2019t get it. It was like someone died. And my mum said, \u2018It\u2019s happening for a reason, just wait.\u2019 And soon afterwards I got this part in <em>Random Hearts</em>, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/27/obituaries\">Sydney Pollack</a> movie, which was incredible.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4a4f639d079d92f27145d85ba2446d9cbe24f12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4a4f639d079d92f27145d85ba2446d9cbe24f12/58_179_3619_2172/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Picture this: In 127 Hours with James Franco and Amber Tamblyn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Picture this: In 127 Hours with James Franco and Amber Tamblyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: C.Fox Search/Everett/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It stood her in good stead when she moved to LA with Bruno. Her fortunes turned slowly but surely \u2013 when she was 22 she got <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/brokeback-mountain\"><em>Brokeback Mountain</em></a>, playing Heath Ledger\u2019s daughter, a role that changed the course of her career. \u201cAt the audition, I didn\u2019t understand what a big deal it was to read for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/anglee\">Ang [Lee</a>, the director], so there was less pressure,\u201d she remembers. \u201cBut he was so gentle and quiet, it felt like he was rooting for me.\u201d She likens Lee to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/david-fincher\">David Fincher</a>, whom she worked with on <em>House of Cards</em>. \u201cThey\u2019re both very specific directors. Like, don\u2019t blink so much, don\u2019t raise your eyebrows\u2026 I crave that now, but making <em>Brokeback Mountain</em>, I didn\u2019t understand. I just thought I was doing a terrible job and I was going to be fired!\u201d</p> <p>Doors started to open. Movies like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/mar/10/dvd-review-transsiberian\"><em>Transsiberian</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/28/127-hours-danny-boyle-review\"><em>127 Hours</em></a> got her name ever closer to the poster, and then <em>House of Cards </em>changed everything. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/fantastic-four\"><em>Fantastic Four</em></a>, where she met Bell, followed but wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing \u2013 widely panned, it garnered just 9% of positivity on <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/\">rottentomatoes.com</a>, a hub of movie criticism.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the career of the other Mara \u2013 Rooney \u2013 was soaring. Twice nominated for an Oscar, she may have entered the business long after Kate, but she has arguably surpassed her in many ways. The rivalry narrative doesn\u2019t wash. \u201cI know conflict is more interesting,\u201d says Mara, \u201cbut honestly, I just feel so grateful that we\u2019re both living our dreams successfully and to be able to share that with someone you grew up with \u2013 it\u2019s really special.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1be9dda8d0caaddb337ea04c51875c74cadcc8df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1be9dda8d0caaddb337ea04c51875c74cadcc8df/84_105_1747_1048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sister act: Kate, left, with her sister and fellow actor, Rooney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sister act: Kate, left, with her sister and fellow actor, Rooney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pace/BEI/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So they\u2019ve never been up for the same job?

  "<p>It\u2019s like something out of the 1980s futuristic cartoon show The Jetsons: floating commuter pods are propelled through low-pressure tubes at 760mph, faster than an average 747 jetliner.</p> <p>This is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/11/hyperloop-supersonic-train-test-propulsion-system\">Hyperloop</a>, a super-fast transportation system that promises to be better and cheaper than high-speed rail. The Hyperloop is the brainchild of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who proposed the concept <a href=\"http://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/hyperloop_alpha-20130812.pdf\">in a white paper</a> back in 2013. Musk envisioned a train that would allow people to travel between Los Angeles and San Francisco \u2013 a journey that currently takes around six hours by car - in about 30 minutes.</p> <p>Musk only introduced the idea; he\u2019s leaving it up to <a href=\"http://www.spacex.com/hyperloop\">other companies</a> to try to develop it. An LA-based firm called Hyperloop One secured $80m in May to proceed to the next phase of its development, which includes testing on a patch of remote desert in northern Nevada.

It\u2019s meant to marry the privacy of a car with the efficiency of mass transit. Although the idea has been around since the 1950s, only five systems have successfully been implemented worldwide, <a href=\"http://transweb.sjsu.edu/PDFs/research/1227-automated-transit-networks.pdf\">according to a 2014 study</a> from think tank Mineta Transportation Institute. </p> <p>Just one exists in the US, in Morgantown at West Virginia University, which launched in 1975. The other four - at Heathrow Airport in London, Rotterdam in The Netherlands, Masdar City in Abu Dhabi and Suncheon Bay in South Korea - all opened within the last decade or so, but that\u2019s still \u201cnot enough to claim that there is an active market sufficient to support an industry,\u201d wrote the authors of the report. </p> <p>A big barrier is the cost to implement such a project. The study estimates that cities would need to cough up between $10m and $20m per mile to put in place a medium capacity system, and there are also only a few \u201ccredible\u201d companies, says the report, who can deliver a personal rapid transit project within a couple of years. </p> <p>It is this type of flashy futuristic idea that requires millions of dollars and huge new infrastructure that we should be wary of, says Robert Puentes, director of the Eno Center for Transportation, a Washington DC-based think tank.</p> <p>\u201cThe focus right now in the US should be on making sure the existing system is performing as well as it can, and that it\u2019s as safe as it can be,\u201d he says. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/12/hyperloop-or-over-hyped-latest-demo-does-little-to-ease-doubts\">Hyperloop or over-hyped?

The internet and the sharing economy for example is seeing companies like Uber and Car2go fundamentally change how people travel, leading to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/23/car-sharing-helps-environment-pollution\">drop in private car ownership</a> and <a href=\"http://www.apta.com/mediacenter/pressreleases/2016/Pages/160315_Shared-Use-Mobility.aspx\">an increase in public transit use</a>. People are right to get excited by these developments and other ones that keep existing systems, ie our roads, running in a more efficient and cost effective way, says Puentes. </p> <p>Expanding a city\u2019s bus services isn\u2019t exactly headline-grabbing, but it\u2019s an example of the type of sensible transportation initiatives that should be getting more attention, he says. For instance, the city of Houston, in Texas, <a href=\"http://www.citylab.com/commute/2016/04/how-houstons-bus-network-got-its-groove-back/476784/\">recently improved its decades-old bus system</a> simply by adding more hours and additional days to several key bus lines.</p> <p>The goal was to make better use of the city\u2019s existing fleet of 1,200 buses without raising operating costs. The initiative, launched in August 2015, <a href=\"https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/houston-change-entire-bus-system-overnight\">cost just $10m</a> of an annual $300m budget. So far, the project seems to be working. Weekly bus and rail ridership <a href=\"https://twitter.com/christofspieler/status/684377993448394752\">went up by nearly 10%</a> in the months following the increased service.</p> <p>\u201cThey focused around the redesign of old technology, and it has fundamentally changed how people in the city travel, and it\u2019s been very well received,\u201d says Puentes.</p>",
  "<h2>Jon Bennie: \u2018There\u2019s a fascination with the hidden world which is much less well studied\u2019</h2> <p><em>Jon Bennie is an associate research fellow at the University of Exeter where he is working on a project to access the ecological effects of night-time light pollution on different plants and animals.</em></p> <p><strong>Could you tell me about what you study?</strong><br>I\u2019ve been working for the last five years on the <a href=\"http://www.exeter.ac.uk/cornwall/news/2014/title_417435_en.html\" title=\"\">Ecolight Project</a>, which is funded by the European Research Council. We started off really trying to look at artificial light and light pollution as a concern for astronomy and for the aesthetic enjoyment of stars, but now we\u2019re trying to find out about the ecological effects on plants and animals and the environment. It\u2019s being driven by the growing awareness of the extent of the problem. In Europe, 60% of&#xa0;people can\u2019t see the Milky Way and 88% of Europe experiences light-polluted skies.</p> <p>Light is critical to all forms of life \u2013 every plant and animal gets information from natural light cycles. Daily cycles control circadian clocks. There are bimonthly lunar cycles \u2013 a lot of animals have a different physiological response to a new moon and a full moon \u2013 and different seasons. Bud-burst in trees in spring and songbird breeding rely on consistent natural light signals which give information about time and location. Dung beetles can orientate by the Milky Way. If it is obscured over large areas, what does that mean for the animals that use it to navigate?</p> <p><strong>Why are you studying it?</strong><br>Humans are active during the day, but that\u2019s pretty unusual for animals; around 70% of mammals are nocturnal. We\u2019ve got 2,000-3,000 moth and butterfly species in the UK but only 60 are active during the day. We tend to think of things in a day-active bubble, but so many interesting processes and interactions happen at night. As we envelop ourselves in this luminous fog at night-time, trying to make the night more like the day, there are implications for a whole range of&#xa0;species. There are two aspects: the direct impact on wildlife in our towns and cities, and then the wider countryside which is affected by sky glow and the effect of fragmentation. We wanted to find out about this.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Seeing the difference in moth activity or owls\u2019 hunting patterns between a new and full moon is amazing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>What have been your most important findings so far?</strong><br>The difficulty is trying to pin down the effects of sky glow. We know indirect illumination has effects on both plants and animals, and there is an increasing amount of research being done in this area, but there still aren\u2019t many case studies. We found that predatory ground beetles, spiders and some bat species (pipistrelles) group around streetlights, because they use the artificial illumination to gain an advantage while hunting their prey. We\u2019ve been looking at whether effects can<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/10/sea-otters-global-warming-trophic-cascades-food-chain-kelp\" title=\"\"> cascade up and down food webs</a>. We found a direct effect of low-intensity light on the flowering of a few plants, which in turn reduced aphid numbers, showing that the light-based effects on one species can cascade to the species that feed on them, and we expect they will be able to cascade further than this.</p> <p>The challenge here is finding out at what level of the ecosystem these effects are occurring. We know that if we illuminate an ecosystem it changes, but every time we do an experiment we find a new response that we\u2019ve never thought of before. We\u2019ve been running this experiment for four years and even in the simple systems, unpicking the pathways is difficult.</p> <p><strong>What drew you to studying at night?</strong><br>I started off as an ecologist looking at plants and plant-and-insect interactions. Like most ecologists, I was out doing fieldwork during the day but it suddenly occurred to me that the majority of stuff is going on at dawn and dusk and during the night. There are challenges with studying things at night, but there\u2019s that fascination with the hidden world which is much less well studied. Most of the places people go to watch wildlife, such as African plains, are unusual places, with a lot of animal activity during the day.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s challenging about working at night?</strong><br>If you want to study what things are doing in the darkness, you have to do it in the dark and that causes problems with simple things like writing notes, running equipment, that sort of thing. There are other issues with doing fieldwork in more urban areas; I\u2019ve had the police come along and ask me what I\u2019m doing a couple of times!</p> <p>We\u2019re dismantling one of our experiments that has been running for five years now, which was more controlled, with net cages. We\u2019re getting the last of the data from that at the moment. Our current study has been going for four years now and we haven\u2019t got any plans to stop at the moment. It sort of depends on whether we\u2019ve got the funding and people. We need a team to conduct the fieldwork and maintenance. We\u2019ve had three of us working full-time on the project, a technician and two researchers, but it can be difficult to get people to work on the project early in the morning and late at night.</p> <p><strong>Is it difficult to stay mentally alert at night, or does the quietness encourage contemplation?</strong><br>I think the stillness really helps me think, but more late at night than if I\u2019ve got up before dusk. I\u2019m more of a night owl than a morning person, so I struggle with the mornings sometimes.</p> <p><strong>Working at night, do you ever feel spooked or lonely?</strong><br>Yeah, absolutely. I think that\u2019s part of the fun of it. I grew up in Devon where I did a lot of camping and walking, and walking back from the pub in the pitch darkness without streetlights, so I\u2019m pretty used to being on my own in the dark. Still, you hear strange noises sometimes and you get spooked. I do feel safer out there in real darkness though, rather than in a lit town. I once had a run-in with a couple of angry badgers in the middle of the night. I was walking along and two of them exploded out of the vegetation near me. It certainly gave me a shock.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/02/academics-brexit-research-peat-fears-eu-funds\">Academics feel blight of Brexit \u2013 from cancer research to peat projects</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Most people are asleep while you\u2019re working. What are we missing out on?</strong><br>Things like the quality of light in the mornings, the stillness. It\u2019s beautiful to hear the dawn chorus out in the open. The amount of wildlife activity that happens during the night is incredible \u2013 bats, owls, badgers, all the nocturnal species. Seeing the difference in moth activity or owls\u2019 hunting patterns between a new and full moon is amazing. You feel like you\u2019re more in tune with nature and can look up at the night sky without all the light pollution near populated areas.</p> <p><strong>What is the end goal of this entire project?</strong><br>We want to be able to find out about the effects of artificial light on species so that we can inform governments about how to lower the impacts of our lighting. Currently, lots of white LEDs are being used for street lighting, but they are actually blue LEDs with a white phosphor coating. This blue light affects a lot of wildlife much more than other types. We really hope to provide an evidence base which supports keeping important ecological areas unlit.</p> <p>The main steps that can be taken are split into four groups: reducing the number of areas that are lit; in those which are lit, reduce the duration of lighting; change the type of light being produced so that it has the lowest ecological effect; change the design of lights (eg shielding them so that they only light a very specific area) to make them more friendly to local species.</p> <p><strong>What could people do with their own outdoor lighting to reduce their effect on local species?</strong><br>People could make shields for their current lights, or buy lights that come with a shield attached. These angle the light downwards to a specific area, preventing it from spreading over foliage and therefore reducing the chance that it will impact creatures near your house.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4942f742e122a73e3044ef810675f28a0110993\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4942f742e122a73e3044ef810675f28a0110993/0_0_4368_2912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caroline Horton in her DrEAMSLab.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Old memories tend to crop up more often\u2019: Caroline Horton in her DrEAMSLab.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Caroline Horton: \u2018The only problem is that sometimes people start dreaming about the lab\u2019</h2> <p><em>Caroline Horton is a senior psychology lecturer at </em><a href=\"http://www.bishopg.ac.uk/staff/Pages/caroline-horton.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>Bishop Grosseteste University</em></a><em> in Lincoln. Her research concerns sleep, dreaming and memory, with a special focus on how dreaming consolidates memories from our waking lives. She has set up a dedicated laboratory for studying dreams, called </em><a href=\"http://www.dreamslab.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>DrEAMSLab</em></a><em> (Dreams, Emotions, Associations and Memories in Sleep Laboratory), which launched in February 2016.</em></p> <p><strong>What are you studying?</strong><br>I\u2019m interested in how dreams improve memory. A lot of organising and reshaping happens when we\u2019re asleep. Dreams help consolidate memories by sifting through what happened that day, deciding what we can forget and starting to set things we need to remember into long-term brain structures. Everybody has dreams, whether you remember them or not, so as a psychologist they are fascinating.</p> <p><strong>How do you gather your research?</strong><br>Most of our studies take place in people\u2019s homes. In a recent study, we gave the subjects a Dictaphone and a programmed alarm clock, and asked them to record their dreams at four different points over two nights, to see how dreams changed through the night. But this year we\u2019ve launched the DrEAMSLab, where we can use electrodes to monitor people as they sleep. It\u2019s a small, cosy bedroom with blackout blinds and a computer, as some of our experiments involve asking people to learn something before they go to sleep. The only problem so far is people sometimes start dreaming about the lab, while the home is a more natural environment to collect data in.</p> <p><strong>Why are some dreams so strange?</strong><br>It\u2019s a common misconception that you only dream during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In fact, you dream all the time. Sleep is deeper in the first four hours of the night, and dreams in that period are shorter, and more mundane \u2013 you might dream about being at work, for instance. These dreams are reactivating memories from the previous day to see which ones need to be consolidated. During REM sleep, your brain is very active, so dreams become more complex and story-like. They can be bizarre because new memories are put into different contexts, to make them more memorable. Old memories tend to crop up more often \u2013 for example, you might dream about someone you saw on TV that night speaking in an office conference room you used three years ago. And because your brain is almost awake during REM sleep, those dreams are easier to remember.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As a scientist, it can be tricky explaining our work, as people still associate dreaming with subjective art forms</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Why do we have nightmares?</strong><br>People often dream of emotionally intense experiences from waking life, both positive and negative, because they\u2019re important to remember. Sometimes, our brain runs through potentially scary or dangerous situations, so we are better equipped to cope if they happen in real life \u2013 like dreaming about the gear stick jamming when you\u2019re driving, for instance. It\u2019s also about using our past experience to help us in the future. Before exams, people have a lot of dreams about feeling unprepared. And if you wake up feeling unprepared, you\u2019re more likely to get your head in the books.</p> <p><strong>Why do old places or people from childhood crop up in dreams?</strong><br>You\u2019re more likely to dream of life events that happened in your late teens and early 20s, as at that age you\u2019re experiencing a lot of new things \u2013 moving away from home for the first time, or your first relationship. You\u2019re at peak memory health when these are happening, and they can be emotional, so they\u2019re the strongest memories in the system and appear in dreams throughout your adult life, often combined with new memories. Don\u2019t worry, it probably doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re still pining after your first love!</p> <p><strong>Is everything we dream related to memory?</strong><br>The more often you record your dreams, the better you get at identifying which memory each fragment is from. I\u2019ve been recording my own dreams for years and have become very good at it. But some things do come up that seem totally random. If you\u2019re a creative person, like an artist, you\u2019re more likely to have more creative, fanciful dreams, while individuals who experience psychosis have much more disassociated, bizarre dreams.</p> <p><strong>Can we interpret our dreams?</strong><br>We usually dream of things from our everyday lives, and each dream is personal and unique to the dreamer. So I wouldn\u2019t advocate a \u201cdream language\u201d. As a scientist studying dreams, it can sometimes be tricky explaining our work, as people still associate dreaming with subjective, therapeutic art forms. Sometimes the answer is simple \u2013 people who dream about losing teeth a lot are probably just grinding their teeth while they\u2019re asleep. </p> <p><strong>Does cheese give you weird dreams?</strong><br>Yes, we think so. This could be because cheese is very salty and so can make you wake up earlier because you\u2019re thirsty, and so can catch you in the middle of a dream. But we don\u2019t yet know whether it affects dream content and the types of memories that are activated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41ee6f479d2db9c52dbff36a9882995ff51411cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41ee6f479d2db9c52dbff36a9882995ff51411cc/0_231_5439_3263/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Debra Skene and her integrating sphere in the Clinical Investigation Unit at the University of Surrey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Debra Skene and her integrating sphere in the Clinical Investigation Unit at the University of Surrey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Debra Skene: \u2018We know the value of sleep, yet we\u2019re often awake at night\u2019</h2> <p><em>Debra Skene is a professor of neuroendocrinology at the </em><a href=\"http://www.surrey.ac.uk/biochemical/People/debra_j_skene/\" title=\"\"><em>University of Surrey</em></a><em>. She studies the human circadian timing system and how it becomes disrupted in blind people, shift workers and older people. Her team\u2019s discovery that blue light from sources such as iPads can alter the timing of this system has important implications for how we&#xa0;sleep. </em></p> <p><strong>What are you studying?</strong><br>I study human circadian rhythms and sleep. Everything in our body is rhythmic, from the release of hormones to our behaviour, and we\u2019ve developed these circadian rhythms because we live on Earth, which has a light-dark cycle and a periodicity of 24&#xa0;hours.</p> <p>We used to think there was just one clock in the brain controlling these rhythms, but we now know that we have clocks in just about every tissue in our body. We are trying to understand how all of these clocks speak to one another and stay&#xa0;in tune, and how they are affected by time cues such as exposure to light or meal&#xa0;times. For instance, when we wake up and open our eyes each morning we get a direct feed of light into our brains, and this resets our internal timing system to be in tune with the natural 24-hour rhythm of earth\u2019s rotation.</p> <p><strong>Why are you studying this?</strong><br>So that we can help people synchronise to new time zones or shift patterns, and have treatment strategies for people whose circadian rhythms are out of sync. For instance, totally blind people can\u2019t synchronise their central body clock with the daily light-dark cycle, and the result is that they\u2019re essentially jetlagged a lot of the time.</p> <p>Also, we need to better understand how light exposure affects our internal clocks to ensure that we get the right amount of light to maintain alertness during the day and good sleep at night.</p> <p><strong>What are you observing?</strong><br>We measure people\u2019s mood, performance, sleepiness, hormones and metabolites [the products of the chemical reactions happening within our bodies] throughout the day and night, in order to understand which rhythms are truly circadian, ie generated by this internal clock timing system. This involves removing all of the external factors that could influence&#xa0;their rhythms, so volunteers are kept in a constant, semi-recumbent posture for 40 hours in dim light and at a constant temperature. They are not allowed to sleep, and instead of breakfast, lunch and supper, we give them small, hourly snacks. We wire them up so we can check their brain activity to see if they are falling asleep and we can wake them up.</p> <p>We also get people into the lab and deprive them of sleep, in order to understand what\u2019s happening in people\u2019s bodies during the first night of night shift work.</p> <p><strong>What do you find fascinating about your&#xa0;subject?</strong><br>All scientists are drawn to what we don\u2019t know. What currently most interests me is the link between the timing of our clocks and metabolism. We know that long-term shift workers have an increased risk of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and a tendency to be more obese; we\u2019re now trying to work out the mechanisms behind this relationship.</p> <p><strong>What are the challenges you face working at night?</strong><br>One of the biggest obstacles is getting people to stay awake during our experiments. At 4am, people are sleepy, but we can\u2019t go in and overexcite them because that might affect our results. Instead we have to walk in quietly and talk to them about some relatively boring subject. Everything is done in time isolation, so no one has access to what the time is, the internet or the wireless. Volunteers can watch videos, but it has to be from afar, so that the light on the screen isn\u2019t bright enough to affect their bodies.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One tip is to be in bright light during the early part of your shift, and reduce light exposure near the end</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Do you employ any special equipment?</strong><br>Another challenge we face is making sure everyone is at the same baseline when they come into the lab, and they\u2019ve been maintaining a regular sleep-wake cycle in their own homes. This is to minimise the variance between people and ensure that when we measure something, it\u2019s the effect of what we\u2019re testing and not the result of differences in people\u2019s circadian timing. To do this, we use actiwatches \u2013 small accelerometers worn on the wrist that record how much people have moved, which is a proxy for when they\u2019re active and not active \u2013 and ask all our participants to complete sleep diaries. The actiwatches also have light sensors, which tell us how much light they\u2019ve been exposed to and when.</p> <p>Our group is famous for showing that blue wavelength light has the greatest effect on the human circadian system. To do this, we had to put participants\u2019 heads into an integrating sphere \u2013 a reflective dome that bounces light around inside it, so that when you put your head inside it your entire retina is equally illuminated.</p> <p><strong>Is it difficult to stay mentally alert at night?</strong><br>We always work in shifts when we do&#xa0;overnight experiments, so one group works from the evening up until&#xa0;about 2am, and another does from 2am onwards. Generally you are so busy taking blood samples and spinning them down, or asking participants questions about how alert they feel that although you\u2019re tired, you stay awake. The other thing I\u2019ve noticed, which is generally common in shift workers, is that I love eating sugary things, such as&#xa0;biscuits or jam and toast, that I would&#xa0;never normally eat. We think that timing of unhealthy food consumption could be a key factor in the ill-health of chronic shift workers, although exactly why we crave these types of food at night needs more research.</p> <p><strong>Would you describe yourself as a night owl, or an early-morning person?</strong><br>I am a late type, so it is easier for me stay&#xa0;up quite late at night, which helps.&#xa0;One thing we\u2019re trying to do as a field is to identify people\u2019s chronotypes \u2013 their propensity to be alert at different&#xa0;times of day \u2013 and match this to their shift patterns, to see if this makes any difference to their coping with shift work.</p> <p><strong>Are you concerned about the effects of your working hours on your health or wellbeing?</strong><br>We always joke when we go to sleep conferences that we know the value of sleep, and yet we\u2019re often awake at&#xa0;night, so the irony isn\u2019t lost on us. I\u2019m&#xa0;also aware that when I fly across time zones, it isn\u2019t very good for my body either. It is something that you just&#xa0;have&#xa0;to do.</p> <p><strong>Do you have any tips for staying up late/managing the body clock?</strong><br>Try to take a nap before you go on to your shift \u2013 although the problem here is that in normal circumstances, when you\u2019re synchronised with the light-dark cycle, it\u2019s not easy to take a nap in the evening. Another tip is to be in bright light during the early part of your shift if possible, and near the end of the night shift, reduce light exposure. Also, we insist that everyone \u2013 volunteers and staff \u2013 sleeps in the lab and are fully rested before they go home, or they get taken home in taxis, so that there is no risk posed by them driving.</p> <p><strong>Most people are asleep while you\u2019re working. What are the rest of us missing out on?</strong><br>Normally, as a late type, I sleep through the dawn, but one of the great things about being a night worker is becoming much more conscious of it. It\u2019s nice and quiet, you can hear the birds, and that early dawn light \u2013 the sort you get even before you see the sun \u2013 I think that\u2019s a memory that sticks with you.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6dc9acfca8a1e6b0d0c4f6db3b90aa127d1e8554\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6dc9acfca8a1e6b0d0c4f6db3b90aa127d1e8554/0_442_5040_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018They are so cryptic\u2019: Kate Jones at home with her bat- detecting equipment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018They are so cryptic\u2019: Kate Jones at home with her bat-<br> detecting equipment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Kate Jones: \u2018I\u2019ve been bitten, but never by a vampire bat\u2019</h2> <p><a href=\"https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=KEJON62\" title=\"\"><em>Kate Jones</em></a><em> is a professor of ecology and biodiversity at University College London with a special interest in bat research and conservation.

She lives in London. </em></p> <p><strong>How and why did you get into bats?</strong><br>My first contact was as an undergraduate, checking boxes with one of the professors in the North York&#xa0;Moors. He came down a ladder with a load of bats in his hand. There was one who was asleep and when he placed it in my hand it woke up and looked at me as if to say \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I just thought that was so badass. That was it for me.</p> <p>I\u2019ve tried to avoid being a bat specialist as that can pigeonhole you. I try to look at the bigger picture, but always with a cunning eye on bats. They do so many weird things and so little is known about them \u2013 that\u2019s what really draws me to them.</p> <p><strong>What makes bats unique?</strong><br>They are so cryptic \u2013 they come out at night, but you don\u2019t see them. They are the only mammal that has proper power of flight. They can live for a really long time \u2013 up to 30-40 years \u2013 in the largest aggregation of mammals on the planet. They also host diseases that transmit to humans \u2013 Ebola, Sars. How do they host them and how do their immune systems cope? How have they evolved such a sophisticated system as echolocation?</p> <p><strong>What are some of the current conservation issues facing bats?</strong><br>Land-use change, such as deforestation&#xa0;and conversion of land for agriculture. Persecution \u2013 many people still view bats as pests or vermin&#xa0;and they lack legal protection in many countries. And introduced species such as snakes or rats. Bats might be slightly better able to cope than some as they can fly away, but they&#xa0;are attached to flyways and migration routes and it takes them a long time to recover from any population crash or disturbance.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m not a big sleeper anyway. Sometimes it can drag a bit but lots of exciting things happen at night</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>How have bats been affected as society has become more 24/7?</strong><br>It\u2019s difficult to say \u2013 some species really don\u2019t like light, it interferes with their hunting. But the most common British species, pipistrelles, are drawn to lights because they attract the insects which the bats eat. Urbanisation could be more sympathetic, with less light pollution and increased habitat for wildlife.</p> <p><strong>Why are bats demonised? Is it because they are nocturnal?</strong><br>I think it\u2019s because maybe they are so secretive and cryptic by nature. There is the vampire thing that has been totally overblown, lots of negative media stories and preconceptions. There are 1,400 species of bat; only three are vampiric and they are in South America. It is a bit crazy.</p> <p><strong>Have you ever been bitten?</strong><br>I have been bitten lots of times, but never by a vampire bat and I do have a rabies jab. But I have been infected by <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/histoplasmosis/\" title=\"\">histoplasmosis</a> \u2013 probably from when I was bat-tracking in Puerto Rico\u2019s hot caves. It\u2019s infection caused by a fungus found in bat guano. It has left a lot of calcified nodules on my lungs.</p> <p><strong>What sort of research do you do at night?</strong><br>Typically we would go out to a region or neighbourhood and train up local groups to use sensors and record the bat species. In Puerto Rico we spent a couple of weeks catching bats in mist nets at night to measure the impact of a recent hurricane. Or we\u2019d head out at dusk to do a walking transect survey, setting detectors and looking for roosts.</p> <p><strong>Do you get scared?</strong><br>I took a BBC team out to Hampstead Heath and they were all freaking out that it was the middle of the night, but for me it was completely normal. There are so many things to see after dark \u2013 bats, hedgehogs, foxes, owls, nightjars, crickets and cicadas.</p> <p><strong>Are you a night owl?</strong><br>I\u2019m not a big sleeper anyway. Sometimes it can drag a bit but lots of exciting things happen at night. When you\u2019re driving around different countries with sensor equipment stuck out the window, you can find yourself in strange situations where people think you\u2019re up to no good. We\u2019ve had guns pointed at us in Romania and Ghana.</p> <p><strong>Any tips for staying up late or managing the body clock?</strong><br>A nice shower in the morning usually sorts me out.</p> <p><strong>How does night-time work affect family and friends?</strong><br>Many are happy to come out for an hour or so. But staying out all night is beyond most people, and hardly anyone wants to come out for the dawn swarm at 3am. That\u2019s the worst part of the night \u2013 too late to be that day but too early to be the&#xa0;next.</p>",
  "<p>On some nights, in the insomniac intervals between rumbling goods trains, and beneath the sound of ambulance sirens, I can hear owls calling mournfully to one another from the trees that screen the railway tracks running past the back of the house in which I live in inner London. On most nights, alongside the shouts of people fighting or having sex, I hear cats and foxes screaming intermittently, as if they are being tortured. On some mornings, when a thin light first leaks through my blinds, I can hear a cockerel croaking from a garden in which chickens are kept a couple of streets away. Occasionally, when the mornings are resonantly still, the insistent tapping of a woodpecker chiselling at a tree trunk wakes me.</p> <p>The city at night is far eerier, far more feral than it is in the day. It is far harder to anthropomorphise, far more difficult to domesticate. In fact, the city doesn\u2019t necessarily sound and feel like a metropolis, a centre of advanced civilisation, when most of its population is fast asleep. It can sound and feel closer to nature than culture. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/virginiawoolf\">Virginia Woolf</a> once pointed out with a noticeable sense of frisson, \u201cwe are no longer quite ourselves\u201d after dark. She relished \u201cthe irresponsibility which darkness and lamplight bestow\u201d. Our cities, like ourselves, can seem alien and unfamiliar at night. And if you listen to them attentively, as though through an echo sounder, you can hear the encompassing darkness transmit from its depths the noises and pulses of the capital\u2019s pre-modern past.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Cities nurture a heart of darkness that the processes of industrialisation and electrification have failed to conquer</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The sounds I sometimes hear from my bedroom, for example, are identifiably descendants of those that the author and printer William Baldwin enumerated in his eccentric satire <em>Beware the Cat</em> (1553), one of the most evocative records we have of London in the 16th century. At one point, Baldwin\u2019s protagonist, Gregory Streamer, ingests a narcotic and lies in his chamber at Aldersgate listening with preternatural hearing to the \u201ccommixed noises\u201d of the nocturnal city. These include the \u201cbarking of dogs, grunting of hogs, wailing of cats, rumbling of rats\u201d; the \u201cringing of bells, counting of coins, mounting of groins, whispering of lovers\u201d; also the \u201cscratching of owls, fluttering of fowls, routing of knaves, snorting of slaves\u201d. He might have added the tapping of cobblers and the shovelling and scraping of \u201cnightmen\u201d, popularly known as \u201cTom-Turd-Men\u201d, who were employed to clean the city\u2019s streets and privies after dark.</p> <p>The night-time streams our cities\u2019 pasts. It channels their historical continuities and discontinuities with a clarity and vitality that our everyday lives, which are shaped by an almost uninterrupted purposefulness, constantly obscure. It reminds us that we once shared these cities with innumerable animals, some of them tame, some of them not; and that to some extent we still do. It reminds us that, though we think of the 24-hour city as a comparatively recent phenomenon \u2013 if in the UK it is a phenomenon at all \u2013 cities have always been hives of labour and leisure after nightfall. Baldwin, in his remarkable onomatopoeic prose poem, refers to the audible nocturnal activities of, among other things, \u201cgrouting and spinning, baking and brewing\u201d. It reminds us, too, that we were once fearful of the night, and of the people who inhabit it, whether these assume the form of potential criminals or the police; and that, to a striking extent, especially if we come from socially marginalised groups, we still are.</p> <p>\u201cHowever efficiently artificial light annihilates the difference between night and day,\u201d the poet and critic Al Alvarez wrote, \u201cit never wholly eliminates the primitive suspicion that night people are up to no good.\u201d Over the past four or five centuries, a series of social and technological changes have reshaped the city at night, progressively colonising it. The introduction of oil light, gaslight and electric light has, for example, successively reshaped it according to the needs of a diurnal state. And the extension of working hours has reshaped it according to the needs of a daytime economy. But these changes haven\u2019t completely dispelled its pre-modern past. Cities nurture a heart of darkness that even the processes of industrialisation and electrification, the introduction of all-night factories and shops, all-night buses and trains, have failed fully to conquer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e6403b6bc1e205999e403e5fb72368ef6fe81027\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6403b6bc1e205999e403e5fb72368ef6fe81027/0_0_2677_3508/763.jpg\" alt=\"Gaslight allows high-jinks, circa 1820.\" width=\"763\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gaslight allows high-jinks, circa 1820.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: SSPL via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1788, at the height of the Enlightenment, the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Times\"><em>Daily Universal Register</em></a> triumphantly reported that \u201cnot a single building in all London is perhaps now to be heard of which bears the repute of being an haunted house\u201d. Scientific rationalism, it was optimistically assumed, had rinsed the city\u2019s darker, more mysterious places with the cold, bright light of reason, just as it had driven magic back to the dark ages. But, in the 21st century as in previous ones, London remains, like all cities, a repository of archaic, if not primal, fears and anxieties at night. Anyone who has walked through its empty streets alone at 3am, sensitive to the slightest flicker of movement in the darkness, knows this (not, of course, that these fears and anxieties are necessarily irrational, particularly if you happen to be a woman).</p> <p>Intellectual enlightenment and the practical illumination of the streets, both enterprises that sought to eradicate remnants of the medieval past, were closely complicit developments in the cities of early modern Europe. Coordinated public street lighting had been in place in central parts of the British capital for a century by the time the newspaper report I\u2019ve quoted complacently declared that its buildings were finally free of ghosts. Paris, operating under the initiative of Louis XIV\u2019s \u201ccouncil for the reform of the policing of the city\u201d, spearheaded the policy in 1667. Other European cities, conscious of the need to pre-empt petty crimes and forestall political conspiracies, followed in rapid succession: Amsterdam in 1669, Turin in 1675, Berlin in 1682, and London in 1684.</p> <p>Replacing the lantern candles that private householders had formerly been required to erect outside their front doors, most European civic authorities deployed oil lanterns, maintained at public expense, to light the streets on moonless nights. The effect, according to contemporaries, was almost overwhelming. The first report on the \u201cNew Lights\u201d of the British metropolis, published in 1690, noted in euphoric tones that they produced \u201csuch a mutual reflection, that they all seem to be but one great Solar-Light\u201d.</p> <p>Public lighting had a decisive impact on Europe\u2019s main thoroughfares, transforming them into places where, at least when the weather was clement, people could promenade and shop after dark. The German novelist Sophie von La Roche, enraptured by London\u2019s culture of consumption, used a letter of 1786 to describe the \u201cdouble rows of brightly shining lamps\u201d that enabled pedestrians and people in coaches to gaze at Oxford Street\u2019s \u201csplendidly lit shop fronts\u201d.</p> <p>In some quite literal sense, the city at night in the late 17th and 18th centuries was flamboyant. As the rise of London\u2019s coffee houses and pleasure gardens indicated, \u201cnightlife\u201d became a distinct social phenomenon from this time. It was increasingly fashionable to stay up dancing, drinking, gambling and soliciting prostitutes all night and then remain in bed throughout the next day. This was in part because it dramatised an aristocratic refusal of the protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism. In populous, upwardly mobile societies like those pioneered in London and Paris, where distinctions of rank could all too easily be obscured in the press of bodies on the streets, the right to roam freely at night was a privilege. And at first light, when revellers staggering home passed labourers walking to work, it was once again unambiguously clear to which social class these individuals belonged.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a0668ec0ea3c0b1966de4805c11e53889d3db52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a0668ec0ea3c0b1966de4805c11e53889d3db52/0_232_3660_2196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man stops to talk to a policeman in the rain on the Thames embankment, 1929.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man stops to talk to a policeman in the rain on the Thames embankment, 1929.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fox Photos/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But if street lighting gentrified and glamorised the commercial and political centres of Europe\u2019s cities in this period, it relegated other regions to no-go areas. The French dramatist Louis-S\u00e9bastien Mercier expressed relief in 1780 that thousands of \u201coil reflectors\u201d had recently replaced lanterns in the French capital. But, as well as protesting that this \u201cexcellent innovation\u201d had been \u201cmarred by misdirected economy\u201d, he pointedly noted that, outside the shallow pools of dazzling light that the oil lamps emitted, the streets had been plunged into a gloom that seemed deeper and more impenetrable than ever. Certainly, in the poorer areas of Europe\u2019s cities, the new technology made little difference to people\u2019s everyday lives. At night, the serpentine streets, suffocating courts and labyrinthine slums of the city were quite as obscure and noxious as they had been in the middle ages.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some people have freer and fuller access to the city at night than others</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The introduction of gaslight in the early 19th century had much the same effect, transforming the areas frequented by the upper and middle classes but leaving those inhabited by the poor pretty much untouched. Even so, alongside the professionalisation of Europe\u2019s police forces, it revolutionised cities at night. In 1807, as part of an energetic campaign to make London the first metropolis to be predominantly lit at night by gas, the expat German entrepreneur <a href=\"http://www.ssplprints.com/image/83653/rowlandson-thomas-a-peep-at-the-gas-lights-in-pall-mall-london-1807\">Frederick Winsor</a> mounted an exhibition of its benefits in Pall Mall. The <em>Monthly Magazine</em> praised the success of this experiment and the \u201cbeautifully white and brilliant\u201d light it produced. By 1823 more than 200 miles of streets in London were lit by almost 40,000 lamps. Light had been industrialised.</p> <p>Not everyone was happy about this development. Like other Romantics, John Keats complained that the intimate forms of illumination associated with candles and oil lamps, which lit small areas with an uneven, gently flickering flame, and which consequently generated a kind of contemplative aura, were being consigned to the past. An impersonal artificial flare, especially in the regions where the retail dealers \u201clet loose the gas\u201d, was progressively repelling \u201call the powers of darkness\u201d. Keats lamented the fact that the city\u2019s authorities and commercial interests were exiling night\u2019s magic, its mystery and its majesty, from the city. And his famous <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/44479\">Ode to a Nightingale</a> (1819), which celebrates the \u201cembalmed darkness\u201d, was a carefully staged attempt to summon it back.</p> <p>The illuminating effects of gaslight were far more uniform than those of oil, but electric lighting, which emerged in the 1880s, flooded rather than simply pooled the streets in which it was installed with an intense, apparently white light. Cartoons and paintings from the period proudly depict people standing about on pavements reading newspapers beneath etiolated electric lamps. Electric street lighting became the ultimate badge of metropolitan modernity, and European cities competed with one another to be the pre-eminent City of Light. In the end, New York overtook all of them, including Paris. Meanwhile, cities that retained their medieval topography, and that were slow to introduce the new technology, were consigned to the past. In an article titled \u201cAgainst Past-Loving Venice\u201d (1910), the Italian Futurist FT Marinetti thundered: \u201cLet the reign of holy Electric Light finally come, to liberate Venice from its venal moonshine\u2026\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a4a184b0f6710104c3e18637d4da099626c3017\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a4a184b0f6710104c3e18637d4da099626c3017/0_124_3700_2221/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harrods in London, flooded with light in 1935.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harrods in London, flooded with light in 1935.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fox Photos/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But, in spite of the unvarying glare of electric street lights at the commercial, industrial and residential centres, even the 20th century\u2019s most futuristic cities were shaped by socially peripheral, largely working-class areas that remained plunged in darkness at night. The German astronomer <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_H._B%C3%BCrgel\">Bruno H B\u00fcrgel</a>, recalling in 1930 the pride with which his father, who \u201ccame from the days of lighting by oil-lamp\u201d, led him through Berlin\u2019s \u201cwealth of light\u201d, drily observed: \u201cA step into the side streets, and you felt set back by centuries.\u201d It was not merely the absence of light, but the presence of the poor at night, and above all the homeless, that made these neighbourhoods seem like remnants of the pre-Enlightenment, pre-capitalist past. The \u201chouseless\u201d, as they used to be called, had been an endemic presence in Europe\u2019s cities after dark since the middle ages, when male and female denizens of the streets were criminalised as \u201ccommon nightwalkers\u201d.</p> <p>The 20th-century city nonetheless staged the progressive colonisation of the night by the day, darkness by light. Bars, cinemas, clubs, music halls, theatres and amusement parks catered ever more energetically to people\u2019s appetite for leisure \u201cafter hours\u201d. Indeed, the phrase \u201cafter hours\u201d seemed more and more meaningless, as factories, hospitals, offices and supermarkets thrummed throughout the night. Even in what had for centuries been called \u201cthe dead night\u201d, roughly between 2am and 4am, the centres of major metropolitan cities \u2013 places like Piccadilly Circus and Times Square \u2013 pulsed with people. \u201cElectric light,\u201d Thomas Edison had insisted, \u201cmeans night life, and night life means progress.\u201d</p> <p>In the early 1940s, when the British capital was routinely plunged into darkness during the blitz, Edison\u2019s formula seemed all the more irrefutable. For at that time, conversely, the absence of electric light plunged London, and other European cities, into a state of barbarism. It was perhaps in part because of this traumatic experience that the postwar generation redoubled its commitment to extracting the value of both labour and leisure from the night. The word \u201cclubbing\u201d was first used to mean going to nightclubs in the mid-1960s, when the children of those who been adults through the second world war set about overcoming this inheritance and reclaiming the night.</p> <p>Since then, as the art historian Jonathan Crary recently wrote in his fine polemic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/22/24-7-late-capitalism-ends-sleep-jonathan-crary-review\"><em>24/7: Late Capitalism and the Ends of Sleep</em></a>, the capitalist system has fostered the rise of a society \u201cin which a state of permanent illumination is inseparable from the non-stop operation of global exchange and illumination\u201d. In the late 1990s, to give a spectacular example, a Russian-European space consortium <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-man-who-turned-night-into-day\">developed plans</a> to use satellites with parabolic reflectors to illuminate remote regions of Earth with sunlight and so enable work to be performed around the clock. Promising \u201cdaylight all night long\u201d, it also proposed that entire metropolitan areas might be illuminated after dark along these lines, rendering electric light itself anachronistic. Dreams of the elimination of the night can no longer be dismissed as science fiction.</p> <p>In the 21st century, electric lighting in advanced capitalist countries \u2013 if not in innumerable developing nations \u2013 is a uniform and universal feature of cities at night. So is commuting, shopping, working and other activities that for much of the past seemed unimaginable taking place after dark. But in practice, as has been the case for millennia, some people have freer and fuller access to the city at night than others. Lone women may feel excluded from it, for example, if only because at certain times and in certain places they are made to feel unacceptably vulnerable. Black and Asian men, for their part, are far more likely to be criminalised in western cities than white men at night.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/23/london-all-night-tube-to-launch-august-sadiq-khan\">24-hour tube</a>, it is probably safe to predict, will not fundamentally alter the fact that for many people, if not for the city\u2019s population of cats and feral foxes, London remains, like other British cities, at least partially off limits at night. We have a night-time economy; we need a night-time politics.</p> <p><em>Matthew Beaumont is the author of Nightwalking: a Nocturnal History of London, \u00a39.99, Verso. </em><a href=\"http://\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a38.19</em></a></p>",
  "<p>The numbers alone are stunning: six Olympic medals, including two golds; 27 world championship medals, including 11 golds; eight Commonwealth Games medals, including five golds. The place of Anna Meares OAM in the pantheon of all-time Australian sporting greats is undisputed.<br></p> <p>But even these statistics fail to fully reflect the magnitude of the 32-year-old\u2019s successes. The daughter of a Queensland coal mining father and former state athletics champion mother, Meares grew up three hours away from the nearest cycling club. Years later, a fractured neck vertebrate from a crash while racing almost left her permanently wheelchair-bound. And during a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/11/anna-meares-i-didnt-feel-like-i-belonged-that-skinsuit-was-like-supermans-cape\">decade-long duel with Britain\u2019s Victoria Pendleton</a>, Meares experienced successive morale-crushing defeats. But time and again, Australia\u2019s 2016 Olympic flag bearer rose to the challenge.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/14/australias-kim-brennan-wins-gold-in-rowing-as-meares-takes-keirin-bronze\">Australia's Kim Brennan wins gold in rowing as Meares takes keirin bronze</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A bronze medal in the women\u2019s keirin on Sunday morning (AEST) may not be the perfect way to conclude this superlative-defying career. But, then, the Rio Games might not be the end of Meares\u2019 racing days at all. Even if the Adelaide-based cyclist does elect to retire following her final event (the forthcoming individual sprint) \u2013 Meares has been noncommittal \u2013 a podium-placing ride is a fitting way to farewell the sport.<br></p> <p>By finishing third, Meares became the first Australian to win an individual medal at four Olympics. Not even swimming greats Ian Thorpe or Dawn Fraser can claim that consistency and longevity. Where she now ranks alongside those Olympians and others is an open question, one sure to be debated at velodromes across the country. Australia may never again see a cyclist like Meares.</p> <p> At first glance, track cycling seems like a battle of brawn rather than brains. Yet tactics and nerve can be decisive, such that the mental element is often as important as pure speed. It is here that Meares\u2019 upbringing gave her an advantage. Desperate to beat older sister Kerrie, who would later win dual Commonwealth Games gold medals in 2002, a younger Meares lacked the physical attributes to match her sibling. She may have been a \u201cchugger\u201d who \u201ccouldn\u2019t go very fast\u201d, in the words of former coach Ken Tucker, but instead Meares developed \u201cthis tremendous mental capacity. There was no one better under pressure.\u201d</p> <p> While physicality would come in time \u2013 she is now almost synonymous with the box jump gym exercise \u2013 that calmness and tactical nous would never desert Meares. It was on display again in the keirin semi-finals, with careful manoeuvring prior to the final strait allowing her to qualify first.</p> <p> Meares\u2019 mental toughness is reflected in her personality, and the Queenslander has two distinct sides. When in the public eye, Meares is charming, friendly and on rare occasions can even be incredibly open to the media (she disclosed the end of her 15-year marriage to a newspaper in February). Yet during training and competition, Meares exudes an incredible aura of intensity \u2013 it takes a brave onlooker to offer a simple acknowledgement in the bowels of the velodrome.</p> <p> This competitive persona only made her reaction after winning bronze all the more telling. Despite failing to outsprint Dutchwoman Elis Ligtlee to gold, Meares was buoyant. A large smile spoke volumes about what the podium finish meant in her fourth consecutive Olympics.</p> <p> When Meares does retire, she will leave a glittering legacy on and off the velodrome. She has been the face of Australian track cycling during its golden era, playing a crucial role in elevating the nation alongside Great Britain as a global powerhouse. She has also helped develop the next generation: acting as a mentor, rival and training partner for her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/11/stephanie-morton-to-win-an-olympic-medal-would-be-unreal-but-why-stop-at-one\">likely successor</a>, offering advice to the <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-05/matthew-glaetzer-world-track-cycling-championships/7223552\">fastest rider</a> in the world and even <a href=\"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/olympic-champion-anna-meares-reveals-why-she-nearly-quit-cycling/news-story/7ad6a0c39c23f514faaf3e3b03b31e1f\">becoming housemates</a> with a promising young sprinter.</p> <p> Meares has also been a constant source of inspiration for many. Her determination in overcoming <em>that</em> neck-breaking crash, her ceaseless desire for success and her graciousness following the occasional defeat have set a high standard for Australian athletes.</p> <p>It is apt, then, that the road leading to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/28/inside-australias-olympic-track-cycling-medal-factory\">Cycling Australia\u2019s High Performance Unit</a> was recently renamed Anna Meares Way. Her time on the track may be drawing to a close, but Meares\u2019 legend will continue inspiring Australian cyclists for decades to come.<br></p>",

From my very unscientific sample of half a dozen people, the most common answer was that tickets are too expensive for most locals. The cheapest Olympics tickets are 40Rs (a little under \u00a310) which are mostly for sports that are little known in Brazil such as hockey and rugby. </p> <p>That is a lot for people earning the minimum wage of 880Rs (about \u00a3200), especially when you add the cost of transport to the mostly distant venues. Other answers were that people were opposed to the Olympics on political grounds or that they were not interested in most of the sports.</p> <p>On the subject of ticket give-aways not happening, this may have something to do with a judge\u2019s ruling earlier this year that the Rio government must not hand out tickets in a municipal election year because it might influence votes. I have been trying to get confirmation from Rio2016 but no response yet.<br></p> <p>Finally, it is important to note that this is not just Brazil\u2019s fault. As my colleague Owen Gibson notes part of the problem is that authorised re-sellers (many of whom are based overseas) have not been able to shift tickets. In that case, the empty seats might be caused by the Zika epidemic, crime and other negative stories about Rio in the run-up to the Games.</p> <p>On a separate note, I\u2019m now watching the last two minutes of a cracking basketball game between regional rivals Brazil and Argentina. Just three points in it. The crowd are going crazy. Can\u2019t see an empty seat.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57af7091e4b0c23bfed89310\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-13T19:13:52.572Z\">8.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Nadal is cooking in the third set, pushing Del Potro on his serve and geeing up the largely pro-Rafa crowd.

You can keep up with all the action as it unfolds on the Guardian live blog, which unlike most events at these Games, never stops.</p> <h2>The big picture</h2> <p> Day seven will go down in history for a number of reasons, not least for the records that fell in the velodrome. In the men\u2019s team pursuit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/12/team-gb-bradley-wiggins-olympic-gold-mens-team-pursuit-australia\">Team GB triumphed in world record time</a> as <strong>Ed Clancy</strong>, <strong>Steven Burke</strong> and <strong>Owain Doull</strong> played no small part in Bradley Wiggins leaving the arena as Great Britain\u2019s most decorated Olympian. His eight medals \u2013 five of them gold \u2013 lift him above Chris Hoy as the G.O.A.T of Team GB and unless they reintroduce medals for poetry, like the one Pierre de Coubertin won in 1912, there\u2019s little left for the cycling great to achieve. That was bad luck for the Australians, who crossed the line 0.743 seconds slower for silver.</p> <p> Shots have been fired by Team USA\u2019s <strong>Hope Solo</strong>, and we\u2019re not talking about action at the gun range. After Solo and her world <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/12/usa-lose-womens-football-sweden-olympic-quarter-finals-penalty-kicks\">No1-ranked football team-mates were dumped from the Games</a> in a sensational penalty shoot-out, the US goalkeeper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/12/hope-solo-sweden-cowards-olympics-football-rio-2016\">accused triumphant victors Sweden of being a bunch of cowards</a>. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to make it far in the tournament,\u201d Solo said after the game. \u201cI think it was very cowardly. But they won, they moving on and we\u2019re going home.\u201d At least her final thought on the matter rang true: \u201cLosing sucks. I\u2019m really bad at it.\u201d</p> <p> The Games also shift a gear from here on in with action under way in the athletics arena, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/the-athletics-elite-turns-up-on-time-but-rio-seems-still-to-be-in-bed\">but as our own Barney Ronay tells us, there\u2019s just not many people on hand to watch it all</a>. As Olympians compete for gold medals \u2013 and while Ethiopia\u2019s <strong>Almaz Ayana</strong> destroyed the 10,000m world record \u2013 bad weather and what would appear to be local apathy have meant crowds more in line with the Goodwill Games, or perhaps a school sports day.</p> <p>Much happier was the sight of 21-year-old Singaporean <strong>Joseph Schooling</strong> being passed the baton, of sorts, when he usurped <strong>Michael Phelps</strong> for gold in the 100m butterfly, a final in which there was an incredible three-way dead heat for silver.

  "<p>Elizabeth and John Gilbert* were strolling the streets of Athens on a Sunday afternoon when they were ambushed. A knife was held to their throats while the two attackers seized their belongings before fleeing with their money and their mobiles. Unable to call anyone without phones or contact lists, they headed for the nearest police station to report the crime.</p> <p>Early next morning they managed to ring their service provider, Vodafone, to inform it of the theft. A month later a phone bill arrived for \u00a35,789.</p> <p>\u201cIt appears we fell victim not only to theft at knife-point, but also to one of Europe\u2019s fastest-growing crimes, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/01/sim-card-flaw-cellphone-hackers-karsten-nohl\" title=\"\">thieves use stolen sim cards to repeatedly dial premium rate numbers</a> set up by gang members who profit from the proceeds,\u201d John Gilbert says. \u201cVodafone insists we should pay this massive sum, without giving any consideration to the circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>Tourists abroad are increasingly being targeted by criminal gangs whose priority is not mobile phone handsets, but the more valuable sim card inside. Few people have any inkling that bills of thousands of pounds can be racked up in just hours when their mobiles are stolen. In a global racket known as international revenue share fraud, gangs target holiday resorts and use the sims from stolen handsets to ring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/may/17/bt-bill-phone-teeing-scam\" title=\"\">international premium rate numbers</a> in countries in Africa and Asia, where the cost of connecting a call is high. The fraudsters are paid a fee by the premium rate number provider for every minute of calls they make.</p> <p>It\u2019s a scam that is rapidly proliferating \u2013 the Communication Fraud Control Association found that $10.7bn (\u00a38.3bn) was lost to revenue sharing scams last year, a 497% increase from 2013. Thanks to new technologies, one phone can be connected to up to six premium rate lines at a time with calls lasting up to an hour, the optimum time after which many providers will terminate a high cost call. Thus sim cards can be milked like debit cards, only \u2013 until recently \u2013 without the \u00a350 cap that banks apply to debts run up when the latter are stolen.</p> <p>It was because of horror stories like the Gilberts\u2019 that in March last year five of Britain\u2019s biggest mobile phone companies bowed to years of government pressure and signed a voluntary code to protect customers from bills racked up by phone thieves.</p> <p>Under the Code of practice on consumer billing, customers\u2019 liability for such charges is capped at \u00a3100 provided the phone is reported lost or stolen within 24 hours. Before the code came into force, customers were responsible for all charges accrued before a theft was reported. Vodafone was the last of the signatories to implement the agreement last September and has capped customers\u2019 liability to \u00a3500 if a stolen phone is flagged up within five days.</p> <p>Unfortunately for the Gilberts, their ordeal in February last year occurred five months before Vodafone\u2019s cap was introduced. And despite the fact that Vodafone acknowledged the importance of the agreement \u201cto improve customers\u2019 experience at what can be an upsetting time\u201d, the company has refused to consider reducing or waiving the bill.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We were in shock \u2026 our first thought was not 'we must find a way to call Vodafone', but to get to a police station</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe were in shock \u2026 and our first thought was not \u2018we must find a way to call Vodafone\u2019, but to get to a police station,\u201d the Gilberts say. \u201cAll our contacts were stored on our stolen phones and all our money taken, so it was not feasible to call anyone straight away.\u201d</p> <p>A voluntary code which would have protected the Gilberts was supposed to be in place by spring 2014, but it wasn\u2019t until the following summer that the main signatories introduced limited liability. The favourite excuse of companies was that they did not receive victims\u2019 call records from overseas providers until the following day \u2013 in fact, for the past eight years 90% of the world\u2019s phone operators have been part of an international agreement, the Near Real Time Data Roaming Exchange, which obliges them to share data for fraud analysis within four hours or else accept liability for the cost of all calls after that time.</p> <p>However, according to Colin Yates, a fraud consultant and former head of fraud management at Vodafone, shrinking budgets mean that companies don\u2019t always spot illegal activity when the records are received. \u201cRecords are not always analysed 24/7, so while suspicious calling activity may be reported by the roaming partner within four hours, the notification will not be actioned for a day or so until the home network fraud analysts return to the office,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cIf a customer normally spends, say, \u00a350 per month and makes a couple of international calls, then suddenly over a 24-hour period there are 100 international calls and a \u00a3500 bill, then it is not unreasonable for them to expect their service provider to identify this and take some immediate action.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/30/end-bill-shock-eu-mobile-roaming-charges-slashed-phone\">An end to \u2018bill shock\u2019 as EU mobile roaming charges are slashed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s likely, therefore, that over the years many customers have been sent bills that they should not have had to pay.

His provider, Vodafone again, refused to waive the charges until a barrister judged them likely to be invalid and offered to take up&#xa0;his case.</p> <p>A similar intransigence has threatened the credit rating and the stress levels of the Gilberts over the past 18 months. It has also compromised their telecommunications. \u201cWe agreed to keep paying our monthly contract while disputing the bill, but they now keep suspending our connection every couple of weeks, and we need to fight hard to convince them to re-connect us,\u201d they say. Only when <em>the Observer</em> contacted Vodafone and alerted Ofcom did the company back down and write off the debt.</p> <p>Ofcom, which allowed providers to delay the introduction of liability caps since it first required them in 2012, takes a dim view of Vodafone\u2019s behaviour: \u201cWe remain concerned about the length of time it has taken the company to address this dispute,\u201d a spokesperson says. \u201cLast year, we launched a formal investigation into Vodafone\u2019s complaints handling processes, which is ongoing.\u201d</p> <p>Vodafone now says it will apply the cap retrospectively in the Gilberts\u2019 case in belated recognition that \u201ctheir particular circumstances were very difficult and distressing\u201d. \u201cWe are sorry this issue has dragged on for so long,\u201d says a spokesperson who secured the reprieve within three days of media intervention.</p> <p>Meanwhile, critics claim that the new cap on customer liability, while welcome, does not go far enough \u2013 especially since mobile phone providers should themselves be able to flag up suspicious activity rather than waiting to be notified of a theft.</p> <p>\u201cSince the cap was introduced, the number of people coming to us with extortionate bills from stolen mobiles has dropped,\u201d says Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice. \u201cThis is positive, but we have always argued that mobile phone companies could go further by getting rid of time limits which give customers only 24 hours to report their phone stolen and trigger the cap. It\u2019s not always possible to report a theft within a day, and abolishing this rule would make the cap fairer.</p> <p>\u201cWe also think \u00a3100 is too much for a victim of crime to pay and are calling for the cap to be cut to \u00a350.\u201d</p> <p><em>*Not their real names</em></p> <h2>How to avoid the shock of a post-holiday bill<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"043ccbf5b135b1d24d207673b3be0c0d00e6fa50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/043ccbf5b135b1d24d207673b3be0c0d00e6fa50/0_120_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Before you go on holiday, register your mobile to help police trace you if it is recovered.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Before you go on holiday, register your mobile to help police trace you if it is recovered.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edmund Terakopian/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Up to 300,000 phones are reported stolen each year in the UK according to the National Mobile Phone Crime Unit, and many more customers are victims of theft while overseas.</p> <p>To minimise liability when thieves run up large charges, notify your service provider as soon as you discover that your handset is missing.

A retro-reflective material is made up of millions of microscopic glass beads held in resin. When a light, such as a car headlamp, is directed at it, instead of diffusing and scattering the light, it reflects the energy directly back at the source, resulting in an intense brightness. The result is that retro-reflective materials appear to light up in the dark, a bit like a cat\u2019s eyes if you shine a torch at them (although this is not recommended). Although retro-reflective materials have been around for a while, in such places as the stripes on builders\u2019 high-visibility bibs, for example, recent advances in their durability, breathability and flexibility have enabled them to be employed in a wider range of garments and increasingly innovative ways.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc61c1b3cb0a940808360b32cd9dd1a0f9d957f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc61c1b3cb0a940808360b32cd9dd1a0f9d957f2/0_120_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reflective and hi-vis elements on Rapha\u2019s cycling wear.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reflective and hi-vis elements on Rapha\u2019s cycling wear.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rapha</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn the past, retro-reflective materials were quite fragile, prone to cracking or peeling after washing and wearing,\u201d says Raeburn. \u201cOne area that\u2019s greatly improved is allowing stretch \u2013 for instance in overshoes or gloves.\u201d Raeburn shows me some prototypes for Rapha\u2019s collection for next season: overshoes that shimmer under the light; jackets with reflective polka dots and a jumper made with retro-reflective yarn. \u201cAll of these products weren\u2019t possible a few years ago,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Unlike hi-vis garments, the retro-reflective material only comes alive when placed in bright light during otherwise dark conditions, so during the day they can look like stylish items of clothing. \u201cThese small improvements in stretch, breathability and so on open up design options to us,\u201d says Raeburn. \u201cSafety wear was often non-stylish. Now visibility is there by merit of good design and materials, which is much more appealing. These garments can transition from bike to office.

At this stage, there can\u2019t be many people who haven\u2019t, at one time or another, fretted about this question. After all, the technology has invaded every aspect of our lives; it is changing social and private behaviour, having a disproportionate impact on our children and facilitating types of criminal and antisocial behaviour that are repulsive and sometimes terrifying. And it is now also changing democratic politics: the most interesting thing about Donald Trump is how his narcissistic personality has found its perfect expression in Twitter \u2013 which is how we come to have <a href=\"http://www.maryaiken.com/news/2016/6/17/welcome-to-the-troll-election\" title=\"\">an internet troll running for president</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Aiken finds it alarming that parents of babies believe that it\u2019s good for infants to have access to technology</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But at the same time our public discourse about technology remains depressingly Manichaean \u2013 with enthusiasts (and a formidably powerful global industry) extolling its wonders, while critics focus only on its manifest downsides. But this isn\u2019t a proper debate: we are like two drunks in a bar arguing about whether oxygen is, on balance, a good or a bad thing.</p> <p>The reality is that digital technology (like most technologies) is <em>both</em> good and bad. And, as with oxygen, it\u2019s not going to go away. So the only rational way forward is to figure out how to live intelligently with it. But in order to do that we need to understand it. The industry and its boosters have done a pretty good job in explaining the advantages. What we lack is an informed understanding of the problems, dangers and pathologies to which it gives rise.</p> <p>This is the gap that Dr Aiken seeks to fill. As a psychologist, her prime interest is in the scientific understanding of online behaviour. \u201cIf I seem to focus on many of the negative aspects of technology,\u201d she writes, \u201cit is in order to bring the debate back to the balanced centre rather than have one driven by utopian idealism or commercialism. My job is just to provide the best wisdom possible, based on what we know about human beings and how their cognitive, behavioural, physiological, social, developmental, affective, and motivational capabilities have been exploited or compromised or changed by the design of these products.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/04/why-spending-more-time-on-the-internet-is-a-good-thing\">Why spending more time on the internet is a good thing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her book has to cover a lot of ground. She begins with fetishes and addiction and leaves one in little doubt that the old boast of the now defunct <em>News of the World</em> (\u201cAll&nbsp;human life is here\u201d) is definitely fulfilled by the internet. Aiken\u2019s point is really just that the network provides unprecedented opportunities for personalities that are warped in particular ways to follow their inclinations, harmless or otherwise.</p> <p>But in a way, we knew much of this. Where Aiken really hits her stride is in three central chapters covering the impact of digital technology on children and young people. Here she makes a powerful case for the view that our society has been criminally negligent in the way it puts children in the harm\u2019s way of digital technology. This is partly about the usual dangers of pornography, paedophilia, cyberbullying etc, but it\u2019s just as much about the casual laxity of parents, and the way in which the technology industry continues to avoid responsibility for the perils that it facilitates and the damage that its products can do.</p> <p>For example, Aiken finds it alarming (as I do) that parents of babies mistakenly believe that it\u2019s good for infants to have access to the technology from very young ages.

This is partly \u2013 but only partly \u2013 a matter of regulation, which in relation to the internet is always a tricky problem. But it\u2019s mainly a problem of the cognitive dissonance which afflicts us all in relation to digital technology.

  "<p>The proposed new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset has turned into the first headache for Theresa May\u2019s government. The issue is now about far more than Britain\u2019s energy policy. It is about foreign policy too.</p> <p>May is yet to say anything publicly about the government\u2019s decision to review the \u00a318bn project. The only official comment was from Greg Clark, the new business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, who welcomed EDF\u2019s approval of the project but added: \u201cThe government will now consider carefully all the component parts of this project and make its decision in the early autumn.\u201d</p> <p>On the face of it, taking time to review such a controversial project is sensible. After all, there are genuine doubts about whether EDF, which is 85% owned by the French government, can build the plant and its European pressurised reactor (EPR) on time, on budget and safely. The National Audit Office has warned that taxpayers could end up paying more than \u00a330bn through a range of subsidies designed to support the project.</p> <p>But the role of China has taken centre stage. The China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) has a 33% stake in Hinkley, with a gentleman\u2019s agreement that it will go on to build its own nuclear plants in Britain. Last week it emerged that CGN and a consultant to the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/hinkley-point-c-case-against-cgn-has-the-feel-of-a-modern-spy-thriller\" title=\"\">have been charged in the US with conspiring to help the Chinese government develop nuclear material</a>.</p> <p>We now know, thanks to Vince Cable, that May raised security concerns about that while home secretary in the coalition. Her joint chief of staff, Nick Timothy, wrote last year that David Cameron\u2019s government was \u201cselling our national security to China\u201d.</p> <p>No one in May\u2019s new government has done much to move people away from the idea that it is concerned about China\u2019s involvement in Hinkley. That is presumably why China\u2019s ambassador to the UK said last week that Beijing\u2019s relationship with the UK was at a \u201ccrucial historical juncture\u201d.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s relationship with China, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, is clearly at risk because of the plant. The fact that the Hinkley saga \u2013 which has rumbled on for a decade \u2013 is reaching a climax just weeks after Britain voted to leave the European Union adds another ingredient to the mix.</p> <p>Lord Mandelson, the former business secretary, says Britain must show that it is open for business and \u201ccan\u2019t be too fussy about who we do trade with\u201d. Mandelson\u2019s comments represent the extreme end of one side of the argument, with Timothy\u2019s at the other.</p> <p>Britain must find a way to work with China, a key investor in London Heathrow, Canary Wharf and football clubs. It could also back other key infrastructure projects such as High Speed 2. China has already shown it is keen to invest in Britain, where the legal and regulatory system offer the reassurance of a safe haven for assets.</p> <p>Security, of course, should be a concern. But when Britain agreed to sell British Energy to EDF for \u00a312.5bn in 2008, it became inevitable that foreign investment and expertise would be needed to build new nuclear power stations.</p> <p>The only way, therefore, to develop a home-grown energy policy is to move away from large Hinkley-type projects,&#xa0;either towards forms of renewable energy or towards smaller nuclear&#xa0;power plants, which Rolls-Royce can build.</p> <p>But if the government does decide to scrap Hinkley Point C, the decision should not be about security: it should be because alternatives offer more value, efficiency, and safety. The potential cost to the taxpayer through subsidies to EDF and China, and the question marks about the EPR reactor \u2013 there still isn\u2019t one in service anywhere in the world \u2013 are more pressing concerns than Chinese involvement.</p> <p>If the government does scrap Hinkley Point C, it must outline the alternative route it intends to take \u2013 and then ensure there are no hard feelings in Beijing.</p> <h2>Inheritance tax law needs reform<br></h2> <p>The Dukes of Westminster have had almost as much influence on tax law as they have on the garden squares of Mayfair and Belgravia. The \u00a39bn property fortune now passing to a new generation would probably not exist today without a legal environment moulded over time by the very richest families.</p> <p>The second duke, famous for his four wives and a love affair with Coco Chanel, was more cautious with his finances than his personal life might suggest. In 1936 he won a case in which the judge stated that every man was entitled to arrange his affairs so that the tax owing was \u201cless than it otherwise would be\u201d. The ruling has been a thorn in the revenue\u2019s side ever since.</p> <p>The trust structure from which the 25-year-old Hugh Grosvenor and his sisters will benefit dates from his death in 1953. For the Grosvenors, the 40% death duties incurred by normal estates do not apply. Trusts can last for up to 125 years, with wealth flowing freely from one generation to another.</p> <p>Campaigners are calling for the beneficiaries of family trusts to be named on a public register, and for trusts to publish annual accounts, as private companies do.</p> <p>Lobbyists in the thriving wealth management industry argue that opaqueness provides protection. Research suggests as many as a quarter of the beneficiaries are either children or vulnerable adults. A public register would expose individuals who have access to significant sums.</p> <p>But the secrecy arguments are weak. These vulnerable individuals do not control the money from which they benefit \u2013 that responsibility lies with competent adult trustees.</p> <p>The latest available data shows the number of trusts registered with the tax office has fallen slowly over time, to 160,500 in the financial year ending in March 2013. But their total annual income has risen to \u00a32bn.</p> <p>The degree to which trusts should be taxed is up for discussion, but the argument for transparency has surely been won.</p> <h2>Stop whingeing about apprenticeships<br></h2> <p>Depending on who you listen to, the government\u2019s planned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/12/apprenticeships-levy-will-go-ahead-next-year-uk-government-confirms\" title=\"\">apprenticeship levy</a> is a desperately needed scheme to address Britain\u2019s chronic skills shortage or a badly designed payroll tax that will drive down the quality of training.</p> <p>Both sides were out in force to make their case on Friday when the government confirmed it was launching the levy next April and ignoring the calls from business for a postponement in the wake of the Brexit vote.</p> <p>Just days earlier, Downing Street had faced down calls from corporate lobbyists to slow the implementation of the national living wage.</p> <p>Critics who say that the design of the apprenticeship levy needs tweaking to get the kind of schemes we need may be proven right. But Theresa May\u2019s government is right to press ahead with an April launch.</p> <p>May said last week that she wants to tackle inequality, and creating more routes into secure jobs with good career prospects is a key part of that.</p>",

In the meantime, read how Justin Gatlin impressed in the heats:</em></p> <p>Yet all of a sudden everyone, from Coe to the watching volunteers and the crowd, was smiling. As he pushed his way through the media presence that quadruples every time he appears, Bolt added: \u201cI\u2019m feeling good, I\u2019m happy. Now it\u2019s all about execution and getting it right when it comes to the finals. There are going to be some fast semi-finals.\u201d</p> <p>The fastest qualifier, for what it\u2019s worth at this stage of the competition, was Gatlin. The American, hamfistedly cast as the twice-banned bogeyman to Bolt\u2019s saviour at the Beijing world championships last year where he lost out by a fraction, was also heartily cheered.</p> <p>\u201cIt was easy, man. Controlled the race from the beginning, stayed strong. I feel the best I have all season,\u201d he said after a time of 10.01 in a race in which he was easing down for the last 20 metres.</p> <p>Inevitably, Gatlin was asked again about his USA team-mate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/10/lilly-king-unrepentant-calling-out-drug-cheats\">Lilly King\u2019s comments </a>last week. In the midst of rising rhetoric about a new sporting cold war in the pool, King hit out not only at Russian rival Yulia Efimova but her own team-mates.</p> <p>\u201cDo I think people who have been caught doping should be on the team? They shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is just something that needs to be set in stone.\u201d</p> <p>A hitherto relaxed Gatlin, who has not reproduced the consistent excellence of last season but still believes he can win here, stiffened slightly.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know who Lilly King is. She does swimming and not track and field, so I\u2019m not worried about that. I have confidence in my own policies,\u201d said the twice-banned sprinter, who continues to divide opinion between those who believe he has served his time and those who bristle at his presence.</p> <p>\u201cUsada has done a great job, Wada has done a great job. I\u2019ve come back and done what I need to do. I\u2019ve worked hard just like everyone else,\u201d he added.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/olympic-games-rio-athletics-100m-usain-bolt-justin-gatlin\">Usain Bolt arrives to lift the Rio fans but finds Justin Gatlin has the legs</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>"
