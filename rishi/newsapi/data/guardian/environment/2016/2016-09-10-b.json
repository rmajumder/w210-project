  "<p>On a balmy evening last week in north Wales, the bats were flitting about, the blackberries were as large as grapes, the little winberries on the Berwyn hills were as sweet as sugar and the rowan trees were bowed down with berries. It was nearly as warm at 9pm in Chirk as it was in Lagos.</p> <p>Welcome to early autumn 2016. After a very wet and notably mild winter, a soggy spring and a warmer-than-average summer, much of Britain has been basking in tropical-style humidity and temperatures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/09/refuelling-avian-departure-lounge-country-diary\">Refuelling at the avian departure lounge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That combination of a mild winter, early rain and late summer warmth could result in fine autumn colours as well as splendid fruit, nut, mushroom and seed harvests, say ecologists, farmers and producers.</p> <p>\u201cThe autumn should be spectacular for fruit and nuts,\u201d says Matthew Oates, a conservationist with the National Trust. \u201cIt\u2019s been an extraordinarily good year for beech nuts, and also for rowans and hawthorns.\u201d</p> <p>There will be plenty of holly for Christmas, he says, and anyone hoping to make a crab apple jelly to accompany their Sunday roasts will be spoilt for choice as the fruit look set to be particularly good this year.</p> <p>The mild wet winter and the resulting vegetation growth will have a downside this autumn, however, says Oates. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious slug year. They could do a lot of damage to the mushrooms.\u201d</p> <p>Mycologists say this year\u2019s mushroom harvest is promising, but in some areas slugs may be the only things enjoying them this autumn. Many foragers reacted in horror to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/04/new-forest-bans-fungi-pickers\" title=\"\">total ban on picking</a> imposed in the New Forest last week by the Forestry Commission. An autumn harvest traditionally enjoyed by hundreds of local people is to be stopped for the first time in centuries on the premise that gangs of commercial foragers are sweeping the woodland clean of all fungi.</p> <p>\u201cThere is absolutely no evidence that picking fungi causes harm, and no evidence of these \u2018gangs\u2019,\u201d says Daniel Butler, a mycologist and forager from mid-Wales. \u201cIn the end a mushroom is just a fruiting body. Picking no more harms future crops than harvesting apples damages the tree. If the authorities are still determined to limit mushroom harvesting, why stop there? What makes a mushroom different from a blackberry?</p> <p>\u201cSince the Norman conquest we have all had certain foraging rights. Provided we are in a place where we are entitled to be, like a footpath, nature reserve, Forestry Commission woodland or urban park, we can gather flowers, foliage, fruit and fungi for personal consumption.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa3697da90c8c25ac3247056259d12fce3dba844\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa3697da90c8c25ac3247056259d12fce3dba844/0_313_4928_2955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A slug crawls over wild mushrooms\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A slug crawls over wild mushrooms.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Blackberry pickers in some parts of the country may have a wait before they can fill their plastic boxes with fruit. Oates says blackberries have generally been later this year: \u201cIn the Cotswolds they are only just getting going because the bushes flowered late. Since then the weather has generally been too dry for them, but they are coming now.\u201d</p> <p>While some householders may have already noticed a sudden abundance of house spiders scuttling across their floors as mating season gets under way, reports in some areas of the press of billions of \u201cdaddy-longlegs\u201d, or crane flies, about to invade Britain may not be quite accurate, according to Matt Shardlow of conservation charity Buglife.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where that idea comes from but this hasn\u2019t been a brilliant year for insects,\u201d he says. \u201cThe government\u2019s State of Nature report, which is published next week, will show 60% of invertebrates in decline and a huge loss of bio-abundance.\u201d</p> <p>He says the situation of bumble and solitary bee species this year is really shocking and worse than expected. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.ceh.ac.uk/news-and-media/news/new-study-neonicotinoid-insecticides-linked-wild-bee-decline-across-england\" title=\"\">A new paper by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology</a> looked at 60 species and found that 40% have distribution declines greater than 10% as a result of a group of systemic pesticides called neonics,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is worst-case-scenario stuff.\u201d</p> <p>Hundreds of volunteer observers working with the Woodland Trust\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.naturescalendar.org.uk/\" title=\"\">nature\u2019s calendar survey</a> have so far recorded little autumn leaf colour compared with 2015. Kate Lewthwaite, the trust\u2019s citizen science manager, says: \u201cBeech, silver birch, ash and oak trees are all significantly behind where they were last year.\u201d</p> <p>But she says there are already signs that migratory birds are preparing to leave earlier than they did in 2015. \u201cThere have been more recordings of house martins, swifts and swallows [leaving] compared with this time last year.\u201d</p> <p>When the leaves do begin to change, the colours are expected to be stunning. A mild autumn could mean prolonged colour well into November, says Andrew Smith, director of the Forestry Commission\u2019s Westonbirt national arboretum in Gloucestershire. \u201cThe abundant rain we experienced in spring, coupled with above-average amounts of sunshine, has meant a great growing season, which allows trees to build up plenty of sugars in their leaves,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ee535f10ca5dc679ff3c55ac85cd081cb9889f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ee535f10ca5dc679ff3c55ac85cd081cb9889f8/0_1049_4400_2639/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apples are set for a bumper year\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apples are set for a bumper year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Joe Daniels of the Forestry Commission\u2019s Grizedale forest, in the southern Lake District, says that while birches and sycamores are just changing, the oak is a bit behind. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping there will be good colours this year,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we get some nice crisp mornings it will be really lovely.\u201d</p> <p>The owners of Britain\u2019s 500-odd vineyards, which last year produced nearly five million bottles of wine, are among those hoping the heat lasts a few more weeks. \u201cWe are quietly optimistic. Grape picking will start probably in two weeks\u2019 time \u2026 but the bulk will be in mid-October,\u201d says Julia Trustram Eve of marketing body English Wine Producers. \u201cThe next few weeks are crucial. The grapes are healthy, and the vines are healthy. It may not be a vintage year after the poor start we had, but a few weeks\u2019 warmth now will help.\u201d</p> <p>The apple industry thinks 2016 will see growers match last years\u2019s record haul. \u201cThere\u2019s been a huge renaissance in the English apple,\u201d says Adrian Barlow, chair of trade body English Apples and Pears. \u201cWe will have record crops of Gala, the most popular apple in the UK by far, but we could do with some cold nights to put colour into the skins. The sunshine has been great for the sugar content.\u201d</p> <p>Farmers report a mixed year but the prolonged hot, dry weather in Norfolk has resulted in one of the earliest ever cereal harvests, says Kit Papworth, a large Norfolk farm contractor. \u201cWe had an extraordinary run of weather and plenty of combine capacity. Our costs have been lower \u2013 we\u2019ve cut all the winter crops without having to start the drier, which has never happened before \u2013 and probably won\u2019t happen again in my lifetime.\u201d</p> <p>One of the best British harvests this year will be sunshine, says the Solar Trade Association (STA). New government figures show there is now a total installed capacity of 9.79 gigawatts of solar power, making the UK, which now has 800,000 homes generating solar electricity and 200,000 solar hot water, the sixth-biggest generator in the world \u2013 ahead of much sunnier France and Spain.</p> <p>STA head of external affairs Leonie Green says: \u201cTotal generation from solar rose by 41% between January and March compared with 2015. It peaked in August at 23.9% of UK electricity demand, which was a new record.\u201d</p> <p>James Madden of forecasting service Exacta Weather says: \u201cHot air built up on the near continent will continue to drift across our shores to bring bursts of warm to hot weather in among some other weather types into October.</p> <p>\u201cThese bouts of Indian summer-type weather will also be enough to continue the several-month trend of above average temperatures for the next several weeks.\u201d</p> <p>But the Met Office is more cautious. \u201cThere will be some drier, brighter periods, particularly in the south and south-east,\u201d says its long range forecast. \u201cTemperatures will be perhaps very warm at first in the south-east, but in general are averaging out close to normal.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>America has never been entirely sure what to do with its white poor. For complicated historical and political reasons, we associate \u201cpoor\u201d in our public consciousness with \u201cblack\u201d. Terms such as \u201cwelfare queen\u201d and \u201cculture of poverty\u201d became associated uniquely with the social maladies of African Americans in urban ghettos, despite the fact that poor whites outnumbered poor blacks.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t always thus. When <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/primary-resources/lbj-union64/\" title=\"\">President Lyndon Baines Johnson </a>launched his \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d in the 1960s, he did so from eastern Kentucky coal country, then and now one of the poorest regions of the country. That region is my ancestral homeland, the place from which my grandparents emigrated to avoid the sort of material destitution President Johnson highlighted. Like millions of southern and Appalachian migrants, they moved north to the booming industrial economies of Ohio, Pennsylvania and similar states.</p> <p>They moved in the hope of finding better jobs and higher wages and for a time they found those things. Yet in the wake of a long-term decline in manufacturing in the United States, the economic boomtown my grandparents migrated to began to struggle in many of the same ways as the eastern Kentucky town they left behind. By the time their grandchildren reached adulthood in the early 2000s, joblessness and despair had replaced the optimism that characterised my grandparents 50 years earlier. And though the local economies of each region differed \u2013 in Detroit, automobile manufacturing; in southern Ohio, steel and paper mills; in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, coal mining \u2013 the social problems looked eerily similar. All across Appalachia and the Rust Belt, opioid addiction, family breakdown and rising mortality set in. And the ills afflicting the white working class, so similar to those stereotypically assigned to the black poor, became impossible to ignore.</p> <p>To many commentators, these problems are statistics to be analysed, but to me, they were the backdrop of my youth. As a kid, I sorted Middletown into three basic geographic regions. First, the area surrounding the high school, which opened in 1969. The \u201crich\u201d kids lived here. Large homes mixed comfortably with well-kept parks and office complexes. If your dad was a doctor, he almost certainly owned a home or had an office here, if not both. I dreamed that I\u2019d own a house in Manchester Manor, a relatively new development not a mile from the high school, where a nice home went for less than a fifth of the price of a decent house in San Francisco. Next, the poor kids (the really poor kids) lived near Armco, where even the nice homes had been converted into multi-family apartment units. I didn\u2019t know until recently that this neighbourhood was actually two neighbourhoods \u2013 one inhabited by Middletown\u2019s working-class black population, the other by its poorest white population. Middletown\u2019s few housing projects stood there.</p> <p>Then there was the area where we lived \u2013 mostly single-family homes, with abandoned warehouses and factories within walking distance. Looking back, I don\u2019t know if the \u201creally poor\u201d areas and my block were any different or whether these divisions were the constructs of a mind that didn\u2019t want to believe we were really poor.</p> <p>Across the street from our house was Miami Park, a single city block with a swing set, a tennis court, a baseball field and a basketball court. As I grew up, I noticed that the tennis court lines faded with each passing month and that the city had stopped filling in the cracks or replacing the nets on the basketball courts. I was still young when the tennis court became little more than a cement block littered with grass patches. I learned that our neighbourhood had \u201cgone downhill\u201d after two bikes were stolen in the course of the week. For years, Mamaw said, her children had left their bikes unchained in the yard with no problems. Now we woke to find thick locks cracked in two by deadbolt cutters. From that point forward, I walked.</p> <h2><strong>Downtown Middletown is little more than a relic </strong></h2> <p>If Middletown had changed little by the time I was born, the writing was on the wall almost immediately thereafter. It\u2019s easy even for residents to miss how much Middletown has changed because the change has been gradual \u2013 more erosion than mudslide. But it\u2019s obvious if you know where to look and a common refrain for those of us who return intermittently is: \u201cGeez, Middletown is not looking good.\u201d</p> <p>In the 1980s, Middletown had a proud, almost idyllic downtown: a bustling shopping centre, restaurants that had operated since before the Second World War and a few bars where men like Papaw would gather and have a beer (or sometimes many) after a hard day at the steel mill. My favourite store was the local Kmart, which was the main attraction in a strip mall, near a branch of Dillman\u2019s, a local grocer with three or four locations. Now the strip mall is mostly bare: Kmart stands empty and the Dillman family closed that big store and all the rest, too. The last I checked, there was only an Arby\u2019s, a discount grocery store, and a Chinese buffet in what was once a Middletown centre of commerce. The scene at that strip mall is hardly uncommon. Few Middletown businesses are doing well and many have ceased operating altogether. Twenty years ago, there were two malls. Now one of those malls is a parking lot and the other serves as a walking course for the elderly.</p> <p>Today, downtown Middletown is little more than a relic of American industrial glory. Abandoned shops line the heart of downtown Middletown, where Central Avenue and Main Street meet. Richie\u2019s pawnshop has long since closed, though the hideous yellow and green sign still marks the site, last time I checked. Richie\u2019s isn\u2019t far from an old pharmacy that, in its heyday, had a soda bar and served root beer floats. Across the street is a building that looks like a theatre, with one of those giant triangular signs that reads \u201cST\u2013L\u201d because the letters in the middle were shattered and not replaced. A little farther down the road is a cash-for-gold store and not far from that is a payday lending outfit.</p> <p>Not far from the main drag of empty shops and boarded-up windows is the Sorg mansion. The Sorgs, a powerful and wealthy industrial family dating back to the 19th century, operated a large paper mill in Middletown. They donated enough money to put their names on the local opera house and helped build Middletown into a respectable enough city to attract Armco. Their mansion, a gigantic manor home, sits near a formerly proud Middletown country club. Despite its beauty, a Maryland couple recently purchased the mansion for $225,000 or about half of what a decent multi-room apartment sets you back in Washington DC.</p> <p>Located quite literally on Main Street, the Sorg mansion is just up the road from a number of opulent homes that housed Middletown\u2019s wealthy in their heyday. Most have fallen into disrepair. Those that haven\u2019t have been subdivided into small apartments for Middletown\u2019s poorest residents. A street that was once the pride of Middletown is now a notorious spot for druggies and dealers. Main Street is now the place you avoid after dark.</p> <h2><strong>The white working class had grown angry. And it had no heroes</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>City leaders have tried in vain to revive Middle-town\u2019s downtown, though in recent years they\u2019ve met with some limited success, as a few businesses have opened near the newest branch of a local community college. Despite some progress, efforts to reinvent downtown Middletown are likely futile. People didn\u2019t leave because our downtown lacked trendy cultural amenities. The trendy cultural amenities left because there weren\u2019t enough consumers in Middletown to support them. And why weren\u2019t there enough well-paying consumers? Because there weren\u2019t enough jobs to employ those consumers. Downtown Middletown\u2019s struggles were a symptom of everything else happening to Middletown\u2019s people, especially the collapsing importance of the local steel mill.</p> <p>Unfortunately, very few of America\u2019s political or financial classes understood what was happening in towns such as Middletown. And this ignorance comes in part from their increasing segregation from working- and middle-class families. In booming Washington DC, cosmopolitan New York and hi-tech San Francisco, people rarely come face to face with the poor, with the possible exception of the random beggar. Their interactions with the poor of rural and suburban America are rarer still. Meanwhile, as a 2011 Brookings Institute study found, \u201ccompared to 2000, residents of extreme-poverty neighbourhoods in 2005\u20132009 were more likely to be white, native-born, high-school or college graduates, homeowners and not receiving public assistance\u201d. The white poor always existed, but they were rapidly growing in numbers and America\u2019s wealthiest and most powerful residents seemed unaware.</p> <p>Indeed, if they deigned to care much about the white working class, they often expressed little more than condescension or outright disdain. As my grandma once told me, \u201chillbillies\u201d \u2013 by which she meant poor whites with some connection to Appalachia \u2013 were the only group of people that elites felt comfortable stereotyping and looking down upon. From MTV\u2019s chronicle of a \u201cwild\u201d white family in West Virginia to <a href=\"http://www.kentucky.com/entertainment/tv/article44150238.html\" title=\"\"><em>Justified</em></a>, a popular show about eastern Kentucky, the media\u2019s interest in the region seemed confined to entertaining caricature.</p> <p>The political system\u2019s response was even worse. While candidate Obama in 2007 secretly chastised poor whites for \u201cclinging to their guns and religion,\u201d the Republican party, where most white, working-class Americans made a political home, seemed completely unaware that its own base was struggling. In 2012, Mitt Romney ran on a platform that celebrated the noble business owner, even as polls showed that the white working class increasingly mistrusted the business owners perceived to push them from their work.</p> <p>And in late 2015, the party appeared ready to crown <a href=\"https://jeb2016.com\" title=\"\">Jeb Bush</a>, the scion of a wealthy family whose policy programme differed little from Mitt Romney\u2019s, even as his tone did. This was the brother of a man who started two unsuccessful wars, wars whose burden was disproportionately shouldered by the white middle and working class. And though a number of putative challengers offered stylistic contrasts with the younger Bush brother, no one challenged the core premise at the heart of his candidacy: tax cuts and deregulation at home combined with an active, military-focused foreign policy abroad. Just eight years after George W Bush left office to historically low approval numbers, the party appeared primed to double down on Bush, both in policy and in genetics. And no one seemed that interested in stopping it.</p> <p>Except for Donald Trump.</p> <p>In a now famous September debate among Republican presidential candidates, Jeb offered a robust defence of his brother\u2019s foreign policy: \u201cAs it relates to my brother, there\u2019s one thing I know for sure: he kept us safe.\u201d In interviews after the debate and on social media, Trump filleted Bush repeatedly, noting the failures of the war and even blaming Bush for his failure to prevent the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It was the third rail of Republican politics and television commentators predicated that it was the end of Trump\u2019s candidacy. How, many asked, could Trump survive such an aggressive criticism of the party\u2019s most recent president? Instead, Trump thrived, building on his lead in the polls and cruising to the Republican nomination.</p> <p>What so many commentators failed to understand was that the Republican party of George W Bush had changed. In the eight years since Obama\u2019s election, the white working class had grown angry: at the economy that failed to deliver good jobs, at the failed prosecution of two wars, at a government bureaucracy that failed to deliver good healthcare for veterans, at policy-makers who bailed out megabanks in the 2008 financial crisis even as many Americans lost their homes. The party didn\u2019t want another Mitt Romney and it sure as hell didn\u2019t want another Bush. It wanted, most of all, a man whose very existence is the opposite of everything prior nominees stood for.</p> <p>This was about more than finances and the macroeconomy problem. As a culture, working-class white Americans like myself had no heroes. We loved the military but had no George S Patton figure in the modern army. I doubt my neighbours could even name a high-ranking military officer. The space programme, long a source of pride, had gone the way of the dodo and with it the celebrity astronauts. We had lost any trust in the media as guardians of truth and consequently many were willing to believe all manner of conspiracies about our allegedly foreign-born president and his supposed grabs for power.</p> <h2><strong>In style and tone Trump reminds blue-collar workers of themselves</strong></h2> <p>To understand the significance of this cultural detachment, you must appreciate that much of my family\u2019s, my neighbourhood\u2019s and my community\u2019s identity derives from our love of country. I once interviewed my grandma for a class project about the Second World War. After 70 years filled with marriage, children, grandchildren, death, poverty and triumph, the thing about which she was unquestionably the proudest and most excited was that she and her family did their part during the war.</p> <p>We spoke for minutes about everything else; we spoke for hours about war rations, <a href=\"http://www.people.com/article/rosie-the-riveter-95-real-life-inspiration-iconic-poster\" title=\"\">Rosie the Riveter</a>, her dad\u2019s wartime love letters to her mother from the Pacific and the day \u201cwe dropped the bomb\u201d. My grandma always had two gods: Jesus Christ and the United States of America. I was no different and neither was anyone else I knew.</p> <p>Many in the US and abroad marvel that a showy billionaire could inspire such allegiance among relatively poor voters. Yet in style and tone, Trump reminds blue-collar workers of themselves. Gone are the poll-tested and consultant-approved political lines, replaced with a backslapping swashbuckler unafraid of saying what\u2019s on his mind. The elites of DC and NY see an offensive madman, blowing through decades of political convention with his every word. His voters, on the other hand, see a man who\u2019s refreshingly relatable, who talks about politics and policy as if he were sitting around the dinner table.</p> <p>More important is Trump\u2019s message. Implicit in the slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d is a belief that one\u2019s country is not especially great right now and that\u2019s certainly how many of Middletown\u2019s residents felt. In the wake of the Great Recession, there was something almost spiritual about the cynicism of the community at large. If America was the lynchpin of a civic faith, then many in the white working class were losing something like a religion.</p> <p>In America, commentators have devoted dozens of essays and think pieces to the question of whether Trump\u2019s rise is primarily a function of economic insecurity or racial anxiety. The question is easy to answer \u2013 it\u2019s both \u2013 and yet not especially helpful. Donald Trump isn\u2019t just the candidate of economically dispossessed whites, though he is that. Nor is he just the candidate of racially anxious whites, though he is also that.</p> <p>He\u2019s the candidate of the man who opens his morning paper to find that another of his neighbours has died of a heroin overdose; of the woman who proudly sent her son to fight in Iraq only to watch it break his body and mind; of the father who spends hours on the phone with the Department of Veterans Affairs, begging for medical care that his former Marine nephew is owed both legally and morally; of the proud coal miner who voted for Bill Clinton and then watched as his wife promised to \u201cput a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business\u201d. Donald Trump is the candidate of a patriotic people who feel an almost apocalyptic apprehension about the future. His great insight was to recognise and exploit that apprehension.</p> <p>The tragedy of Trump\u2019s candidacy is that, embedded in his furious exhortations against Muslims and Mexicans and trade deals gone awry is a message that America\u2019s white poor don\u2019t need: that everything wrong in your life is someone else\u2019s fault. No one doubts that globalisation and automation have disproportionately had an impact on the white working class and no responsible politics should fail to appreciate and address that fact. Yet our neighbourhoods and our communities create certain pressures and instil certain values that make it harder for our children to lead happy lives.</p> <h2><strong>Trump\u2019s entire candidacy consists of pointing the finger at someone else</strong><br><br></h2> <p>During my junior year of high school, our neighbour Pattie called her landlord to report a leaky roof. The landlord arrived and found Pattie topless, stoned and unconscious on her living-room couch. Upstairs, the bathtub was overflowing, thus the leaking roof. Pattie had apparently drawn herself a bath, taken a few prescription painkillers and passed out. The top floor of her home and many of her family\u2019s possessions were ruined. This is the reality of our community. It\u2019s not just about hard-working people dispossessed by globalisation, though that\u2019s undoubtedly true for many people. It\u2019s also about a naked druggie destroying what little of value exists in her life. It\u2019s about children who lose their toys and clothes to a mother\u2019s addiction. It\u2019s about families torn apart by domestic violence and students afraid to go home when the school bell rings at the end of the day.</p> <p>Psychologists call it \u201clearned helplessness\u201d when a person believes, as I did during my youth, that their choices have no effect on their life\u2019s outcomes. We acquired that sense of helplessness from a number of sources: from families who felt that you had to pretend to be \u201cblack or liberal\u201d to get into an Ivy League school; from the home life that showed us the world could be turned upside down in an instant; from seeing so few of our neighbours succeed in the modern economy that we wondered whether success was even possible for those like us.</p> <p>To recognise that these neighbourhoods and attitudes affect us is not to place moral blame on the poor. Indeed, many of the obstacles folks like me perceive are quite real. But it is dangerous, even destructive, to give up completely on the role of agency. The white working class must build a set of values that recognises life\u2019s unfairness while constructively engaging with it \u2013 in our community institutions, in our government and in our families. Yet Trump\u2019s message for the white voter so desperately in need of introspection and self-reflection is: it\u2019s all someone else\u2019s fault. His rallies may be cathartic, as he screams and yells at conjured enemies, but he offers no solutions. His entire candidacy is an exercise in pointing the finger at someone else.</p> <p>In pointing that finger so repeatedly and enthusiastically, Donald Trump has debased our entire political culture. On the right, the party of robust American global leadership now finds itself apologising for a man who apologises for Vladimir Putin even as he scares our staunchest European allies.</p> <p>The Republican speaker of the house, a brilliant, respected leader, regularly repudiates some noxious statement of Trump\u2019s even as he cannot politically repudiate the man himself. On the left, the cosmopolitan elites of the Democratic party have taken to Facebook and Twitter to denounce half of their fellow citizens, people they rarely see, much less know. In the eyes of American elites, Trump\u2019s voters are racist rednecks, finally reaping what they\u2019ve sown.</p> <p>In this age of Trump, each tribe has lost the ability to show even a hint of compassion for the other side.</p> <p>The great irony is that the people who may make Trump president are among those who most need a constructive politics and an engaged leader. They need a life raft and a mirror. Trump instead offers a political high, a promise to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d without a single good idea regarding how.</p> <p>Hillbilly Elegy by JD Vance is published by William Collins on 22 September, \u00a316.99</p> <p>\u2022 Comments will be opened later</p>",
  "<p>European leaders will <a href=\"https://euobserver.com/institutional/134931\" title=\"\">meet in Bratislava</a> next Friday at an informal summit intended to map a new path for the EU in the wake of Britain\u2019s vote to leave. Yet while the unwelcome outcome of June\u2019s referendum was a trigger for the talks, this review, or re-evaluation, of the European project is long overdue. Modern-day Europe faces enormous challenges not remotely envisaged by the EU\u2019s founding fathers when they signed the Treaty of Rome 60 years ago next year. A new consensus on how to address these shared problems, in principle and in practice, is urgently needed as the treaty anniversary approaches.</p> <p>Britain, unfortunately, will have little or no say over what happens next. Theresa May is not invited to Bratislava. The summit will take place without her. The government is not being asked for it views on the crucial issues confronting Europe and, if it chooses to air them, it is increasingly likely, as time goes by, that it will be ignored. The EU wants only one thing from Britain right now, as Donald Tusk, the European council president,<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/08/donald-tusk-tells-theresa-may-the-ball-is-in-your-court-as-he-ur/\" title=\"\"> reminded May last week</a>: a firm date for starting exit negotiations. And this, unfortunately again, May is unwilling or unable to give them. To pretend the outcome of Bratislava and ensuing discussions will not have a big impact on British interests is to perpetuate the wilful blindness that led to the calamitous Brexit vote. A major struggle, years in the making, is coming to a head. It pits the \u201cold\u201d liberal, open-markets, open-borders EU, led by Germany, France and Italy, against the \u201cnew\u201d, conservative, nationalist EU, states such as <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/future-eu/news/visegrad-group-to-table-proposals-at-bratislava-summit/\" title=\"\">Poland, Hungary and Slovakia</a> that are more recent entrants. At issue is the future of the EU\u2019s so-called four freedoms \u2013 the free movement of labour, goods, services and capital.</p> <p>Claiming to be responding to public concerns about immigration, Islamist terrorism, economic security and the erosion of cultural traditions, the Poles and their allies in the <a href=\"http://www.visegradgroup.eu/about\" title=\"\">Visegr\u00e1d</a> group are resisting the migrant quota system championed by Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel. They want greater autonomy for national parliaments, more oversight of transnational corporations and investment, the scrapping of plans for visa-free EU travel for Turks, and greater recognition of what Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Hungary\u2019s rightwing prime minister, calls \u201chistoric, religious and national identity\u201d.</p> <p>These objectives are shared by advancing, populist and nationalist movements across western Europe, too, including the Alternative for Germany (AfD), which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/mecklenburg-vorpommern-german-anti-immigrant-party-strong-regional-election-exit-polls-merkel\" title=\"\">humiliated Merkel</a> in elections in her home state last week. And if this agenda sounds familiar, it is. It echoes many of the positions adopted by Leave campaigners and their Ukip allies. How all these issues are tackled really matters for Britain. The irony is, if they had not cut and run, the views espoused by Michael Gove and Boris Johnson would have had much more influence in reshaping Europe\u2019s aims and priorities at this moment. As it is, they, and Britain, have no say.</p> <p>The Bratislava 27 face other tests. One is what to do about the eurozone\u2019s problems, mushrooming national deficits and the widening gap between the wealthier north and poorer south. Yet it is foolish to separate broader, pan-European post-crash worries, such as high youth unemployment and reduced foreign investment, from problems in the global economy, such as lower demand in China. Britain shares these problems. And it continues to have a strong interest in a prosperous, thriving European trading bloc of 500 million consumers, purchasers of 44% of UK exports in 2014. But in this area, too, Britain will have no voice and no say.</p> <p>Agreeing on the need to reform and revive the EU, Bratislava will consider a range of other proposals, including more rather than less integration and, for example, strengthening <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/08/european-union-plans-military-battlegroups-after-brexit-vote\" title=\"\">EU defence and security policy</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s time to move forward to a European defence union, which is basically a \u2018Schengen of defence\u2019,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/all/news/german-minister-in-lithuania-backs-european-defence-union/\" title=\"\">Ursula von der Leyen</a>, the German defence minister, while visiting Lithuania last week. Such statements of intent must ring alarm bells in Whitehall. As the EU\u2019s heaviest hitter on defence, Britain habitually took the lead, prioritising Nato and pouring cold water on previous, often French-inspired EU co-operation initiatives. But soon, London will have no say at all.</p> <p>What price now the Brexiters\u2019 repeated assurances that breaking with the EU would not undermine Nato and Britain\u2019s defences? How will this dismaying abdication of responsibility play with Washington? And how Vladimir Putin must be laughing, as he continues Russia\u2019s military build-up along Europe\u2019s Baltic frontier. May and her ministers have no answers. No summit, no comment.</p>",
  "<p>One party contested the last general election with a commitment to create more grammar schools. That party wasn\u2019t the Conservatives \u2013 it was Ukip. So why did Theresa May pick a fight for which she lacks a mandate? Why start it now when she was under absolutely no pressure to do so? Why unfurl her standard on terrain that looks heavily stacked against her from the start? In seeking to understand why she has chosen to make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-to-end-ban-on-new-grammar-schools\" title=\"\">grammar schools</a> her first domestic battlefield, we will find that political psychology is a more useful guide than anything else.</p> <p>There was no public clamour for a programme of expanding grammar schools. Even in the minority of counties where they have survived the wave of abolitions that began in the 1960s, only a small segment of the electorate have any direct experience of them. That is why I don\u2019t place much trust in opinion polls suggesting that there is a lot of public support for expanding the number of schools allocating places by academic selection. I am not confident that most people responding to these polls understand what grammars are and what more of them would mean. In her big speech on Friday, Mrs May contended that her new version of the grammar is intended to be \u201cinclusive, not exclusive\u201d. But exclusivity is the whole point about them and it is so for both their supporters and opponents. Giving to the gifted child a different, and implicitly superior, kind of schooling is precisely the attraction of grammars to those who think they are a fantastic idea; just as it is why they are so passionately opposed by the many critics, among them the chief inspector of schools, who think that segregating children is a dreadful concept.</p> <p>It is a political problem with grammars as well as a social and educational one that they divide children into winners and losers. This was one of the major reasons that previous Tory governments have not attempted to restore them. Margaret Thatcher may have been a proud alumnus of Kesteven and Grantham Girls\u2019 School, but as education secretary she presided over a record number of closures and never sought to revive the grammar/secondary modern split when she was prime minister. \u201cBring back the grammars\u201d has, though, always been an effective way of harvesting applause from Tory audiences. It is especially popular with Conservatives who, like the current prime minister, had a grammar school education themselves and believe that it explains their life stories. Autobiography may be a bad way of making policy, but in my experience it has an especially potent influence on politicians when it comes to education. Full declaration of my own background: I went to all-ability state primary and junior schools, sat what was then the 12-plus and attended a grammar in Warwickshire before going on a scholarship to a private school. I hope that multi-environment experience gives me a bit of insight into how the protagonists are thinking.</p> <p>During the exchanges about the government\u2019s intentions in parliament, some of the Tory contributors lingered affectionately on their school days. <a href=\"http://www.chrisphilp.com\" title=\"\">Chris Philp</a>, the MP for Croydon South, declared: \u201cI went to a state grammar school in south London and I owe my place here to that school.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/greening-struggles-to-produce-evidence-to-back-grammar-schools\" title=\"\">Justine Greening</a>, the comprehensive-schooled education secretary, responded rather icily: \u201cI think all of us are here because of the education that we were lucky enough to have.\u201d</p> <p>Education is one of those subjects that provokes Conservatives to fight a form of class war with each other. It is rare for this war to be openly declared, but it is lurking in the background and becomes visceral when they debate schooling. Grammar Tories think of themselves as the product of intelligence allied to effort and ambition. They often feel this most intensely. When Michael Howard was Tory leader, I never saw him more passionate than when he shouted over the dispatch box at Tony Blair that he, Howard \u201cthis grammar-school boy\u201d, was not going to take any lectures about privilege from \u201cthat public-school boy\u201d.</p> <p>This sense of moral superiority among grammar-school Tories is felt just as keenly, even more so in fact, when they compare themselves with private-school Tories whom they often regard as unmerited beneficiaries of wealth and inherited advantage. \u201cMeritocracy\u201d was a word that David Cameron struggled to use without being mocked because of where he went to school. Mrs May is much more comfortable with it and \u201cmeritocracy\u201d made repeat appearances in her speech. Her declared ambition was to make \u201cBritain the great meritocracy of the world\u201d. Many Tories of her background hated Mr Cameron for his refusal to countenance a revival of grammars. They regarded this as a man with an expensive education denying life chances to people who had not enjoyed his early advantages. Mrs May has made a big feature of the opening period of her premiership of defining herself through contrasts with her predecessor. This is a way of virtue-signalling to other Tories and the wider electorate that she is a friend of aspiration and opportunity in a way her predecessor was not.</p> <p>Let us assume that she sincerely wants to do more for gifted children from less advantaged backgrounds. In taking this road, she simply ignores the great weight of evidence that says her chosen instrument will not do that and might very well sharpen inequalities. Specialist after specialist has reminded the prime minister of this since she declared her intentions. So have many colleagues from her own party. David Willetts, the Tory minister for the universities in the last parliament, has pointed out that if your aim is to lubricate social mobility, then expanding the number of grammars is not the way to go about it. Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary, bluntly calls the policy a \u201cweird\u201d distraction from driving up the performance of all schools while Ms Greening couldn\u2019t sound less enthused. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/07/grammar-schools-expansion-disaster-social-mobility-tsar-alan-milburn\" title=\"\">Alan Milburn</a>, the chairman of the government\u2019s commission on social mobility, predicts that it will be a \u201cdisaster\u201d because it will not lead to more selection by ability but more \u201cselection socially\u201d. Mrs May has had to acknowledge that affluent parents will try to maximise the chances of their offspring prospering from an extension of selection. She has also conceded that no one has yet managed to come up with a test that is \u201ctutor-proof\u201d. She can\u2019t or won\u2019t say how many new grammars she would like.</p> <p>When you get into the detail, the government is not putting all that much money where the prime minister\u2019s mouth is. She envisages spending \u00a350m a year on expanding grammars, a tiny fraction of an education budget totalling more than \u00a380bn. That\u2019s not really the supposed \u201cschools revolution\u201d blared in some of the headlines. This suggests it is more about symbolism.</p> <p>That symbolism is nevertheless important because expanding grammars is an implied repudiation of the idea that every school should strive for excellence. It upsets a well-grounded consensus that the most effective way to drive up educational attainment is to concentrate on recruiting talented teachers and put them under effective leadership. There is also plenty of evidence about the best way to tackle underachievement, which is to focus extra help on poorer children through mechanisms such as the pupil premium and paying extra to good teachers who work in disadvantaged areas.</p> <p>Projecting grammars on to the top of the news bulletins has also obscured other ideas from Mrs May that were potentially more radical and more likely to gather wide support. It was arresting to hear a Tory prime minister say that private schools must do more for their communities to earn their charitable tax breaks. That has largely gone unremarked upon because of the emotional potency of the grammars issue. Opposition will be wide, deep and fierce. This is one of those rare issues \u2013 in fact, it is the only one \u2013 which unites the teaching unions, Michael Gove, the Lib Dems, the Scottish Nationalists, Jeremy Corbyn and the parliamentary Labour party. It will require legislation. Memo to Mrs May: your working majority in the Commons is just 17. A chunk of Tory MPs, among them the Conservative chairman of the education select committee, are already indicating that they are not comfortable. Further memo to Mrs May: you do not have a majority at all in the Lords. The upper house will not be constrained by the Salisbury Convention that binds peers not to oppose a policy that was in the ruling party\u2019s election manifesto because expanding the number of grammars was not in the Tory manifesto.</p> <p>The prime minister is setting herself up for a ferocious battle for which she does not have an electoral mandate over a relatively trivial amount of money to implement a policy that will have an impact only on a tiny minority of schoolchildren and with no evidence that it will have the intended effect. \u201cMy teachers made me the woman I am today,\u201d Mrs May wrote for yesterday\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3782457/My-debt-grammar-schools-Theresa-s-personal-crusade-child-chance-education-revolution-attacks-fee-paying-schools-divorced-reality.html\" title=\"\"><em>Daily Mail</em></a>. She must have missed the lesson about only starting battles worth fighting and where there is a good chance of winning.</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>One of the greatest parliamentary advances of recent times has been the willingness of all sides in both houses to shed light on past injustices.</p> <p>We all want to maximise trust in our public bodies and we can only do that if we open up fully about our country\u2019s past.

Jessie was contacted in an online forum by several parents but connected most with Emma and Michael. The couples met for the first time about one year ago and have visited each other several times since.</p> <p>\u201cShe lives in Rockhampton, I live in Canberra, we have no common friends, we don\u2019t have similar lives, she\u2019s 33 and I\u2019m 40, she\u2019s a teacher\u2019s aid and I\u2019m a high school teacher and playwright,\u201d Emma says. \u201cBut it has become a fantastic friendship.

Emma and Michael had their first child, Edward, nine years ago, but it took them two years to conceive him. Emma discovered her fallopian tubes were blocked about 18 months into trying and, after a medical procedure to repair her fallopian tubes, became pregnant with him six months later.</p> <p>\u201cWe thought we\u2019d had it tough because we\u2019d tried so hard to conceive him but we had no idea how tough things could get,\u201d she says.</p> <p>One month after Edward was born, they conceived again, which excited them given their desire for more children and earlier difficulties. But Emma miscarried at nine weeks, discovering she had been carrying twins.</p> <p>In 2010 Emma became pregnant again, this time through IVF, having failed to conceive naturally for two years. At 15 weeks, when she went to the toilet one night, her waters broke.</p> <p>\u201cWe went to hospital and they said; \u2018you\u2019ll have to have a termination and deliver the baby, even though it\u2019s still alive\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was terrible. Doctors had different viewpoints about what had happened but no one could tell us clearly why.

To complicate matters, she had also been diagnosed with an autoimmune illness that could, in itself, cause pregnancy loss.</p> <p>But, to their shock, Emma and Michael became pregnant again in 2014, this time conceiving naturally despite believing they were unable to. They had not been trying for a child. Emma was terrified of losing another baby and asked for a surgical stitch to be placed around her cervix to strengthen it and hold it closed. She was advised by her obstetrician that the stitch would not be necessary, because there were other, safer ways to support the cervix. A routine scan at 15 weeks found her cervix had begun to open and she was at this point given a surgical stitch and placed on strict bed rest. </p> <p>\u201cNearly four weeks into the bed rest I was given an ultrasound that revealed my waters had seeped gradually away and so, just like the first time, I had to give birth to a living baby that would not survive,\u201d Emma says. </p> <p>\u201cWe felt cursed.

Unfortunately the first embryo transfer to Jessie, in January, ended in miscarriage about seven weeks into her pregnancy. </p> <p>\u201cThat was the first time I have experienced anything like that and was very tough for all of us,\u201d Jessie says. </p> <p>But, to Emma and Michael\u2019s relief, Jessie agreed to try again.</p> <p>\u201cWe were fortunate that the second transfer has been successful,\u201d Jessie says. \u201cIn the beginning especially, it was near impossible to relax. As time goes on and everything seems to be going great, I can relax and try and enjoy the pregnancy a little more each day.\u201d </p> <p>She is now 25 weeks pregnant.</p> <p>While there is no limit to the number of IVF cycles that can be claimed through Medicare, surrogates who become pregnant through IVF are not entitled to a Medicare rebate. It makes surrogacy an option only to those who can afford it.<br></p> <p>Emma says she stopped keeping track of the medical and legal costs when they reached about $50,000. This is, however, still cheaper than it is for those who travel overseas to find a commercial surrogate, with a study published in the Medical Journal of Australia finding the average total costs for couples travelling to India was $69,212 and $172,347 for those traveling to the US. </p> <p>The president of Surrogacy Australia, Robert Reith, says the organisation wants the government to allow a Medicare rebate for couples who require a surrogate to start a family, to decriminalise commercial surrogacy and to create a compensated surrogacy framework consistent across Australia, including allowing for surrogates and intending parents to advertise.</p> <p>\u201cCommon factors for requiring surrogacy include infertility, being unable to carry a child due to disease or cancer, being part of a same-sex relationship, or Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome [a disorder that occurs in women and mainly affects her reproductive system],\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cMost surrogacy pregnancies are very positive. After 10 years of heartbreak, my wife and I are currently 17 weeks pregnant. My sister-in-law is our surrogate. As it\u2019s such an emotional issue, people are very private, so we do find it hard to get people to go public.\u201d<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As it\u2019s such an emotional issue, people are very private.</p> <footer> <cite>Robert Reith, Surrogacy Australia</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In May, the standing committee on social policy and legal affairs tabled its report from its inquiry into surrogacy to parliament. As its key point, the committee recommended that commercial surrogacy remain illegal in Australia, noting that surrogates were not motivated by financial reward and \u201ca significant potential for the exploitation of surrogates and children to occur\u201d through commercialisation. </p> <p>However, the committee recommended a nationally consistent legal altruistic surrogacy framework be established. The committee did not make any recommendations about Medicare rebates but noted that \u201ca number of submissions have raised the issue of Medicare coverage for surrogates\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIt has been noted that Medicare coverage does not extend to IVF treatment if a surrogate is used,\u201d <a href=\"http://file:///Users/melisa/Downloads/FullReport%20(1).pdf\">the report</a> found. \u201cThe Australian government\u2019s paid parental leave scheme does apply to women who are pregnant with a surrogate child.\u201d </p> <p>The government is due to respond to the committee\u2019s recommendations by the end of the year.</p> <p>Dr Karin Hammarberg, a women\u2019s health researcher with the Jean Hailes research unit at Monash University\u2019s school of public health and preventive medicine, said rebates for IVF could be better targeted to those most likely to benefit from IVF treatment.</p> <p>\u201cSurrogacy, due to its cost, is really only available to a select few,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are prepared to fund IVF irrespective of age or likelihood of succeeding. But the worthy case of a young woman who had cancer of the uterus, for example, and who has a sister prepared to help her have a child through surrogacy, does not have treatment funded to the same extent.</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t got the balance quite right.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/19/cambodia-foreign-surrogacy-thailand-ban\">Cambodia proves fertile ground for foreign surrogacy after Thailand ban | Sarah Haaij</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A leading Australian surrogacy lawyer, Stephen Page, said it was common for his clients to have been through \u201cmany, many rounds\u201d of failed IVF before opting for surrogacy. </p> <p>\u201cWe as taxpayers are paying for that,\u201d he says. \u201cIf surrogacy were more available, they wouldn\u2019t have done so many rounds, they\u2019d go towards surrogacy sooner.\u201d</p> <p>He supports a carefully regulated and nationally consistent model of commercial surrogacy that would require intensive counselling for all parties and which would ban financially unstable or first-time parents from becoming a surrogate. </p> <p>\u201cTypically, surrogates are women 25 years and older, so they are quite mature, and they have had all of their own children,\u201d Page says. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s generally a good idea, because they know what they\u2019re in for, they\u2019re aware of any complications they\u2019re in for and, if they have had all of their own kids, they won\u2019t suddenly decide they want to keep yours.\u201d</p> <p>Page also believes it is unfair that the only people benefiting financially from surrogacy currently are \u201cdoctors, lawyers and fertility specialists\u201d.</p> <p>Jessie says while her intention in becoming a surrogate was to help someone in need, she believes there should be room for some commercialisation of the industry in Australia.</p> <p>While she would recommend altruistic surrogacy to others, she says establishing a good relationship with the intended parents and sorting out legal arrangements first is essential. </p> <p>\u201cI also don\u2019t think it\u2019s something you should jump into without that and the full support of your own family,\u201d she says. \u201cI also believe you should always trust your gut feeling.\u201d</p> <p>Jessie also says that the responsibility she feels carrying someone else\u2019s child is enormous.

  "<p>Jill Scott is a fine embodiment of Manchester City Women\u2019s relentless pursuit of excellence and glory. On Sunday Nick Cushing\u2019s side can move to within three points of a first top-flight title by beating Arsenal. On 2 October they can secure a second Continental Tyres Cup in two years by beating Birmingham City at their own Academy Stadium. And three days later City make their debut in the Champions League, hosting Russia\u2019s Zvezda 2005 Perm in the last 32.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/07/barcelona-womens-team-america-nwsl\">Barcelona consider fielding women's team in America's NWSL</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In all this, the driving force is Scott, a 14-year veteran who began at her hometown\u2019s Sunderland Women and has 101 England caps and 15 international goals.</p> <p>\u201cOne thing that always sticks out for me is that it is about being excellent and having high standards,\u201d she says of City. \u201cIt\u2019s also about how you are as a person and we\u2019ve learned a lot. Hopefully when we step outside this environment we\u2019re better people for the experience. If you\u2019re not there\u2019s probably something wrong. We\u2019re very lucky \u2013 we do have everything.\u201d</p> <p>Last season City lost out on the Women\u2019s Super League title on the final day to Chelsea Ladies. This term City, captained by Steph Houghton, lead Chelsea by seven points before their final three matches.</p> <p>The champions have a game in hand, so victory at Arsenal in Sunday\u2019s 2pm kick-off means one more win from their last two outings guarantees the title.</p> <p>Yet despite Arsenal being defeated in the Continental Cup semi-final last weekend and in the reverse league fixture, Scott strikes a cautious note. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult. The game [last] Sunday could have gone either way,\u201d she says. \u201cThey had a lot of chances, so it\u2019s about looking at it like a brand new game. It\u2019s always difficult when you play a team a third time because you\u2019ve shown your hand but we\u2019ll prepare well.\u201d</p> <p>City are undefeated and in flying form, and Scott is clear about the difference this season. \u201cLast time we probably left ourselves too much to do going into the second part of the season; this year we had a good first half of the season and carried that on,\u201d the midfielder says.</p> <p>\u201cBut we\u2019re under no illusion that these last three games are going to be very difficult. Chelsea have still got a game in hand but we haven\u2019t spoken about winning the league all year. I don\u2019t think a draw would be disastrous at all, it would be another point on the table, but we go into every game wanting to win.\u201d</p> <p>Scott, now 29, was again named by Mark Sampson for England\u2019s final two European Championship qualifiers, against Estonia on Thursday and Belgium the following week. \u201cIt\u2019s always difficult being at a club like this because the talent around you is so good and there\u2019s going to be competition for places but you\u2019ve got to concentrate on your job, work hard in training,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all gone according to plan with England. It\u2019s great that we\u2019ve already qualified and we\u2019ve got these two games but we\u2019ll still be wanting to top the group and send out a statement of intent for the Euros next year.\u201d</p> <p>The venue for the cup final makes it especially pleasing to Scott that City are in it. \u201cThat\u2019s probably one of my greatest memories in football, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/16/arsenal-manchester-city-womens-super-league-continental-cup-final\" title=\"\">winning that two years ago</a>,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were all very disappointed not to make the final last year. And especially with the final being here, at the Academy, it would have been very painful to watch teams competing for the trophy we won two years ago.</p> <p>\u201cSo that win [over Arsenal] is starting to sink in. It was massive for us as a club and hopefully we can get a lot of fans down and please them in the final.\u201d</p> <p>Then comes the Champions League tie with Zvezda, the current and five-times Russian champions. \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting \u2013 we deserve to be competing against the best,\u201d Scott says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of going into the unknown and I don\u2019t know too much about Zvezda but based on the experience of playing against Russia, they do have good individual players.\u201d</p> <p>Before then Scott hopes to have achieved a long-term ambition. \u201cI\u2019ve been playing in this top league for 13, 14 years and never won it. I don\u2019t want to get carried away \u2013 but there\u2019s no hiding the fact that it would mean absolutely everything.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Tom Watson\u2019s Ryder Cup legacy did not solely relate to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/28/ryder-cup-2014-jamie-donaldson-seals-win-wedge-shot-life-keegan-bradley\" title=\"\">continuation of a poor United States run</a>. Nor, indeed, the staggering scene that was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/28/phil-mickelson-tom-watson-ryder-cup\" title=\"\">Phil Mickelson\u2019s barely concealed volley</a> at the captain in the immediate aftermath of a comprehensive defeat at Gleneagles. There was also Watson\u2019s identification of what he regarded as a flaw in the US wildcard process. Until now, the winner of the $10m FedEx Cup would be confirmed too late for Ryder Cup selection. Davis Love III, Watson\u2019s immediate successor, will name his final captain\u2019s pick after the Tour Championship concludes in Atlanta just days before the contest gets under way. An already elongated process will now drag on even longer.</p> <p>On Sunday Love will announce his first three additions to an eight-man side that includes just one debutant, Brooks Koepka. Whereas the decision as called for by Darren Clarke, Love\u2019s counterpart with Europe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/31/darren-clarke-ryder-cup-captains-picks-thomas-pieters\" title=\"\">was subject to widespread debate</a>, there is apparently a more straightforward scenario for the home skipper. It would count as a major shock if Rickie Fowler and Bubba Watson were not confirmed as US team members by the man who presided over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/01/ryder-cup-europe-win-medinah\" title=\"\">such a painful defeat at Medinah in 2012</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/30/ryder-cup-darren-clarke-rookies-prosper\">Darren Clarke backs his Ryder Cup wild cards and rookies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fowler finds himself in the midst of a curious year, which has been dogged by under-performance since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/24/rickie-fowler-hsbc-championship\" title=\"\">his victory in Abu Dhabi in January</a>. Fowler\u2019s 2016 major displays \u2013 he has finished no better than a share of 33rd and failed to survive for the weekend in two of them \u2013 has proven especially strange.</p> <p>And yet, partly because of the popularity and energy he brings to a team environment, added to the capability of providing special moments, it seems inconceivable that Fowler would not don US colours at Hazeltine. The same applies to Watson, ranked No7 in the world. Watson, like Fowler, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/22/bubba-watson-northern-trust-open-rory-mcilroy\" title=\"\">won in the early part of the year</a> and, also like Fowler, subsequently discovered the harsh realities of majors. \u201cRickie is starting to make some putts and he is feeling confident with his game,\u201d said Love. \u201cYou listen to what he\u2019s saying, he\u2019s excited about it. Rickie is trending up, that\u2019s the great thing. He\u2019s playing very, very well.\u201d</p> <p>Given Hazeltine can stretch to more than 7,600 yards, the perception is that Watson\u2019s distance will become an essential American tool. JB Holmes arguably has a strong enough case for Ryder Cup inclusion even before length off the tee is taken into account but, when it is, that the man from Kentucky currently ranks second on the PGA Tour\u2019s driving distance chart has to be a key factor.</p> <p>Love, however, has pointed to a wider picture. \u201cEverybody just automatically assumes well, it\u2019s big and long and it\u2019s a bomber\u2019s course. But we\u2019ve broken it down a little bit. The assistant captains have cautioned me: \u2018Don\u2019t just think about it this way; think about it from every angle.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s where making pairings is going to be important. Picking a guy for alternate-shot that matches up with a guy, you put two strengths out there. It\u2019s not just length. You have to have a great wedge game and you have to be a good putter. They are pretty big greens and a lot of them have this just kind of big, general up-and-over slope. So you have to be a good lag putter; you have to be a great iron player. It\u2019s going to be hard to get close to the hole if it\u2019s windy.</p> <p>\u201cSo a lot of factors go into it. But the course is going to be a big part of how we make our pairings. Everybody generally on both teams is long. You\u2019re either long or you\u2019re really long. I think that\u2019s what it boils down to.

  "<p>Whatever Novak Djokovic\u2019s protestations to the contrary, the prevailing sentiment around Flushing Meadows, supported by the visual evidence, is the defending champion is less than fully fit as he reaches for his third US Open title against Stan Wawrinka on Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s behind me,\u201d Djokovic said on Friday night of his collection of medical woes \u2013 left wrist, right elbow, both shoulders \u2013 \u201cso I don\u2019t have any concerns.\u201d</p> <p>If that is not so, if those suspicions are given life on what is expected to be another humid and draining afternoon and Djokovic collapses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/10/stan-wawrinka-to-face-djokovic-in-us-open-final-after-win-over-kei-nishikori\" title=\"\">against one of the strongest men in tennis</a>, it might not only reduce the showpiece event to farce, but will draw into sharp focus an important underlying theme of this final slam of the season.</p> <p>If it goes longer than three sets, there will probably be moments when the trainer appears \u2013 and more than likely for the right reasons. Modern tennis is one of the most demanding sports on the planet. But the rules need tightening. If the final is to be both a test of will and talent, each contestant must answer the same questions according to the same rules, and there are too many grey areas at the moment to be sure that is always the case. In an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/sep/09/novak-djokovic-gael-monfils-us-open-mens-tennis-live\" title=\"\">environment of suffering</a>, it is natural to give someone the benefit of the doubt.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/sep/09/novak-djokovic-gael-monfils-us-open-mens-tennis-live\">Novak Djokovic defeats Ga\u00ebl Monfils to make US Open final \u2013\u00a0as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For most of the fortnight, too many players have struggled to stay upright long enough to compete on level terms. Djokovic himself has been the beneficiary of a veritable train-crash of a walkover and two retirements \u2013 Jiri Vesely (whose arm injury prevented him playing at all), Mikhail Youzhny (hamstring) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/07/novak-djokovic-into-us-open-semi-finals-after-jo-wilfried-tsonga-retires\" title=\"\">and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga</a> (knee) \u2013 all the while guarding his own frailties in the most unexpectedly benign circumstances.</p> <p>No other player in the Open era has reached the semi-finals of a grand slam tournament like this \u2013 giving up 40 games in six matches, with two of them unfinished. Along the way, Djokovic has had to cope with his own minor hiccups and, as is his right, he has used the rules to help him.</p> <p>He was cruising against Kyle Edmund in the fourth round until broken in the third set, and immediately called for the trainer, who massaged his right elbow. Djokovic recovered quickly and won in&#xa0;style.</p> <p>In his weird semi-final against Monfils, again Djokovic was in command, albeit struggling briefly to cope with the Frenchman\u2019s eccentricities in the first set, until his shoulders gave up on him: first the right, then the left. Each time he benefited from the rest and recovered steadily from a break of service to complete the win.</p> <p>Yet he maintained in both incidents that there was no problem, that he was physically OK and he would be in good condition for his next match. There was nothing underhand about this, but the denials didn\u2019t seem to fit the picture. If Djokovic was fit, why call for the trainer?</p> <p>Medical assistance in a tennis match, either the longer version where a player can leave the battle, or on court during changeovers or breaks in play, should be for a problem that needs treating, not to help a player \u201creset\u201d, to use the locker-room jargon.</p> <p>Others have had contrasting experiences at this tournament. When Dan Evans asked for a medical time-out at a stressful moment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/03/dan-evans-stan-wawrinka-us-open-tennis-match-report\" title=\"\">towards the end of his epic struggle with Wawrinka</a> in the third round, the tournament physio refused because he thought he was \u201ccramping\u201d. The rules forbid extended treatment for \u201closs of condition\u201d. Evans insisted he had a problem with foot pain. It was, he conceded later, a pre-existing condition but it had become worse during the match. He felt hard done by, with some justification.</p> <p>As the 1987 Wimbledon champion, Pat Cash, pointed out with exquisite timing on his ever-interesting blog on Friday, there are ways to finesse these situations. Players will complain of a minor injury, real or imagined, while actually getting relief from the physical rigour and mental strain of the match, often after being broken, as well. Perhaps reputation helps, sometimes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2015/jun/07/novak-djokovic-stanislas-wawrinka-mens-french-open-final-live\">Stanislas Wawrinka beats Novak Djokovic in men's French Open final \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And so to the final: after a tricky semi-final and an otherwise relaxed progress through the card, Djokovic looks dangerous. The ball popped pleasingly off his racket against Monfils and he was moving again like the jaguar of the court he is, ready to pounce on the merest half-chance.</p> <p>If it comes down to pure tennis, Djokovic starts as a rightful favourite against the world No3, whom he has beaten 19 times in 23 matches. However, Wawrinka has an ace: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2015/jun/07/novak-djokovic-stanislas-wawrinka-mens-french-open-final-live\" title=\"\">that extraordinary win over the Serb</a> in four sets in the French Open final last year.</p> <p>For a set and more his fabled single-handed backhand did not quite click and an embarrassing wipeout seemed certain. But Wawrinka felt good in the shot and those balls finally began to land, rally after rally, to the point where Djokovic had no answers. It all ended in tears.</p> <p>So the Serb will not lack for motivation against an opponent who has won 10 finals in a row. For that reason alone, it could be a memorable contest. Wawrinka looked powerful and full of running in quelling the challenge of Kei Nishikori in their semi-final and there is no reason to believe he is at anything less than 100%.</p> <p>Both finalists will carry the cumulative baggage of a long season, and the conditions will ask extra questions of them. It is the answers that will be intriguing. It would be encouraging for the integrity of the sport and the event if neither of them needed the assistance of the trainer and just put it all on the line, without excuses.</p> <p>I have a feeling Djokovic has enough left to win his third US title but this match will be the first genuine test of his inner strength.</p>",

  "<p>Tensions between Facebook and the news industry boiled over this week when the social media corporation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/08/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-napalm-girl-photo-vietnam-war\">censored</a> a Pulitzer-winning Vietnam war photo, because it featured a naked child and violated site \u201ccommunity standards\u201d.</p> <p>The dispute over the \u201cnapalm girl\u201d image, which a Norwegian writer published in a post about <a href=\"http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kommentar/Dear-Mark-I-am-writing-this-to-inform-you-that-I-shall-not-comply-with-your-requirement-to-remove-this-picture-604156b.html\">historic warfare photography</a>, ended Friday when Facebook <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/09/facebook-reinstates-napalm-girl-photo\">reversed its decision</a>, acknowledging the \u201cglobal importance of this image in documenting a particular moment in time\u201d.</p> <p>But the spat has exposed what journalists and ethicists say are fundamental flaws in the way Facebook controls and spreads news. Critics say the company\u2019s decisions were driven by PR concerns and should serve as a wake-up call to free speech advocates about how powerful Facebook has become\u2013 and how ill-equipped the corporation is for its role, however unwilling, in journalism.</p> <p>Some hope the scandal will be a turning point for CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who critics say has a moral obligation to recognize his role as the \u201cworld\u2019s most powerful editor\u201d and take meaningful steps to make Facebook accountable for what it distributes. </p> <p>\u201cWhat Facebook has to do now is think very hard about what it really means to be a publisher,\u201d said Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. \u201cIf they don\u2019t,\u201d she warned, \u201cthis is going to happen to them over and over again.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018We need more than just algorithms\u2019</h2> <p>Whether Facebook and media executives like to admit it, the social media site now plays a vital role in how people consume news, carrying an influence that is difficult to overstate. Studies have <a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/07/new-pew-data-more-americans-are-getting-news-on-facebook-and-twitter/\">repeatedly</a> found that Facebook has become the <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/09/24/how-social-media-is-reshaping-news/\">primary news source</a> for many people, and that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/15/facebooks-news-publishers-reuters-institute-for-the-study-of-journalism\">publishers\u2019 revenues</a> have been hit hard as a result. </p> <p>To some journalists, the decline in advertising revenue is less alarming than what the row over the war photo revealed: Facebook\u2019s control over the news has become so vast that it could censor stories in ways that deeply threaten the free press.</p> <p>Whether Facebook knows what to do with that power is an open question.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost like these are kids playing with a toy above their age bracket,\u201d said Jane Kirtley, professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota. \u201cWe surely need something more than just algorithms. We need people who are sentient beings who will actually stop and analyze these things.\u201d</p> <p>Zuckerberg has refused to acknowledge that Facebook is a publisher or <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/08/30/facebook-media-company/\">media company</a>, instead sticking to the labels of \u201ctech company\u201d and \u201cplatform\u201d. But the idea of an unbiased platform was recently called into question when it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/09/facebook-newsfeed-censor-conservative-news\">revealed </a>that Facebook staff curated news articles in its \u201ctrending\u201d section.</p> <p>The company then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/29/facebook-fires-trending-topics-team-algorithm\">fired the team</a> that managed the trending pieces and let an algorithm take over, and Facebook immediately began <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/29/facebook-trending-news-editors-fake-news-stories\">pushing fake and vulgar stories</a> into users\u2019 feeds.</p> <p>\u201cFacebook wants to have the responsibility of a publisher but also to be seen as a neutral carrier of information that is not in the position of making news judgments,\u201d said Jim Newton, a former Los Angeles Times editor who teaches journalism ethics at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they are going to be able to navigate that in the long term.\u201d</p> <p>Bell said Facebook was a \u201cspectacularly well resourced and brilliant organization from a technological perspective\u201d \u2013 and that its editorial efforts should start to reflect that rigor and dedication. Some have called for someone responsible for tough newsroom decisions to take over: an editor in duties and title.</p> <p>\u201cFacebook needs an editor \u2013 to stop Facebook from editing,\u201d Jeff Jarvis, journalism professor at the City University of New York, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffjarvis/dear-mark-zuckerberg-d0b48675dfaf#.gvnedan3c\">wrote</a> on Friday. \u201cIt needs someone to save Facebook from itself by bringing principles to the discussion of rules.\u201d</p> <p>Jarvis argued that Facebook should allow editors of reputable news organizations to make key decisions related to how they use the platform \u2013 such as publishing a war photo that may technically violate policy. A Facebook editor could intervene when there are disagreements, he said.</p> <p>Edward Wasserman, dean of the University of California, Berkeley journalism school, said Facebook should create a team of journalists to address these complex issues \u2013 instead of reacting on reflex when a mistake goes viral.</p> <p>\u201cIf they are in the news business, which they are, then they have to get into the world of editorial judgement.\u201d </p> <h2>\u2018Black boxes\u2019 that no one understands</h2> <p>To some in media, a key first step to making Facebook a respectable news publisher is increased transparency.</p> <p>Aside from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/12/facebook-trending-news-leaked-documents-editor-guidelines\">leaked documents</a>, the public knows little about how Facebook\u2019s algorithms work and what role employees play. Both algorithms and editors can be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/08/artificial-intelligence-beauty-contest-doesnt-like-black-people\">heavily biased</a>, and until Facebook is more open about how and why certain news stories are permitted and promoted, the company will continue to earn the ire of journalists, whose stories can live or die by Facebook.</p> <p>\u201cFacebook and Google are like black boxes. Nobody understands the algorithms except the people inside,\u201d said Jonathan Taplin, former director of the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg Innovation Lab.</p> <p>Without knowledge of how Facebook determines a war photo is pornographic, there is an assumption that a machine or an ignorant low-level staffer made the call \u2013 and there is no one to hold accountable. </p> <p>\u201cIt was probably a human who is 22 years old and has no fucking idea about the importance of the [napalm] picture,\u201d Taplin said.</p> <p>While news organizations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-scott-trust/2015/jul/26/the-scott-trust\">like the Guardian</a> operate as a public trust, Facebook has a different agenda, he added.

The Syrian air force would stay out of zones being targeted by the US and Russia. The US is also aiming to convince other rebel groups to separate themselves from al-Nusra Front where they have been fighting the regime together.</p> <p>\u201cToday the United States and Russia are announcing a plan which we hope will reduce violence, reduce suffering and resume movement toward a negotiated peace and a transition in Syria ... that, if followed, has the ability to provide a turning point, a moment of change,\u201d Kerry said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/07/water-supplies-in-syria-deteriorating-fast-due-to-conflict-experts-warn\">Water supplies in Syria deteriorating fast due to conflict, experts warn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lavrov said he hoped the ceasefire would lead to the prompt resumption of negotiations over Syria\u2019s political future.

They were the dominant side from the off, and though the football wasn\u2019t always fluent, most of the stuff that was came from them, and Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s hat-trick was a thoroughly accomplished one. Rangers had their moments, many of them flowing through Windass, but they were outclassed at both ends of the pitch in the end. Senderos\u2019s needless dismissal summed up their afternoon.</p> <p>\u201cTop six looks like the extent of Rangers ambition this year,\u201d writes Simon McMahon. \u201cThe Ronny Deila era at Celtic Park already seems a long time ago.\u201d I guess we\u2019ll find out just how long ago when Brendan Rodgers\u2019s side face the rather more formidable talents of Barcelona on Tuesday. Rangers have a way to go yet, on this evidence, before they can become title contenders.</p> <p>Anyway, that\u2019s me done for the afternoon. Thanks for your company and comments.

So, after a few years\u2019 hiatus, the intoxicating rivalry resumes, amid breathless hype, re-scratching of old wounds, ancient enmities, and a grudging resentment from fans of other clubs at the obsession over this one fixture at the expense of anything and everything else. But enough about Guardiola v Mourinho and the Manchester derby, for the Old Firm rivalry is back! back! back!</p> <p>Not that it ever really went away, of course, with the circumstances of Rangers\u2019 reconstitution becoming a kind of proxy battleground for all the old hostility. So Rangers are either back in their rightful place after being vengefully dumped on by the rest of Scottish football (not helped by their own internal boardroom strife), or an entirely new club, given a leg-up by dint of historic reputation and institutional bias. Whatever your views, CORRESPONDENCE ON THIS SUBJECT IS CLOSED.</p> <p>Let\u2019s talk about the football. There\u2019s no doubt that Celtic are the favourites on paper, their unchallenged domestic dominance over the past five years giving them an in-built advantage. In theory anyway. The well-received appointment of Brendan Rodgers has brightened the mood at Parkhead and they\u2019ve won all three of their league games this season. The contrast in status is illustrated by the fact that while this is undoubtedly Rangers\u2019 biggest game of the season so far, it\u2019s not even Celtic\u2019s biggest this week \u2013 Tuesday\u2019s Big Cup damage-limitation exercise in Barcelona will undoubtedly be on Parkhead minds. And while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/scottish-premiership/table\">top of the early-season table</a> may look like any other Scottish top flight table from the past 100 years, Rangers have not been mightily convincing in nestling in behind Celtic in second place.</p> <p>However, Marc Warburton is a smart manager and his side were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/17/celtic-rangers-scottish-cup-semi-final-match-report\">deserved winners of the most recent derby</a>, last year\u2019s Scottish Cup semi-final, and then played their part in arguably the most raucously entertaining major domestic match played in Britain last season, the Scottish Cup final defeat to Hibs, even if the aftermath was a tad ugly. They will provide a stern test for Brendan Rodgers\u2019s side, whose aptitude in pressure situations remains unproven, given the dreadful performance in Israel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/23/hapoel-beer-sheva-celtic-champions-league-qualifier-match-report\">against Hapoel Beer-Sheva</a> that almost turfed them out of the Champions League.</p> <p>There\u2019s some interesting team speculation to chew over too \u2013 will Leigh Griffiths be fit? How will the much-trailed Scott Brown v Joey Barton midfield square-up pan out? Will Joe Garner, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sek8FbRQKw0\">a striker with an eye for a spectacular finish</a>, get a start for Rangers? Neither side looks entirely convincing at the back so we might expect goals today. May football be the winner, whatever happens. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-10T09:43:43.572Z\">at 10.43am BST</time></p>  </div>",

By day three, they say, it is an almost entirely mental endeavour. </p> <p>That said, there is much that can be done in the weeks or so before a major event. Tapering has long since entered the vocabulary of professional and amateur cyclists, but there remains little agreement on how best to achieve the perfect start-line condition. Most agree that the training load should diminish significantly in the days before a sportive or <em>gran fondo</em>, but for a multi-stage event is there a risk that slowing up could shock the body into lethargy? </p> <p>Alex Dowsett, the former world hour record holder on the track and professional rider for Movistar, says the key to successful tapering is honing the \u201ctop end\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThe majority of the work\u2019s been done and it\u2019s time to fine-tune,\u201d explains the 27-year-old who runs his own training programme called <a href=\"http://www.cyclism.com/\">Cyclism</a>. \u201cThe strength and endurance phases should be done, and in weeks three and two there\u2019ll likely be fewer hours spent in the saddle but much more quality within what you do; so shorter, sharper but harder intervals with bigger rests between them.\u201d <br></p> <p>As the workload reduces, he says, so too should food intake. This view is supported by Charlotte Kennedy, a nutritionist with Etixx, the sports nutrition company that works with a host of pro-teams. She says tapering riders\u2019 training should be matched by a slightly reduced intake of carbohydrates, and a dramatically reduced intake of all things on the treat list. Alcohol, she says, should be wholly eschewed for the final fortnight, if not before, and now is the time to sacrifice that slice of cake on the weekly cafe ride. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bike-blog/2016/jul/29/maratona-dles-dolomites-fighting-the-fear-in-face-of-daunting-cycling-challenges\">Maratona dles Dolomites: fighting 'the fear' in face of daunting challenge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dowsett says: \u201cYour food intake should reduce a little, but don\u2019t overdo it; you need to make sure you\u2019re well fuelled to make the most of these sessions but not too much that you\u2019re gaining weight, considering the mountains you have ahead of you.\u201d </p> <p>In the final week, it is all about rest. \u201cThe last week is where you won\u2019t gain anything but can certainly ruin it all. This is really the taper week,\u201d he says. \u201cIt should be a mix of easy rides and a few leg-loosener intervals in there, just to maintain what you have. </p> <p>\u201cThis is where you really freshen up for the event.

  "<p>The relationship that changed me was the relationship that made me \u2013 a common enough paradox. </p> <p>Between the ages of 11 and 14, I had an English teacher whom, for everybody\u2019s sake, I will call Mr B. During those crucial years, he dominated my intellectual development, and today he is the little man in my head. Mr B taught he how to read and how to write. He was the man who taught me how to do the things that have become myself. He distorted me into the person I am. <br></p> <p> I suppose a school in suburban Edmonton, Alberta, in western Canada in the 1980s, is as good a place as any to encounter a presiding spirit. The location could not have been less remarkable. The school itself, set down on an enormous field overlooking a freeway, looked like an abandoned strip mall with only one door. It was a private school in the sense that my parents paid for me to attend but it should by no means be confused with British private schools. We wore uniforms, but mainly because it was cheaper for our parents. It possessed the opposite of glamour. </p> <p>The school was a stark somewhat Calvinist throwback, with an educational philosophy that can be summed up as \u201cit was better the way it was.\u201d We did logarithms rather than \u201cthe new math\u201d. We read from The Canadian Readers, collections of imperialist tidbits published in the 1920s, rather than the new nationalist, multicultural anthologies that emerged in the wake of the signing of the Canadian constitution in 1982. </p> <p> Even by the standards of this environment, Mr B was eccentrically antiquated. We would stand at our desks when any teacher entered the room, but Mr B insisted we stand at attention when he entered, and then at ease, before we sat. He wore tight white shirts, often sleeveless, and narrow ties, like a 1960s junior executive at the Rand Corporation. He frequently barked. He insisted we all sit still or stand still when we were not engaged in productive effort.</p> <p> My education in middle school was not significantly different from the education pioneer schoolchildren received 100 years earlier in one-room log cabin schools, both in its moral underpinning and in its content. We learned the components of sentences: subjects, verbs, objects, which always went in that order. Sentences could contain subjective clauses, objective clauses and adjectival clauses. By using or refraining from using these elements, we wrote simple sentences or compound sentences or compound-complex sentences. Simple sentences were always best. In grade seven, we worked only on individual sentences, in grade eight on single paragraphs, and then finally in grade nine on arguments. </p> <p> It was all mechanical. Each argument worked exactly the same way, beginning with the inverted triangle approach to the introductory paragraph, moving from the general to the particular and concluding with a thesis statement. (If you want an example, look at the opening paragraph of this essay.) The introductory paragraph was to be followed by supporting examples and concluding with a restatement of the thesis and a concluding paragraph moving from the particular back out to the general. </p> <p>There was only ever one correct way to write \u2013 the clearest and most economical way. There was no room for expression; there was only writing correctly or incorrectly. Mr B taught me the Aristotelian rhetorical method: logos (be right), ethos (be decent), pathos (be charming) and in that order.</p> <p>There were other tricks, too. He taught me that it\u2019s easier to make an argument when you don\u2019t know anything about the subject. He taught me that it\u2019s easier to make an argument that you disagree with. It\u2019s easier to write when the business of writing is a question of technique alone. I have always remembered these lessons. </p> <p> These practical matters would have been enough, but of course like every powerful teacher \u2013 whether good or evil \u2013 he imbued me with his example. Mr B was the first case in my life of a grown-up man who believed in literature. The tepid little anecdotes and doggerel in The Canadian Readers found no love in his heart. Mr B wanted real poetry. It was much more than love. It was belief. My introduction to writing was old-fashioned, traditional but my introduction to reading literature was just plain weird. </p> <p>Only later, on my way to a PhD in early modern drama, did I realize how deeply eccentric Mr B\u2019s taste was. He believed that romanticism, specifically Wordsworth\u2019s theory of literary expression as \u201cthe spontaneous overflow of powerful emotion\u201d, had been the death of literature. With the abandonment of technical facility as an ideal, literature has wandered from the high mountains of the mastery of thought and word into the swamps of self-expression. He taught us mainly the poets of the Renaissance: Ben Jonson, Sir Philip Sidney, Wyatt, Spenser, Donne. Shakespeare was a treat. And one very fine day, in the ninth grade, when the class had been particularly well-behaved and efficient, he allowed us Alexander Pope. There could be no higher mark of his approval, that he believed we were ready to read The Essay on Man. </p> <p> I was by no means Mr B\u2019s favorite student. I was messy in personal appearance, and my handwriting was poor, and these matters of discipline mattered to him. Nonetheless he did once lend me a book. I don\u2019t remember why, although I certainly remember the book. It was a collection of the writings of Lord Denning, a British jurist remembered, if at all, for adjudicating the Profumo case. He had a literary style, borrowed from the aggressive simplicity of legal briefs, that was basic to the point of being off-putting. The clarity can be unnerving. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>This newcomer has built, or has had built for him, a house on the edge of the cricket ground which four years ago was a field where cattle grazed. The animals did not mind the cricket. But now this adjoining field has been turned into a housing estate. The newcomer bought one of the houses on the edge of the cricket ground. No doubt the open space was a selling point. Now he complains that when a batsman hits a six the ball has been known to land in his garden or on or near his house. His wife has got so upset about it that they always go out at weekends. They do not go into the garden when cricket is being played. They say that this is intolerable.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Denning\u2019s was a style so basic that it amounted to the avant-garde. Imagine giving such a book to a 12-year-old boy, as a way of introducing him to the joys of writing. Then imagine that gift working. </p> <p>There was a radical edge to Mr B. He must have been influenced by Glenn Gould, I think \u2013 they were both passionate in their overweening love of restraint. Whenever I see those moving literary teachers \u2013 from Miss Jean Brodie up to Robin Williams in Dead Poets Society \u2013 they always open their students\u2019 minds up to the glamorous potential within themselves. Mr B had no time for such nonsense. He believed that writing was like plumbing, but that was no insult. He believed that writing could aspire to be as useful and necessary as plumbing. He wanted art to reach that quiet dignity.</p> <p>If our relationship ended, and I\u2019m not entirely sure it has ended, it ended simply because I went to high school. There was, needless to say, no outward expression of emotion, no fond farewell. His vision of language was one that aspired to pure functionality, a language of communication. He communicated more information to me than any other person. But his main point, as a teacher, was not to say what didn\u2019t have to be said. What would goodbye mean? What purpose would it serve?</p> <p> I had a hit a few months ago \u2013 an op-ed in the New York Times<em> </em>on <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/opinion/sunday/the-closing-of-the-canadian-mind.html\">the Closing of the Canadian Mind</a> that received 400,000 plus Facebook shares and millions of readers. Someone sent me a picture of a clipping of the thing taped to the window of a storefront, which is pretty much the ultimate compliment for an opinion piece. It was written exactly the way Mr B taught me to write an essay in grade seven. His stuff works. I make my living by virtue of his instruction \u2013the connection is absolutely direct.</p> <p> Mr B made me and broke me because, through him, I came to believe that obsessive passion over the quality of linguistic expression was the most important thing in life. Despite ample enough experience, I am unable to shake this conviction. </p> <p> And now I must go back over this essay, looking for the places where Mr B would disapprove. </p> <p><em>For other essays in this series, go on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/you-changed-me\">You Changed Me </a>page.</em></p>",

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>During the winter of early 2014 Jones\u2019s only chance for serenity was these late hours. The CIA was demanding his boss, Senate intelligence committee chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, fire him. Feinstein\u2019s Republican colleagues, once supportive of Jones, were demanding he testify.</p> <p>Testimony was treacherous. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island senator and former federal prosecutor, warned Jones that asserting his rights against self-incrimination or seeking a lawyer\u2019s counsel could give committee Republicans a political lever against his highly controversial work. The CIA would soon formally insist that the US justice department actually prosecute Jones, the Senate staffer who had devoted over six years of his life to investigating the CIA\u2019s infamous post-9/11 torture program.<br></p> <p>Jones, a former FBI counter-terrorism analyst, wanted to testify. The CIA had pushed him past the point where he could back down. Its lies, documented in a 6,700-page secret report which Jones was constantly rewriting that winter, were compounding: to Congress, to Barack Obama, to George W Bush, to the press, to the public. The lies were not random misstatements. They were directional, in the service of covering up the brutality of what it did to at least 119 terrorist suspects \u2013 some clearly innocent \u2013 it held in a global network of secret prisons. Jones was on the verge of exposing the coverup. As he saw it, the personalized intensity of the CIA\u2019s attacks on him, and the unprecedented steps they were taking, validated the account he had compiled after combing through over 6m classified CIA documents. </p> <p>Jones put his Bose earbuds in, cued up a Tragically Hip record, and ran. </p> <p>It couldn\u2019t be that long of a lap, just enough to clear his head and work the frustrations out. Jones would need to be back in the Senate intelligence committee\u2019s secured, classified offices very soon. Each day brought a new calculation: it might be the last that the committee had access to its own classified report. The CIA had gone \u201cinto war mode\u201d with its congressional overseers, Jones told the Guardian. There was no choice but to work deeply into the night, leaving Capitol Hill at 3 or 4 in the morning, with breaks only for a run, and then back to work by 8 or 9 to repeat the cycle.</p> <p>Less than a year had passed since the CIA had communicated to the Senate that its exhaustive torture report, drawn from millions of the agency\u2019s own documents, was significantly incorrect. Less than a year had passed since Jones, unbeknownst to the CIA, had locked in a committee safe crucial portions of one such record, called the Panetta Review, in which the CIA had come to the same conclusions about torture as Jones had. But now the agency was letting the committee know it was not playing around \u2013 and that it was coming for Jones himself. </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>From August to September 2013 Jones had more than a dozen meetings with agency officials lasting 60 hours to attempt to reconcile their objections with findings in his 6,700-page classified report. It got to the point where Jones would take a whiteboard with him. That way, he could sketch out the timelines he found in CIA cables for when the agency learned specific aspects of its terrorism intelligence. He attempted to demonstrate contradictions from what the CIA said publicly \u2013 and how the claimed basis for those CIA statements occurred before this-or-that torture session the agency said was the genesis of the information. </p> <p>\u201cIt should be noted that at no point in those discussions did [Senate] staff ask CIA to reconcile the CIA June 2013 response to the Panetta Review,\u201d said CIA spokesman Ryan Trapani. \u201cIn fact, at no time in those discussions did [committee] staff indicate that they had a copy of the Panetta Review.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Support the Guardian\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;html&gt;

Feinstein was concerned Jones was too close to the report to be objective, but she backed his decision. With the report stuck in limbo, she gave him a new challenge: redo the report, incorporating aspects of the CIA\u2019s response, and putting what they found to be wrong about that response in the footnotes.<br></p> <p>\u201cBasically, her thing was: make them own their response,\u201d Jones said. The effect was to expand a 250-page executive summary to over 500 pages, \u201cdoubling the amount of information\u201d, all as the CIA continued to object. The agency and the committee were arraying for battle.</p> <p>Just before Thanksgiving, Feinstein formally wrote to CIA director John Brennan requesting the entire 1,000-plus page Panetta Review. Jones had not taken the full document back from the satellite location, only the sections necessary to show busy senators that the agency concluded it had misled its political masters about the futility of its torture. The CIA said it would not provide it. This time, it would be Feinstein\u2019s allies on the committee who escalated.</p> <p>On 17 December, the CIA sent its choice for its next top attorney, Caroline Krass, to the committee for a nomination hearing. Shortly before the hearing, a CIA attorney, Darrin Hostetler, met with Jones in private, once again sparring over the agency\u2019s response. Once again, Jones reminded Hostetler that the Panetta Review supported his conclusions. \u201cI\u2019m done talking to you, Dan,\u201d Hostetler said, ending the meeting. An agency official who worked with Jones at the satellite location apologized to Jones for Hostetler\u2019s behavior.<br></p> <p>During the hearing, Mark Udall, a Colorado Democrat, lit into Krass. Unexpectedly, Udall mentioned the existence of the Panetta Review in public for the first time, demanding the disclosure of the document. Among the reasons for Udall\u2019s fervor: in August 2013, after the CIA had condemned the committee report in contradiction of the Panetta Review, its former chief lawyer Stephen Preston told Udall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/799469-qfr-udall-preston-8-09-13-responses.html\">in writing</a> that the agency provided the committee with \u201cinaccurate information related to aspects of the [torture] program\u201d \u2013 a major point the CIA was now disputing.<br> </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk3ut21ksJ0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qk3ut21ksJ0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Jones was <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?316835-1/senate-intelligence-cmte-considers-cia-state-nominees\">visible on the staff dias behind Udall</a>. Hostetler walked out of the hearing. </p> <p>\u201cThen things totally went to hell,\u201d Jones said. </p> <p>Unbeknownst to Jones, Udall or Feinstein, the public reference to the Panetta Review so alarmed the CIA as to prompt a milestone event in its history. Since 2009, the CIA had maintained a firewalled network on which the Senate could view internal documents relevant to its torture inquiry. It was known as RDINet, for \u201crendition, detention and interrogation.\u201d By mutual agreement, the CIA was not supposed to access the Senate\u2019s side of the network for any reason aside from picayune IT help. But at least five agency officials would surreptitiously transgress the network firewalls, view the Senate investigators\u2019 work, and reconstruct Jones\u2019s emails. Their rationale, established in a subsequent internal investigation, was to determine if the Senate deliberately exploited an evident flaw in the architecture of the network to digitally acquire the Panetta Review \u2013 which they did not want the Senate to have.</p> <p>It was an extreme step. After Congress overhauled the CIA in the 1970s, the agency was not supposed to spy on Americans domestically except in extremely circumscribed circumstances. Now it was turning its spywork onto the elected officials tasked with overseeing it.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The CIA had gone into war mode</p> <footer> <cite>Daniel Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cEvery officer is clearly, I would say rigorously, trained that CIA is a foreign intelligence service. We have a legal mandate to conduct intelligence operations on non-American entities ... It\u2019s very clear, the distinction, and then elaborate, the working out of what may and may not be done,\u201d said Glenn Carle, a retired CIA officer.</p> <p>Carle continued: \u201cFor the agency to<strong> </strong>penetrate a firewalled network used by the United States Senate is flat criminal activity.

The CIA vigorously disputes that characterization. CIA director Brennan, whom Carle praises as an \u201chonorable guy\u201d, was informed about the firewall breach almost as soon as the agency began its fateful operations. </p> <p>Beginning on 9 January 2014, agency officials created a \u201cdummy account\u201d that looked to the network like it came from Jones\u2019s team, something beyond the limits of the 2009 agreements between the committee and the CIA about network access. They logged in, searched for the Panetta Review on the Senate side of the network and found it. The next day, they searched their own side to determine if they had the Panetta Review. They didn\u2019t find it, presumed they might have been hacked, and set to find out what happened. They took screenshots of what they found. Yet never once did they discuss their findings with Jones, whose technical ineptitude might have disabused them of the theory that he had either deliberately hacked a classified network or been savvy enough to exploit a vulnerability.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"1b0b329a698f3da2a602d8fca479d11c5bc219d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b0b329a698f3da2a602d8fca479d11c5bc219d5/0_0_1300_500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"385\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>CIA headquarters at Langley. 9 January 2014</h2> <p>According to a subsequent inspector-general report, an unnamed CIA official \u2013 whom <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/the-google-search-that-made-the-cia-spy-on-the-us-senate\">Vice News\u2019s Jason Leopold has reported is Hostetler</a> \u2013 got the agency\u2019s Counterintelligence Center involved on 9 January by saying there was a \u201cforthcoming D/CIA tasking\u201d, a reference to Brennan. The unnamed official said Brennan wanted a report by \u201cthat afternoon\u201d into Senate use of the network, stretching from 1 March 2009 to 31 December 2013. The CIA inspector general, David Buckley, would later find that \u201cconflicting information\u201d prevented him from determining \u201cwhether any of D/CIA Brennan\u2019s senior staff, much less the DCI himself, approved any of the taskings.\u201d But an agency attorney, unusually, gave an operational order. </p> <p>Brennan learned at least the outline of what would become the breach on 9 January, the very first day it was conceived. The director would later say he knew then of some review, but did not specifically recall if anyone briefing him explained how they knew the location of, among other documents, the Panetta Review. Brennan discussed the issue with CIA personnel over the next two days, and tasked them to \u201cuse whatever means necessary\u201d to find out how it was that the documents appeared on the Senate side of the firewall. Brennan said he only asked \u201care we sure\u201d the documents were genuine CIA material and that he desired a better understanding of how RDINet worked. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>[The CIA] was turning its spywork onto the elected officials tasked with overseeing it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While Brennan would later say he denied directing anyone at the CIA to examine the Senate\u2019s use of the system, the technical staff, examined and passed around screenshots of what was on the Senate network drives. By 11 January \u2013 a Saturday \u2013 the CIA official Vice identified as Hostetler spoke with Brennan and learned Brennan had discussed the issue with Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff and a powerful ally. The official would later say he believed himself authorized by Brennan \u201cto gather the necessary agency personnel and components who would normally be involved in such an effort\u201d.</p> <p>Hostetler, through a representative, declined to speak with the Guardian. Nor did the White House make McDonough available for an interview. But an official said: \u201cNeither Denis McDonough nor anyone else at the White House was notified of the searches before they began. As such, and to be sure, the White House did not authorize them.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, 13 January, a meeting gathered, chaired by the third-highest ranking official at CIA, Meroe Park, and attended by Counterintelligence Center personnel. Their concern was determining if there was an \u201cinnocent\u201d or nefarious explanation for the Senate\u2019s acquisition of the Panetta Review, something Brennan would need to know. The meeting heard how it would be possible to perform an operation to find out, one that would involve intrusive digital forensics on their Senate overseers. An attendee would later say no one in attendance objected. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d0d2bcfd91db88d7924a1900732a9144bea6d3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d0d2bcfd91db88d7924a1900732a9144bea6d3c/231_750_848_453/500.jpg\" alt=\"From a report released by the CIA inspector general in July 2014\" width=\"500\" height=\"267\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><br></p> <p>Brennan learned of this discussion the next day, 14 January. Multiple official accounts have Brennan essentially alarmed to hear that senior counterintelligence officials were involved in what could easily be understood as spying on the Senate. Brennan indicated a concern that the optics of the situation were perilous for the CIA. He ordered the work stopped \u2013 what he would tell the inspector general was a \u201cstand down\u201d order. The official Vice reported is Hostetler characterized it merely as a \u201cpause\u201d.<br></p> <p>On 15 January 2014, Brennan called an emergency discussion with Feinstein and top committee Republican Saxby Chambliss. They met in a secured room on the Hill. Brennan had brought the acting top CIA lawyer, Robert Eatinger, whom Jones had discovered had provided legal advice to the agency\u2019s Counterterrorist Center, which was deeply involved in the torture. If Brennan was worried, he did not convey that to the senators. </p> <p>Brennan read a statement. He revealed that the agency had conducted a \u201csearch\u201d of the computer network it had set up for the Senate \u2013 unlike every previous investigation at the agency, the CIA had demanded it only produce documentation on torture at a facility it controlled \u2013 and discovered that the Senate investigators had inappropriate access to the Panetta Review. The staffers, he said, had to be \u201cdisciplined\u201d. A CIA network, Brennan was implying, had been compromised. (The CIA would not comment on this meeting, but pointed to <a href=\"http://images.politico.com/global/2014/03/11/brennanltrrereview.pdf\">a 27 January letter from Brennan to Feinstein</a> to characterize it.)</p> <p>Jones understood Brennan\u2019s statement to be a demand for the senators to fire him. Brennan didn\u2019t use his name, but Jones was the chief investigator, the one constantly and most consistently working at the CIA facility. On multiple levels, Jones was shocked. Not only was the director of the CIA telling his legislative overseers that their choice to conduct oversight was unacceptable, he was revealing that the network operated in a manner that the Senate thought \u201cwas impossible\u201d, with the CIA able to access the Senate\u2019s investigative work. </p> <p>Even more startling: although someone at the CIA in 2010 had placed the Panetta Review on the Senate side of the network, Brennan was suggesting that Jones was a master hacker, able to force his way into the CIA\u2019s classified files. In truth, Jones was barely tech-literate: \u201cI am really good at Microsoft Word. That\u2019s it.\u201d </p> <p>But Brennan wasn\u2019t describing the basis for believing his claims. Instead, he told Chambliss and Feinstein the search would not be the CIA\u2019s last. To protect the security of an agency network, Brennan said, the agency would need to conduct more searches, ostensibly to find whatever vulnerability he implied Jones had exploited, and proposed a joint search with Senate assistance. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d31105e43837eec3c79dff16b0a4cf33a65a841e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d31105e43837eec3c79dff16b0a4cf33a65a841e/0_107_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"CIA director John Brennan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Feinstein, in a letter sent two days later, refused. She requested that Brennan not conduct the searches, offering to suspend staff access to the network, and reminded him of the \u201cseparation of powers issues\u201d at stake in the CIA taking such an aggressive step against the Senate. </p> <p>But despite both Feinstein\u2019s refusal and Brennan\u2019s \u201cstand down\u201d order, the CIA continued looking deeper into the Senate\u2019s use of the network. </p> <p>On 16 January, according to CIA documents acquired through the Freedom of Information Act <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/274285608/Senate-Docs-Syp-Wm#from_embed\">by Vice News\u2019s Leopold</a>, the agency called upon a digital unit called the Cyber Blue Team, which hunts for vulnerabilities in agency networks. The next day \u2013 the day Feinstein put her refusal to join an inquiry into her staff in writing to Brennan \u2013 Cyber Blue Team reviewed \u201cforensically reconstructed emails\u201d between Senate staffers only accessible on their side of RDINet. The team prepared a report that same day assessing the Senate use of the network, delivering it to \u201csenior agency leadership\u201d on 21 January. </p> <p>Jones had been able to convince Senate Republicans naturally inclined to believe the CIA that his meager tech skills undermined Brennan\u2019s accusation. But that could hardly win them over in what they were seeing as a battle between the CIA and Senate Democrats. Combative, Jones was prepared to testify about the episode. But while he had no family and little to lose, several of his colleagues on the investigative staff had spouses, children and career ambitions. They would be the casualties of escalation. He opted against testimony. The option would ultimately be overtaken by events. </p> <p>The CIA\u2019s move against the Senate committee quickly showed signs of backfiring. In late January, Buckley, the CIA\u2019s inspector general, confronted Brennan about the on-network searches of the Senate investigators. He told Brennan that he needed to open an investigation \u2013 and Brennan responded by ordering Buckley to investigate. But Buckley went further than Brennan apparently calculated, and referred the matter to the US justice department. Suddenly, the CIA was back in a position its leaders thought it had escaped \u2013 in the crosshairs of potential prosecution.</p> <p>Buckley \u2013 who declined comment to the Guardian \u2013 told the committee of his referral on 4 February, only a week after he started examine the breach. It <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/us/new-inquiry-into-cia-employees-amid-clashes-over-interrogation-program.html\">leaked to the New York Times</a> on 4 March.</p> <p>Agency attorney Eatinger launched what the CIA considered a response necessitated by a theft concern and the committee considered a counter-gambit. On 7 February, the senior lawyer made his own criminal referral to the justice department: this one on Jones, ostensibly for improper network access. Eatinger had a conflict: Jones\u2019s narrative referred to his role in the torture program 1,600 times. It took mere weeks for an account of Senate staff taking the Panetta Review from the CIA offsite location to <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/national-security/article24764827.html\">leak to reporters</a>. To Jones, the whole thing validated the apocryphal credo of spywork: deny everything, admit nothing, make counter-accusations.</p> <p>Everything had escalated past the point of no return. Jones had finished his edits and rewrites to the committee report. It awaited a Senate vote on declassification. But now all of that was overshadowed by a fight with the CIA that had moved into the realm of back and forth criminal accusation. </p> <p>Jones thought the accusation was self-evidently absurd, enough to discredit the agency as engaged in bald-faced retaliation and wounding itself politically. \u201cI was wrong about that. It was actually pretty astute of them,\u201d he recollected.</p> <p>Efforts at de-escalation failed. In mid-January, within days of the network search, Brennan briefed the Senate majority leader, Democrat Harry Reid of Nevada. Reid, who is close to Feinstein, told him that in the interests of avoiding a crisis, Brennan ought to apologize. Brennan flatly refused, insisting the agency had nothing to apologize for. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70a557fee2a6c73b5805f1d1585c08814f22ac9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70a557fee2a6c73b5805f1d1585c08814f22ac9b/0_327_3899_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Senator Harry Reid\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The White House counsel, Kathryn Ruemmler, attempted to contain the damage. Ruemmler came to the Hill that winter, in a series of meetings with both the full committee and its leadership, to take the temperature of Senate-CIA relations down from their white-hot level. According to participants in those meetings, if Brennan was unyielding, Ruemmler was balanced. Feinstein brought up the 2010 document disappearance as a prologue for the current imbroglio. Ruemmler told her she had a valid point. </p> <p>Reid, a pivotal ally for the White House on Capitol Hill, did not want to be backed into a corner. After the criminal referral, Reid spoke to McDonough and conveyed that if Brennan was unwilling to apologize, he was not willing to defend Brennan should the episode become public. McDonough was noncommittal. A week later, Reid received a phone call from Barack Obama.<br></p> <p>To Reid\u2019s surprise, the president defended the CIA\u2019s actions. Obama rattled off the CIA\u2019s side of the story: the Senate staff had taken CIA documents and the agency had no choice but to handle the matter as it did. </p> <p>\u201cMr President,\u201d Reid said, \u201cI wish you could hear yourself.\u201d</p> <p>According to a former senior Senate aide, the episode stiffened Reid\u2019s inclination to defend Feinstein to the hilt. In early March, Reid contacted Feinstein, who was considering exposing the episode, and assured her of his full support in the battle to come. \u201cWe gave them ample opportunity\u201d to settle the issue, he told her. </p> <p>On 11 March, Jones got word that Feinstein was going to say something on the Senate floor. He had written her a speech detailing the origins and developments of the oversight battle with Langley, but he didn\u2019t know if Feinstein would actually deliver it. Feinstein got along well with Brennan on other matters, and taking on Brennan carried the risk of taking on Obama, the president Brennan had cultivated since Obama\u2019s first campaign. </p> <p>Instead, Feinstein laid into the CIA with an intensity unseen since the 1970s Church Committee, where legislators described an unbridled agency that spied on Americans as eagerly as they spied on foreign adversaries. The agency searches \u201cmay have undermined the constitutional framework essential to effective congressional oversight of intelligence activities or any other government function,\u201d Feinstein charged. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/09/dianne-feinstein-cia-torture-report-stain-americas-value-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4439j\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2206945\"            data-video-name=\"Dianne Feinstein on CIA torture report: 'A stain on America's values' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/9/1418145193706/Dianne-Feinstein-015.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-453298225\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/9/1418145193706/Dianne-Feinstein-015.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/12/09/141109Feinstein1_FromGuAmRM-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/12/09/141109Feinstein1_FromGuAmRM.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/12/09/141109Feinstein1_FromGuAmRM/141109Feinstein1_FromGuAmRM.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/12/09/141109Feinstein1_FromGuAmRM_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/12/09/141109Feinstein1_FromGuAmRM_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/09/dianne-feinstein-cia-torture-report-stain-americas-value-video\">Dianne Feinstein on CIA torture report: \u2018A stain on America\u2019s values\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>She foreshadowed the next fight within the committee and wrapped it in the constitution: declassifying the torture report. Not only would a public version ensure torture \u201cwill never again be considered or permitted\u201d, Feinstein said, but the CIA\u2019s reprisal against Jones meant the Senate faced a \u201cdefining moment\u201d testing whether the committee could effectively perform its oversight, \u201cor whether our work can be thwarted by those we oversee\u201d.</p> <p>Feinstein\u2019s speech occurred hours before Brennan had committed to a public appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations. Moderator Andrea Mitchell could not refrain from soliciting a response to Feinstein. To the incredulity of Jones, Brennan, who had been at the very least briefed on all of this from inception \u2013 who had told Feinstein and Chambliss on 15 January it had happened \u2013 denied everything. </p> <p>\u201cAs far as the allegations of, you know, CIA hacking into, you know, Senate computers, nothing could be further from the truth. I mean we wouldn\u2019t do that. I mean, that\u2019s just beyond the \u2013 you know, the scope of reason in terms of what we would do,\u201d Brennan said. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Mr President, I wish you could hear yourself</p> <footer> <cite>Senator Harry Reid</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The years of clashing with the CIA behind closed doors had now exploded into public view. The CIA contacted reporters to provide the agency\u2019s preferred version of events, and observers took a scalpel to distinctions between searching and hacking. The implications of Feinstein\u2019s charges were profound. If the CIA would lie about torture, what else would it lie about? If it would spy on its legislative overseers, who wouldn\u2019t the agency spy on? </p> <p>Shocked by Brennan\u2019s denial, Reid had the Senate sergeant-at-arms conduct his own investigation. Reid wrote to the attorney general, Eric Holder, on 19 March to take into account the \u201cserious separation of powers implications\u201d of the CIA\u2019s search, which he said \u201cseemingly attempted to intimidate [the agency\u2019s] overseers\u201d.</p> <p>The sergeant-at-arms inquiry has been a forgotten aspect of the saga. One knowledgeable source said it ended up inconclusive. CIA\u2019s Trapani noted: \u201cDespite pledges of an investigation by the Senate sergeant-at-arms, there is no corresponding public record that sheds light on or explains fully the actions of [committee] staff.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>Feinstein\u2019s speech had another impact, this one intentional. On 3 April, the committee voted 11-3 to authorize a declassified version of the torture report. Senate Republicans who had long rejected the report\u2019s findings joined Democrats who embraced them. Even Chambliss voted in favor of declassification, saying : \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/03/senate-votes-declassify-cia-torture-report\">We need to get this behind us</a>.\u201d </p> <p>Yet the CIA had an ally Feinstein may not have appreciated: the Oval Office. The White House announced that same day that the CIA itself would lead the declassification review. Formally, a White House official told the Guardian, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper spearheaded it. The intelligence community would effectively choose which of its embarrassments to spare the public from learning. </p> <p>Carl Levin, a longtime Democratic senator from Michigan who retired in 2015, said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the White House\u2019s overall lack of support for the committee.</p> <p>\u201cThe White House declined to lead the declassification effort, and instead gave the declassification review to the very agency, the CIA, that the Senate committee was investigating,\u201d Levin told the Guardian.</p> <p>Brennan\u2019s major ally at the White House was someone Jones knew well from a decade before. Chief of staff McDonough had encouraged Jones to join the security apparatus when Jones was an aspirant Senate staffer and McDonough was a Senate leadership aide. McDonough was one of Obama\u2019s closest confidants, with him on his Senate staff , through the presidential campaign and to his tenure as a deputy national security adviser. He assumed his current job right as Brennan, another White House senior staffer and campaign veteran, went to Langley. </p> <p>\u201cDenis played a much more central role in this than any of us thought he would,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe feeling was that he just backed CIA.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>A criminal prosecution does not have to advance particularly far to ruin someone\u2019s life. The arcane provisions of Senate rules place senior staff in an exquisite financial bind. Such staff are banned from receiving gifts worth more than a pittance, as those gifts might be used to purchase influence. But included in that category is pro-bono legal assistance. </p> <p>While senators themselves can get legal aid if needed through campaign funding, they cannot themselves provide it to their staff. Feinstein and her predecessor as committee chair, Jay Rockefeller, set up a defense fund, according to a knowledgable source, but couldn\u2019t actually use it to protect aides facing legal jeopardy.</p> <p>Jones learned all of that when he had to seek legal representation. The cost of the retainer quoted to him made him wince: as a teacher, an FBI officer and a Senate staffer, \u201cI had not amassed a large amount of wealth.\u201d </p> <p>But Jones was single. He did not have children. The potential prosecution of his colleagues on the committee staff who did was having a \u201cdevastating\u201d effect. Emotionally, psychologically, the search scandal hung over everything they did, especially as they were about to do final battle with the CIA over declassification. The longer the process draws out, he said, \u201cyou can destroy someone financially.\u201d </p> <p>But on 30 April, less than a month after the committee voted to declassify the report\u2019s executive summary, the justice department sent word to the CIA attorney that it had \u201cno prosecutorial interest\u201d in pursuing a case against the Senate staffers. It would be the beginning of the Senate\u2019s vindication on this controversy. </p> <p>Jones took no victory lap. His pace was grueling, and they had not even begun the declassification discussions. The Republican senators were still musing about making him testify. The CIA-Senate fight loomed over every conversation with the White House, and in the committee. During that spring and summer, Brennan would still arrive on Capitol Hill to brief the senators on various intelligence matters. Substantive discussion would be consumed by legislators demanding more information about the various investigations around the search, and Brennan declining. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/09/daniel-jones-senate-staffer-cia-spying-interview-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/527pj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2702368\"            data-video-name=\"Daniel Jones: the Senate staffer spied on by the CIA \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"the guardian\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d1e96be4b07ac3d446a54f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/08/20160907DANJONES_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/08/20160907DANJONES.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/08/20160907DANJONES_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/09/daniel-jones-senate-staffer-cia-spying-interview-video\">Daniel Jones: the Senate staffer spied on by the CIA</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Brennan\u2019s position became untenable on 18 July. Buckley, the inspector general, concluded in a classified report that at least five CIA officials \u2013 including, conspicuously, two attorneys \u2013 \u201cimproperly accessed [committee] Majority staff shared drives on the RDINet\u201d. In an ironic echo of the torture report\u2019s findings that the CIA misled the government about its detainee abuse, Buckley called out a \u201clack of candor\u201d among the three technical staff he interviewed. And he found that Eatinger\u2019s prosecutorial referral from February was \u201cunfounded\u201d as it went beyond the findings that the Cyber Blue Team had reached about Senate behavior on RDINet. </p> <p>Although Buckley concluded that the committee and the CIA did not reach \u201csigned memorand[a] of understanding\u201d, his report attached several 2009-era CIA-Senate letters referring to consensus that the only CIA access to RDINet\u2019s committee side would come from IT staff \u201cfor IT maintenance and support\u201d. (\u201cI think we are all in agreement on the computer issue,\u201d an unnamed CIA official had written to the committee back on 8 June 2009.) One of those CIA documents was even called Memorandum of Understanding. It would be an issue in a skirmish to come. </p> <p>The CIA didn\u2019t want the committee staff to have access to Buckley\u2019s report, even in classified form, as it contained the names of agency officials and sensitive units implicated in the episode. But within days, Buckley conveyed his findings to committee senators. While Jones could not attend a members-only briefing, he quickly learned that senators were told, unequivocally, that he had done nothing wrong. </p> <p>\u201cAt that point, I felt significantly vindicated,\u201d Jones said. </p> <p>\u201cThe CIA\u2019s own inspector general found that CIA inappropriately searched the Senate\u2019s computers,\u201d said Levin, the former senator. </p> <p>\u201cThe CIA and the White House held no one accountable for these actions.\u201d</p> <p>Feinstein had a conversation with Brennan shortly afterward. On 31 July, Feinstein put out a statement that included a devastating line: \u201cDirector Brennan apologized for these actions.\u201d It was less categorical than many on the committee wanted. Vice\u2019s Leopold would ultimately acquire and publish a <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/the-google-search-that-made-the-cia-spy-on-the-us-senate\">letter from Brennan formally apologizing</a>, but the director never sent it, opting to apologize \u201cin person for the specific search that went beyond his instructions at the time,\u201d the CIA\u2019s Trapani said. But Feinstein got her desired result: <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/cia-director-brennan-apologizes-senate-leaders-computer-hack-n169706\">headlines</a> around the world indicated Brennan had taken a step back. Udall immediately called on Brennan to resign. Speculation shot through Washington over whether he would.<br></p> <p>\u201cHe admitted that the CIA\u2019s actions were inappropriate, but he continues to deny that searching through a Senate committee\u2019s files and emails is spying on the committee. It\u2019s pretty bizarre when the CIA director doesn\u2019t seem to know what the word \u2018spying\u2019 means,\u201d said Wyden.</p> <p>Jay Rockefeller, the West Virginia Democrat and former committee chairman, did not join Udall in calling for Brennan\u2019s resignation. But, he said, \u201cI did express my profound disappointment to Director Brennan on more than one occasion. My assessment at the time was that, despite Director Brennan having perhaps irreparably damaged his credibility with much of the committee, he was still capable of at least partially redeeming himself by holding people at the CIA accountable and publicly apologizing.\u201d There would be no such public apology.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The CIA and the White House held no one accountable for these actions</p> <footer> <cite>Former senator Carl Levin</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Barely half a year after the CIA had turned its powers against its overseers, the committee had won two consecutive victories. Chambliss, the panel\u2019s top Republican, called on the CIA to deal with the five offending officials \u201cvery harshly\u201d. But the fight was far from over. </p> <p>Brennan announced he would convene an \u201caccountability board\u201d to examine the network-search debacle. More crucially, the very next day, the CIA was set to deliver to the committee the version of the torture report it was comfortable with the public seeing, as Congress and the political world departed for the traditional August recess. If the committee had wanted to release that heavily blacked-out version, it could have done so, and avoided its next battle with the CIA \u2013 and the White House. </p> <p>Unlike in 2010, the White House would not mediate between the agency and the committee. It would simply back John Brennan.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Barack Obama, the president who ended the CIA\u2019s torture program by <a href=\"http:// https://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations\">executive order</a> his second full day in office, entered the White House briefing room on 1 August 2014. \u201cWe tortured some folks,\u201d he memorably said. </p> <p>What Obama said afterward received less attention, but Jones can recount it to this day.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important for us not to feel too sanctimonious in retrospect about the tough job those folks [at the CIA] had,\u201d said the president. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"e7fbb151cda21a6994e7f783379676d7cba52d98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7fbb151cda21a6994e7f783379676d7cba52d98/0_0_1300_500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Obama White House briefing August 1 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"385\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>White House briefing room. 1 August 2014</h2> <p>The proposed declassifications the CIA would deliver back to the committee reflected that sentiment and far more. It would be difficult for a reader to feel \u201csanctimonious\u201d about torture, as it would be difficult to understand what the CIA had actually done.<br></p> <p>When Jones had drafted the report over the years, he had not taken a hardline approach to transparency. The former FBI official deliberately obscured many things he considered reasonably outside the public\u2019s knowledge. No draft of the report had ever contained the true name of a CIA official involved in the program, nor the countries where the black sites were. All were given cover names, and not even the agency\u2019s official cover names at that. It was how it had been in previous committee reports. Jones considered it uncontroversial. </p> <p>But the CIA fought release of all of that. The entire saga of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the admitted 9/11 mastermind whom the CIA waterboarded the most \u2013 a story the report told at great length \u2013 was blacked out, known in official parlance as \u201credaction\u201d. The CIA would not permit publication of the names of the 119 detainees the committee could find the agency detained. No country\u2019s cover name could be public. No pseudonym of a CIA officer could be public. </p> <p>\u201cThey redacted all references to Allah,\u201d Jones said. \u201cLike, really? Under what national security concern?\u201d</p> <p>The effect of the redactions was to obscure the story of what happened. CIA officials involved in the torture had persisted, thrived and been promoted within the agency, including individuals whom Jones had concluded helped mislead the Bush administration and the public. Jones had told, with cover names, that aspect of the story. Readers would have found it difficult to follow detainees from black site to black site, and more so to place pseudonymous interrogators at any. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t follow the narrative arc,\u201d Jones said.</p> <p>The CIA\u2019s black magic marker looked cynical when considering that numerous senior agency officials involved with torture had published memoirs covering much of this material. CIA director George Tenet, ex-lawyer John Rizzo, even Jose Rodriguez, whose destruction of videotaped evidence of torture had occasioned the report \u2013 all had books out, books that had been cleared by the CIA\u2019s pre-publication review. The agency, with support from the White House, had permitted Hollywood film-makers unprecedented access for the 2012 film Zero Dark Thirty, which told the CIA\u2019s torture story the way the agency wanted it told \u2013 and in contradiction of what the Senate had found actually happened. </p> <p>After years of fighting with the CIA for access and accuracy, and brawling over accusations of criminality, Jones\u2019s new brief was to argue for rolling back the redactions. In 2010, when the CIA removed documents from the Senate side of RDINet, both sides turned to the White House to mediate the dispute. Now, the Senate negotiators were across the table from the CIA and the White House together. Meetings that lasted \u201chours and hours\u201d from August to December occurred at the White House \u2013 some even in the Situation Room \u2013 or on Capitol Hill, not the CIA. Jones remembered going practically paragraph by paragraph over declassification in the 525-page executive summary.</p> <p>For the CIA\u2019s part, cover names for agency officials would end up being fig leaves, once attentive readers began poring over the report. </p> <p>\u201cA pseudonym itself is little protection when a host of other information about that officer is made public and will be seen and possibly utilized by adversaries and foreign intelligence services,\u201d said agency spokesman Trapani.</p> <p>Trapani called the declassification discussions \u201cdesigned to preserve the committee\u2019s narrative of the CIA program for the public, while also protecting critical national security interests \u2013 including the safety and security of US personnel and ongoing intelligence operations.\u201d<br></p> <p>McDonough was a presence in the meetings, even those where he delegated attendance to National Security Council staffers or White House attorneys. The fact that the White House chief of staff would personally oversee the negotiations spoke to the gravity of the issue. Jones cannot recall a single issue on which McDonough or his team backed the Senate, and only when the agency would agree to relent would McDonough concur. There would be no help from the White House. </p> <p>\u201cDuring the process,\u201d a White House official said, \u201cDenis represented the views of the president and advocated on behalf of the redactions the inter-agency [process] assessed necessary to protect sensitive information.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62dc5b69a4518d4d0d18fdd43cf202829fbcae0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62dc5b69a4518d4d0d18fdd43cf202829fbcae0b/0_53_3584_2150/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Denis McDonough\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>McDonough\u2019s position was particularly startling to Jones considering that Obama had taken an explicit position on classification. An executive order Obama issued in December 2009, intended to enforce his pledge to run the \u201cmost transparent administration in history\u201d, explicitly barred the agencies from \u201c<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/executive-order-classified-national-security-information\">conceal[ing] violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error</a>\u201d. Citing national security exemptions required an argument for why release would harm US \u201cnational defense or foreign relations\u201d, rather than being an end of discussion. </p> <p>\u201cThe administration didn\u2019t come to us with arguments for why they were redacting information, other than \u2018this is hurtful to national security.\u2019 What we would do would be to go to the statute and say, \u2018This is unclassified, because the law says this, this, this and this,\u2019 and they would just say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s a national security issue, we can\u2019t release this,\u201d Jones said. \u201c\u2018The world will end if this information is out,\u2019 and then you find out it\u2019s been out for four years \u2013 either they\u2019ve officially declassified it, or they allowed CIA officers to talk about it in books.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes the administration wouldn\u2019t even do that; or after the negotiators conceded to the Senate there was no national security basis for classification, the White House and CIA had a fallback contention, one for which Jones said made the discussions like beating his head against a wall.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s two arguments. You would put the lives of the CIA officers at risk, the lives of their families at risk. And then, the latter one, which always seemed to be the real reason because the other stuff just didn\u2019t hold any water, was that this will really hurt morale at the CIA, this is a morale issue. And they would openly say that, as if that was a reasonable response to making something classified,\u201d said Jones.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018The world will end if this information is out,\u2019 and then you find out it\u2019s been out for years</p> <footer> <cite>Daniel Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At those points, Jones would pull out Obama\u2019s own executive order and quote it to the CIA, the White House staff, even McDonough. \u201cWe had it with us at every one of our meetings,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Nor was the agency consistent. It would not permit the Senate to publish pseudonyms of its officers. But it relented on allowing the report to use them for the contractor psychologists James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen, who designed the torture program and even participated in interrogations. Although any argument about protecting the safety of the lives and families of agency officials would apply equally to Mitchell and Jessen, the report calls them, unlike any CIA employee, \u201cSwigert\u201d and \u201cDunbar\u201d.</p> <p>The drawn-out discussions would not always involve staff. In mid-October, McDonough flew to San Francisco to speak with Feinstein without Jones present. Feinstein pleaded for the use of agency cover names to appear in the report, but McDonough refused, even as she asked for fewer and fewer of them. </p> <p>\u201cIt was a battle we ended up losing. We wanted to include our own pseudonyms so you could follow a particular individual through the report. We went right up until the end,\u201d Jones said.</p> <p>But the White House and the CIA could afford a drawn-out process in a way Feinstein and her staff could not. It was a midterm election year, and the Democrats were widely forecast to lose the Senate, a circumstance that came to pass on election day, 4 November. Feinstein lost her gavel. A GOP that had vacillated between unsupportive of the torture inquiry and hostile to it would be in power come January. The race was truly on. </p> <p>\u201cAfter the election, the declassification of the report is at stake, whether it ever becomes public,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe were not in a position of power.\u201d </p> <p>Exasperation with McDonough exploded immediately after the Democrats lost the election. McDonough attended a Senate Democratic caucus meeting. Feinstein, whose demeanor is universally described as calm, excoriated him \u2013 \u201cjust fucking floored him\u201d, the former senior Senate aide said \u2013 accusing McDonough of being relieved the Democrats lost the chamber because now the administration could run out the clock on making the report public. Feinstein said McDonough had violated agreements they had reached on redactions and called the administration duplicitous. </p> <p>McDonough\u2019s response echoed Obama\u2019s August press conference. He said that the families of hardworking CIA officials would be vulnerable in the event that the Senate\u2019s disclosure of their identities led to physical danger. It was an incendiary charge, given that no CIA agent\u2019s real name appeared even in the classified version of the report.</p> <p>Most party-caucus meetings center around a lunch discussion and break when senators need to leave for votes. But anger at McDonough, both personal and as a proxy for the White House, was white-hot. They held McDonough at the meeting through the voting and came back to vent more spleen. </p> <p>\u201cThey really said flat out to McDonough, \u2018You\u2019re protecting what happened, you\u2019re no better than what had happened in the Bush administration,\u2019\u201d said the ex-senior aide present. </p> <p>\u201cThis was a very spirited conversation,\u201d said Wyden, who was in attendance.</p> <p>\u201cIt was very tense,\u201d said Jones, one of the few staffers at the meeting.</p> <p>There was another issue, one not before revealed, that went down to the wire \u2013 the very last thing on which McDonough and the CIA would not yield an inch. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s pretty bizarre when the CIA director doesn\u2019t seem to know what the word \u2018spying\u2019 means</p> <footer> <cite>Senator Ron Wyden</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Senior CIA officials had assured the Senate that the personnel performing the interrogations were vetted rigorously. Former director Michael Hayden told the committee in 2007 that \u201call of those involved in the questioning of detainees are carefully chosen and screened for demonstrated professional judgment and maturity.\u201d </p> <p>It was not always true. The committee had learned that some CIA interrogators had records of violent acts in their personal lives \u2013 to include domestic abuse and even sexual assault. Even without listing names or pseudonyms, Langley refused to let that fact become public, no matter how tenuously connected to US national security it was. </p> <p>\u201cCIA conducted extensive analysis of the possible use of possible pseudonyms in the [Senate] report and determined that to do so would risk publicly revealing the true names of those officers, as well as the names of officers not associated with the program, and the identification of their family members,\u201d said the CIA\u2019s Trapani. \u201cThe administration did not support making disclosures that would put US government personnel and their families at additional risk.\u201d</p> <p>It was Friday 5 December 2014. The lame-duck session of Congress was nearly ended, and with it, Democratic control of the Senate. The committee, the CIA and McDonough had reached agreement on the entire report, except for the section \u2013 a single paragraph \u2013 alluding to the questionable backgrounds of its interrogators. </p> <p>McDonough would not back down. \u201cIt was a long meeting,\u201d Jones remembered, and the CIA was not even present. McDonough said the administration would agree to release the report \u201cas is\u201d. But first the paragraph had to change. </p> <p>The meeting became an endurance test. Finally, the committee representatives found a degree of acceptable language from McDonough. </p> <p>Page 470 of the report, long after the narrative had ended, referred to \u201ca number of personnel whose backgrounds include notable derogatory information calling into question their eligibility for employment, their access to classified information, and their participation in CIA interrogation activities.\u201d Most of that information was known to the agency. The report continued: \u201cThis group of officers included individuals who, among other issues, had engaged in inappropriate detainee interrogations, had workplace anger management issues, and had reportedly admitted to sexual assault.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cI was like, \u2018Alright, this doesn\u2019t do it justice, but at least people will get the idea,\u2019\u201d Jones said. \u201cThis was done to water down the backgrounds of people involved in the program.\u201d</p> <p>Six years after Jones began looking into CIA torture, it seemed like a section of the Senate report would finally see the light of day. But at the end of the meeting, the committee received an unexpected surprise. John Kerry, the secretary of state, longtime Massachusetts senator, war hero and 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, called Feinstein. It would be a near-death experience for the torture inquiry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"612906daf554534931869de02cd89c0ffcc30394\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/612906daf554534931869de02cd89c0ffcc30394/0_229_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US secretary of state John Kerry\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Kerry was urging his old Senate colleagues to delay the report\u2019s release. It was a tenuous moment globally, he argued. The coalition against the Islamic State would be jeopardized by an inflammatory report about the CIA torturing Muslims. Americans\u2019 lives and property abroad could be jeopardized. </p> <p>By that point, there were many aspects of the CIA\u2019s entreaties that no longer held sway with Democratic senators. But Kerry could not be dismissed out of hand. Many senators on the committee had close working relationships, even friendships, with Kerry. They knew him not to inflate threats. </p> <p>Technically, all Kerry was asking was a delay in the report\u2019s release. But the political reality, with the Republicans set to take over the Senate, was that delay was fatal. There was another inescapable certainty. Should the worst occur, and violence follow the release of the torture report, every senator whose name graced its cover would have to answer for it.<br></p> <p>Had James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, not intervened at that critical moment, it is possible that the Democratic senators would have capitulated and buried the report. </p> <p>By the weekend, the committee received a five-page document prepared by Clapper\u2019s office (ODNI), the entity nominally in charge of the 16 intelligence agencies. It purported to forecast the outcome of the report\u2019s release. Jones described it as \u201ca farce\u201d.</p> <p>ODNI\u2019s assessment was riddled with factual errors, and from those errors extrapolated dire consequences, including violence and damage to intelligence relationships. It falsely claimed the report, even in classified form, identified countries that hosted black sites. By that point, even committee senators reliant on staff for details of the report could see how wrong it was. When asked, a senior ODNI official telegraphed indifference to the accuracy of the document. Jones recalls the official saying: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what\u2019s in the report. It matters what people think is.\u201d </p> <p>If the administration\u2019s goal was to suppress the torture report, Clapper pulled defeat from the jaws of victory. No longer were senators fixated on Kerry\u2019s warning. According to multiple sources, they were convinced an administration they wanted badly to believe was on their side was willing to insult their intelligence, all in the service of helping the CIA cover up an act the president himself had vociferously opposed. </p> <p>\u201cIt was a poorly done intelligence product with clear factual errors and it inaccurately described the study we were about to release,\u201d said Rockefeller. </p> <p>\u201cUltimately, yes, I think for some senators, the angle and clear errors in that intelligence assessment played a role in their decision to support the release of the redacted Executive Summary of the Study. My only regret is we did not work to declassify more.\u201d</p> <p>Timothy Barrett, an ODNI spokesman, said the directorship supported the redacted release of the summary but \u201chad a duty to warn policymakers about the possible consequences of release of the report in order to enable preparation and effective measures to protect American citizens and interests. This assessment could not be limited to the text of the report in a vacuum, but had to consider the effect of its release in light of other information that had already been reported \u2013 and public perceptions.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The report that\u2019s out is not the report we would have chosen to put out</p> <footer> <cite>Daniel Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On 9 December, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/09/cia-torture-report-released\">the committee released the executive summary</a>.

  "<p>By his own admission, South African artist William Kentridge\u2019s career got off to a slow start. Even by the time he was in his mid-40s and had built a reputation in his own country, a UK broadsheet critic could declare without embarrassment that he had never heard of Kentridge when reviewing, positively, his 1999 show at London\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/serpentine-pavilion\">Serpentine</a> gallery. It is not an admission that has been made much since. Kentridge\u2019s work is shown and collected by great museums all over the world and his growing status as a public intellectual saw him deliver the prestigious <a href=\"http://mahindrahumanities.fas.harvard.edu/content/william-kentridge-drawing-lesson-six-anti-entropy\">Norton Lectures</a> at Harvard in 2012.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/aug/29/eyes-on-the-prize-the-must-see-art-and-design-of-autumn-2016\">Eyes on the prize: the must-see art and design of autumn 2016</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kentridge will be difficult to avoid in London this autumn. His first major UK show in 15 years opens at the <a href=\"http://www.whitechapelgallery.org/exhibitions/william-kentridge/\">Whitechapel Gallery</a> later this month. It will be followed by his own design and direction of the English National Opera\u2019s production of Berg\u2019s <em>Lulu</em>, a collaboration with the composer Philip Miller at the Print Room, as well as a lecture.</p> <p>But while Kentridge and his work will be appearing in different venues and in different mediums, there is far more that connects these apparently disparate events than divides them. His production of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/31/william-kentridge-lulu-opera-metropolitan\">Lulu</a></em> is underpinned by his distinctive expressionist charcoal drawings and animations. The event at the Print Room involves the human voice as well as film. His lecture has a strong element of performance and includes specially made artwork.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I started out I tried to follow the, well-meaning and sensible, advice of all my friends who told me to do one thing and do it well,\u201d he explains. \u201cJust do drawing, they said. Just do theatre. Only make films because otherwise you get caught between them. For a long time I tried that, and I failed at all of them. Now I don\u2019t even pretend to know what form an idea will ultimately take or what project it will end up in. I just get on with doing things knowing they will end up somewhere.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"386e04c2f0dff51dd7cca705c093e7f0b7170342\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/386e04c2f0dff51dd7cca705c093e7f0b7170342/0_0_3778_3780/999.jpg\" alt=\"Streets of the City (2009), tapestry weave with embroidery\" width=\"999\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Streets of the City (2009), tapestry weave with embroidery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy William Kentridge, Marian Goodman Gallery, Goodman Gallery and Lia Rumma Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Observing Kentridge at work in Johannesburg is to get a sense of the scale of his production. He has two studios, one at the family home where he was brought up in the old-money suburb of Houghton, near where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nelsonmandela\">Nelson Mandela</a> spent his last years and a neighbourhood in which the primary selling point of property is now the size of its security walls. His other studio is in a larger space downtown in what has become an artistic oasis in a city centre that had been hollowed out by crime and the flight of commerce. But just as the whole of Johannesburg life seems to be present in his work, so his pieces come from all over the city. This year his gallery, the Goodman, celebrates 50 years of presenting art that has challenged black and white elites alike. Kentridge is not only its star artist, but a sponsor and supporter of other artists in a society in which state subsidy is vanishingly small. Much of his artwork is produced by David Krut\u2019s print shop, next door to the downtown studio; Kentridge works closely with one of the last foundries in the city, and a few miles out of town is the Stephens Tapestry Studio, with whom he has been collaborating for more than two decades.</p> <p>Work from all these sources will be in evidence at the Whitechapel show in the form of installations, film, sculpture, drawings, tapestry and prints, often featuring the artist himself in his habitual uniform of dark trousers, white shirt and pince-nez glasses either perched on his nose or hanging round his neck. They combine to address Kentridge\u2019s eternal subjects of time, art, colonialism and utopian politics. The newest work \u2013 only completed in the last few weeks \u2013 will be an installation, <em>Right into Her Arms</em>, in which two corrugated cardboard screens are transformed into recognisably human characters who dance a sexually charged pas de deux. The piece not only exemplifies Kentridge\u2019s enthusiasm for cross-fertilisation, but also his underlying artistic and political preoccupations.</p> <p>\u201cIt is someway between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/may/05/a-century-of-dada-anti-war-artists-mainstream-con\">Dada</a> and a cabaret performance,\u201d he says. \u201cThese were things I was looking at while making<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/31/william-kentridge-lulu-opera-metropolitan\"> <em>Lulu</em></a> but they didn\u2019t get into the final production. Our initial goal was to make programmable, movable screens to see what projected images looked like on them as they shifted. It was quite a challenge and the team had to develop new software. But soon the focus changed to whether the set itself could become the protagonist. And what began as just a way of receiving images of Lulu and her lovers, ended up with the screens being lovers themselves. I\u2019m always interested in what I call the \u2018less good idea\u2019, by which I mean the secondary idea. You start with one plan and then something better emerges from the periphery that would have been impossible without the first thought.\u201d</p> <p><em>Right into Her Arms</em> also connects to another installation in the show, <em>O Sentimental Machine</em>, which is about Trotsky\u2019s declaration that human beings were semi-manufactured products. \u201cA lot of Soviet thinkers were concerned as to what would happen to imperfect people in a perfect society. They asked if our emotions were mechanical, could we get rid of rid of rage and jealousy and so on which would make it so much easier for us to get along? You can see how well that went. But the counterpart is the very contemporary idea of can we teach machines to be human? And so in <em>Right into Her Arms</em> the micromovements of the screens that appear to be like human pauses and shifts and hesitations, effectively become the work.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"49dfebdbc23e0e9831d4f9b353e671f78f08d323\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49dfebdbc23e0e9831d4f9b353e671f78f08d323/1082_596_3725_2235/1000.jpg\" alt=\"O Sentimental Machine (2015) \u2013 a five-channel video installation with four megaphones.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">O Sentimental Machine (2015) \u2013 a five-channel video installation with four megaphones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy William Kentridge, Marian Goodman Gallery, Goodman Gallery and Lia Rumma Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Scattered across the exhibits in the Whitechapel will be Kentridge\u2019s trademark collection of shapeshifting images of objects such as the stovetop coffee pots \u2013 familiar from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/pablo-picasso\">Picasso</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/braque\">Braque</a> \u2013 that he morphs into a woman dancing, or a rocket crashing into the moon, or an elevator descending into the gold mines on which Johannesburg was built (or, sometimes, a device for making coffee). \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like commedia dell\u2019arte,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have your set characters and they are sent off to perform different shows every night. The coffee pot is just standing there waiting to be used in different places. There are lots of rhinoceroses, typewriters, megaphones that keep coming back. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/cezanne\">C\u00e9zanne</a> spoke about the world being constructed from cones, spheres, and cylinders. Which is a way of taking the world and formalising it. I like the idea of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s cone but I wanted to send it back into the world to earn its keep which it does in the form of a megaphone. They are formally interesting, but they also bring so many associations, from mass rallies, to delivering instructions, to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/16812\"><em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em></a>.\u201d</p> <p>In his attempts to codify the place of politics in his work Kentridge says he likes the example set by Manet, \u201cwho did very political work but also painted a lot of flowers. I\u2019ve never felt I needed to distinguish strongly between work that was about the history of art and work about the history of the country. It all flows into the studio and different parts get picked up at different moments.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>During the YBA years, London became almost entirely self-congratulatory \u2013 it was completely insufferable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Kentridge, despite being born into white privilege in Johannesburg in 1955, was exposed to the implications of the history of the country from the outset. Both of his parents were prominent liberal lawyers: his father, Sydney, acted for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nelsonmandela\">Nelson Mandela</a> at the 1958 treason trial and later for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/desmondtutu\">Desmond Tutu</a> and the family of anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko; his mother, Felicia, was instrumental in providing legal support to those denied it by apartheid. He says by the end of primary school he was aware that \u201cmy parents held different views to the majority of other boys\u2019 parents who took for granted the way society was organised. And it was becoming clear to me that we were in a very unnatural society.\u201d At university \u2013 his last year coincided with the 1976 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/16/my-activism-started-then-the-soweto-uprising-remembered\">Soweto Uprising</a> \u2013 he produced agitprop art and posters and was involved in political theatre. But he never joined a party, saying he was \u201ctoo aware of the contradictions and the ambiguities of all the statements of certainty that were the basis for political parties. I was always happier to be at the edges of things, and while my sympathies were with the ANC, I never became a member.\u201d</p> <p>After leaving university he began to draw and make prints and then studied theatre and mime in Paris. He developed a working relationship with the Handspring Puppet Company \u2013 now best known for their work on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/war-horse\"><em>War Horse</em></a> \u2013 that has continued to this day. But his early career as an artist was underwritten by work as an art director in South African TV and film industry. \u201cIt was so low-budget that I was really the person who borrowed my friends furniture. So my initial career ambition was to sell some drawings and see how long I could survive before having to go back to the film industry. And I did sell enough drawings, but let it be said, for a white South African artist there were so many safety nets. My wife was a medical doctor so she had an income. There would have been family to catch me if they hadn\u2019t sold. It is very different for black artists, who are usually much more out on a limb. And fundamentally that is still the case.\u201d</p> <p>As a newly professional artist he says he was aware of the wider art world, and he took a very conservative view of it. \u201cI was as sceptical and derisory as anyone at the thought of a person putting a pile of bricks in the Tate. Joseph Beuys\u2019s idea of pumping honey through a tube around museum as political art? That wasn\u2019t politics. Politics was the police arresting you and putting electrodes on your testicles. I was interested in early modernism, and having been brought up in a society full of violence and absurdity I understood the Dadaists very well. But I couldn\u2019t see the link between them and the minimalists and conceptualists. It\u2019s taken me a long time to me to appreciate it and I had to be dragged kicking and screaming into understanding the world I was in.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"08b766e9b02be75c0eb943dbb9b69ec243a64691\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08b766e9b02be75c0eb943dbb9b69ec243a64691/370_0_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kentridge\u2019s production of Alban Berg\u2019s opera Lulu.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kentridge\u2019s production of Alban Berg\u2019s opera Lulu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BAUS/Ci\u00e4rchen &amp; Matthias Baus and Dutch National Opera</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He suspects such thinking was part of a postcolonial insecurity. \u201cYou have to come from the centre of the Empire to have the confidence to say that whatever rubbish I do, it will be given the benefit of the doubt because I am an American, or whatever, doing it. And that does enable very interesting work to happen.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until the late 80s that Kentridge stumbled upon the idea of combining his drawing and film-making to create idiosyncratic, animations. He describes the technique as \u201cpoor man\u2019s animation\u201d in that he rubs out and reapplies charcoal marks to a drawing on a single sheet of paper, taking images of each change. The series of allegorical films he made in this way from 1989 to 1996 \u2013 about a property developer, his wife and her lover \u2013 made his name in South Africa. His international reputation was established when his work was shown at the 1997 <em>documenta</em> show in Germany. \u201cIt did feel like a breakthrough \u2013 before then I\u2019d been more known as a theatre-maker through the work of Handspring.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What is to show for the majority of the people since the birth of the rainbow nation? It's not enough</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He says when he was younger there was a sense that if you wanted to be part of the international art conversation then you had to go to New York or London or Paris. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem so essential now,\u201d he says, \u201calthough it\u2019s still important for your work to be shown there.\u201d Surveying the global scene, he thinks London has enjoyed something of a comeback over the last decade or so, after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2015/feb/28/young-british-artists-at-play-in-the-1990s-in-pictures\">YBA</a> years during which it \u201cbecame almost entirely self-congratulatory. That was all there was and everyone else in the world didn\u2019t really count. From outside Britain it was completely insufferable. It felt like a closed club, but feels much less so now.\u201d</p> <p>His parents left South Africa for London, as have his siblings and one of his three children. But he says he intends to stay despite declaring himself \u201ccautiously pessimistic\u201d about the country. \u201cThere are very hard things to overcome. The anger and disappointment about what has not happened in the last 25 years grows and grows. Race is becoming more prominent as a factor rather than less. What is to show for the majority of the people since the birth of the rainbow nation? There is a lot. But it is not enough. I think we\u2019re in for difficulties in the two years ahead.\u201d He says that he could have left, and \u201cthat in some ways it has got harder to work in that here\u2019s no longer a laboratory that processes film, for instance. You have to send it to Europe. But there is still a print shop and a foundry that I need. There are actors and musicians, puppet makers and tapestry weavers. So much of my work \u2013 in its content and its making \u2013 is dependent on being in Johannesburg and what it offers. The very fact that after 61 years I\u2019m still here means there is something strong holding me here.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><em>William Kentridge: Thick Time</em> is at the <a href=\"http://www.whitechapelgallery.org/\">Whitechapel Gallery</a>, London E1, from 21 September. <em>Lulu</em> opens at <a href=\"https://www.eno.org/\">ENO</a>, London WC2N, on 9 November. <a href=\"http://www.the-print-room.org/\"><em>Paper Music</em> is at The Print Room</a>, London W11, from 9 October.<br></li> </ul>",

Well, the Giants attacked the Swans hard and had obvious success in roughing up their more fancied opponents. Shane Mumford and Steve Johnson were among the enforcers and the latter is likely to face intense scrutiny from the match review panel for a shirt-front that flattened Swans on-baller Josh Kennedy. Mumford slung Kurt Tippett to the ground in a rough tackle that might also have him in the sights of the MRP.</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t just brute strength. GWS took their chances and enjoyed sustained passages of dominance. Jeremy Cameron tore the game open in the third term with three goals and a number of other inspirational plays. He finished with 4.4 from 13 disposals and six marks, while rather tellingly, Lance Franklin managed only 0.2 at the other end, having gathered many of his 20 possessions further up the ground. Toby Greene was immense up forward for the Giants, while Lachie Whitfield, Stephen Coniglio and Devon Smith all dominated in the middle of the ground.</p> <p>That\u2019s all from me but thanks for joining us for what\u2019s been a fascinating qualifying final, one that emphatically confirmed that the Giants mean business. They\u2019re through to the preliminary final, meaning they\u2019ve now got a week to rest weary limbs, while the Swans have to contend with a cut-throat semi-final. They were outgunned in all respects today and lost Callum Mills to a hamstring injury as well.

Another thing the Giants have done well is ensure that bar the set shot he missed a few minutes back, Franklin is only getting easy ball well up the ground and too high to be a scoring threat himself. Not only that but the Giants have the most potent-looking forwards on the ground right now in Cameron and Greene and the latter bobs up again here, weaving his way around a would-be tackler and slotting another goal from 30 metres.

Franklin and Tippett are right into Mumford in the aftermath and to say there\u2019s some spice in this contest would be an understatement. </p> <p>Was the Johnson-Kennedy incident accidental? Replays have been inconclusive so far. A minute later Tippett\u2019s down on his haunches too. The blood rule is being invoked often It\u2019s like Game of Thrones down there! Anyway, when some football breaks out, Johnson gets another shot on goal after being tackled high but he bungles it, missing to the right. Early prediction: the match review panel could have a busy night ahead. Out of nowhere Toby Greene dobs a goal from 40 metres out on a tight angle after being tackled high. What a gem!

  "<p>One of the main differences between humans and animals is that we compulsively tell stories \u2013 to&#xa0;ourselves and to others. The question of why this should be&#xa0;remains a mystery. Did our need to create narratives simply arise out of our facility for language? Is it nothing more than a form of rarefied entertainment? And do all the global and historical stories, in their multitude of&#xa0;forms, have anything in common \u2013 some fundamental strand of shared DNA that endures to this day?</p> <p>Many thinkers, writers and critics have tried to identify the underlying meaning, origin and structure of stories,&#xa0;from Kipling, Goethe and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell\" title=\"\">Joseph Campbell</a> right back to the original dramatic theorist, Aristotle, who in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetics_(Aristotle)\" title=\"\"><em>Poetics</em></a> came up with the still extant three-act structure, along with catharsis, denouement, reversal (<em>peripeteia</em>) and much more besides.</p> <p>The closest we have in the contemporary world to <em>Poetics</em> may be the classic text <em>Story</em> by <a href=\"http://mckeestory.com/\" title=\"\">Robert McKee</a>.

However, McKee receives a more sceptical response from most novelists, at least, most non-genre novelists like myself.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jonathancoe\" title=\"\">Jonathan Coe</a>, for instance, straightforwardly rejects McKee\u2019s approach to storytelling: \u201cFor me, the essence of creative writing \u2013 whether it\u2019s in the form of a novel, a play or a&#xa0;screenplay \u2013 is absolute freedom. So&#xa0;I&#xa0;have an instinctive horror of all systems which try to reduce writing to a series of rules to do with three-act structures and narrative arcs. It\u2019s a sure recipe for formulaic writing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7c2decabe3f4f2c410956948b840858a5b822e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7c2decabe3f4f2c410956948b840858a5b822e3/0_328_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Esther Freud\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018He has struck terror into my heart\u2019: Esther Freud.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/16/esther-freud-houses-ghosts-inspired-new-book\" title=\"\">Esther Freud</a> agrees. \u201cMcKee has always struck terror into my heart with the idea that something important and gripping has to happen on page 27,\u201d she says. \u201cActors and writers I knew were always going to his courses, but my reality is that there are no real rules with writing \u2013 you just have to get on with it, and trust your instincts.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/sadie-jones\" title=\"\">Sadie Jones</a>, who attempted for several years to make it as a screenwriter before she turned to novels, was the only writer I talked to who showed some sympathy for McKee. \u201cWhen I was younger I entirely rejected the notion of being taught to write, and McKee\u2019s name made me run in horror,\u201d she says. \u201cI later realised we&#xa0;can reject or accept the teachings of&#xa0;others as we choose. It\u2019s a question of confidence. Insecurity doesn\u2019t want to be lectured, but if we want to break the rules we can do it more thoroughly if we master them first.\u201d</p> <p>It is instructive that all three writers use the words \u201chorror\u201d or \u201cterror\u201d when talking about the \u201crules\u201d of storytelling. It seems to indicate that novelists don\u2019t merely dislike McKee, they fear him.</p> <p>***</p> <p>An intensive inquiry into the nature and structure of narrative, McKee\u2019s \u201cStory seminar\u201d has been running in one form&#xa0;or another since he first gave the lecture at the University of Southern California in 1983.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>McKee credits himself as inventing the language of Hollywood \u2013 it is not an empty boast</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>McKee credits himself with inventing the language of Hollywood \u2013 with its talk of the \u201cmid-point climax\u201d, the \u201cinciting incident\u201d and the \u201cnegation of the negation\u201d, a phrase that originated with Hegel, but in movies means something like \u201cthe ultimate negative\u201d: a fallen hero who is not merely defeated but wants to die, or a character who doesn\u2019t simply lose faith in God but begins to hate God.</p> <p>His claim is not an empty boast. So prominent is McKee in film-making circles that he had the rare honour, for a writing teacher, to be depicted at some length \u2013 satirically, but not without tenderness \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHVqxD8PNq8\" title=\"\">by Brian Cox in the Charlie Kaufman-written film <em>Adaptation</em></a>.

A teacher of story myself, formerly with the <a href=\"https://www.faberacademy.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Faber Academy</a> and now for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses\" title=\"\">Guardian Masterclasses</a>, I do not have the same deep aversion to \u201ccraft\u201d as some of my peers. But McKee is the most pure \u2013 perhaps even puritanical \u2013 of all modern story theorists, and I&#xa0;don\u2019t expect to find his fundamentalism to my taste.</p> <p>The audience has come from all over the world \u2013 from Australia, Thailand, Italy, Barcelona, even Siberia. They are&#xa0;mostly in their 20s and 30s. McKee, 75,&#xa0;shambles about the stage cradling a&#xa0;cup of coffee. A heavy brow embroidered with impressive eyebrows and a full head of hair give him a&#xa0;prophetic aspect. He reminds me of&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Charlton+Heston+playing+Moses&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1898&amp;bih=712&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7r4nz1frOAhXHJsAKHc5YB0kQsAQIMg\" title=\"\">Charlton Heston playing Moses</a> \u2013 a&#xa0;similarity underlined by his course literature offering his \u201cTen Commandments of Storytelling\u201d, which include \u201cThou shalt not make life easy for thine protagonist\u201d and \u201cThou shalt take thine story into the depth and breadth of human experience\u201d.</p> <p>McKee is a tartar about maintaining order and timekeeping. He makes it clear that if you turn up late, you will not be admitted. If you use a mobile phone, you will be fined. If you use it more than once you will be excluded. There\u2019s a \u00a310 fine for talking.</p> <p>He reiterates these amiable threats sitting on a high stool, legs dangling in&#xa0;front of him like late-period Sinatra or the Irish comic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezUZqPSjd-4\" title=\"\">Dave Allen</a>. He does, in fact, consider himself a comic \u2013 \u201ca&#xa0;comic says the world is shit. And you have to destroy it.\u201d</p> <p>He begins by making some fairly grandiose statements: \u201cWhat we do as storytellers is crucial to the success of our species on the planet\u201d\u2026 \u201cAll stories say how and why life changes. They equip us to live.\u201d He poses crucial questions at the start of his lectures: \u201cWhat is a story? What do all the story cultures and genres have in common?\u201d, and spends the next three days trying to answer them, beginning with this suggestion: \u201cAll stories have same universal form. Not formula. There is no formula. But it\u2019s like saying the form of music is remarkably simple \u2013 just 12 notes on a scale.\u201d</p> <p>Having started exactly on time the lecture continues from 9am in the morning to 8pm, with only three short breaks per day, two of which McKee works through, taking questions from individuals. His fundamental insight concerns the relationship between storytelling and the human psyche \u2013 how a story is structured basically reflects how a human mind, and a human life, is structured.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every lived moment is an event taking place at a number of levels \u2013 interpersonal, internal, societal, institutional</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Drama, for him, arises when we make \u201cvalue-laden choices under pressure\u201d. It is through these choices that we find out who we are \u2013 since all of us live under the cover of masks, which hide our selves from others, and even ourselves. Every lived moment of human life is a multilayered event taking place at a number of different levels \u2013 interpersonal, internal, societal, institutional. Story, then, is the sea in which all of us swim, and dramatists, screenwriters and novelists create \u201cstory\u201d with the boring bits of life cut out. In story nothing moves forward except through conflict, and stories are metaphors for life \u2013 because to be alive is to be in perpetual conflict.</p> <p>To grasp how McKee actually talks it is necessary to use italics extensively, as he constantly emphasises \u2013 in his slightly abrasive Detroit drawl \u2013 the key words in any passage of speech.</p> <p>\u201cStory design means <em>choices</em> \u2013 boiling down from life, far more material [than] you could ever use. A story is a&#xa0;series of <em>events</em> that have been chosen then <em>composed</em>. Like composing <em>music</em>.</p> <p>\u201cAn <em>event </em>is a meaningful choice; that is, a choice with a <em>value</em> at stake. <em>Values</em> are at the heart of storytelling. A&#xa0;binary of human experience, positive&#xa0;or negative, truth and lies, love and hate, war and peace \u2013 all are <em>binaries</em>. They shift charge constantly. An <em>event</em> \u2013 in story terms \u2013 equals <em>meaningful change in the value-charged condition of a character\u2019s life, achieved through conflict</em>.\u201d</p> <p>McKee doesn\u2019t confine himself to talking about writing: he wanders off-piste frequently. The course literature warns the audience to be aware that \u201cMr McKee has strong opinions on religion, politics and society and uses strong language.\u201d This is not an understatement. What follows is a selection of quotes from the lecture, all&#xa0;of which&#xa0;are extracts from larger anecdotal reflections.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are not equal. If you\u2019re a liberal at 30 you have no brain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you show your woman your inner crybaby she\u2019s out the door. Never say what you deeply feel and think to your&#xa0;woman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA lot of women\u2019s films just say, \u2018All men are shit\u2019 \u2013 can you imagine a man writing something the same?\u201d</p> <p>If McKee\u2019s tongue is in his cheek \u2013 and it may well be \u2013 he conceals it well. But his predilection for winding up his audience does little to dilute what I am beginning to realise is the strength and clarity of his teaching.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8034e1ffb778d46ccac2c43979364571fb02200d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8034e1ffb778d46ccac2c43979364571fb02200d/0_249_2961_2203/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca\" width=\"1000\" height=\"744\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the conclusion of the third day, when he has finished his scene-by-scene deconstruction of <em>Casablanca</em>, he sings, in a slightly quavery voice, the theme tune of the movie, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d22CiKMPpaY\" title=\"\">\u201cAs Time Goes By\u201d</a>. This song, he believes, points to the underlying message of the film, the tension between Being and Becoming \u2013 that is, the idea of holding on to what is permanent within you while you are forced into incessant change by circumstance.</p> <p>\u201cYou can have both \u2013 if you learn to love. And that is what I wish you all.\u201d</p> <p>With these words, the three-day seminar is concluded. He promptly receives a standing ovation from the entire audience.</p> <p>***</p> <p>When we meet, after the course, in McKee\u2019s sparsely furnished rented flat in Chelsea, I ask first about the element of his lecture I found particularly fascinating \u2013 the relationship of life as it is lived to the scene-by-scene dramatic structure of a story.</p> <p>\u201cIn film, there\u2019s this constant irony of expectation not meeting result. Out of this turning point comes the opposite \u2013 a turning point for the better. Then the positive shifts to the negative almost automatically. No wonder primitives believed in the unseen hand, because this dynamic is so relentless,\u201d McKee says. \u201cWe focus in story on moments when life is interesting \u2026 when the world reacts in a way which, in retrospect, you think you should have seen coming. Human beings have imagination and that makes the shit really hit the fan. Because you also have animal instincts. Therefore you have inner conflicts. It\u2019s not only the world that doesn\u2019t react the way you expect: y<em>ou</em> don\u2019t react the way you expect.\u201d</p> <p>Story, for McKee, is a consolatory refraction of reality. By witnessing our own true inner dilemmas realistically on screen or page we receive a form of relief. But it is also, at some level, an exercise in denial. \u201cDenial makes the world go round,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you live in unvarnished reality for one minute you have to fantasise \u2026 it\u2019s just too awful. You have to deny it. Story mediates the contradictions that make life unlivable. It is an evolutionary adaptation to consciousness.\u201d</p> <p>Is this element of denial \u2013 in many Hollywood films in particular \u2013 the reason so many fiction writers are nervous about the dynamics, or even existence, of story structure? McKee looks scornful \u2013 an expression that comes easily to him. \u201cThat\u2019s because they think \u2018art is instinctive\u2019. Which is fucking nonsense. You don\u2019t want constipation from analysis, you don\u2019t want to get in your own way; but you have to learn your craft. \u2018It won\u2019t stop you being a genius\u2019 as <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/eugene-delacroix\" title=\"\">Delacroix</a> said.\u201d</p> <p>Is that also true for literary, non-genre novelists?</p> <p>\u201cEvery writer is a genre writer. If you don\u2019t know the genre, the audience does. There\u2019s no such thing as non-generic story; if you think that, your head is up your ass.\u201d</p> <p>When I suggest there are elements of his lecture with which many people might not agree, feminists in particular, his voice rises several decibels.</p> <p>\u201c<em>Really</em>? You think I\u2019m not a feminist? I say just as many critical things about male behaviour, but it goes unnoticed. I treat people in a universal way. Women are just as fucked up as men, but you\u2019re not allowed to say that. Once you say it you\u2019re perceived as an anti-feminist. Women cannot be criticised. Well, guess what \u2026\u201d</p> <p>He leaves the sentence unfinished.</p> <p>Does he really believe that if you\u2019re liberal at 30 you have no brain?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Anything that puts meaning and beauty into the world in the form of story helps people live with more peace and purpose</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cMy attitude is, they\u2019re both wrong. If liberalism becomes extreme and sentimental and unthinking it\u2019s a dead end \u2013 same with the right wing. I hate them all. I hate institutions.</p> <p>He has spent so much of his life doing these lectures, rather than actually writing screenplays. What\u2019s his motivation?</p> <p>\u201cLife is absurd. But there is one meaningful thing, one inarguable thing, and that is that there is suffering. Fine writing helps alleviate that suffering \u2013 and anything that puts meaning and beauty into the world in the form of story, helps people to live with more peace and purpose and balance, is deeply worthwhile.\u201d</p> <p>McKee\u2019s political opinions may certainly appear overripe to most contemporary readers, but he doesn\u2019t give a&#xa0;damn, which is perhaps one of the things that makes him a good teacher. At the end of his seminar I was&#xa0;handed a piece of paper on which I&#xa0;was asked to write the most important thing I learned on his course. A great number of possibilities crossed my mind \u2013 particularly how a narrative only progresses through conflict and meaningful change (with a value at stake), or how to show deep character (\u201cchoice of action in pursuit of a desire under the pressure of life\u201d); but in the end I decided very quickly. \u201cEverything is subtext,\u201d I wrote. This is really what McKee teaches above all else \u2013 that the best drama always happens below the surface.</p> <p>As I hack away at my eighth novel, his voice is now in my head much of the time. If McKee is the God of Story, then I am no longer an agnostic \u2013 I am a&#xa0;convert.</p> <p>\u2022 Tim Lott offers mentoring for writers at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/2015/oct/28/one-to-one-mentoring-for-authors-with-tim-lott\" title=\"\">theguardian.com/masterclasses</a>.

Scientists and farmers around the world are pointing out that we can regenerate degraded soils by switching from intensive industrial farming to more ecological methods \u2013 not just organic fertiliser, but also no-tillage, composting, and crop rotation. Here\u2019s the brilliant part: as the soils recover, they not only regain their capacity to hold CO<sub>2</sub>, they begin to actively pull additional CO<sub>2</sub> out of the atmosphere.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The battle here is not just between two different methods. It is between two different ways of relating to the land</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The science on this is quite exciting. A study published recently by the US National Academy of Sciences claims that regenerative farming can <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/109/44/18226.full\">sequester 3%</a> of our global carbon emissions. An article in <em>Science </em>suggests it could be <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/304/5677/1623\">up to 15%</a>. And new research from the Rodale Institute in Pennsylvania, although not yet peer-reviewed, says sequestration rates could be <a href=\"http://rodaleinstitute.org/regenerative-organic-agriculture-and-climate-change/\">as high as 40%</a>. The same report argues that if we apply regenerative techniques to the world\u2019s pastureland as well, we could capture more than 100% of global emissions. In other words, regenerative farming may be our best shot at actually cooling the planet.</p> <p>Yet despite having the evidence on their side, proponents of regenerative farming \u2013 like the international farmers\u2019 association <a href=\"https://viacampesina.org/en/index.php/actions-and-events-mainmenu-26/-climate-change-and-agrofuels-mainmenu-75/1887-together-we-can-cool-the-planet-full-video\">La Via Campesina</a> \u2013 are fighting an uphill battle. The multinational corporations that run the industrial food system seem to be dead set against it because it threatens their monopoly power \u2013 power that relies on seeds linked to patented chemical fertilisers and pesticides. They are well aware that their methods are causing climate change, but they insist that it\u2019s a necessary evil: if we want to feed the world\u2019s growing population, we don\u2019t have a choice \u2013 it\u2019s the only way to secure high yields.</p> <p>Scientists are calling their bluff. First of all, feeding the world isn\u2019t about higher yields; it\u2019s about fairer distribution. We already grow enough food <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eric_Holt-Gimenez/publication/241746569_We_Already_Grow_Enough_Food_for_10_Billion_People_and_Still_Can%27t_End_Hunger/links/554b83710cf29752ee7c8d22.pdf?origin=publication_detail\">for 10 billion people</a>. In any case, it can be argued that regenerative farming actually <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/304/5677/1623.full\">increases crop yields</a> over the long term by enhancing soil fertility and improving resilience against drought and flooding. So as climate change makes farming more difficult, this may be our best bet for food security, too.</p> <p>The battle here is not just between two different methods. It is between two different ways of relating to the land: one that sees the soil as an object from which profit must be extracted at all costs, and one that recognizes the interdependence of living systems and honours the principles of balance and harmony.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a98cacddbf9fe4507c3fbe50e25306656bbde0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a98cacddbf9fe4507c3fbe50e25306656bbde0e/0_3_2436_1463/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lines of maize on the Malaysian organic farm run by Dr Mohd Ishak Syed Ahmad in Malacca.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lines of maize on the Malaysian organic farm run by Dr Mohd Ishak Syed Ahmad in Malacca.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bazuki Muhammad/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ultimately, this is about more than just soil. It is about something much larger. As Pope Francis put it in his much-celebrated encyclical last year, our present ecological crisis is the sign of a cultural pathology. \u201cWe have come to see ourselves as the lords and masters of the Earth, entitled to plunder her at will. The sickness evident in the soil, in the water, in the air and in all forms of life are symptoms that reflect the violence present in our hearts. We have forgotten that we ourselves are dust of the Earth; that we breathe her air and receive life from her waters.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe our engineers are missing the point. The problem with geo-engineering is that it proceeds from the very same logic that got us into this mess in the first place: one that treats the land as something to be subdued, dominated and consumed. But the solution to climate change won\u2019t be found in the latest schemes to bend our living planet to the will of man. Perhaps instead it lies in something much more down to earth \u2013 an ethic of care and healing, starting with the soils on which our existence depends. </p> <p>Of course, regenerative farming <a href=\"https://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/notill.htm\">doesn\u2019t offer</a> a permanent solution to the climate crisis; soils can only hold a finite amount of carbon. We still need to get off fossil fuels, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 we have to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jul/15/clean-energy-wont-save-us-economic-system-can\">kick our obsession</a> with endless exponential growth and downsize our material economy to bring it back in tune with ecological cycles.

  "<p>It\u2019s September, which means \u2013 exciting! \u2013 it\u2019s fashion <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/07/groundhog-day-perfect-comedy-for-ever\">Groundhog Day</a> again. This consists of fashion weeks starting up, followed swiftly by the announcement of a political initiative to protect women against this evil on the catwalk. (Another feature of fashion Groundhog Day, incidentally, is a slew of articles by male columnists expressing bafflement at why the models are so thin, which can be summed up as: \u201cI don\u2019t find this sexy, so why?!\u201d However would we know how to look without men telling us what turns them on?)</p> <p>Anyway, the latest initiative comes courtesy of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/womens-equality-party\">Women\u2019s Equality party</a>, which has launched a campaign demanding, among other things, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/04/minimum-bmi-checks-uk-models-womens-equality-party\">that British designers and retailers stop using size zero clothes in shows and photoshoots</a>. This, the WEP claims, \u201cwill tackle negative body image issues and eating disorders\u201d.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to ignore the all-too-predictable connection between fashion models and eating disorders here, because I\u2019ve written enough for this lifetime about how absurdly reductive it is to suggest that a mental illness is caused by Vogue. Instead, I\u2019ll say this: the WEP is perfectly within its rights to address this issue, but \u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 it will not make a blind bit of difference. There have been efforts to legislate against fashion\u2019s obsession with skinniness in the past; these laws, wherever they\u2019re passed, always get a lot of play, because the media love a story that allows them to run a&#xa0;photo of a skinny model at least as much&#xa0;as the fashion industry likes the skinny model herself.</p> <p>So it would be understandable if you were confused as to why things haven\u2019t changed. The problem is not only that the laws are rarely enforced, but also that they are the equivalent of rearranging the Titanic\u2019s deck chairs. For a start, fashion is too international for one country\u2019s legislation to make a difference \u2013 especially, I\u2019m sorry to say, when it\u2019s this country doing the legislating. With the exception of Burberry, British-based fashion companies simply do not spend enough on international advertising for any laws to have an effect; the rest of the world won\u2019t even see the photographs. Slapping legislation on a tiny British brand will not change the aesthetic if&#xa0;Chanel and Prada can carry on as before.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/aug/13/hillary-clinton-parks-and-recreation-hadley-freeman\">Don't like Hillary Clinton? You need to watch Parks And Recreation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While fashion represents the connection between skinniness and perfection in its purest form, it is also the end point. By the time a&#xa0;woman is looking at fashion photography, she\u2019ll have gone through years of indoctrination that the less of her there is, the better. It\u2019s there in all the children\u2019s books and films, in which the evil women are plump and the nice ones are slender (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/roalddahl\">Roald Dahl</a> is especially bad on this). It\u2019s there in pretty much every film ever made (the only person I\u2019ve interviewed with an evident eating disorder was not a model but an actress). And it\u2019s&#xa0;there in the general atmosphere of being female today, the things you grow up hearing the adult women around you saying about their bodies, the way they decline dessert. According to <a href=\"http://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/what-we-do/research/the-good-childhood-report\">a report just published by the Children\u2019s Society</a>, teenage girls are unhappier than ever, especially with their bodies, which they compare unfavourably with those of their friends and celebrities.</p> <p>This masochistic tendency towards self\u2011erasure is a complicated issue, something a&#xa0;well\u2011meaning but overly simplistic campaign against thinness in fashion can\u2019t fix. The WEP has also suggested including body-image lessons as part of the school curriculum, which is a better idea (and, tellingly, it has had less pick-up, what with it lacking the vital excuse for a photograph of a model). But instead of fussing about the meaningless phrase \u201csize zero\u201d, or conflating thinness with anorexia, the WEP would be more effective if it looked at the prevalence of eating disorders in the fashion industry and exposed this. Instead of pretending it can tell fashion editors what to put in their magazines, the WEP could talk to them to get a more realistic sense of&#xa0;the problem, and get them on side.</p> <p>If we really want to end the association between female skinniness and female aspiration, women need to be doing this on an individual, focused level, not leaving it to politicians to act on an amorphous, collective one. Look at the way you talk about your body and what you eat, especially in front of young girls. Call out publications that condescend to larger women and feature photographs only of slim ones. Remind your female friends and your daughters that their jeans size is not a measurement of their&#xa0;personal value.</p> <p>It is easy to damn the fashion industry for promoting skinny as the feminine ideal. It\u2019s harder to admit that it is only echoing back too many of our&#xa0;own darkest thoughts, our own self-loathing.</p>",
  "<p>Sam is eight years old: unhappy at school, held back by his limited vocabulary, and guided through the world by his two thirtysomething parents. As his father, Alex, sees it, \u201cthe world is a gigantic engine that needs to function in a certain way, with predictable actions, in order to ensure [Sam\u2019s] safety. Before he can relax, he needs to know the timings and movements of everything around him, and he must have his finger on&#xa0;the off button at all times.\u201d</p> <p>This is a crisp summary of one of the basic components of autism, which sits at the heart of <em>A Boy Made of Blocks</em>, and explains why this unassuming-looking work of commercial fiction carries not just an air of zeitgeisty significance, but the sense of a missionary author who needs to tell the world about things too often misunderstood.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/keithstuart\" title=\"\">Keith Stuart</a> is the Guardian\u2019s games editor. As his debut novel\u2019s brief afterword explains, he is also the father of a&#xa0;boy who was diagnosed four years ago with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/autism\" title=\"\">autism</a> spectrum disorder, or ASD. He knows intimately a reality familiar to those of us with autistic children, or friends and relatives \u201con&#xa0;the spectrum\u201d \u2013 of a society still woefully ignorant of what ASD means, serial battles with officialdom, and \u201ca&#xa0;planet of concern and confusion\u201d around which lives and relationships inevitably orbit.</p> <p>But in his case, there has been a fortuitous blessing: his work with gaming and IT in general was at first a means to commune with his son, and eventually the spark for an unforeseen flowering of enthusiasm and language. More than anything else, this was true of Minecraft, the virtual world created by&#xa0;a Swedish developer called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/shortcuts/2015/sep/01/markus-persson-the-minecraft-billionaire-sending-lonely-late-night-tweets-from-ibiza\" title=\"\">Markus Persson</a>, and first released to the world in 2009. \u201cIt\u2019s like Lego, but set in a vast landscape you can explore and alter,\u201d Stuart explains. Minecraft has fostered a whole subculture among autistic people, because it opens up the possibility of a kind of social interaction free of the mysterious nuances and distractions of the real world.</p> <p>Stuart tells his story in the voice of&#xa0;Alex, who is enduring an uncertain separation from Sam\u2019s mother, Jody, is&#xa0;about to lose his job as a mortgage adviser and is suffering the long aftermath of a grim childhood bereavement. He is also an awkward player in a social milieu of&#xa0;young(ish) professionals in&#xa0;Bristol. Sam\u2019s autism echoes his father\u2019s psychology \u2013 \u201cPlay doesn\u2019t come easily to me,\u201d Alex admits \u2013 and also works as a counterpoint to the thirtysomething condition explored in the book, where jobs never last long, and debt is rarely far away. \u201cThere is no such thing as stability any more,\u201d one character says. \u201cI mean, the pace of life, the uncertainty of everything. You\u2019ve got to hang on somehow, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>Sam and his dad, by contrast, crave stability and certainty, and in this shared predicament lies a simple insight. \u201cAutism is a kind of intense, very centred version of how we all feel, of the anxieties we all have,\u201d says Alex. In Stuart\u2019s central adult trio of Alex and his friends Dan and Matt, there are also implied shades of the realisation set out by Hans Asperger in 1944: that \u201cthe&#xa0;autistic personality is an extreme variant of male intelligence \u2026 In the autistic individual the male pattern is&#xa0;exaggerated to the extreme\u201d.</p> <p>Minecraft becomes as much a part of the action as the Bristol streetscape, as Alex and Sam set off on repeated odysseys which take in zombies, \u201ccreepers\u201d and, most of all, the creation of ever more ambitious buildings, using the titular blocks. \u201cIn this universe, where the rules are unambiguous, where the logic is clear and unerring, Sam is in control,\u201d his father says, as he marvels at his son\u2019s sudden ingenuity. The comically blocky people and animals take on a deep fascination, and the game\u2019s omnipresent piano music becomes a&#xa0;signifier for something unexpectedly&#xa0;profound \u2013 as the two of them breach&#xa0;the parameters of the game, and apply some of its lessons to everyday life.</p> <p>All this rings true. That said, in keeping with the sometimes clunky methods of Stuart\u2019s chosen genre, there are less&#xa0;credible moments, such as when characters say things like: \u201cPlease figure things out \u2013 like you should have done years ago when we were happy\u201d. The odd detour, too, threatens to make the story too sappy for its own good. But keep faith, and it really doesn\u2019t matter. <em>A Boy Made of Blocks</em> is constructed around not just a great plot (the very moving denouement, at a Minecraft contest in London, is particularly inspired), but a rare sense of&#xa0;honesty and insight. Most of all it shows how autism need not be something discrete and fenced-off: it\u2019s a condition that shines light on the most fundamental parts of being human.</p> <p>\u2022 To order A Boy Made of Blocks for \u00a310.65 (Sphere, RRP \u00a312.99) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/boy-made-of-blocks.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

Skepta started releasing music in the early 00s, a key figure in the grime scene that emerged when London\u2019s sink estates started producing a dark, low-res reflection of the shiny UK garage that was dominating pop. After starting Meridian Crew (named after his Tottenham estate), then the Boy Better Know crew with his brother and fellow MC, Jamie \u201cJME\u201d Adenuga, Skepta became a cult underground artist. He was feted for his merciless, witty abuse of other MCs and carrying an unshakable self-determination that owed nothing to traditional musical channels in order to get his music heard.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Radio 1 doesn\u2019t exist to me.

US artists such as Puff Daddy were <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOYUOgmTjU4\">brought in for guest spots</a> in an attempt to make Skepta sound like every identikit chart rapper. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e137a8ba901a32e6951d5196aa4e8f6e614d32ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e137a8ba901a32e6951d5196aa4e8f6e614d32ef/0_460_6741_4045/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Skepta and members of his BBK crew in Hackney, east London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boy knows better...

Skepta went into a crisis of self-examination, emerging from it skint and label-less. He shakes his head at the memory: \u201cIn every area of life you get a natural talent and then somebody comes in, a manager who knows about the business, they take them and fuck them over. The talent realises they\u2019ve been fucked over and come out the other side. Some of them fall off and some people come out untouchable. And I\u2019m one of the people that came out untouchable. I\u2019m winning even if I have zero pence in my bank account, because my mind\u2019s free.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/06/10-things-we-learned-from-skeptas-konnichiwa\">10 things we learned from Skepta's Konnichiwa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He often speaks in hip-hop hyperbole but it isn\u2019t without substance: since then, Skepta has achieved recognition while remaining independent. Free from label constraints, he replaced euphoric pop riffs with his own defiant productions: ice-cold electronic rhythms spiked with reggae bass and techno futurism, resurrecting the grime sound that made his name and releasing them on his own BBK label. It was the right move. In 2014, he let loose That\u2019s Not Me, a shot of brutal energy that atoned for every misstep he\u2019d made in the last four years in three thrilling minutes. Its video was filmed on an \u00a380 budget and <a href=\"http://www.guardian-series.co.uk/news/13946393.Tottenham_rapper_Skepta_wins_big_at_the_MOBOs/\">won a Mobo award</a>. His absolution was complete. Following single Shutdown nailed his anti-mainstream stance in two blunt lines: \u201cThey try to steal my vision/ This ain\u2019t a culture, it\u2019s my religion.\u201d</p> <p>From there, grime went national, aided by direct-to-fan social media. In tandem with the genre\u2019s popularity and a wealth of new MCs breaking through, Skepta\u2019s notoriety expanded outside his core London fanbase to a new audience of suburban teenagers. His internet-enabled model, where releases would be pushed through his own channels, removed the distorting effect of major-label A&amp;R opinion; grime could flourish as it pleased with no commercial interference. By summer 2015, the Boy Better Know crew were drawing as big a crowd at the Reading and Leeds festivals as they were at Wiley\u2019s underground rave Eskimo Dance. Then it went global. By the time Skepta dropped Konnichiwa earlier this year, he was playing gigs from Tokyo to Lagos.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyONbqggasY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dyONbqggasY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Basking in the heat, Skepta contemplates the album that\u2019s gunning for a Mercury win. \u201cAs a younger man, I didn\u2019t think this was possible,\u201d he says. Its instant popularity still tickles him (all the more so as Konnichiwa was distributed direct from his home, his living room doubling up as a make-do CD warehouse). \u201cLike, my album came out in May, I was on a flight to Toronto the next day to play a show, and they knew all the words to the new songs. The next day! You think when I was a kid I ever thought that would happen? I mean, Pharrell Williams is on my album! If I was on a major label I might think, \u2018Oh yeah, that\u2019s what happens isn\u2019t it, I\u2019m signed, I\u2019ve got loads of money.\u2019 You don\u2019t even appreciate it. \u2019Cause I\u2019m independent, I wake up every day, look in the mirror, and I\u2019m like: \u2018You! You scruffy little shit from Tottenham got Pharrell on your album! I\u2019m blessed, bro.\u2019 That independent existence is scary because I don\u2019t have no certainty in my life. But that adrenaline is sick, it makes me make things happen.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If wearing a hoodie means you\u2019re going to rob something, I\u2019m going to wear a hoodie and go to No 1</p> <footer> <cite>Skepta</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The appearance of super-producer Pharrell was one of Skepta\u2019s few concessions to the accepted wisdom of packing an album with guest spots; in contrast, the producers alone listed on the latest Kanye and Beyonc\u00e9 records add up to a phone book\u2019s worth of names. But Skepta, who produces the majority of his own music, was determined to keep Konnichiwa tight. Talk of the potential of big-name US collaborations darkens his mood.</p> <p>\u201cI had so many anti-climaxes in America,\u201d he says. Since his star has risen in the States, numerous artists have been clamouring for a slice of Brit authenticity. But Skepta is unimpressed by their fame game. \u201cArtists that I look up to, that I\u2019d seen on television here in London, I meet them and they\u2019re not even human,\u201d he continues. \u201cThey\u2019re just arseholes \u2013 people that, when I was younger, I thought were gonna inspire me when I met them. For real, they\u2019ve gone too far. People tell them that they\u2019re an artist and that they\u2019re big and that\u2019s what they become.

He discarded the designer clothing he wore in the major-label years, reverting to basic black tracksuits that realigned him with the kids on the streets. (\u201cIf they paint us with the brush that means wearing a hoodie means you\u2019re going to rob something, I\u2019m going to put on a hoodie and go to fucking No 1,\u201d he says). His album is full of tracks where he is the relatable everyman, from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVw542-t5W4\">Crime Riddim</a>\u2019s tales of police harassment to the titular opener pointing out that he travelled \u201cto the Brits on a train\u2026 Man shut down Wireless, then I walked home in the rain\u201d.

True to his word, Skepta is friendly, giving them advice, genuinely listening to their responses, then resolutely refusing a selfie. They leave, starstruck and satisfied. Talk of grime spreading has the MC philosophical. \u201cWe\u2019ve been ahead for so long in the UK, we\u2019re so multicultural and that\u2019s the beauty,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why grime was formed, from this mix, this understanding of different people. Now other people are catching on. There\u2019s a revolution happening.\u201d</p> <p>When Skepta talks of a revolution, he\u2019s talking about one that starts from within. He\u2019s a firm believer in self-actualisation, as well as the power of creating networks outside of the conventional structures. \u201cGetting in touch with your life purpose is important,\u201d he says, if by now a little hazily. \u201cNow I understand what I\u2019m here to tell everyone: togetherness is everything, bruv.\u201d</p> <p>As such, it\u2019s little surprise that he\u2019s got no time for party politics. Whereas some grime artists like Novelist are taking to the stage, encouraging chants of \u201cFuck David Cameron\u201d and tweeting their allegiance to the Labour Party, all that is bottom of Skepta\u2019s agenda. Last month, Tory culture secretary <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edvaizey/status/761257407179882496\">Ed Vaizey sent Skepta and fellow rapper Kano a congratulatory tweet</a> for being nominated for a Mercury award. He had ignored all the non-grime artists on the shortlist in what looked like a bizarre, craven reach for credibility. Vaizey wasn\u2019t dismissed in response; he was utterly ignored. Today Skepta has never heard of him, and has no interest in hearing about him whatsoever \u2013 Vaizey is part of a different world to his, and he sees the media and politicians as one and the same.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c5ab0dc48416113f989dd5d947302262df67f25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c5ab0dc48416113f989dd5d947302262df67f25/0_475_5019_5015/1000.jpg\" alt=\"skepta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Skepta: \u2018Greatness is a state of mind\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivia Rose for The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He pauses to relight his spliff, and warms to his theme. \u201cThe other day Beyonc\u00e9 was <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4ji6ct\">dancing to That\u2019s Not Me in Wembley arena</a>,\u201d he says. \u201c<em>That</em> should be on the news; that is fucking sick, it\u2019s a game changer.

After breaking into the US Billboard charts, and touring the world with an album of slang-heavy music that should only make sense in the UK, you do get the feeling that Skepta could do anything with that sort of self-belief. He seems to know that, too.

It is not illegal to hold companies offshore.</p> <p>The Panama Papers include emails from Zhukov\u2019s lawyers in Cyprus and Comatrans SA, a financial services company based in Geneva.</p> <p>By 2009, Zhukov and the Ukrainian oligarchs Igor Kolomoisky and Gennady Bogolyubov were embroiled in a bitter battle for control of JKX, an oil and gas company listed on the London Stock Exchange. JKX is one of the biggest non-\u00adstate-owned oil producers in Ukraine.</p> <p>Zhukov bought an 11.5% stake in the company through his BVI\u00ad-registered investment vehicle Glengary Overseas Ltd. It was claimed that he had teamed up with Kolomoisky and Bogolyubov to seize control of JKX. In 2013, a dispute with the then board of JKX spilled over into the high court.</p> <p>JKX\u2019s British managers argued that the trio were <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/inquiry-into-oligarchs-alleged-collusion-to-take-control-of-british-firm-8925792.html?origin=internalSearch\">colluding to take over the business</a> without paying \u201ca proper premium for the shares\u201d.<br></p> <p>The high court judge Mr Justice Mann said Kolomoisky had a <a href=\"http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2013/2631.html\">reputation for being a \u201ccorporate raider\u201d</a> , but did not determine whether the reputation was deserved or not. Bogolyubov \u201cprobably\u201d did, too, the judge said, adding that Zhukov did not \u201cseem to have had the same reputation,\u201d but had previously done business with Kolomoisky, Ukraine\u2019s second-richest man.</p> <p>The board considered that it had reasonable cause to believe that the oligarchs were acting together, Mann found. However, he said the board\u2019s purpose in its actions was improper, meaning its decisions were invalid.</p> <p>The board appealed, but the supreme court unanimously upheld Mann\u2019s decision last year. One of the supreme court justices, Lord Sumption, had previously acted as QC for Abramovich in his 2012 legal battle against the late oligarch Boris Berezovsky, with Sumption <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/aug/06/jonathan-sumption-brain-of-britain\">reportedly earning a fee of more than \u00a35m</a>.</p> <p>It has been <a href=\"http://johnhelmer.net/?p=15085\">reported</a> that, in January, Zhukov and his fellow oligarchs ousted JKX\u2019s directors and replaced them with their own nominees. A spokesman for JKX has denied any connection between the three oligarchs and JKX\u2019s second-largest shareholder, Proxima Capital Group, which achieved the changes.</p> <p>Months later, Kolomoisky\u2019s global assets were frozen after a <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-22/billionaire-kolomoisky-at-center-of-380-million-asset-freeze\">separate $380m legal dispute</a> with Russian oil company Tatneft.</p> <p>The order covered Kolomoisky\u2019s French villa and other assets, following claims that he had seized control of a Ukrainian oil refinery joint venture and siphoned hundreds of millions of dollars into offshore shell companies. Bogolyubov\u2019s assets, including a house in Belgrave Square, central London, were also frozen.</p> <p>Kolomoisky dismisses the Tatneft allegations as \u201cobviously false\u201d. He has denied \u201ccolluding with anyone\u201d over JKX and being a corporate raider and said Mann did not find on this point. Kolomoisky said there were \u201clegitimate reasons\u201d for using offshore structures, not least that Ukrainian presidents use state bodies to redistribute assets when they come to power.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is that a significant part of the world operates under different conditions to those in the UK,\u201d Kolomoisky said.</p> <p>Kolomoisky appears in the Panama Papers in connection with five offshore companies and a family trust. His Israeli passport also surfaces, together with that of his daughter, Angelika.

He vehemently denied the allegations and successfully defended himself. Zhukov admits meeting and doing business with some of Odessa\u2019s criminal figures, but says this was before their illegal connections became apparent.</p> <p>However, the case gave a fascinating insight into his background and the company that he kept at the time. </p> <p>In the 1990s, Zhukov co-founded <a href=\"https://www.occrp.org/en/customs/1846-operators-of-cargo-terminal-raise-questions\">Sintez UK</a>, a company involved in shipping Russian crude oil to the port of Odessa, in Ukraine, which was <a href=\"https://www.occrp.org/en/customs/1846-operators-of-cargo-terminal-raise-questions\">allegedly run</a> by mafia gangs at the time.</p> <p>In 1998, Italian police launched a major investigation into the Ukrainian mafia, which concluded that the problem of organised crime in Odessa was very serious, with mobsters \u201cin possession of a great quantity of weapons such as guns, machine guns and explosives\u201d.</p> <p>A report by the special police unit servizio centralo operativo includes a reference to Zhukov in a graphic.

Angert\u2019s company <a href=\"http://companyformationuk.co/Officers/TRANSCARGO-LIMITED/2910507\">Transcargo</a> shared a Mayfair address with Zhukov\u2019s Sintez UK. </p> <p>Italian police arrested Zhukov at Olbia airport in Sardinia in 2001 as he was heading to his villa in nearby Porto Cervo. Detectives accused him of being part of a ring that tried to smuggle weapons from Ukraine and Belarus to the former Yugoslavia in 1994. The alleged shipment, apparently destined for Venice and hidden aboard the Jadran Express container vessel, was said to have included grenades, anti-tank weapons and 30,0000 Kalashnikovs.</p> <p>While Zhukov spent six months in prison in Turin, he was interviewed by Belgian police and later acquitted. He <a href=\"http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/441351\">told Russian newspaper Kommersant</a>: \u201cI am completely innocent of arms dealing.\u201d The court held that the underlying facts \u201cdid not exist\u201d. His lawyers said the proceedings were \u201ctotally without merit\u201d.</p> <p>According to his spokesman, Zhukov knew <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jul/09/armstrade.iantraynor\">Angert and Leonid Minin</a>, an international arms dealer, who was one of the inspirations for Yuri Orlov, the fictional character played by Nicolas Cage in the film Lord of War.</p> <p>Minin was arrested in 2000 when police found him in a Milan hotel with four prostitutes, cocaine, $150,000 (\u00a3113,000) in cash and African diamonds worth $500m. He was convicted of drug possession and sentenced to two years in prison. </p> <p>However, Zhukov\u2019s spokesman told the Guardian that his client\u2019s oil companies were only involved in lawful arms-length \u201ccommercial transactions\u201d with Minin\u2019s firms. </p> <p>These were \u201cfully legitimate\u201d, he said, adding that Minin did not have \u201cnasty reputational issues\u201d at the time.</p> <p>Separately, Italy\u2019s parliament named Zhukov in a 464-page report into Russian organised crime in 2005. It called Zhukov an \u201cimportant member\u201d of the Solntsevskaya gang, Russia\u2019s most powerful international crime syndicate, with a base in Rome.</p> <p>Zhukov strongly denies the allegation. He has never been arrested, charged or convicted of any related offences. </p> <p>Zhukov\u2019s UK citizenship will not endear him to Russia\u2019s hawkish president, Vladimir Putin. UK-Russian relations <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/russia-and-iran-delighted-at-uks-rejection-of-eu\">have been strained</a> since the murder of the former Russian secret service officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/19/alexander-litvinenko-the-man-who-solved-his-own-murder\">Alexander Litvinenko</a> in London in 2006.

Give these green stems of thought your passionate attention, otherwise they may be dead by Christmas. Water well and weed diligently. But here\u2019s my advice on how to proceed: treat these seedlings like job applicants. You don\u2019t know who they are yet. They may seem feisty, clever or captivatingly beautiful, but are they going to offer anything original? Most important, are they likely to be inspirational companions, who will lead you to create the best work that you\u2019re capable of? WB&#xa0;Yeats\u2019s advice to writers, \u201cDo not hurry, do not rest\u201d, is&#xa0;relevant here.</p> <p>As the autumn advances, keep a vigil on the applicants. Then, you\u2019ll gradually begin to know what they\u2019re leading you towards. Are you embarking on the long road to something truthful, or just moving towards a heaving skip of recycled bullshit? The landmass of the western world is slowly being submerged by bad books. You don\u2019t want to add to this tonnage, so go slowly into your analysis of what it is you\u2019ve got to say. Does it have real emotional and intellectual grip? If so, then start gathering all the knowledge you\u2019ll need to set forth on your great writing adventure.</p> <p>Only remember that the September applicants may not fulfil their promising CVs.

It\u2019s tempting, given the limitless power of the omniscient novelist, to plunge into a character\u2019s head and write, baldly, \u201cLaura felt painfully envious\u201d. But what has&#xa0;more energy is the analysis of how a character in the grip&#xa0;of painful envy carries herself, speaks, looks, and even dresses. We always know, if we are observant, how a person who is desperately, secretly in love with another behaves. The trick of fiction is to extract the ways in which other emotions affect the outer crust, too, and by observing the&#xa0;characteristic walk of a human being overcome with happiness, say, making the reader feel observant, and not just laboriously informed.</p> <p>How this carriage affects the characters around her, too: because fiction does not amount to much if it is just one character standing in a stairwell, pondering gravely about past events. If the first lesson of fiction is about the leakage of the abstract into the world of the physical, the second ought to be that fiction is about the way one character\u2019s desires will crash into another\u2019s, and a third, and a fourth, when all that seems to be happening is four friends meeting in a pub, or working together in an office, or finding themselves thrown together by chance. The episode that consists of one person alone leads to nothing much: the episode of four different characters with their own ways of life moves in multiple directions.</p> <p>To do this, the beginning writer is going to have to undertake some systematic observation, notebook in hand. No novelist worth reading ever sat at home, entranced with the words spooling out. They paid attention to the life of the streets, to the mannerisms of their friends, to the way a small child speaks when he is hoping not to get found out.

If you start writing (however striking your original idea) with no sense of how your story will end, then life becomes progressively harder. Flailing around. Writer\u2019s block. Draft after draft. This is how novels get abandoned; film scripts bottom-drawered. The thing to do is to stop and envisage your final pages, your final scene. Take your time. What note do you want to strike? What surprise do you want to spring? What denouement will justify this journey?</p> <p>It may sound mechanical, but story-telling is a very complicated business, full of moving parts and many cogs engaging.

A comprehensive in Exeter? Born with a silver spoon; or things started off comfortably, but his father\u2019s business failed when he was 11? Raised in the shadow of three older siblings?

Talmudic study?) and his fears.</p> <p>Once you know this person as well as you know yourself (or better), and once you put him, or her, in a particular place in a particular time, your character can only really act (or react) in a limited number of ways. He will notice only certain things, and those things only from a particular perspective; he will interact with others as only he can. If you\u2019re using the first person, or the third person privileging this character, your diction and syntax \u2013 your very writing style \u2013 will be shaped by this person.</p> <p>So much about a character is invisible, in fiction as in real life; but what lies beneath the surface will affect every aspect of your story.

Suddenly you\u2019ll see what you couldn\u2019t see when you were down among the undergrowth. It\u2019s going on too long, it\u2019s sentimental, the tone\u2019s too heavy, there are too many sentences with same rhythm, there\u2019s an inadvertent repetition. Or, something\u2019s missing. You could print out your work, to try to see it freshly \u2013 or type it up, if you\u2019re writing longhand. Or you could look at it full screen on the computer, with a different background, more like the pages of a book. The trouble is you have to make this effort not once, but over and over. Your mind will be sore from the effort of reading the same old thing so many times as if it were new. But unless you do it you won\u2019t know what you\u2019ve written, or whether you\u2019ve got it alive and whole, faithfully, on to the page.</p> <p>\u2022 Tessa Hadley is professor of creative writing at Bath Spa University</p> <h2>Don\u2019t be afraid to start again <strong>\u2013 </strong>Jeanette Winterson</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b16d30419aa8e9070e4a6afdfafd682f5152cb56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b16d30419aa8e9070e4a6afdfafd682f5152cb56/2027_657_2409_3011/800.jpg\" alt=\"Murdo MacLeod for the Guardian\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Murdo MacLeod for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Creativity is inexhaustible.

Day and night, the compulsion to write never leaves him, he says. He can\u2019t rest; can\u2019t forget the unfinished novel he\u2019s meant to be working on; can\u2019t see a cloud in the sky without thinking of a comparison (with a grand piano, say) he might use somewhere; can\u2019t trust the praise of encouragement of friends; feels nervous, miserable, overwrought, half-mad, and when any new work of his appears in print realises that it\u2019s all wrong. Nina doesn\u2019t listen, to her cost. But aspiring writers would do well to heed the warning. To be forever \u201cconsuming your own life\u201d, as Trigorin puts it, is no picnic.</p> <p>But as he also admits, the act itself, when you\u2019re fully immersed, is enjoyable. And to write \u201cin a sort of haze\u201d, unsure what you\u2019re up to but simply compelled, may be no bad thing. Say you sit down to write a poem, or an episode, set on an autumn morning. You have the idea but feel stuck, hamstrung, overwhelmed by your literary forebears: mist and mellow fruitfulness have been done to death. So has woodsmoke but suddenly you\u2019ve the smell in your nostrils and are reminded of (or imagine) a particular fire, logs crackling in a grate, two wine-glasses, a bitter argument, a crimson stain on a sheepskin rug \u2013 perhaps the scene is a winter night rather an autumn morning and the logs are imitation logs in a modern gas fire, but that\u2019s fine, where you\u2019re being taken is more interesting than what you\u2019d planned. Just go with it \u2013 you can always change it later.</p> <p>In other words, if you only write what you\u2019re expecting to write, you\u2019ll be bored. Take a risk. Work against the grain. Don\u2019t be afraid to make a deathbed scene comic, or to show a murderer being kind to animals.

There\u2019s a couple of ways to get around this. Most obviously, you can let yourself off writing as well as you\u2019re possibly able. You can say: \u201cThis is draft zero, not even a first draft, so there\u2019s no need for it to be anything but an exciting mess.\u201d Lots of writing advice is about taking the pressure off by lowering the expectations you have of each draft. That\u2019s the very best part of your very best.</p> <p>A different approach, one I often suggest to writers who are struggling, is to dodge the issue entirely.</p> <p>Instead of writing your novel or story as you, and anticipating all that pressure of owning your work (having friends read it as yours, reading it out in public after being introduced as you), give yourself a pseudonym to work with. Make up the name of a writer you just might have been, if you hadn\u2019t been yourself. Type it in at the top of the manuscript. Print it out. Sign it. (I\u2019m serious.) This draft is no longer by you (at your very best). This draft is by them, whoever they turn out to be.</p> <p>Now, whenever you need to figure something out about your story, from the overall form to the punctuation of a sentence, you can shift responsibility. The question isn\u2019t \u201cHow do I, at my very best, write this?\u201d but \u201cHow does so-and-so write this?\u201d</p> <p>By writing under a secret pseudonym, you will gain a collaborator who has no hang-ups, no responsibilities, no history. They will, I promise, help you write better \u2013 perhaps even better than your very best.</p> <p>\u2022 Toby Litt is a senior lecturer in creative writing at Birkbeck, University of London <strong> </strong></p> <h2>Do your research <strong>\u2013 </strong>Kathryn Hughes</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a30f72955421b1daa3283cee9f7b00bcd398e3bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a30f72955421b1daa3283cee9f7b00bcd398e3bf/507_206_592_739/401.jpg\" alt=\"Graham Turner for the Guardian\" width=\"401\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graham Turner for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s this odd idea that, when it comes to writing non-fiction and biography, all you have to do is get the facts straight in your head and then spool them out in a listless monotone. The experience is rather like sitting next to a pub bore, who starts every sentence with \u201cThe interesting thing is \u2026\u201d without noticing that you\u2019ve already turned away and started to talk to someone else.</p> <p>So it\u2019s all about finding a way to tell your story about the past as if it is actually very present. And, no, that doesn\u2019t mean employing the historic present tense, which is used far too often, and mostly badly. Instead, you need to marinate yourself in your material, consuming everything that you can get your hands on about your subject (we\u2019ll assume you\u2019re writing a biography) and the period in which they lived. Read the books that they read, not just the ones that they actually wrote. Track down their great-great-granddaughter and ask if there any relics (snuffboxes, spectacles diaries, not actual bones) that you could sniff or finger. Saturate yourself in your subject\u2019s correspondence until you know the name of their neighbour\u2019s dog or the date on which their child\u2019s first tooth fell out.</p> <p>Only once you\u2019ve metabolised this material, taken it into your own body, let it settle and mulch inside you for weeks, months or years, will you have a hope of making it live again. The first time you sit down to write, after a period of research immersion, try it freestyle. Don\u2019t hug your notes, or pore over timelines. Write the narrative from memory, letting details float to the front of your imagination, while others recede into the background. With any luck, your narrative will feel fresh and juicy because that is how it lives in your imagination. Only at this point should you go back to your data and make sure that you haven\u2019t invented anything.

It is this seriousness of intent that gives you half a chance of writing something that will have a life beyond your desk. It might be easier to deny this aspect and pretend that you will never get there \u2013 how dare you presume that this folly of a story you are bashing out can be something real, a book for an actual audience, and more to the point, isn\u2019t it very likely you will write a bad ending? You made the whole thing up, after all, and this contraption that we call plot could easily come apart. So goes the insecure writerly mind in the dark hours. But once you believe that you will reach the end of your book, whatever shape that takes, then it can make it easier to write with the kind of conviction and purpose that makes a reader want to turn the page.</p> <p>In <em>Six Walks in the Fictional Woods</em>, the playful and profound series of essays on writing by<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/nov/12/umberto-eco-real-literature-is-about-losers\" title=\"\"> Umberto Eco</a>, he likens the act of reading to playing a game: \u201ca game by which we give sense to the immensity of things that have happened, are happening or will happen in the world\u201d. By saying to yourself that you will complete the story, you are acknowledging the nature of this transaction between yourself and a potential reader \u2013 you are in the game.</p> <p>Of course, your story may never have a reader, but I believe there are very few benefits to thinking in that way. Time and time again I have seen talented students ditch their manuscripts at the half-way point, and less talented students reach the end, rewrite the whole book enthusiastically, and get published. Something about ending your novel can elevate it beyond what you might feel is a shameful and insubstantial piece of drivel that you have written in your pyjamas and make it a contender in your own mind.

Pearls seemingly formed between tennis and cocktails, brilliantly deployed by the greats between six and nine every morning but Sunday. Suddenly our biggest hurdle isn\u2019t character, pace or plot, but that we can\u2019t even play tennis.</p> <p>I\u2019m talking about the otherness of our peers. If our toolkit&#xa0;belongs to Fitzgerald and Faulkner, our first issue will&#xa0;be getting over writing relative crap at the outset. But whoever said \u201cwriting is rewriting\u201d knew the science of crap, the practical lesson being: it\u2019s easier to improve it than to originate brilliance. To improve it we need to have it, which means writing it, and that requires a different ethos than the one we probably sat down with, glowing with hope&#xa0;and expectation.</p> <p>My suggestion is this: we stop ourselves from writing what we have to write by pausing to fret over details and risks, and by filtering ourselves through subconscious juries. Sparkles of gold can appear if we just get enough words written, which means write like the wind, don\u2019t look down. Make a pact never to show anyone, build a mound of dirt, skim it later for anything that excites you. Skimming is a different job, sober and honest, of an archaeologist crumbling dirt in her hands. Separate any glimmers into a new document and build on them, connect them, repeat the process. Those glimmers are also evidence that things can work out, making them power pills for the will; use them to press on. We might start by sifting crap but a couple of passes can lure out real pipe-puffing linen-wearing tennis-playing vigour.</p> <p>The key then is to not try playing tennis.</p> <p>\u2022 DBC Pierre is author of writing guide <em>Release the Bats</em></p> <h2>Ignore tips <strong>\u2013 </strong>Amit Chaudhuri</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"03713fb033b57a444610a7eca447cf8dd72312f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03713fb033b57a444610a7eca447cf8dd72312f5/2374_297_1676_2095/800.jpg\" alt=\"Eamonn McCabe for the Guardian\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eamonn McCabe for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The one tip I give to students of writing is to disregard tips. These might have to do with arresting opening sentences, or they may simply concern the tools of the trade \u2013 character, setting, description, plot. The four words, chosen randomly, are vague descriptive categories once used in literary&#xa0;departments, where, with \u201ctone\u201d, they\u2019ve been abandoned, only to be repeatedly invoked in creative writing classes along with \u201ccraft\u201d, \u201csentence\u201d, and that nervous-making shibboleth, \u201cpoint of view\u201d. I\u2019m not sure what \u201ccharacter\u201d means. Is it an aggregate of physical features \u2013 nose, eyes, hair \u2013 which add up to a bodily presence into which, as if it were a vessel, you pour psychological life: thoughts, memories, political views? Can&#xa0;you \u201cfictionalise\u201d a real person by adding a moustache to his face, or a stammer to his speech?</p> <p>Why is it that, when we invent characters, the process of&#xa0;invention involves an excavation from the subconscious, as if we were trying to remember someone we knew decades&#xa0;ago; while when we write of people we know, we see them in our imagination as independent entities who are&#xa0;essentially strangers to us? To create a character is to unlearn what we know: tips will be unhelpful. Unhelpful, too, is the hierarchy in which these categories arrive, with character at the centre, and setting important inasmuch as&#xa0;it&#xa0;is where plot or story \u2013 or what happens to the protagonist \u2013 unfolds.</p> <p>For me, the protagonist is only one element in a story: evening, room, wall, smoke, car, are other possible ones. It\u2019s a prejudice inherited from the European Renaissance that the human must occupy centre stage, everything else being secondary. A work of the imagination gives us not a protagonist, but the intimation of a world. No one thing in a&#xa0;world \u2013 object or person \u2013 has centrality.</p> <p>If I have one more tip, it\u2019s this: give nothing centrality, because writing is about continually shifting weight from one thing and moment to the other.</p> <p>\u2022 Amit Chaudhuri is professor of contemporary literature at the University of East&#xa0;Anglia</p> <h2>Just do it <strong>\u2013 </strong>Naomi Alderman</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"152354f00ac4a277124f19c8ce7f12d0e55f5e59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/152354f00ac4a277124f19c8ce7f12d0e55f5e59/91_89_271_338/271.png\" alt=\"Naomi Alderman\" width=\"271\" height=\"338\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>You learn the most from sitting down and doing the work, regularly, patiently, sometimes in hope, sometimes despairingly.

Expect to be disgusted by your own early work. If writing is your vocation, if you hope that it might be your salvation, push on through the disgust until you find&#xa0;one true sentence, a few words that say more than you&#xa0;expected, something you didn\u2019t know until you set it&#xa0;down.</p> <p>There are no \u201ctips\u201d for this process really; it\u2019s painstaking and intense and doesn\u2019t often feel pleasant.</p> <p>However, I think there are tips for how to sit your bum on the chair and do the work.</p> <p>Stop reading so many articles on the internet about how to write.

There are lots of jobs that make these kinds of demands, and maybe we just have to make the best of it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2015/aug/22/secret-teacher-face-another-school-year\">Secret Teacher: I really don\u2019t know if I can face another school year</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are, thankfully, some positive people around me.

  "<p>The FTSE 100 has jumped by 14% in a dramatic recovery since its post-Brexit dive on 24 June. But once again the cheap \u201cindex\u201d funds have given investors the best returns, prompting many to conclude that paying a fund manager to look after your money just isn\u2019t worth it when computers do it better.</p> <p>Year in, year out, low-charge index funds have been beating their more expensive actively managed counterparts. Almost all the difference is down to the fact that index funds charge as little as 0.06% a year, while active funds charge at least 1%, and often a lot more once hidden fees are taken into account. After all, those Porsches and Ferraris have to be financed somehow.</p> <p>On 24 June, Brexit result day, active funds fell 8%, but UK index funds were down just 6%. Since then the latter have maintained a 2% lead over the former. Over one year the average UK active fund is up 10.6%, but the typical UK index fund is up 17%. In the US, active funds are up 24.8% over the year, while Fidelity\u2019s US index fund is up 31.2%. In Europe, active funds are up around 16.7%, but index funds are around 17%.</p> <p>Index and tracker funds simply replicate the market, neither beating it or falling much behind. Like conventional funds, you are free to put them into a \u00a315,240 tax-free Isa. But financial advisers have not been keen on them, as they paid little, if any, sales commission. Regulatory changes, however, are thankfully sweeping away some of the bias against index funds. Last week Hargreaves Lansdown, the UK\u2019s biggest firm of financial advisers, added for the first time index funds to its Wealth 150 list of what it reckons are the best investments.</p> <p>So how do you buy an index fund, who from, and which one to choose?</p> <h2><strong>What to buy</strong></h2> <p>Firstly, choose your index. There is a tracker for virtually every single index in the world \u2013 you can match the FTSE 100, the FTSE All Share or the S&amp;P 500 on Wall Street, and so on. The big providers in the UK with trackers available to small investors are Vanguard, L&amp;G, BlackRock, Fidelity and HSBC.</p> <p>Which one you choose comes down to price, which vary according to which market you are tracking.</p> <p><strong>FTSE 100 trackers</strong> These match the performance of the 100 biggest shares on the London stock exchange. The BlackRock 100 UK Equity fund charges 0.07% of your assets every year. L&amp;G\u2019s UK 100 index fund is 0.1% a year, while the HSBC FTSE 100 Index fund is 0.18%.</p> <p><strong>FTSE All Share trackers</strong> These match the FTSE 100, but also include small- and medium-sized companies. BlackRock\u2019s UK Equity Tracker costs 0.06%, while HSBC\u2019s FTSE All Share Index is 0.07%. Fidelity\u2019s Index UK costs 0.08% a year, but 0.06% if you buy directly from Fidelity.</p> <p><strong>UK Equity Income trackers</strong> An index fund can also match dividend payments from big shares on the London stock market. The Vanguard FTSE UK Equity Income Index fund currently pays dividends of 4.48% and charges 0.22% a year.</p> <p><strong>Do-it-all index funds</strong> Among the most popular trackers are ones that hold a mix of equity and bond trackers across the world. For example, Vanguard\u2019s Life Strategy 40% Equity Fund contains 17 global sub-funds and charges 0.24%.</p> <h2><strong>How to buy</strong></h2> <p>You can\u2019t ring up groups such as Vanguard and ask to invest \u00a31,000 \u2013 their minimum for direct investors is \u00a3100,000. But you can invest how much you like via an investment platform, which buy and hold the index fund for you, send you statements, let you withdraw and add money and so on. Typically you will pay the price of the underlying fund, plus the cost of keeping it on the platform. The cheapest platform depends on how much you are investing and how frequently you trade.</p> <p><strong>Cheap for small sums</strong> Cavendish, Rplan and Axa Self Investor all stand out. <a href=\"https://www.cavendishonline.co.uk/\" title=\"\">CavendishOnline</a> charges 0.25% a year, so with the cheapest of the index funds at 0.06%, an investor could pay as little as 0.31% for their money to be invested and managed. That\u2019s just \u00a33.10 for every \u00a31,000 invested. Rplan and Axa Self Investor\u2019s basic platform charge is 0.35%. AJ Bell YouInvest charges 0.25%, plus \u00a31.50 for each transaction.</p> <p><strong>Cheap for bigger investors</strong> Percentage-based fees can be pricey if you have a large sum to invest, so consider paying a basic charge instead. For example, iWeb, part of the Lloyds group, charges \u00a3200 to open an account. After that it charges \u00a35 per transaction when you buy and sell, with no annual platform charges on top. You will, of course, still have to pay the underlying fund fee (eg, 0.06% for the BlackRock Tracker). Alliance Trust Savings charges \u00a37.50 a month, plus \u00a312.50 per transaction, plus fund fee. The Share Centre charges a lower \u00a34.80 a month plus a fund dealing fee of 1% (minimum \u00a37.50) per transaction.</p> <p><strong>Cheap for advice</strong> If you don\u2019t fancy picking funds yourself, there are online services that do it for you. Moneyfarm assesses your risk and creates you a portfolio of index funds. Underlying costs are 0.25%, but it charges nothing on the first \u00a310,000. For \u00a350,000 of investments, its fee is \u00a3240 a year. Nutmeg will build and manage a portfolio for you, and charges 0.3%-0.95%, and says underlying fund fees are 0.19%.</p> <p><strong>The big beasts</strong> Hargreaves Lansdown has nearly 40% of the market for small investors. Its fee is 0.45% a year plus the underlying fund fee. Its size means it has negotiated some cheaper underlying fund fees than its rivals \u2013 for example, it discounts the L&amp;G UK Index fund from 0.1% to 0.06%. Fidelity is the other mega-platform and charges a 0.35% service fee.</p>",
  "<h2>Approaching 60, should I stay in my current role or accept it\u2019s time to retire?</h2> <p><strong>I\u2019ve been teaching at an FE college for more than 20 years and will be 60 next July. This means I will be eligible to retire and claim my teachers\u2019 pension.</strong></p> <p><strong>There are many changes taking place at the college, which is looking at merging with other institutions. The job has become very stressful, plus I have diabetes.&#xa0; To claim my pension from July 2017 I have to give between six weeks\u2019 and six months\u2019 notice, which means decision time is looming.</strong></p> <p><strong>I have no concrete plans of what to do after retirement. Colleagues say I should reduce my teaching hours and carry on. Personally, I want a less demanding role, perhaps as a teaching or learning support tutor.&#xa0;</strong></p> <p><strong>I don\u2019t know whether I should approach my head or HR to discuss this now. I\u2019m worried this may put doubts in their minds about my competence \u2013 and my fitness. Or should I just give in my notice and plan something new? If so, what? </strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>You are sensibly giving all this serious thought right now rather than waiting for the deadline, but I suspect the luxury of time is causing you to worry too much and see problems where none may exist.</p> <p>To start with your last question first: should you just give in your notice and plan something new on retirement? Nothing you\u2019ve told me suggests this should be your choice. If you had long harboured the ambition to do something entirely different on retirement you would certainly have mentioned it. You\u2019re sensitive to stress and have diabetes. Although you find your present role unsatisfactory in certain respects, you\u2019re familiar with your college and clearly comfortable there. Your ideal would be a less demanding role that would enable you to stay, so your priority must surely be to see if that\u2019s a real possibility.</p> <p>I don\u2019t share your concern that discussing post-retirement options with HR (rather than your head) might cause them to question your commitment as a teacher. At this stage you don\u2019t even have to reveal where your inclination lies. It\u2019s entirely reasonable to ask for information, and part of HR\u2019s role is to supply it. You could even depersonalise things by asking: \u201cWhat are the choices open to people in my position?\u201d</p> <p>Whatever you learn, it\u2019s bound to help you make the right decision.</p> <p><strong>Readers say </strong></p> <p>\u2022 Don\u2019t be afraid to be selfish \u2013 you seem to have done your stint for your fellow man already. I suggest you take a 100% break from your current working environment and experience life from a different perspective. I started volunteering for Citizens Advice, while a colleague volunteered for the local canal trust doing restorative and maintenance work after 40 years behind a desk!</p> <p>Good luck. <strong>daveginboav</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Phased retirement is an option for those in the teachers\u2019 pension scheme. I was able to step away from a head of department role and take a part-time senior role in another field.</p> <p>I am now in the last year of the phased bit, my fourth, and it has been wholly positive. I realised how much I leant on the work status, the feeling of effecting change, the title, the daily interactions, but I have naturally distanced myself from that and engineered some creative situations instead, such as editing a book and making a film.</p> <p>It was a chance to step back and consider what it was I really liked doing as opposed to what I thought I did. I tried a few things that didn\u2019t work out but that\u2019s all part of the fun. <strong>frankmills </strong></p> <h2>Is wanting to work in the heritage sector a daydream?</h2> <p><strong>In 2012 I completed a PGCE. After some time on the supply circuit and being unable to obtain a full-time teaching post, I worked from 2014 to this last academic term as a higher-level teaching assistant at a primary school to get some stability and guaranteed pay.&#xa0;</strong></p> <p><strong>However, though I\u2019ve always wanted to work in education, I aimed for roles outside schools, within libraries or the heritage/arts sector, running education and projects for museums, theatre companies, etc. My degree was in English and history, my two passions.</strong></p> <p><strong>I spent a year volunteering with the National Trust. Over the past two years I have had at least 10-15 interviews for education officer/librarian roles (out of the at least 50 cross-country jobs I\u2019ve applied for), and each time was told I was a good candidate but the job went to someone with more experience. As my contract has been ended at my last post, I will be returning to a supply agency next week.&#xa0;</strong></p> <p><strong>At nearly 30, what do I do? Seek further unpaid work experience and continue to apply for education roles within the heritage sector, or is it time to accept this may be a castle in the sky?</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>I urge you not to make a decision now that you could well regret for the rest of your working life. The first option you mention, to seek further unpaid work experience and continue to apply for roles within the heritage sector, seems to me the right one. The more experience you have, the better \u2013 and at least as valuable, it is also evidence to potential employers of how committed you are to working in this sector. If you can convey that commitment in future interviews (which there will be) you have every chance of finally embarking on the career to which you\u2019ve long aspired.</p> <p><strong>Readers say </strong></p> <p>\u2022 Continue to look for a mainstream education role and use the holidays to volunteer in local arts organisations. School holidays are the period with strongest demand. I would also suggest you seek help with your interview skills. Your track record suggests there may be issues. <strong>JulesMaigret</strong></p> <p><strong>Do you need advice on a work issue?

  "<p>When I discovered the theme for my recipe swap, I was grateful and relieved in equal measure. While this classic sweet-but-bitter citrus preserve always has a place at my breakfast table, the supply from my enthusiastic jam-making auntie often outstrips the demand. I\u2019ve experimented to a certain degree (spreading it over a pork shoulder, layering in breakfast pots with creamy Greek yoghurt, swirling through brownie batter), but your suggestions have given me a renewed vigour.</p> <p>In all cases, these recipes have proved to be so much more than the sum of their parts. That characteristic bitterness is just what an indulgent, chocolatey pudding needs to pull it back from the brink of sickly sweet; it pairs perfectly with robust, woody herbs while retaining its character, and, what\u2019s more, a little spike of heat will mean you will be reaching for a spoon at breakfast, lunch and dinner. See this as a chance to think beyond tea and toast.</p> <h2>The winning recipe: <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57bda701e4b0fe30498a458a/5001549\">Marmalade panna cotta with bay and bourbon</a></h2> <p>What I loved most about <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/detoutcoeur%20Limousin\"><em>Detoutcoeur Limousin</em></a>\u2019s panna cotta is that it\u2019s a collection of classic ingredients used to make a crowd-pleasing pudding, but somehow, it tastes exciting and new. It\u2019s creamy, sharp, heady and rich, all in one mouthful, with the warming sweetness of the marmalade giving a good contrast to savoury bay. Using finely shredded marmalade will give a smoother texture.</p> <p><strong>Makes 6</strong><br>3 gelatine leaves<br>250ml double cream<br>400ml creme fraiche<br>100ml whole milk<br>2 bay leaves<br>150g Seville orange marmalade<br>Juice and zest of 1 orange, plus extra zest to serve<br>Zest of 1 lemon<br>2 tbsp bourbon (optional)</p> <p>1 Put the gelatine leaves in a bowl of cold water for around 5 minutes, or until they soften.</p> <p>2 Heat the cream, creme fraiche and milk with the bay leaves and marmalade until it is all just starting to simmer. Remove from the heat and add the zest and juice of an orange and the lemon zest, then simmer for a few minutes until slightly thickened.</p> <p>3 Remove the gelatine from the water, squeezing to remove any excess, then take the cream mixture off the heat and whisk in the gelatine and bourbon, if using. Remove the bay leaves and leave to cool for about 20-30 minutes before pouring into 250ml ramekins, or other serving dishes.

  "<p>It\u2019s the best kind of late summer day, with bright sunshine and a temperature as high as anything we\u2019ve had this year. The smell of new-mown grass carries on the warm breeze and from a few fields away comes the muted drone of a tractor. Emerging from under the bridge the river curves sinuously as it crosses the sand on the final stage of its journey to the sea. But unlike it, rather than heading for the beach I take the path behind the low dunes. It is edged by a riot of plants, some still in flower.</p> <p>The violet-blue flowers of <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/common-vetch\">common vetch</a> stand out from the luxuriant tangle of its intertwining leaves, while clumps of purple thistle-like <a href=\"http://www.wildflowershop.co.uk/WF%20Plant%20Notes/Knapweed.htm\">hardheads</a> rise above them. The remains of umbelliferous hogweed, dried ochre seed-heads atop brittle, ridged stems, make sculptural statements amid the foliage. Scattered liberally throughout are the cheerful yellows of the <a href=\"http://www.hebridensis.co.uk/Flowering%20Plants/species.php?id=37\">autumn hawkbit</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/10/wenlock-edge-dragonfly-both-messenger-missile\">Country diary: Wenlock Edge: This dragonfly is both messenger and missile</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With the exception of the two sandy lines kept clear by the passage of the crofter\u2019s tractor, the path itself is half-covered with plants. Various grasses, now sporting feathery flower heads, grow along its centre, while from its margins, silverweed has sent reddish, tendril-like exploratory stems across the intervening space.

  "<p>Chris Bowen this week set out his plans for winning the fight against the rise of protectionism. It\u2019s a fight in which those in favour of free trade have been shown over the past year \u2013 whether in the Brexit vote or the inability to counter Donald Trump \u2013 to have been completely inept. Among the best aspect of Bowen\u2019s plan of attack is that he has realised one of the reasons for this ineptness has been an over reliance on data and facts.</p> <p>The government\u2019s position on trade essentially operates from the belief that the benefits of free trade are obvious, and thus it is also obvious that more free trade \u2013 in whatever form \u2013 is better. Such a position has led to the government pursuing free trade agreements with eagerness and delight.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/17/australia-eager-to-start-free-trade-talks-with-britain\">Australia eager to start free trade talks with Britain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The problem however is that the data that demonstrates the benefits of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/jul/11/there-are-economic-benefits-to-free-trade-but-not-for-everyone\">free trade is actually pretty complex</a>, and the data that demonstrates the benefits of free trade agreements is actually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/nov/20/why-isnt-the-government-being-held-to-account-on-the-china-free-trade-deal\">pretty skint</a>.</p> <p>Little wonder that people might think it\u2019s all a load of hogwash.</p> <p>Two weeks ago, the treasurer, Scott Morrison,&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/aug/29/scott-morrisons-car-crash-logic-and-the-real-story-behind-the-taxed-nots\">noted</a> the resistance to free trade and suggested that the government \u201cmust face up to their concerns and address them\u201d.</p> <p>And he addressed them by saying that \u201cthere is more than three trillion worth of foreign investment in Australia today\u201d and that exports \u201cdelivered around $363bn to our economy and accounted for around 19% of our GDP and around 1.3% of annual growth\u201d.</p> <p>I wrote an honours thesis on foreign direct investment, and even I was rolling my eyes.</p> <p>And now, the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, has set out his argument for free trade in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/07/chris-bowen-warns-against-populist-stances-on-immigration-and-trade\">a speech</a> titled, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.chrisbowen.net/media-centre/speeches.do?newsId=7209\">The Case for Openness</a>\u201d. He too quoted some of the data that pointed to the benefits of free trade, but crucially he argued that they alone were not enough.</p> <p>He suggested that those in favour of free trade needed to win \u201cthe evidence war, the passion war and the fairness and inclusivity war\u201d. It was a crucial acknowledgment that the voice from above, reminding us of the glory days of the reform of the 1980s, is not going to cut it.</p> <p>I love facts as much as anyone, but the problem with the benefits of free trade is that you mostly are talking about cheaper imports.</p> <p>As Bowen noted in his speech, the price of computers, TVs and stereos has declined by 90% over the last 25 years. That sounds great, but when you get to other facts, like for example that we pay less for cars than we did in the early 1990s, it doesn\u2019t take too much thinking to realise the impact of this on the local car industry and its workers.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t mean free trade is bad but it does highlight how there are winners and losers \u2013 and the data focuses mostly on the winners.</p> <p>Bowen also noted that trade is not the only reason for declining work in such industries as large-scale manufacturing, but that automation is also playing a large and increasing role \u2013 something which greater trade protectionism will do nothing to halt.</p> <p>But this mix of trade, automation, declining employment, and a rise in the lower-paid service sectors, also causes people to believe that free trade only benefits the few, and also leads to inequality.</p> <p>This is not necessarily the case.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://voxeu.org/article/drivers-inequality-trade-versus-tax-rates#.V9Ijxwjz9qQ.twitter\">study this week out of the USA</a> argues that trade is not what causes inequality, but rather, tax and welfare policies are to blame.</p> <p>The impact of such a finding is implicit in Bowen\u2019s argument that \u201cthe more people feel they benefit from our economy, the more they will embrace the system which allows it to grow.\u201d</p> <p>It means you can\u2019t unlink welfare and tax policy from trade policy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/jul/11/there-are-economic-benefits-to-free-trade-but-not-for-everyone\">Free trade is viewed as economic catnip, but the benefits are not for everyone | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Arguing for more free trade while also pledging a crackdown on welfare and bemoaning the \u201ctaxed-nots\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/aug/29/scott-morrisons-car-crash-logic-and-the-real-story-behind-the-taxed-nots\">as Morrison did</a>, is just self-defeating.</p> <p>But the path Bowen has chosen, while admirable, remains a rocky one. The difficulty is evident in his speech. He spent much more time talking of the \u201cevidence war\u201d than he did the \u201cpassion, fairness and inclusivity wars\u201d.</p> <p>Similarly he offered little concrete solutions other than the anodyne suggestions of \u201cmore investment in relevant education, training and industry plans\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s why the ALP should <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/09/coalitions-plan-to-abolish-welfare-supplement-attacked-by-australia-institute\">reverse its election commitment</a> to cut the $4.40/week energy supplement&#xa0;for those on Newstart.</p> <p>Since the global financial crisis, the drive towards protectionism has gathered pace, but it is wrong to believe it is just a fight about trade. As Bowen argues, it is also about inequality and inclusiveness.</p> <p>Quoting data and graphs alone will not further the cause, but neither will pursuing welfare and tax policies that foster inequality, all the while suggesting that yet another free trade agreement will somehow make everything better for all.</p>"
