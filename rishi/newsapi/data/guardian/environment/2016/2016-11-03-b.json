  "<p>Can we be clear on this? The closure of Australia\u2019s most polluting power station, Hazelwood, was inevitable and in terms of doing our modest bit to militate against climate change, desirable. That doesn\u2019t for a moment minimise the impact on the 750 workers who will lose their jobs, nor on the thousands of people in the Latrobe valley, one of the most disadvantaged communities in the country.</p> <p>This ageing, groaning, hulk of a power station is serviced by a giant open-cut coal mine just a few hundred metres from the town of Morwell, east of Melbourne. That a mine with a perimeter of about 18km was dug so close to residential houses was itself a shocking decision symbolic of the sacrifice coal towns have made to keep industry and consumers\u2019 energy needs satisfied.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/03/hazelwood-coal-power-station-to-close-with-loss-of-800-jobs\">Hazelwood coal power station to close with loss of up to 1,000 jobs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over the years, Hazelwood has become a symbol of many things. It symbolised governments\u2019 wavering commitment to seriously reducing our carbon emissions, and our own psychological dependence on cheap, reliable coal. Now, it\u2019s a symbol of something else. This is a \u201cred letter day\u201d, as the Melbourne Energy Institute\u2019s Roger Dargaville puts it, a tangible sign that a massive structural transformation is under way as the world shifts away from fossil fuels to deal with the dangers of climate change.</p> <p>Hazelwood\u2019s French owners, Engie, are well aware that the future for coal is bleak, and have already shut or sold off power stations in countries such as India and Indonesia. The footage of the Hazelwood coalmine fire in 2014 that spewed ash over Morwell residents for 45 days didn\u2019t help its image as a company committed to phasing out coal assets in favour of cleaner technologies.</p> <p>Shutting Hazelwood was a <a href=\"http://www.engie.com/en/journalists/press-releases/hazelwood-power-station-australia/\">commercial decision</a>, one influenced by the cost of maintaining the 50-year-old behemoth. It has also decided to sell its other brown coal power station in the Valley, Loy Yang B.</p> <p>All this has a global context \u2013 last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement\">Paris agreement</a> to commit to keeping the global temperature rise below 2c compared with preindustrial levels. To get anywhere near that goal, greenhouse gas emissions need to be net zero by the second half of this century, and that means urgent action, including leaving coal in the ground.</p> <p>The immediate impact of Hazelwood\u2019s closure is likely to be modest \u2013 it is what it represents that is most crucial. It alone produces a quarter of Victoria\u2019s base load electricity needs, and provides about 5% of the nation\u2019s demands. But its closure won\u2019t mean power shortages. Electricity demand has decreased in recent years, and there is a surplus of electricity generating capacity among our remaining power stations. But if another station closes soon, and another soon after that, we are likely to have a problem with reliability if we haven\u2019t planned for it.</p> <p>For now, Victoria\u2019s demands are likely to be supplied by ramping up supply from the New South Wales cleaner black coal-fired power stations \u2013 which will mean a welcome if modest reduction in our overall greenhouse emissions. Electricity prices are likely to rise a little because black coal generation is more expensive than brown coal.</p> <p>Victorian government modelling estimates that average residential power bills could rise by $44 a year, or 85 cents a week as a result of Hazelwood\u2019s demise. As the <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/business/energy/electricity/hazelwood-closure-adds-urgency-to-an-investable-climate-policy-20161102-gsg4eu\">Grattan Institute\u2019s Tony Wood says</a>, power bills will inevitably rise in this era, and it is \u201ca great pity that political leaders have been loath to acknowledge this reality\u201d. </p> <p>More importantly, the closure of Hazelwood means that we need a plan. As Dargaville argues, we can wait for old power stations to fall over one by one, as they will, but that will have a big impact on power reliability if companies decide to shut down several at once.</p> <p>\u201cJust letting the market determines who exits is a bit of a random approach. We have no policy to assist with the orderly departure of coal-fired power stations.\u201d It\u2019s tricky \u2013 we want them to close but not until there is a reliable replacement for the energy they supply, and that requires planning.</p> <p>Wood argues that what is urgently needed is a credible national climate change policy consistent with the government\u2019s 2030 emissions reduction targets. Those targets are too low to achieve the Paris goals but they can be scaled up to meet tougher targets in the future. Wood says that if we had such a policy the owners of coal and gas power stations could factor it into their planning with confidence. For now, there\u2019s uncertainly all round.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/03/australia-being-left-behind-by-global-momentum-on-climate-change\">Australia being 'left behind' by global momentum on climate change</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is uncertainty in the Latrobe valley, too. The state and federal governments on Thursday announced big transition packages to help workers retrain and to encourage new investment in the valley. The workers themselves are in their mid-50s on average and their union, the CFMEU, has negotiated generous conditions and redundancy packages over the years. They are likely to receive more than $300,000 on average in redundancy.</p> <p>But unemployment is high in the valley, and skilled jobs rare. Wendy Farmer\u2019s husband, Brett, has worked at Hazelwood for more than 20 years. Farmer is the spokeswoman for community group Voices of the Valley and asks simple pointed questions. Why, when state and federal governments knew that Hazelwood would close sooner rather than later, is there no transition plan already in place? Why is it just starting now when Hazelwood\u2019s closure is a mere five months away?</p> <p>It\u2019s a question the country could be asking, too. Hazelwood won\u2019t be the last power station to shut, after all, and the people of the valley won\u2019t be the last community to need help.</p>",

The first is the simple hot spring beloved of tourists and health-seekers. There is even a specific term \u2013 balneotherapy \u2013 to describe the use of these for therapeutic benefits. These geothermally heated waters are also used to drive direct-use geothermal systems in places such as Perth, where 55C water is extracted from 500 to 1,200 metres underground and <a href=\"http://www.rockwater.com.au/services/geothermal/\" rel=\"nofollow\">used to heat water for swimming pools</a> or for space heating.</p> <p>The second option is a geothermal heat pump, like the one used to control the temperature at the <a href=\"http://www.ga.gov.au/about/facilities/building\" rel=\"nofollow\">Geosciences Australia building</a> in Canberra. This doesn\u2019t so much use geothermal energy as take advantage of the Earth\u2019s thermal mass to absorb heat during summer and release it during winter.</p> <p>The third option \u2013 and the one causing headaches for Australia\u2019s nascent geothermal energy industry \u2013 is geothermal electricity generation. The problem is not a lack of heat but rather how to economically tap into it.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking at heat that\u2019s effectively created by depth, and because we\u2019re doing this in sedimentary basin settings, three to four kilometres is usually the depth you need to get the temperatures required,\u201d says Dr Rowan Hansberry, a post-doctoral researcher at the <a href=\"https://www.adelaide.edu.au/geothermal/\" rel=\"nofollow\">South Australian centre for geothermal energy research</a>. </p> <p>In volcanically active Iceland, scalding hot water and steam rises through wells with minimum pumping. In Australia, accessing that subterranean heat means drilling at least two wells \u2013 one to pump down cold water at high pressure and another to extract the now-heated water \u2013 and hoping that the rock or substrate between the two wells is permeable enough or fractured enough to allow the water to pass through and collect heat on the way. </p> <p>This is the risky part of so-called enhanced geothermal energy. Geothermal companies don\u2019t know how permeable an area will be until they\u2019ve drilled the wells, which can cost $20m each. For Geodynamics Limited, <a href=\"http://arena.gov.au/project/cooper-basin-enhanced-geothermal-systems-heat-and-power-development/\" rel=\"nofollow\">it cost $144m</a> to find out that the wells drilled 4-5 kilometres into the Cooper Basin were not economically viable, at least in comparison to the alternatives, says Geodynamics\u2019 commercial manager, Gregory Wong.</p> <p>\u201cSolar photovoltaic is now so cheap that it\u2019s difficult for renewables which aren\u2019t currently commercially mature to chase solar photovoltaic down the cost curve,\u201d Wong says. \u201cEven if we continued to make improvements in our delivered cost of energy, the speed at which we can make improvements is nothing like the speed that solar PV has been reducing in cost, so we were getting further away from the cost of solar PV rather than closing the gap.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/29/sustainable-energy-iceland-geothermal-plant\">Sustainable energy: inside Iceland\u2019s geothermal power plant</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Enhanced geothermal energy is not impossible.

The regulator can legally demand Green makes a payment, but the tycoon can appeal against their decision all the way to the supreme court.</p> <p>\u201cThis is very significant, very rare, and there aren\u2019t any precedents,\u201d Ralfe said. \u201cIt will take years. It\u2019s going to be a long war of attrition.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/03/sir-philip-green-bhs-v-pension-regulator-what-happens-next\">The Pension Regulator v Sir Philip Green \u2013 what happens next?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The move also increases the chances of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/19/sir-philip-green-leading-mp-doubtful-can-keep-knighthood\">Green losing his knighthood</a>, following a symbolic vote in parliament last month when MPs demanded the businessman be stripped of his honour.</p> <p>It is understood that the regulator quickly turned down an offer by Green because the lump sum he proposed was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/philip-green-described-as-britains-donald-trump-in-vanity-fair\">too low</a>, while the structure he suggested was seen as risky and left too much uncertainty for pension fund members.</p> <p>The regulator has not disclosed how much it is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jul/25/regulator-must-chase-philip-green-for-bhs-pension-cash\">seeking from Green</a>, but it is thought to be around \u00a3300m and the tycoon\u2019s offer was at least \u00a350m short.</p> <p>But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/03/sir-philip-green-bhs-v-pension-regulator-what-happens-next\">structure of the deal</a> is also important. It is understood that Green\u2019s offer involved buying out pensioners with small savings pots and then setting up a new fund for those who want to remain in a BHS pension scheme. The new scheme would not have a sponsoring company to secure it, which runs contrary to Pension Protection Fund guidelines. </p> <p>The BHS pension scheme is currently in an assessment period with the PPF. If a deal or settlement with Green cannot be reached the scheme will eventually enter the PPF, where the 20,000 members will suffer a cut to their benefits of at least 10%.</p> <p>Ralfe defended the regulator for beginning enforcement action and said it was right to reject complex financial arrangements for bailing out pension schemes. \u201cYou can\u2019t make things up on the hoof, it\u2019s a nonsense,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Ros Altmann, the former pensions minister, added: \u201cYou don\u2019t tell regulators what you believe is the right amount \u2013 they tell you.</p> <p>\u201cIf I were Sir Philip, I would take back responsibility for the BHS scheme and manage it on an ongoing basis to find the best way to meet the liabilities over time. But that will be expensive. </p> <p>\u201cThis is what he promised parliament he would do. Putting in a smaller amount than the regulator requires will just mean members stay in the PPF and any extra money goes into the central PPF pot. To pay better benefits will require a bigger amount of money, but it is up to the regulator to decide what that amount should be.\u201d</p> <p>The PPF, which is funded by a levy charged to company pension schemes, backed the regulator\u2019s announcement.</p> <p>Alan Rubenstein, chief executive of the PPF, said: \u201cWe welcome any steps that may secure more money for the BHS pension schemes. This would reduce the cost falling on our levy payers and may provide the potential for members to receive higher than PPF levels of benefits. </p> <p>\u201cMembers of the BHS pension schemes continue to be protected by the PPF and can be assured that regardless of the current shortfall in the schemes they can expect to receive PPF level benefits.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bhs\">BHS</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/25/bhs-collapse-consumers-guide-retailer-administration\">collapsed into administration</a> in April, leading to the loss of 11,000 jobs and leaving a pension deficit of \u00a3571m. Green controlled BHS between 2000 and 2015, during which time his family and other shareholders collected more than \u00a3580m. In March 2015, Green sold BHS to Dominic Chappell, a serial bankrupt with no retail experience, for just \u00a31. Chappell\u2019s company Retail Acquisitions <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/31/dominic-chappell-bled-bhs-dry-says-paul-sutton\">collected an estimated \u00a317m</a> from BHS despite owning it for just 13 months until it fell into administration.</p> <p>The regulator said it had sent warning notices to Green, Chappell and their companies, Taveta and Retail Acquisitions. The warning notices run to more than 300 pages and explain why the regulator believes the parties are liable to financially support the BHS pension scheme.</p> <p>Green and Chappell now have around six months to reply to the regulator and set out their case. When they do, a Pensions Regulator determinations panel \u2013 which is independent of the investigations team \u2013 will rule whether the parties involved should make a one-off payment into the pension scheme, provide on-going financial support, or both. However, this decision can then be appealed. </p> <p>The regulator has said it is still open to reaching a settlement with Green. The cash sum the regulator is seeking to redress the BHS pension scheme dwarfs its previous settlements. Since the Pensions Regulator was founded in 2005 it has only issued warning notices in 16 cases and completed 10 of those. It has raised \u00a3400m for pension schemes, including through out-of-court settlements. A similar case to BHS involving Coats Group, a thread manufacturer, has not evolved beyond the warning notice stage despite these being issued three years ago.</p> <p>Green insists he made a \u201ccredible and substantial proposal\u201d to the regulator, despite the regulator saying it was yet to receive a \u201csufficiently credible and comprehensive offer\u201d. A source close to the tycoon said: \u201cThere was a substantial amount of money on the table that would have improved the position of BHS pensioners.\u201d</p> <p>The warning notices sent to Green and Chappell are different, although the regulator declined to provide further details. Chappell said: \u201cThere is a huge bundle of documents that we need to read through carefully. When we are ready to make a statement, we will.\u201d</p>",

Now the high court has issued a short and forceful corrective that, for the sake of clarity, can be summarised like this: because parliament is sovereign, unrestrained executive power can only be used in matters where parliament has no say. Parliamentary sovereignty means that primary legislation, like the act that subordinated some UK law to Europe\u2019s in 1972, cannot be overturned just on the government\u2019s say so. Therefore the government cannot invoke article 50 without parliament\u2019s authority.</p> <p>Brexiters\u2019 cries of foul ignore the facts. Both sides accepted that the case was within the court\u2019s jurisdiction. They agreed too that it was a matter only of how, not if, article 50 should be invoked. This was no backdoor attempt to reverse the outcome of&#xa0;the referendum. There was no conspiracy. Rather, three of the most senior judges in England and Wales heard arguments on both sides from some of the best legal minds in the&#xa0;country and unanimously agreed that the law demanded parliament had a say.</p> <p>The decision was expressed with such force and clarity that it is hard to imagine a successful appeal. For that reason alone, the government is wrong to insist it is going to try anyway, a decision that will make it even harder to meet the prime minister\u2019s pledge to trigger article 50 by the end of March. That means a four-day hearing of the full court, currently eleven permanent justices. Scotland, Wales and possibly Northern Ireland are all likely to want to be involved, exacerbating division. And each session will be live-streamed in full view of global markets eager to trade on uncertainty.</p> <p>Instead of continuing an expensive and time-consuming fight in an attempt to seek legitimacy for riding roughshod over parliament, the government would be much wiser to do what it should have done from the start and ask for parliament\u2019s approval to start negotiations on the basis of a clear explanation of what it hopes to achieve. However, the overwhelming political question remains how to manage the consequences of the referendum in a way that heals rather than deepens differences, and in the context of the narrative of betrayal so eagerly fostered by some of her MPs and activists, the prime minister may believe it is better to be seen to fight all the way even if she ends up with the same result. Yet at some point soon, she must stand up to the insatiable zealots in the debate and confront them with her vision for Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU, and she must do it in parliament.</p> <p>Meanwhile the government\u2019s business managers will be aghast. They know they will be unlikely to get away with a simple vote of both houses. It might appear the least-cost option, but while the high court\u2019s judgement is carefully non-prescriptive, it indicates that new legislation is necessary. If the government thinks differently, it risks another legal challenge. Yet getting a bill of this consequence through parliament, however short and apparently non-committal it is, conjures up a long vista of revolt and negotiation that is likely to extinguish hopes of any other legislative initiative for the rest of the session.</p> <p>But now, those MPs \u2013 a majority \u2013 who supported remain are handed the challenge of holding the government to account without feeding into the Brexiters\u2019 conspiracy theories. In particular, it is time for Labour, not least because it is the official opposition, to get on and agree a clear position. Some pro-remain MPs like Nick Clegg who has made much of the running in this debate would like a cross-party alliance around a demand for a second referendum to approve the final deal, and a commitment to staying in the single market. That may be hard for Jeremy Corbyn to accept. But, not least because an early election is back on the cards, he must as a matter of urgency set out what he does want, and how Labour will judge the government\u2019s approach. It is time for a&#xa0;strategy rather than a series of important but piecemeal demands. Parliament is back where it should be, at the heart of the debate. Now Labour must be in the thick of the contest, bold and principled in support of the&#xa0;national interest.</p>",
  "<p>What a surprise, the great British consumer did not retreat into a bunker after the vote for Brexit in June. He and she kept on eating, drinking and buying houses as if nothing of great significance had happened. \u201cFor households, the signs of an economic slowdown are notable by their absence,\u201d admitted governor Mark Carney, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-rate-cuts-2017-growth-forecast-inflation\">struggling to explain</a> why the Bank of England\u2019s forecast in August that short-term growth in the UK economy would come to a near standstill was wrong by an embarrassing margin.</p> <p>Sympathy for the forecasters should be limited. It is true that referendums, especially ones that lead to the defenestration of a prime minister, don\u2019t happen often. But, come on, it was hardly fanciful to think consumers might disregard, for a while, the dangers of an actual exit from the European Union if the event was pencilled in to happen only in 2019.</p> <p>Real incomes are still rising (for now) and experience suggests UK consumers tend to stay on the dancefloor until the music stops. Such behaviour is possibly imprudent in the face of a 20% fall in the exchange rate but most Britons, unlike Bank officials, do not spend their days modelling inflationary pass-through effects.</p> <p>Indeed, for homeowners with variable-rate mortgages, the first direct financial impact of the referendum was a small reduction in monthly payments after the quarter-point cut in Bank rate in August. Carney and co can take some small credit for a successful intervention but their short-term forecasting misjudgment remains severe. Wisely, the governor did not claim to have saved the nation from the gloom he predicted. The positives \u201care neither solely due, nor totally unrelated to\u201d the Bank\u2019s actions, was as far as he dared fudge it.</p> <p>If Threadneedle Street couldn\u2019t tell what lay around the next corner, should we trust its projections for 2017 and 2018? Actually, yes, we should. Those inflation models aren\u2019t perfect but it\u2019s not hard to predict what will happen when the pound is down by a fifth. Prices will rise. The Bank foresees a peak for inflation of 2.75% in mid-2018, which is lower than some in the City expect. But it will be quite enough to squeeze living standards. On that score, believe the Bank.</p> <h2>Pension Regulator\u2019s patience finally snaps </h2> <p>So much for \u201cthe light in the tunnel\u201d that Sir Philip Green claimed to spot as long ago as June in his negotiations with the Pensions Regulator over the deficit in the BHS fund.

The regulator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/02/philip-green-may-be-forced-to-pay-money-into-bhs-pension-scheme\">has launched formal legal proceedings</a> against Green (plus a company controlled by his wife, and also against Dominic Chappell, the former bankrupt whose outfit bought BHS for \u00a31).</p> <p>Green suggests he can\u2019t understand the fuss. He says he\u2019s put forward \u201ca credible and substantial proposal, with evidence and bank confirmation of cash availability\u201d. The Topshop tycoon seems to have misunderstood how the process works. It is not for him to decide what counts as credible and substantial \u2013 that\u2019s the regulator\u2019s role.</p> <p>As far as we can tell, the dispute involves fundamental questions, like the size of the initial lump sum to cover the deficit. If so, the regulator is right to issue warning notices. Green first started talking about his plan to \u201csort\u201d the deficit back in 2014 when he (or, rather, his Monaco-based wife) still owned BHS. The farce has run too long already. It\u2019s now time to discover if the regulator\u2019s powers of compulsion are as strong as they ought to be.</p> <h2>FCA picks up baton dropped by CMA</h2> <p>The Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s proposals to enliven the banking sector were feeble, almost everybody agrees (apart from the report\u2019s authors, of course). Now, even the Financial Conduct Authority seems to have sided with the doubters. The City regulator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/03/fca-banks-credit-overdraft-fees\">will study whether it should impose a cap on overdraft fees</a>, an idea the CMA rejected in its summer report.</p> <p>The two bodies perform different roles, so all sides can pretend politely that there is no fundamental disagreement. But, as the watchful Treasury select committee chair Andrew Tyrie says, it looks as if the FCA is picking up a baton dropped by the CMA. Indeed, the FCA\u2019s inquiry could quickly become a wider review of where else the CMA failed. That would be very welcome. </p>",

  "<p>The average westerner\u2019s carbon emissions destroy 30 square metres of Arctic sea ice every year, according to new research. </p> <p>The work indicates that, even with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/03/world-on-track-for-3c-of-warming-under-current-global-climate-pledges-warns-un\">current efforts to cut emissions</a>, the Arctic will lose all its ice in summer within about 20 years.<br></p> <p>Plummeting Arctic sea ice cover is one of the most obvious signs of climate change and is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/01/rapid-arctic-ice-loss-linked-to-extreme-weather-changes-in-europe-and-us\">increasingly linked to extreme weather events</a> such as storms and floods in Europe and severe cold snaps in the US.</p> <p>The new study revealed a linear link between emissions of CO2 and the loss of Arctic sea ice, which has shrunk by half in the last 40 years. The link enables people to understand their own contribution to climate change, according to the leader of the work, Prof Dirk Notz, at the Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany. </p> <p>\u201cIt allows us, for the first time really, to intuitively grasp how we all individually contribute to global warming,\u201d he said. \u201cThe observed numbers are very simple. For each tonne of CO2 that a person emits anywhere on this planet, three square metres of Arctic summer sea ice disappears.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo far the global warming debate has always been about very large numbers like billions of tonnes of CO2 or very small numbers like 0.1C of temperature change,\u201d he said. \u201cOur study allows us to understand that it is really our own individual actions, every day, that contribute to ongoing global warming.\u201d</p> <p>The research, <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aag2345\">published in the journal Science</a>, analysed the declining extent of Arctic sea ice from 1953 to 2015 and found it tracked the emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel burning and other human activities. The relationship fits well with the underlying physics.</p> <p>As a result, it is possible to calculate how much Arctic sea ice is lost as a result of an individual\u2019s emissions. The average annual emissions of a citizen of the 35 rich nations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is 10 tonnes per year, leading to 30 sq m of ice being lost. Citizens of the US, Canada and Australia have a higher carbon footprint - about 16 tonnes - each causing almost 50 sq m of ice loss per year. In the UK, the average emissions are 7.5 tonnes per year, meaning 22.5 sq m of ice loss.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/sea_ice-zip/giv-140675hgNEGoM1d5\" data-alt=\"CO2 emissions and Arctic ice loss by country\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/sea_ice-zip/giv-140675hgNEGoM1d5\">CO2 emissions and Arctic ice loss by country</a> </figure>  <p>Prof Len Shaffrey, at the University of Reading in the UK, said the new research was sound and showed a new way of linking Arctic sea ice loss and personal CO2 emissions: \u201cIt means on average we are [each] responsible for the loss of tens of square metres of summer Arctic sea ice. That\u2019s a pretty sobering thought.\u201d</p> <p>The link also allows the calculation of how much CO2 can be emitted in future before the Arctic is entirely ice-free in September, usually the month of the smallest extent. The scientists found 1,000 gigatonnes (GT) of CO2 was the limit. If all the carbon-cutting pledges currently made by the world\u2019s nations are implemented, the Arctic will be ice free in summer in about 22 years, according to the new research.</p> <p>\u201cThere is not a god-given year when the ice will be gone but there is this number of 1,000GT - once we have emitted that amount, the [summer] Arctic sea ice will be gone,\u201d Notz said. \u201cIf emissions don\u2019t change at all from today\u2019s level, which is extremely unlikely, then the ice will be gone in 25 years. If emissions continue to rise then the ice will be gone sooner than that.\u201d</p> <p>The 1,000GT carbon budget is also the limit for keeping climate change below the internationally agreed threshold of 2C. This means that even if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement\">Paris climate treaty</a>, which enters into force on Friday, is successful, the Arctic will still become ice-free in summer. </p> <p>However, the Paris treaty also includes an aspiration to limit the temperature rise to 1.5C, which would require radical cuts in CO2 emissions, including sucking the gas out of the air and burying it. If this was achieved, the Arctic ice cap would remain year round.</p> <p>Arctic sea ice fell to its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/16/arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-to-second-lowest-level-ever-recorded\">second lowest recorded extent in September</a>, and scientists say this matters for a number of reasons. \u201cBy losing Arctic sea ice, we are losing a very effective refrigerator, as sea ice today reflects most of the sunlight and keeps the Arctic cool,\u2019 said Notz. \u201cIf we lose this refrigerator, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/21/greenlands-huge-annual-ice-loss-is-even-worse-than-thought\">Greenland ice cap will melt much more rapidly</a>, for example, and drive up sea levels.\u201d<br></p> <p>Other scientists are increasingly linking the loss of Arctic sea ice to a weakening of a high level wind, called the jet stream, which is in turn linked to increasing extreme weather events, such as storms and floods in western Europe, severe cold snaps in the US and drought in California. \u201cThe jury is still out on how robust these studies are but there is mounting evidence,\u201d said Notz.</p> <p>\u201cAlso, we are destroying a landscape from this planet which is extremely beautiful and future generations would have nothing to look at but open water in September, so for me that is an ethical thing,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>Increasing numbers of people have been warming to the notion that Brexit may not have to mean Brexit after all. This was probably inevitable given that those who voted for it did so for a very wide range of reasons, and it is abundantly clear that the cabinet is about as unclear as the rest of us. The announcement that the UK government has lost its high court case about article 50 (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/parliament-must-trigger-brexit-high-court-rules\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 3 November, theguardian.com) means that, subject to appeal, it will have to be debated in parliament. This presents a golden opportunity for MPs to throw a spanner in the works by refusing to vote for article 50 to be triggered without knowing precisely, or at least, generally, what Brexit will actually look like. When&#xa0;we know the awful truth I predict a stampede towards Brexit exit.</p> <p>Any arguments about this thwarting the will of the people needs to be shown up for the nonsense it is. It would not be thwarting the will of the 48% who voted against and, I suspect, a high proportion of those who voted to leave didn\u2019t vote for hard Brexit, having believed some of the lies of leading Brexiters. Perhaps we can still pull back from the brink if parliament is prepared to face the fury of Ukip and the Tory right, two groups that are increasingly difficult to tell apart.<br><strong>Alan Healey</strong><br><em>Bishops Castle, Shropshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 The high court decision is not about whether we stay in or leave the EU, it is about common sense. I have always been a reluctant remainer \u2013 not against Brexit as such, I simply believe that the decision was reached in a fatally flawed way, partly because the leave campaign never had to explain exactly what leave would mean. People were being asked to&#xa0;vote for a blind option.</p> <p>We can\u2019t turn back time and redo the referendum, but at least if there is a full debate in parliament we will get a proper discussion on the reasons for leaving and the options for the future. It is highly likely that parliament will vote to leave, but at least the decision will have been reached in something close to a proper process. This could make a big difference in healing the fractured and politically intolerant mood that has emerged in the country since the vote.<br><strong>Ken Abbott</strong><br><em>Portishead, Somerset</em></p> <p>\u2022 Claims that the high court ruling is an attempt to scupper Brexit altogether are ridiculous. In addition to committing the cardinal sin of defining a word using the word itself (\u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d), the government has also made no sense when arguing against parliamentary ratification of article 50.</p> <p>Theresa May has stated, rather patronisingly, that any negotiator knows you should not show your hand to those on the other side of the table before negotiations have even begun. She is correct.</p> <p>However, it is not implicit that anyone but parliament is able to see our negotiating hand. Parliament is able to sit in private, meaning only MPs may be present and no media coverage may take place. This was done in 2001 when MPs debated the anti-terrorism, crime and security bill.</p> <p>Parliamentary involvement in Brexit will not reverse the referendum result, it will simply scrutinise the terms of withdrawal and it can be achieved without showing our hand to the EU.<br><strong>Gabriel Osborne</strong><br><em>Bristol</em></p> <p>\u2022 \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d is a meaningless and unhelpful phrase and today\u2019s high court judgment reminds us of this. Two words, one repeated, designed to make us forget the constitutional framework and legal process. Brexit (a consultative referendum) means (voted for by a narrow majority) Brexit (that we should leave the EU without further parliamentary scrutiny or consideration of the implications or constitutional foundations of the vote).</p> <p>Our constitution, despite being unwritten, is based in law. Parliament (not the government) decided to ask the public their opinion and parliament should decide what to do with this. The House of Lords must be given the chance to do its job too \u2013 if it exists at all surely it is for moments like this, to intervene and apply perspective in a situation when the government of the day is trying to do something deeply unconstitutional. And to ensure that the proper time and consideration is given to a decision with such significant consequences.</p> <p>The result of the referendum is causing divisions not just because of how deeply many people feel about the issues or that the result feels inconclusive, but because the referendum itself was not put in a robust constitutional framework, and as a result its consequences are open to debate.<br><strong>Kevin Olding</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Liam Fox and Dominic Raab don\u2019t seem to understand the high court\u2019s ruling. The nub of the matter is that the executive cannot by royal prerogative alter the rights that British citizens currently enjoy as members of the EU. The most important of these is the right to live and work freely in 28 European countries. If&#xa0;we leave the EU, Poles and Romanians will have that figure reduced from 28 to 27; British citizens meanwhile will have it reduced from 28 to 1.<br><strong>Charles Turner</strong><br><em>Associate professor of sociology, University of Warwick</em></p> <p>\u2022 What a lovely irony!

Rarely has there been a clearer example of the establishment frustrating democracy and disrespecting the will (for good or ill) of the majority of the people.<br><strong>Tim Raymond</strong><br><em>Seabrook, Kent</em></p> <p>\u2022 If the government fails to overturn the decision to allow parliament a vote on article 50 in the supreme court, then they could always appeal to the European court\u2026<br><strong>Steve Flatley</strong><br><em>York </em></p> <p>\u2022 On 3 November 1774, Edmund Burke spoke as follows to the electors of Bristol:</p> <p>\u201cCertainly, gentlemen, it ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiassed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable.

It had to be these people, in that time, in that space, to make this happen.\u201d</p> <p>In another era, Stipe wouldn\u2019t have been a rock singer. Were he young now, he might have become a video artist, or a photographer, or some nonspecific creative type. But when rock\u2019n\u2019roll hit him in 1975, that was the obvious path for an unusual kid with an urge to make art: \u201cThat\u2019s when I thought: \u2018This is what I\u2019m gonna do.\u2019\u201d And even then, where many songwriters write because they have a burning urge to share something with the world, Stipe wrote songs for a less driven reason: \u201cI needed 12 songs for an album. And the guys would push me very hard. And I was the slowest. And I\u2019ll always be the slowest.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2229f5ee3fb55aff4c1fc2e28c4db1cb900ddb1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2229f5ee3fb55aff4c1fc2e28c4db1cb900ddb1d/0_0_3300_1981/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The band backstage in 1984\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The band backstage in 1984.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Natkin/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You can hear that in Stipe\u2019s writing. Some REM lyrics are terrific. Some are really not very good. But what they had in their favour was Stipe\u2019s unique, oaky voice, one that could imbue pretty much any set of words with emotional force and deep resonance. Take <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rOiW_xY-kc\">Everybody Hurts</a>, a worldwide hit single so potentially platitudinous that it has become an X Factor staple: Stipe makes it sound like the most comforting and profound lyric in pop history.</p> <p>Out of Time, Stipe thinks, is where he started to write well. \u201cI had a pretty clear idea of what I was good at and how I could manifest that, but also the power of the word.\u201d He realised that \u201ca shitty nonsensical lyric\u201d could work in one song, but equally that he could deliver words that \u201cactually fucking resonated on a very deep level. And so <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYitiDJPTE\">Country Feedback</a> resonated on a very deep level. I knew that instantly. It wrote itself. I began to realise around Document [in 1987] that I had skill and I honed it. In time it went from skill to art and my job was to forget everything and allow the instinct to take over, and that\u2019s when the great songs came. Losing My Religion was instinct, Country Feedback was instinct, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XRyEkOfQSg\">Me in Honey </a>\u2026\u201d At the time, Stipe said Out of Time was their first set of love songs. Not any more. \u201cI think I just said that. I needed a line. But they\u2019re not love songs, are they?\u201d</p> <p>It appears to gall him, still, that a lot of people remember Out of Time not for the great songs, but for the sugar-sweet bubblegum pastiche <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCQ0vDAbF7s\">Shiny Happy People</a> (\u201cI\u2019ve made my excuses over and over again and I\u2019ll go to The Hague with my excuses for that song\u201d), but it\u2019s him who brings it up, not me. And then he tries to rationalise it with an anecdote that involves James Franco making a TV series \u201cabout identical twins and the high jinks that happen\u201d, which reminded him of an Elvis Presley film about identical twins and, yes, their high jinks, about getting the name of that film wrong, but how the soundtrack to that film \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057227/\">Kissin\u2019 Cousins</a> \u2013 was the first album he bought because he loved <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOF9lzGLz-8\">the title track</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s still a really good song. Anyway, that was Shiny Happy People.\u201d I try my best to look like I have some idea what he\u2019s talking about. \u201cI have great stories, but I\u2019m a terrible storyteller,\u201d he says, accurately.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rOiW_xY-kc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5rOiW_xY-kc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the video for Everybody Hurts.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Out of Time was released just as the first Gulf war got underway.

It\u2019s a coincidence, but an odd one. \u201cWe still have a Gulf war going on,\u201d Buck observes. \u201cI\u2019m just so disgusted.\u201d Mills observes of Donald Trump that \u201che was bad enough as a private citizen, but he\u2019s much worse as a politician\u201d.</p> <p>Stipe is most damning. \u201cDonald Trump shouldn\u2019t have made it through the third week of the Republican clown car of candidates,\u201d he says. \u201cThe media jumped on him because he\u2019s a great reality TV star and we\u2019re watching the greatest reality TV show of all time unfold in real time through the American presidential election.\u201d That morning, Stipe says, his French boyfriend had told him how France needs to update the Fifth Republic. \u201cAmerica has never updated,\u201d he notes. \u201cWe\u2019re still working like the Bible or the Qur\u2019an, we\u2019re working off a set of rules from another era. We need to really seriously look at who we are and where we are and bring things up to speed.\u201d Or, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdC6thlCAlI\">as he sang on Cuyahoga 31 years ago</a>: \u201cLet\u2019s put our heads together / Start a new country up.\u201d</p> <p>REM\u2019s politics was something that defined them at the height of their fame. At the 1991 MTV video music awards, where the band won six awards, Stipe used the group\u2019s appearances to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMbYPDAaIA0\">strip off his T-shirts</a>, revealing a series of slogans \u2013 \u201cWear a condom\u201d, \u201cChoice\u201d, \u201cAlternative energy now\u201d, \u201cThe right to vote\u201d, \u201cHandgun control\u201d, \u201cLove knows no colours\u201d, \u201cRainforest\u201d. That was just the tip of the iceberg: Stipe, especially, always seemed to be talking up his favoured causes; it was something he felt was both a duty and a privilege, but it created pressures. \u201cThe hardest part was being put in the position of being \u2018the voice of a generation\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a pretty place to be. It\u2019s not easy. I tried. I did try to use the platform of being a public figure. But you find yourself sitting at a table, with someone saying: \u2018Describe to me the problems of global warming from a sub-Saharan perspective.\u2019 I\u2019m a pop star. That\u2019s not what I went to school for.\u201d</p> <p>When the group began, Buck had insisted on a series of guidelines \u2013 moral, ethical, personal, financial, aesthetic \u2013 that would steer them throughout their career. Some were fairly trivial \u2013 no leather onstage, so they didn\u2019t look like every other rock band. Some were crucial \u2013 sharing all songwriting credits equally, regardless of who wrote the song, so there would be no arguments about money down the line. Some of those guidelines are still in use \u2013 Buck tells me that earlier in the day we speak the group had turned down a multi-million-dollar offer to have their music soundtrack an advertising campaign (\u201cI don\u2019t want my children to see me being a whore\u201d). And it\u2019s still the case that any one of the members can veto any decision related to REM, as was the case throughout their career.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb47a5aae9d57f85ebcf652b3064458abfcdb528\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb47a5aae9d57f85ebcf652b3064458abfcdb528/0_125_3032_1819/1000.jpg\" alt=\"REM at the 1991 MTV awards\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">REM, with Stipe in one of the slogan T-shirts he wore at the 1991 MTV awards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So who used the veto most often?</p> <p>\u201cI think Michael might have done it more, but as the face of the band, things affected him more than us,\u201d Mills says.</p> <p>I put that to Stipe. \u201cOoooh!\u201d His lips form a little moue, and he raps the table twice. \u201cWe had a run-in last week, me and Mike Mills,\u201d he says, and he laughs. \u201cAnd I gave in to his desires. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case. If he says it is, then he doesn\u2019t say things like that without a reason.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOff the top of my head, I\u2019d say Michael,\u201d Buck says. \u201cBut it might be me.\u201d</p> <p>I tell Buck that Stipe had seemed surprised when I said Mills had nominated him. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be. I would be fairly comfortable saying he and I would be pretty close to tied. I can rant for 10 minutes about why something is morally, ethically, culturally wrong. And Michael might just say: \u2018I don\u2019t wanna do that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The different members of REM took to their superstardom after Out of Time in different ways. Mills sounds as if he was utterly untroubled by it: \u201cNothing felt like it came on too fast, nothing felt like it was more than we could handle.\u201d (\u201cOf course he would,\u201d Stipe says. \u201cThat\u2019s his personality.\u201d) Buck professes to having thought \u201cit was all kind of bullshit. We just made a record \u2013 big deal. When we went around to do the next record, Automatic for the People, I just disappeared off the face of the earth. Grew a big beard and drove round in my car and flopped in motels for a year. So I never really had to confront the overwhelming nature of it until 1995 [when REM toured after six years off the road], which was mindblowing for all of us.\u201d</p> <p>Stipe, though, was the frontman, the one who had to stand in the headwind. \u201cThe face. Mike Mills called me Face. I was the recognisable one to the world at large.\u201d He relied on the other three to stop becoming, in his words, a monster. \u201cIf I believed everything that was said about me and all the adulation, anyone in that position would [become one],\u201d he says. And yet Stipe\u2019s insecurities plagued him. If a show wasn\u2019t sold out, he was horrified. \u201cIf I was going to put that much effort into it, and I did, I wanted to know that I had a rapt and captive audience. I would always, always look around and find the one person who was yawning or looking at their watch. You have to believe that what you\u2019re doing is so important that everybody is going to be absolutely and completely captivated and in the moment with you. And when you see that one person putting on their lipstick or checking their watch or talking to their girlfriend \u2026 wow.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYOKMUTTDdA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YYOKMUTTDdA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the video for Shiny Happy People</figcaption> </figure>   <p>He got increasingly fed up, too, with the portrayals of his public persona. He became bored with who he seemed to be, what he was saying. He wearied of being called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/06/michael-stipe-rem-collapse-interview\">enigmatic</a>\u201d by people trying to boil down his sometimes contrary, sometimes diffident personality into a single word. Recalling that causes him to reflect on his father, who shared similar traits. \u201cHis humour was really dry, and really smart,\u201d he says. \u201cHe reacted to things that he saw, and he reacted to them in a way that was hysterically funny. Most people didn\u2019t understand that. Or would take a day or two before going, \u2018Oh my God, that was really astute and hysterical.\u2019 I got a little bit of that. So the enigmatic thing I understand. But it became hideously close and I became really bored with myself, and I didn\u2019t think I had anything new to say. I\u2019d played that character. I didn\u2019t think I could do it again.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the one most affected was Bill Berry. He left the group in 1997, explaining simply that he wasn\u2019t enjoying it any longer. They continued without him for 14 years, in which it sometimes seemed they stumbled more than skipped. \u201cThe three-legged dog went through the meat grinder and ended up in \u2026 where\u2019s the place they grind up the bones and turn them into glue? The rendering factory,\u201d Stipe says.</p> <p>You might expect Mills, Berry\u2019s high-school friend, to have been the one who missed the drummer\u2019s presence most. He says not. \u201cI think it was harder on Peter, because Bill was the balance. Bill and Peter wanted more concision in the songs. Michael and I tended to elaborate and add more things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe power dynamic shift that occurred between the three of us was so profound as to literally break up the band and put it back together and break it up and put it back together,\u201d Stipe says. </p> <p>\u201cNo one really wanted to listen to me,\u201d says Buck. \u201cWhich was fine. But no one really had a lot of set goals in mind either. Bill was a no-bullshit guy, and with him gone, it feels to me in retrospect that I was more aggressive than I should have been and everyone was pushing back not to have me bully them. We were all pushing in such different directions, and we were feeling such frustration and anger about it. I started backing away from the whole thing: I had to be talked out of the tree a couple of times, when I said: \u2018I don\u2019t want to do this any more.\u2019 After the 2005 tour, I was totally fed up and we just didn\u2019t talk for, I don\u2019t know, a year.\u201d</p> <p>Stipe remembers things being just as bad seven years earlier, when they made <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/up-mw0000040590\">Up</a>, their first album without Berry. \u201cWe made choices that were not great choices, because we simply weren\u2019t talking. That record really needed an editor, but we could not only not arrive at a decision, we couldn\u2019t be in the same room together. It was bad.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"905f82e6de3fc38fe5fde3d72f5a9a3c667e2fce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/905f82e6de3fc38fe5fde3d72f5a9a3c667e2fce/0_84_4469_2682/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Live at the Milton Keynes Bowl in 1995\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Live at the Milton Keynes Bowl in 1995.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mick Hutson/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All three agree \u2013 they would, wouldn\u2019t they? \u2013 that REM were back on track by the time they called it a day in 2011.

It was nice to have nothing but the music and our friendship tying us together, as opposed to the music, the friendship, the contracts, the upcoming tour, the 300 employees we\u2019re hiring \u2013 all the other things that tend to get in the way of interpersonal relationships.\u201d</p> <p>REM gave Stipe something that nothing else ever has: adrenalin. \u201cIt\u2019s a very powerful drug,\u201d he say. \u201cAnd you have to wean yourself off it carefully. I still miss it. But, hopefully, you find other things to get excited about.\u201d Buck, for his part, longs for particular eras of the group\u2019s lifespan. \u201cI miss being in REM in 1983 and 1987. Which is to say, I miss being young and in the centre of my culture.\u201d</p> <p>What REM have left is a legacy, of both music and of how a band should comport itself, one you see replicated whenever a band with principles crosses over to a mass audience: Radiohead, for example, might consider how much they owe to REM. \u201cWe did a remarkable job of maintaining integrity throughout a very difficult period and in a difficult industry,\u201d Stipe says. \u201cWe forged a new path. We created a new way for people to look and approach this and not become an empty puppet or a dog and pony show.\u201d He pauses. \u201cWhat\u2019s the other part I\u2019m proud of?\u201d</p> <p>The records?</p> <p>Stipe looks up and laughs. \u201cYeah!\u201d</p> <p><em>The 25th anniversary deluxe edition of Out of Time is released on Universal on 18 November.

  "<p>The Bank of England has warned households to expect a sharp rise in inflation next year as the weak pound ramps up the costs of imports and squeezes family finances.</p> <p>Predicting rises in petrol prices and other goods that the UK buys in from abroad, the Bank said inflation would rise from 1.3% this year to 2.7% in 2017 and 2018, higher than in its last set of forecasts three months ago. In its new outlook, the monetary policy committee (MPC), led by the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, said it would take until 2020 for inflation to get back to the target of 2% set by the government.</p> <p>The new forecast was delivered as the Bank kept interest rates at a record low of 0.25% and dropped plans to cut them further in the near future, although the inflation warning was tempered with a projection that economic growth will be much stronger than previously forecast in the near-term. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/06/brexit-pound-plunges-to-30-year-lows-as-eu-fears-bite-into-global-markets-again\">The pound tumbled to 30-year lows</a> in the wake of the vote to leave the EU and has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/12/pound-drops-further-after-davis-hints-uk-could-leave-single-market\">come under fresh pressure in recent weeks</a> over investor fears that the UK is heading for a hard Brexit deal that would leave it shut out of Europe\u2019s single market. The sharp depreciation has made UK exports more competitive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/03/uk-services-costs-pound-inflation\">but imports more expensive</a> \u2013 prompting changes to inflation forecasts. </p> <p>Carney, who has been forced to fend off criticism that he was overly gloomy on the potential blow to the economy from a leave vote, said on Thursday that sterling\u2019s sharp fall made the Bank\u2019s usual balancing act more challenging. </p> <p>He described the UK as facing \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d and said the MPC was making a trade-off between keeping inflation in check and shoring up growth. For now, record-low interest rates and a big programme of electronic money printing, known as quantitative easing, was appropriate, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe MPC is choosing a period of somewhat higher consumer price inflation in exchange for a more modest increase in unemployment. However, there are limits to the extent to which above-target inflation can be tolerated,\u201d Carney told a news conference.</p> <p>His comments about the Bank\u2019s sensitivity to inflation picking up were interpreted by investors as a signal that policymakers were in no hurry to consider cutting interest rates further.

Mark Carney and fellow policymakers had predicted.</p> <p>The Bank left rates at 0.25% as expected by investors and revised up forecasts for economic growth in the final months of this year and throughout 2017, compared with their outlook published in August. But they also warned that sterling\u2019s sharp fall would push up inflation more than previously thought. That in turn would squeeze household incomes and coupled with uncertainty about the UK\u2019s longer-term prospects outside the EU would stem economic growth in 2018. Taking the near and long-term forecasts together the economic picture in three years\u2019 time is slightly worse than in August\u2019s outlook.</p> <p>The forecasts accompanied a unanimous decision by the Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) to leave interest rates at 0.25%, where they had been cut to in August to shore up confidence after June\u2019s vote to leave the EU.</p> <p>In comments likely to be interpreted by financial markets as ruling out any more QE or interest rate cuts any time soon, the Bank also said it could respond \u201cin either direction\u201d to changes in the economic outlook and used minutes from its latest policy meeting to highlight how the weaker pound pushes up inflation.

Back in August, the BoE said growth would slow sharply to just 0.1% in July-September; actually, it was a robust 0.5%.</p> <p>Carney could say the stimulus measures taken by the Bank are having an effect, but critics will continue to argue that he were too gloomy about Brexit.</p> <p>Some economists expect the BoE to <strong>lower</strong> its medium-term growth forecasts, as it tries to assess the impact of Britain leaving the EU. That\u2019s a tricky calculation, as we don\u2019t know what kind of deal the UK will end up with.</p> <p><strong>The Bank may also hike its inflation forecasts</strong>, as the slump in the pound since June continues to push up the cost of imports. That could show the Consumer Prices Index smashing through the official 2% target next year.

A widow and an orphan, she has lived in the country virtually all her adult life. She has endeavoured to raise her four children alone.

She could face deportation, prison and fines of up to $5,000. Her bail has been denied. I find Gula\u2019s treatment by the authorities impossible to understand.

Gula\u2019s situation is not unique, and in the media circus of the past week it seems she has already been tried and found guilty in the court of public opinion.</p> <p>The strength of the picture I took, its success, has to do with Sharbat Gula and her expression: her eyes and their gaze, that fierce look of dignity and determination. It\u2019s an honour to be the photographer who took that iconic picture. It has stood the test of time, which is a testament to the picture, but mostly to Gula herself.</p> <p>Seventeen years later, I went looking for her and was reunited with her, and it was extraordinary. I was thrilled that she was still alive. Gula didn\u2019t know that her picture had been published all over the world, but in time she understood. She did remember that I took her picture that day because it was the first time in&nbsp;her life that she had been photographed. The second time was when I was reunited with her.</p> <p>That fact reminds me of what one of her relatives <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/green-eyed-afghan-girl-sharbat-gula-from-iconic-national-geographic-cover-faces-14-years-in-prison/\" title=\"\">told CBS News</a> this week, that she is a \u201csimple, illiterate lady\u201d who may not understand legal documents. For over a decade, she didn\u2019t realise that millions of people knew her face.

Many believe she was targeted. As her face once symbolised the hopes of countless refugees, the image of her post-arrest mugshot circulated last week was meant to instil fear into other refugees \u2013 and to turn the minds of others against the migrant population.</p> <p>When I first saw that arrest shot, I was saddened by the apparent attempt to humiliate and debase her; but at the same time, I saw that same gaze I first glimpsed decades ago in the Nasir Bagh refugee camp, when an orphan girl stared back at my lens with a proud, haunted look.

I\u2019ve posted vast amounts of commentary on this already, but here is what it means in six key points.</p> <p><strong>1 - The court ruling is much more definitive than anyone expected. </strong>(See, for example, David Allen Green at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/03/article-50-high-court-ruling-high-court-set-to-rule-on-whether-mps-should-vote-on-triggering-article-50-politics-live?page=with:block-581b301be4b0d073c27d112a#block-581b301be4b0d073c27d112a\">4.10pm.) </a>The government is appealing to the supreme court, but informed commentators seem to think it more likely than not that the government will lose again.</p> <p><strong>2 - Unless the government does win at the supreme court, parliament will get to legislate on invoking article 50.</strong> And that means a proper bill, passing through the Commons and the Lords, with MPs and peers getting the chance to amend it. Theresa May has been refusing to give parliament a vote on the terms of Brexit because, once power shifts from the hands of the executive to the legislature (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/03/article-50-high-court-ruling-high-court-set-to-rule-on-whether-mps-should-vote-on-triggering-article-50-politics-live?page=with:block-581af486e4b0d073c27d0fb0#block-581af486e4b0d073c27d0fb0\"> 8.49am)</a>, the prime minister loses some control. The key point about today is that MPs and peers have, for the first time, got a strong chance of shaping the start of the Brexit process.</p> <p><strong>3 - The chances of Brexit being overturned are still very minimal.</strong> It is just about possible to conceive how the UK could stay in the EU (parliament votes to insert a second referendum clause into the article 50 Brexit bill, and some economic catastrophe results in a sharp change in public opinion by 2018) but you would be unwise to bet on it. Most MPs and peers who voted remain accept that the result of the referendum should be honoured.</p> <p><strong>4 - But the chances of Brexit being \u201csoft\u201d not \u201chard\u201d have increased significantly. </strong>There is a majority for a \u201csoft\u201d Brexit in parliament and, if there is a bill, it will now have the chance to exercise leverage.</p> <p><strong>5 - There is now a real possibility that Theresa May will not be able to trigger article 50 before the end of March. </strong>The government says it still intends to meet this deadline, but the need to legislate could lead to a delay.</p> <p><strong>6 - An early election, though by no means inevitable, now does look more likely than it did this time yesterday.</strong></p> <p>That\u2019s all from me for today. I had been intending to cover other stories, but I\u2019m afraid this one took over.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T17:34:35.049Z\">at 5.34pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581b6d57e4b029b92ca45368\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/henrymcdonald\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T17:03:33.973Z\">5.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The votes of Northern Ireland MPs in the House of Commons could prove critical if Theresa May and the government is forced to ask parliament to trigger article 50.</p> <p>All eight Democratic Unionist Party MPs are guaranteed to back Brexit in the Commons given that they were the only major political force in the Stormont Assembly to active back a leave vote in June\u2019s referendum.</p> <p>However, the position of the two Ulster Unionist MPs - Fermanagh/South Tyrone\u2019s Tom Elliott and Danny Kinahan in South Antrim - is interesting. In June UUP leader Mike Nesbitt called for a remain vote.</p> <p>The UUP has now switched position and said its MPs will back the government to allow for the referendum result to be implemented. The party will argue this is because the entire electorate of the UK has spoken in the referendum and it is their duty to back up that outcome in the Commons.</p> <p>The switch though may also be due to fears of being further outflanked by the DUP especially given a number of recent defections from the UUP to the Democratic Unionists. In essence the UUP is again moving to the right in order to slow down its decline vis a vis the DUP.</p> <p>All three SDLP MPs will definitely vote to block Brexit given that the party campaigned vigorously for remain and was involved in last week\u2019s failed legal action in the Belfast High Court to declare Brexit null and void in Northern Ireland only.</p> <p>Sinn Fein will not vote in the Commons because it boycotts the parliament although the party will come under fire accused of failing to add to the Remain voices in the chamber that could scupper Brexit.</p> <p>Yet it is the votes of the unionist bloc that will prove far more critical if and when the referendum result is tested in the House of Commons. Expect more demands from DUP first Minister Arlene Foster for special treatment for Northern Ireland (guaranteed post-Brexit farming subsidies for Ulster agriculture for instance) in order to bolster the government\u2019s numbers in a Brexit vote .... even one after a general election.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581b6dc7e4b07ceadb3a2209\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T17:03:25.060Z\">5.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Since you\u2019re here, we have a small favour to ask.

If the Article 50 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/946c95fc-34bb-31f6-855f-ea21d58249c2\">notification is irrevocable</a> then the argument is that these rights will be removed automatically in due course. This cannot be done, other than by an Act of Parliament.</p> <p>The government could have side-stepped this difficulty by not accepting that the notification was irrevocable (and many, including Lord Kerr who wrote Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, say a notification must be revocable). But it saw this legally sensible move as politically unacceptable. Looking at the judgment, the impression is that the government\u2019s concession on this crucial point determined the outcome of the case.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/11/03/2178734/after-the-high-courts-brexit-decision-forget-about-activating-article-50-in-march/\"><strong>Jolyon Maugham, the barrister and legal writer, says in a Financial Times article that if the government loses its appeal, Theresa May will not be able to trigger article 50 by the end of March as she hopes.</strong></a></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Imagine this.

Depending on how the bill is drafted \u2013 and it is likely to be very short \u2013 there may be moves to amend it to place conditions on the Government before it can trigger Article 50. These could take the form of timing or process requirements \u2013 for example, a requirement on the Government to provide Parliament with information about its negotiating position <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/14819/what-the-government-needs-to-demonstrate-before-it-pulls-the-article-50-trigger/\">before triggering Article 50</a>.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.howtocrackanut.com/blog/2016/11/3/why-an-appeal-of-the-high-court-parliamentary-brexit\"><strong>Albert Sanchez-Graells, a law lecturer, says on his EU economic law blog that he thinks the appeal to the supreme court will lead to the European Court of Justice (or the Court of Justice of the European Union - CJEU) getting involved.</strong></a></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now, in case of an appeal of the High Court\u2019s decision before the UKSC, in my opinion, the referral to the CJEU is legally unavoidable (I will not deal for now with arguments of judicial politics or pragmatic views on the UKSC\u2019s likely course of action). Even if the parties do not challenge or even raise to the UKSC\u2019s consideration the matter of the (ir)reversibility of and Article 50 notification, it is a logical given that the UKSC needs to take a stance (even if implicit) on this point in order to be able to rule on the case. If it quashes the High Court\u2019s decision, it needs to clarify the points of law which the High Court would have gotten wrong--one of which concerns the irrevocability of an Art 50 notification. if it upholds the High Court\u2019s decision, it is (implicitly) accepting the assumption that an Art 50 notification is irrevocable. Either way, the UKSC cannot escape a substantial (implicit) consideration of the interpretation of Article 50.</p> <p>In my view, this engages the UKSC\u2019s obligation to request a preliminary ruling from the CJEU under Article 267(3) TFEU and not doing so triggers a risk of infringement of EU law by the UK due to the acts (or omission, in this case) of its highest court.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://semipartisansam.com/2016/11/03/high-court-brexit-article-50-ruling-parliament-vote-leave-eu/\">Sam Hooper at Semi-Partisan Politics says leave campaigners should not worry too much about the judgment.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t really remember the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poll_Tax_Riots\">Poll Tax riots</a> toward the tail end of Thatcher\u2019s government.

He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The high court ruling is extremely clear - the UK government cannot trigger article 50 using the Crown prerogative. Indeed, this is consistent with many of the arguments made by the leave campaign themselves about parliamentary sovereignty. It is a mistake, in my view, to challenge such a clear ruling and we should now try and move ahead to develop a fuller understanding of the UK government\u2019s position.</p> <p>The position of the Welsh government has been consistent throughout \u2013 we accept the decision made by the people and will not work against the referendum result - we are working hard to get the best possible exit terms for Wales. However, it is important that votes take place in all four nations to endorse the UK negotiating position.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Welsh Conservative Leader, <strong>Andrew RT Davies</strong> \u2013 the only leader of a mainstream political party in Britain to back a vote to leave the EU \u2013 sees it very differently. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A clear majority of the British people voted to leave the European Union in June, and parliament\u2019s job is to enact that decision \u2013 not to subvert it. The people have spoken and their decision must be respected.</p> <p>Parliament had its say when the referendum was approved by an act of parliament. There is no basis for a further vote in parliament, other than to aid those seeking to block the path of democracy.</p> <p>Any attempts to row back on the referendum result will be met with anger and frustration by the British public.</p> <p>This is an unnecessary distraction, and this side-show must not be allowed to distract the UK Government from getting on with the job of negotiating a new relationship with our European neighbours.</p> </blockquote> <p>Plaid Cymru\u2019s Brexit spokesperson, <strong>Jonathan Edwards</strong>, welcomed the ruling. He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is ironic that after months of rhetoric around making parliament sovereign, the UK government wanted to bypass the parliament on a decision of such importance. It is right that the UK Parliament should have a say, but it is important too that the national parliaments of the UK have a say too, including the National Assembly for Wales.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581b2830e4b07ceadb3a2047\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/alice-ross\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T12:08:50.291Z\">12.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Grahame Pigney, organiser of the <strong>People\u2019s Challenge</strong>, which raised \u00a3170,000 to fund the article 50 legal action, said the case was \u201cincredibly important to the UK\u2019s parliamentary democracy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201dWe came here to force the situation, to ask the courts whether it\u2019s parliament or government who is sovereign,\u201d he told the Guardian outside the RCJ. </p> <p>\u201cIn some ways it\u2019s got to go to the Supreme Court to be decided at the highest possible level,\u201d he added. </p> <p>Pigney denied that the case aimed to challenge the referendum\u2019s result. \u201cParliament has to go make the decision on all the facts, including the referendum result and what\u2019s in the best interests of all four nations in the UK,\u201d he said. </p> <p>This morning he is elated, but already planning to raise a further \u00a350,000 to fund the Supreme Court challenge. </p> <p>Pigney said he hopes the case will galvanise politicians into more forceful action. \u201cI\u2019m hoping it will give MPs confidence to do something,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The People\u2019s Challenge\u2019s lawyer, John Halford, said the decision \u201ccompletely vindicates the position taken by the People\u2019s Challenge\u201d.

This is a pure question of law. The court is not concerned with and does not express any view about the merits of leaving the European Union: that is a political issue.</p> <p>2- It is accepted by all sides that this legal question is properly before the court and justiciable: under the UK constitution, it is one for the court to decide [5]. It turns on the extent of the Crown\u2019s powers under its prerogative [explained at 24-29]. The Government accepts that neither the European Union Referendum Act 2015 nor any other Act of Parliament confers on it statutory authority (as distinct from the Crown\u2019s prerogative power) to give notice under Article 50 [67-72, 76 and 105-108].</p> <h2> <em>Background</em></h2> <p>3 - On 1 January 1973 the United Kingdom joined what were then the European Communities, including the European Economic Community. Parliament passed the European Communities Act 1972 (1972 Act) to allow that to happen since it was a condition of membership that Community law should be given effect in the domestic law of the United Kingdom and primary legislation was required to achieve this [1 and 36-54]. The European Communities have now become the European Union.</p> <p>4 - Pursuant to the European Union Referendum Act 2015 a referendum was held on 23 June 2016 on the question whether the United Kingdom should leave or remain in the European Union. The answer given was that the UK should leave [2].</p> <p>5- The process for withdrawal is governed by Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, which states that once a Member State gives notice to withdraw there is a two-year period in which to negotiate a withdrawal agreement. If no agreement is reached in this time then, subject only to agreement on an extension of time with the European Council acting unanimously, the EU Treaties shall cease to apply to that State. The Government accepts that a notice under Article 50 cannot be withdrawn once it has been given. It also accepts that Article 50 does not allow a conditional notice to be given: a notice cannot be qualified by stating that Parliament is required to approve any withdrawal agreement made in the course of Article 50 negotiations [9-17].</p> <p>6 - Therefore, once notice is given under Article 50, some rights under EU law as incorporated into domestic law by the 1972 Act would inevitably be lost once the Article 50 withdrawal process is completed [57-66].</p> <h2> <em>The constitutional principles</em></h2> <p>7 - The most fundamental rule of the UK\u2019s constitution is that Parliament is sovereign and can make and unmake any law it chooses. As an aspect of the sovereignty of Parliament it has been established for hundreds of years that the Crown \u2013 i.e. the Government of the day \u2013 cannot by exercise of prerogative powers override legislation enacted by Parliament. This principle is of critical importance and sets the context for the general rule on which the Government seeks to rely \u2013 that normally the conduct of international relations and the making and unmaking of treaties are taken to be matters falling within the scope of the Crown\u2019s prerogative powers. That general rule exists precisely because the exercise of such prerogative powers has no effect on domestic law, including as laid down by Parliament in legislation [18-36].</p> <p>8 - In the present case, however, the Government accepts, and indeed positively contends, that if notice is given under Article 50 it will inevitably have the effect of changing domestic law. Those elements of EU law which Parliament has made part of domestic law by enactment of the 1972 Act will in due course cease to have effect [76-80].</p> <p>9 - The central contention of the Government in the present case is that Parliament must be taken to have intended when it enacted the 1972 Act that the Crown would retain its prerogative power to effect a withdrawal from the Community Treaties (now the EU Treaties), and thereby intended that the Crown should have the power to choose whether EU law should continue to have effect in the domestic law of the UK or not [76-81].</p> <h2> <em>Conclusion</em></h2> <p>10 - The Court does not accept the argument put forward by the Government. There is nothing in the text of the 1972 Act to support it. In the judgment of the Court the argument is contrary both to the language used by Parliament in the 1972 Act and to the fundamental constitutional principles of the sovereignty of Parliament and the absence of any entitlement on the part of the Crown to change domestic law by the exercise of its prerogative powers [82-94, 97-104]. The Court expressly accepts the principal argument of the claimants [95-96].</p> <p>11 - For the reasons set out in the judgment, we decide that the Government does not have power under the Crown\u2019s prerogative to give notice pursuant to Article 50 for the UK to withdraw from the European Union.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T11:57:31.937Z\">at 11.57am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581b1394e4b029b92ca45104\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T10:39:22.137Z\">10.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Downing Street has also said the government will appeal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jessicaelgot/status/794126273786298368\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Government says it is &quot;disappointed&quot; by court ruling on Article 50 and will appeal, expecting Supreme Court hearing on December 7</p>&mdash; Jessica Elgot (@jessicaelgot) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jessicaelgot/status/794126273786298368\">November 3, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581b119ae4b029b92ca450fd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T10:35:20.074Z\">10.35am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/summary-r-miller-v-secretary-of-state-for-exiting-the-eu-20161103.pdf\">the summary of the judgment (pdf).</a></p> <p>And here is its conclusion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"939710052c8514fb2fd2fb6bf01fbdf181d28160\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/939710052c8514fb2fd2fb6bf01fbdf181d28160/0_0_716_293/500.jpg\" alt=\"Conclusion of summary of article 50 judgement\" width=\"500\" height=\"205\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Conclusion of summary of article 50 judgement</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Court service</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581b11eae4b07ceadb3a1f99\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T10:33:24.611Z\">10.33am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">International trade secretary Liam Fox says government will appeal to supreme court</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In the Commons<strong> Barry Gardiner</strong>, the shadow international trade secretary, asks <strong>Liam Fox</strong>, the international trade secretary, says the government should accept that the Commons will vote for article 50 to be triggered.

She weeps tears of joy at the beauty of the cosmos, and tears of pain after a surreal reunion with her dead father, whose form the aliens decide to take (they are emotionally intelligent too, see?).

In Gravity, you have got Sandra Bullock to cry the zero-gravity tears (and do the underwear scene), and George Clooney is on board, too \u2013 a dream team of romantic leads. But it\u2019s just not that sort of movie, is it? In Contact, Jodie Foster has a young, handsome Matthew McConaughey \u2013 the future king of romcoms \u2013 as her co-star. They have a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it liaison, then, next time she meets him, he\u2019s a priest! McConaughey was also squandered in Christopher Nolan\u2019s overreaching Interstellar. To the film\u2019s credit, he gets to be an emotional man in a sci-fi movie \u2013 the scene of him tearfully watching his children grow up in fast-forward on their video diaries was the movie\u2019s highlight \u2013 but again, you\u2019ve got a widowed McConaughey and Anne Hathaway in a capsule together and the world\u2019s about to end, and they just talk about retro-thrusters and event horizons. And you might have forgotten The Martian\u2019s big romantic moment, when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6h9w9ZTKU\">Kate Mara kisses Sebastian Stan</a> <em>on the outside of his space helmet</em>. Nothing says \u201cgiant prophylactic\u201d like a spacesuit.</p> <p>If romance is hard to find in sci-fi, sex is barely more than a theoretical concept.

Tom Cruise seems to have a no-romance clause written into his sci-fi contract. The only penetration in the Alien movies is of the man-xenomorph variety. For all its fetish wear, The Matrix only managed to get Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Ann Moss together for a mid-rave quickie in the sequel.

Or even a formula. Of course, there are women who like their sci-fi pure and cerebral, and men left cold by space stories, but research suggests that gender is a big factor in genre preference. <a href=\"http://www.participations.org/Volume%209/Issue%202/4%20Redfern.pdf\">A 2012 analysis of BFI statistics</a> found that 83% of respondents who expressed a preference for romantic films were female, 72% for romantic comedies.

There are others that, in retrospect, struck the perfect balance. Look at Blade Runner. It\u2019s a film of big philosophical questions and brilliant future-world design, as pure, profound and prescient a sci-fi as you could wish for.

Some might see this as sci-fi selling out. Arrival has already been branded as \u201csentimental\u201d and \u201cmaudlin\u201d.

Ironically, the \u201cyoung adult\u201d genre has been striking this same balance for some time, from the Hunger Games onwards, perhaps appealing to younger audiences less hung up on the old-fashioned binaries, gender, genre or otherwise. In recent years, we have had a steady trickle of smart, fresh emotionally literate sci-fis that do a lot with a little. Spike Jonze\u2019s Her, for example, where Joaquin Phoenix falls in love with his Scarlett Johansson-voiced operating system. In sci-fi terms, it\u2019s as bold and thorny a film about artificial intelligence as we have ever had, but that\u2019s the point, it doesn\u2019t <em>feel </em>like a sci-fi movie \u2013 more like a warped romance. A similar example would be Michel Gondry\u2019s Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind with Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet chasing each other through the windmills of their partially erased minds.

  "<p>Sir Philip Green could be forced to pay hundreds of millions of pounds into the BHS pension scheme after the Pensions Regulator <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/02/philip-green-may-be-forced-to-pay-money-into-bhs-pension-scheme\">began formal proceedings against the billionaire tycoon</a>. However, the regulator faces a long and arduous battle to erase the pension scheme\u2019s \u00a3571m deficit.</p> <h2><strong>What action has the regulator taken this week on BHS?</strong></h2> <p>The regulator has issued a warning notice to Sir Philip Green and the most recent owner of BHS, Dominic Chappell, and their companies. These warning notices run to more than 300 pages and explain why the regulator believes them liable for providing financial support to the BHS pension scheme, through a one-off contribution and ongoing support. Green and Chappell have been sent different notices. The regulator will not disclose the difference between the notices, but it is understood Green faces far larger financial demands than Chappell, a serial bankrupt.</p> <h2><strong>Why has the regulator done this now?</strong></h2> <p>It launched an anti-avoidance investigation into BHS in March 2015 after Green sold the department store chain to Chappell. The regulator, led by chief executive Lesley Titcomb, has gathered more than 100,000 documents and now believes it has a case against Green and Chappell. At the same time, the regulator and the Pension Protection Fund have been in talks with Green about a bailout for the pension scheme, but the talks have broken down without a deal despite the tycoon pledging to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/15/mps-sir-philip-greens-reputation-and-knighthood-depend-on-pension-offer\">\u201csort\u201d the problems facing BHS pensioners</a>. With no deal in place, the regulator has activated its legal powers instead.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/02/philip-green-may-be-forced-to-pay-money-into-bhs-pension-scheme\">Pensions Regulator begins legal proceedings against Sir Philip Green</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>What happens next?</strong></h2> <p>Green and Chappell now have several months to formally respond. Once those responses have been sent, the regulator\u2019s determinations panel will meet to consider the case and make a ruling. The panel is independent from other parts of the regulator and the team that has investigated BHS, but it has the power to demand cash payments or that parties provide ongoing support to the pension scheme.</p> <h2><strong>Can the regulator legally force Green to make a payment?</strong></h2> <p>Yes, if the determinations panel rules that he should. The regulator was given extensive legal powers through a series of pensions laws. However, Green can appeal against the decision through the legal system, starting with the upper tribunal, then the court of appeal, and finally the supreme court.</p> <h2><strong>What are the chances of winning a legal battle?</strong></h2> <p>The regulator is heading into unknown territory. It was founded in 2005 but has issued warning notices in just 16 cases. Some of these cases were about establishing pensioners as creditors for a company which has gone bust, such as Lehman Brothers, rather than seeking cash from a third party. A similar case involving Coats Group plc, the thread-making business, has yet to develop beyond the warning notice issued three years ago.</p> <h2><strong>What does this mean for Green\u2019s knighthood?</strong></h2> <p>The latest development is not positive for the honour. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/20/philip-green-labelled-billionaire-spiv-in-commons-debate-on-knighthood\">After MPs voted unanimously to strip the tycoon of his title</a>, probably his final hope would be agreeing a rescue deal for the BHS pension scheme. The regulator is still open to agreeing a deal with Green, but the start of enforcement action shows it is not confident about agreeing anything. Ultimately, the forfeiture committee will make a recommendation to the prime minister about the knighthood, but the regulator\u2019s announcement will not count in Green\u2019s favour.</p>",
  "<p>Greece appears on track to win access to a controversial EU programme that could earmark up to \u20ac1.75bn (\u00a31.56bn) in free carbon allowances for the building of two massive coal-fired power plants.</p> <p>The 1100MW coal stations will cost an estimated \u20ac2.4bn, and emit around 7m tonnes of CO2 a year, casting doubt on their viability without a cash injection from an exemption under Europe\u2019s carbon trading market.</p> <p>The European parliament\u2019s industry committee last month approved a rule change allowing Greece to join the scheme, the \u201810c derogation\u2019 of the emissions trading system (ETS). Now, positive votes in the environment committee next month and at a plenary in February could set wheels in motion for the coal plants. </p> <p>Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy, a Dutch Liberal MEP on the environment committee, said: \u201cLignite [coal] has no future and should not be stimulated in any way. Greece\u2019s intention of using public funds to revive its lignite-based model should not be allowed. Article 10C is there to help poor countries towards a sustainable energy future. Lignite does not fit these criteria.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t make this up,\u201d added Imke L\u00fcbbeke, WWF Europe\u2019s head climate and energy policy. \u201cThe ETS was intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but it now risks being abused to facilitate investments in the new coal plants, which would operate well within the 2060s. </p> <p>\u201cThis would violate climate targets and is in no way compatible with the leadership role the EU aspires to play in global climate policy and carbon markets.\u201d</p> <p>Greece depends on 16 ageing lignite coal units for around half of its electricity production and its energy establishment sees two new lignite plants in western Macedonia as a cost-effective way of modernising and securing energy supplies.</p> <p>Emmanuel Panagiotakis, the president of the Greek public power corporation (GPPC), <a href=\"https://www.dei.gr/el/i-dei/kentro-tupou/deltia-tupou/deltia-tupou-2015/oktwvrios-2015/sunantisi-me-eurwvouleutes\">told MEPs last year</a> that without access to free emissions allowances, Greek lignite production would be discredited, causing electricity costs to skyrocket and jeapordising energy security.</p> <p>One of the two new plants, Ptolemaida V, is already under construction, with its \u20ac1.4bn price tag underwritten by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.dei.gr/en/anakoinwseis/xrimatistiriaka-etairikes-prakseis-katavoli-merismatos-ka/xrimatistiriakes-anakoinwseis-2013/ekdosi-telikis-asfalistikis-kalupsis-daneiou-739-e\">a \u20ac739m loan</a> from a consortium led by the German export bank, KfW-Ipex.

It is what they know, what the state requires of them, and what they will do. It would be easier to change your grandmother\u2019s mind about something.\u201d</p> <p>The original 10c derogation was a classic Brussels fudge that allowed east European members to sign up to the EU\u2019s 2020 climate package. Between 2013 and 2019, it <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-12-561_en.htm?locale=en\">allocated 673</a><a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-12-561_en.htm?locale=en\">m free emissions allowances</a> to coal-dependent countries whose GDP per capita was 50% below the EU average.</p> <p>An equivalent value is supposed to be spent by these countries on retrofitting and upgrading energy infrastructure, diversifying energy sources, and on clean energy.</p> <p>In practice though, the derogation has been controversial, with Poland \u2013 by far the system\u2019s biggest beneficiary \u2013 claiming hundreds of millions of euros for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/11/coal-energy\">ghost coal plants which did not exist</a>.</p> <p>Gerbrandy said: \u201c10c is a very important instrument that unfortunately can too easily be abused. We have seen this happen in the past. Strong governance and a clear focus on a true transition towards sustainable energy infrastructure are crucial.\u201d</p> <p>WWF calculates that under the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2015/EN/1-2015-337-EN-F1-1.PDF\">commission\u2019s proposal</a> for revising the ETS and 10c rules, Greece would receive 7m free allowances every year between 2021-2030.

These investments will never pay off. Renewables are the only way out of Greece\u2019s energy mess.\u201d</p> <p>Before it took power in Greece, the leftwing Syriza movement <a href=\"https://left.gr/news/political-resolution-1st-congress-syriza#sthash.DXWQubT4.5GfxjvSI.dpuf\">pledged itself</a> to environmentally safe growth and \u201cthe ecological transformation of the economy\u201d.</p> <p>But the party was also committed to building new coal plants and, under pressure from an EU refusal to write down its debts, focused on coal as an energy safeguard.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/26/greece-syriza-juggles-coal-pipelines-and-climate-ambitions\">a senior Syriza source said</a> that continued fiscal problems would make it wiser to burn lignite than to import it. \u201cOne way or another Greek lignite will be exploited,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Environmentalists say that under Syriza, forest protections have been weakened, energy efficiency policies undermined, environmental permitting systems deregulated, and renewable projects damaged by changes to support schemes.</p> <p>\u201cWe had high hopes when Syriza was elected because of their programme,\u201d said Nikos Mantzaris, a spokesman for WWF Greece. \u201cWe thought they would be friendlier to the environment but in fact their choices have been even worse than the previous government. Syriza came to power promising to get rid of fossil fuels in the next 20 years and instead, they\u2019re investing in lignite.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Google has responded to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/14/european-commission-files-third-antitrust-charge-against-google\">European commission\u2019s (EC) renewed statement of objections</a>, declaring its case against Google Shopping to be \u201cwrong on the facts, the law, and the economics\u201d and dismissing it as just \u201cthe interests of a small number of websites\u201d.<br></p> <p>The seven-year case revolves around the charge that the market dominance of Google within search is being used to leverage its price comparison service to the detriment of third-party sites. </p> <p>Within its second 100-page response to the EC, Google said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/15/google-one-box-search-european-commission-case\">that its Shopping service</a>, which appears as a tab within search results and within adverts at the top of the page, was simply the result of its push to present users with useful information and direct answers to questions. </p> <p>It also said that the exclusion of retailers such as Amazon and eBay from the case was wrong, as they compete with price comparison sites also, despite paying for referral traffic. </p> <p>Kent Walker, Google\u2019s senior vice president and general counsel, said: \u201cConsumers don\u2019t just look for products on a search engine, then click on a price comparison site, and then click again to visit merchant sites. They reach merchant websites in many different ways: via general search engines, specialist search services, merchant platforms, social-media sites, and online ads served by various companies. </p> <p>\u201cAnd of course merchants are reaching consumers directly like never before. On the mobile web \u2013 and more than half of Europe\u2019s Internet traffic is mobile these days \u2013 dedicated apps are the most common way for consumers to shop.\u201d</p> <p>Adjoining the EC\u2019s updated charges, European competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said the commission\u2019s preliminary investigation into Google Shopping revealed that Google had \u201cunduly favoured its own comparison shopping service in its general search result pages\u201d, meaning that \u201cconsumers may not see the most relevant results to their search queries\u201d.</p> <p>A Google spokesperson said: \u201cWe remain confident that these claims lack evidence and are wrong on the facts, the law, and the economics. The surest signs of dynamic competition in any market are low prices, abundant choices, and constant innovation \u2014 and that\u2019s a great description of shopping on the internet today.\u201d</p> <p>Google also responded to the charges made against its advertising services, Adsense for Search, which places contextual, text-based ads near and around search results.</p> <p>A Google spokesperson said: \u201cOur text ads help websites generate income and have always faced strong competition from other ad formats, so we disagree with the Commission\u2019s assessment. Nevertheless, even before the Statement of Objections was filed, we changed practices the Commission takes issue with, so we hope to resolve this case quickly.\u201d</p> <p>The EC originally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/15/google-faces-antitrust-action-from-eu-competition-watchdog\">filed charges in April 2015</a>, receiving a response from Google later that year. New, reinforcing charges in the Google Shopping case were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/14/european-commission-files-third-antitrust-charge-against-google\">then filed by the EC in July this year</a>, which also included charges against Adsense.</p> <p>Google is also facing antitrust charges against its Android mobile operating system, which runs on the majority of smartphones globally.

  "<p>It\u2019s almost six months since Sadiq Khan became London mayor and opinion polls suggest that Londoners are <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/mayor/sadiq-khan-given-poll-boost-after-first-two-months-in-office-a3292706.html\">pleased with him</a> so far.

Khan has allied with London business groups and others to lobby national government for infrastructure investment and stronger devolved powers. Brexit, which he and most London voters opposed, has added <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayor-sends-welcome-message-to-the-world\">edge and urgency</a> to this campaign.

This is the issue Londoners are most concerned about. Accordingly, Khan dubbed the <a href=\"http://davehill.typepad.com/double_q_books/2016/08/one.html\">mayoral election</a> a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/sep/30/sadiq-khan-london-mayoral-race-is-referendum-on-tory-housing-policy\">housing policy referendum</a>. A large part of his approach to this complex policy area will be trying to increase the delivery of homes that are affordable for people on low and middle incomes. Khan has so far not set a target for the absolute number of what he calls \u201cgenuinely affordable\u201d homes to be built in his four-year term, but he has committed to a long term goal of 50% of all new London dwellings meeting that definition. How well is he doing so far? What progress is he making towards honouring other housing pledges in <a href=\"http://www.sadiq.london/homes_for_londoners_manifesto\">his manifesto</a>?</p> <p>A lot of the work on housing has been hard graft behind the scenes. There is a widely shared view that Khan\u2019s deputy for housing and residential development, <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/people/mayoral/james-murray\">James Murray</a>, has applied himself to the vast task with an energy, an intelligence and a political will that was lacking in Boris Johnson\u2019s time as mayor. He has been nurturing the broad consensus that unless London makes a better job of building the kinds of homes it and its people most need, everyone stands to lose - including the rest of the country. The goodwill of housing associations, boroughs of all political complexions, employers and commercial property developers has been sought. A dinner Murray had with new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/jul/19/a-quick-guide-to-new-housing-and-planning-minister-gavin-barwell\">housing minister Gavin Barwell</a>, who is also <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/people/gavin-barwell\">minister for London</a> and MP for a <a href=\"http://www.gavinbarwell.com/\">marginal London constituency</a>, appears to have gone swimmingly.</p> <p>Khan has repeatedly stressed that altering the London housing equation so that it generates better results won\u2019t happen quickly or easily. Sooner or later, though, Londoners will want to start seeing solid results. What follows is a round-up of Khan\u2019s housing policy progress so far and some pointers to important things to come.</p> <h2>A trade-off with property developers</h2> <p>Later this year, after the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/autumn-statement-2016-date-confirmed\">autumn public spending statement on 23 November</a>, City Hall will issue its long-brewing <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/implementing-london-plan/supplementary-planning-guidance\">supplementary planning guidance</a> (SPG) designed to encourage higher \u201caffordable\u201d housing yields from planning deals struck between boroughs and property developers across the city. Like it or not, London depends heavily on private sector companies to finance and deliver buildings it needs - including much of its affordable housing. Inviting them to take a hike might get you a round of applause but, the ways things are now, won\u2019t help put roofs over people\u2019s heads.</p> <p>Khan\u2019s SPG will effectively offer developers an incentive to ensure that the proportion of affordable homes agreed for larger schemes meets a minimum level, expected to be 35%. London mayors have considerable powers to intervene in planning arrangements being worked out at borough level. The SPG will show Khan willing to give a fair wind to plans enshrining the desired percentage, but take a long, hard look at those that don\u2019t. The trade-off is that developers will benefit from the certainty this approach provides \u2013 they may have mastered the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2014/oct/16/earls-court-questions-of-viability\">dark arts of viability</a>, but the attendant aggravation costs them time and money too. The SPG will also set out what types of home called \u201caffordable\u201d by national government meet Khan\u2019s more stringent definition of being \u201cgenuinely\u201d so.</p> <h2><strong>Increasing \u201caffordable\u201d supply with public money</strong></h2> <p>Khan has spent some of what\u2019s left of the <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/housing-and-land/increasing-housing-supply/mayor%E2%80%99s-housing-covenant-2015-18-programme\">\u00a31.25bn provided to Boris Johnson for 2015-2018</a> to increase the \u201caffordable\u201d housing component of housing planned for the <a href=\"http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/khan-intervenes-to-increase-affordable-housing-on-old-oak-site/7016350.article\">first section of the vast Old Oak and Park Royal regeneration project</a> in west London (whose overall stewardship under Johnson he\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/old-oak-common-regeneration-is-branded-a-mess-in-sadiq-khan-review-a3383996.html\">described</a> as \u201ca mess\u201d). He will soon produce a successor to <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/the_mayors_housing_covenant_2015-18_programme_prospectus.pdf\">Johnson\u2019s funding prospectus</a>, outlining to housing associations and boroughs what it will take for them to secure grants from him. This will be published following the autumn statement. City Hall is lobbying for further funding for affordable homes. </p> <h2><strong>Building \u201caffordable\u201d homes on public land</strong></h2> <p>Prior to Khan\u2019s election, Transport for London (TfL) had named a panel of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/feb/04/transport-for-london-names-partner-companies-for-land-development-drive\">developer partners</a> to work with on jointly profiting from building on over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/oct/20/transport-for-london-picks-first-300-acres-for-property-development-drive\">300 acres</a> on 75 sites in its large land portfolio. Its prime objective was to make as much money as it could for the city\u2019s transport systems. Khan, though, wants an overall <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-35465056\">50% of homes built on these sites </a>to be \u201cgenuinely affordable\u201d. His manifesto<a href=\"http://www.sadiq.london/homes_for_londoners_manifesto\"> specified</a> that these would be part-buy, part-rent shared ownership dwellings prioritised for first-time buyers who\u2019ve been renting for five years, especially in Outer London. It is another key strand of his drive to increase affordable housing supply.</p> <p>Since the election, Khan has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/aug/23/london-housing-tfl-land-set-for-affordable-homes-as-sadiq-khan-picks-expert-team\">put in place</a> arrangements for 200 out of 400 homes he wants built on TfL land at Kidbrooke station to meet his requirements and urged the transport body to prioritise some of its smaller sites elsewhere. An <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayor-fast-tracks-more-land-for-affordable-homes\">announcement</a> earlier this week concerned two of these. One is called Landmark Court near London Bridge station, which has been lined up for more than 100 homes, of which \u201cat least 35%\u201d will be affordable. The other is called Fenwick South, which is actually owned by Lambeth Council. The building of 55 social rented homes already planned for it as part of the agreement that will extend the Northern Line into Nine Elms will now begin early next year - sooner than expected. TfL will be responsible for delivering the homes, which will be owned and managed by Lambeth.</p> <h2><strong>A best practice guide for estate regeneration</strong> </h2> <p>Another way Khan could increase the supply of affordable homes would be by helping boroughs to add to the number on council-owned housing estates. Recent <a href=\"http://www.centreforlondon.org/publication/estate-densification/\">research</a> has emphasised that many of the biggest Inner London estates have already been rebuilt or replaced, but that the potential exists to \u201cdensify\u201d others to the tune of an estimated 4,000 to 8,000 homes a year. The problem is that such \u201cregenerations\u201d have the potential to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/oct/10/london-housing-improving-the-theory-and-practice-of-densifying-estates\">contentious, contested and to go very wrong</a> \u2013 not least for people living on them. One positive route through this difficult terrain is to find ways of \u201cdensifying\u201d without extensive demolition and temporary rehousing, with current residents directly benefiting from the results. When he was Islington Council\u2019s housing lead, James Murray <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/aug/07/estate-regeneration-the-king-square-solution\">firmly favoured</a> the latter approach. A \u201cbest practice\u201d document, setting out the mayor\u2019s principles for getting estate regeneration right, is expected to be published by the end of this month.</p> <h2><strong>Introducing the London Living Rent </strong></h2> <p>Khan\u2019s plan to bring in a new private sector tenure with rents set at one third of average local household incomes \u2013 thereby fitting his definition of \u201cgenuinely affordable\u201d - was a major element of his housing manifesto. In September, he <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-37405991\">said</a> London households typically earning between \u00a335,000 and \u00a345,000 a year - which would cover couples each earning substantially less than the average London incomes - would qualify for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-37405991\">these new homes</a> and be able to rent a two-bedroom flat for less than \u00a31,000 per month, compared with the London average of \u00a31,450. Subsequent <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/housing-and-land/renting/london-living-rent#acc-i-41302\">published details</a> indicate that the eligible household income range could be as wide as \u00a325,000 to \u00a360,000, depending on the area of London. </p> <p>The mayor\u2019s intention is that this <a href=\"http://londonist.com/2016/09/mayor-announces-london-living-rent-to-help-blunt-the-housing-crisis\">new form of tenure</a> would enable tenants to save for mortgage deposits and <a href=\"http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/london-living-rent-confirmed-as-homeownership-product/7016863.article\">move on to home ownership</a>. It best described as \u201crent-indexing\u201d rather than rent controlled according to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f432c7aa-16bd-11e6-b197-a4af20d5575e\">one housing expert</a>, though at City Hall they prefer to describe it as a form of rent regulation applied to a specific type of affordable home. Housing providers have said they would be able to supply London Living Rent properties, though some political debate has centred on how far they\u2019d be affordable to renters earning the London Living Wage. The tenure period under <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/housing-and-land/renting/london-living-rent#acc-i-41303\">London Living Rent terms</a> will be \u201cgenerally of up to five years\u201d, says City Hall. Hackney Council, which is eager to help young, middle income residents remain in the borough as well as sustaining its social housing delivery, has pledged to be the first to see 500 London Living Rent homes built. It is thought that the very first London Living Rent homes could start to be built next year.</p> <h2><strong>Understanding the impacts of foreign buyers</strong></h2> <p>Much blame for London\u2019s high housing costs is routinely aimed at foreign buyers investing in absurdly expensive \u201cprime central\u201d flats, but the true impacts of such finance and the use to which resulting properties are put are varied and unclear. Khan is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/nov/01/london-housing-sadiq-khan-research-brief-recognises-need-for-overseas-investors\">commissioning independent research</a> into the phenomenon, hoping to get a fuller picture so that housing policy can be developed accordingly. Significantly, the remit for this research recognises that, for good or ill, overseas buyers continue to play a big part in enabling development in London to happen. Khan wants the final report delivered next spring.</p> <h2>Lessening the ill-effects of the Housing and Planning Act</h2> <p>During the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/zac-versus-sadiq.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">mayoral election campaign</a>, Khan\u2019s Conservative rival Zac Goldsmith made much of an amendment to a piece of legislation that even fellow Tories thought very bad for London and which Goldsmith claimed would enable the forced sale of council homes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/jan/11/what-will-zac-goldsmiths-2-for-1-housing-bill-amendment-achieve\">result</a> in twice as many \u201caffordable\u201d homes being built in the capital as would be lost. But the true impact of the Act in London cannot be fully assessed until its accompanying regulations are published, interpreting the various elements that leave room for discretion. The EU referendum and its turbulent aftermath have meant progress on this task has been slow. The appointment of Gavin Barwell as housing minister (see above) and his <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/09/13/government-edging-away-from-home-ownership-focus-says-housing-mi/\">suggestion</a> of a shift away from controversial \u201cstarter homes\u201d, thought largely useless as an \u201caffordable\u2019 product in London, towards supporting a wider range of relatively low cost homes, including for rent, have raised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/oct/05/conservative-party-conference-hope-housing-crisis\">tentative hopes</a> that the worst aspects of the Act as they could affect the capital might be reduced.</p> <h2>Protecting the green belt</h2> <p>Housing supply <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/major-programmes/london-housing-commission\">analysis</a> <a href=\"http://england.shelter.org.uk/professional_resources/policy_and_research/policy_library/policy_library_folder/report_when_brownfield_isnt_enough\">published</a> during the election campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/mar/29/which-london-mayor-candidate-will-fix-the-capitals-housing-crisis\">underlined</a> how difficult it will be to increase the number of homes built in London to the overall 50,000 a year it is generally held to need - a figure Khan has acknowledged but not committed to - without boroughs bringing forward some of their green belt land for building on. But the issue is politically explosive and Khan has gone to considerable lengths not to ignite it, both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/apr/23/london-mayor-race-zac-goldsmith-is-being-slippery-about-the-green-belt\">during the campaign</a> and since, <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/sadiq-khan-pledges-support-for-green-belt\">making much</a> of his rejection of Tory Bromley Council\u2019s plans for a football stadium and flats to go on green belt land in Chislehurst.</p> <h2>A not-for-profit lettings agency</h2> <p>In his <a href=\"http://www.sadiq.london/homes_for_londoners_manifesto\">manifesto</a>, Khan promised to set up \u201ca London-wide, not-for-profit lettings agency for good landlords, building on the work that councils have started, and ending rip-off fees for renters\u201d. Word is that work has begun on this at City Hall, but it is at an early stage. </p> <h2>Stopping \u201caffordable rent\u201d conversions</h2> <p>A policy introduced by the Tory-led coalition government encouraged housing associations and councils to convert social rented homes to new, more expensive \u201caffordable rent\u201d tenures when they became vacant and were re-let to new people on waiting lists (with the strain often taken by housing benefit, the bill for which the government is actually trying to reduce). This was <a href=\"http://blog.shelter.org.uk/2014/12/does-affordable-rent-really-mean-the-end-of-social-housing/\">correctly seen</a> as a threat to social housing numbers at a time when more, not fewer, are needed. Khan, committed to protecting social housing in London as \u201ca vital asset\u201d, has moved to block these conversions. City Hall says that under Boris Johnson\u2019s\u2019s 2011-2015 affordable homes programme, a total of 19,000 were approved (see \u201cnotes to editors\u201d <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayor-launches-london-living-rent-for-new-homes\">here</a>) with 14,000 of those now completed. The rate of conversions has slowed recently, but Khan <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayor-launches-london-living-rent-for-new-homes\">says</a> he will work with housing associations through his affordable homes programme to put an end to them. </p> <h2>Homes for Londoners team</h2> <p>Khan promised to set up a \u201cnew and powerful team at the heart of City Hall\u201d to pull together all the mayor\u2019s housing powers and resources and \u201cbreak the homebuilding logjam\u201d. So far, a Homes of Londoners governance board has been formed, chaired by Khan - it will meet for the first time next month, after the autumn statement - a \u201cskills and capacity audit\u201d is underway and an in-house team of experts on development viability is being assembled with a view to making the provisions of the supplementary planning guidance stick (read more on that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/aug/23/london-housing-tfl-land-set-for-affordable-homes-as-sadiq-khan-picks-expert-team\">here</a>). Perhaps the \u201cHomes for Londoners\u201d title is best understood as a banner flying above various forms of co-ordinated action. </p> <h2>Preparing for a new London Plan and housing strategy</h2> <p>Mayoral housing policy has to be in line with those enshrined in the London Plan, the name given to the mayor\u2019s statutory \u201cspatial development strategy\u201d for the capital. The current London Plan is Boris Johnson\u2019s. That doesn\u2019t mean Khan is totally hamstrung by it, but it does mean he needs to put it through a <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/london-plan-full-review\">full review</a> which will result in a new version in up to three years\u2019 time. That review is underway with the launch of a consultation document called <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/get-involved/have-your-say/all-consultations/city-all-londoners\">A City for All Londoners</a>. In this, Khan sets out the challenges posed by the capital\u2019s rapid growth and some of the ways he hopes to meet them, including in housing. Themes include some of those mentioned above and homelessness, including rough sleeping. The mayor will also be producing a specific housing strategy to replace Johnson\u2019s. It will come out some time next year. </p> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>The essential difference between Khan\u2019s approach to housing policy and that of his Tory predecessor is that the Labour mayor is, as you\u2019d expect, taking a more interventionist approach to shaping and regulating the huge, unruly beast that is the London housing market. He appears to be demonstrating far greater drive for getting more homes across the \u201cgenuinely affordable\u201d spectrum built. His mayoral team and City Hall officers are of a high calibre and have demonstrated the pragmatic, consensus-building approach that is fundamental to mayors getting things done. </p> <p>London\u2019s housing problems might be characterised as a combination of its booming successes over more than two decades and a consequence of successive national governments\u2019 inadequate responses to the failure of the market to respond in the right way to its demands. Housing shortages and other problems aren\u2019t new to London, and the current ones are beyond the power of any mayor to completely solve alone. But the hope is that Khan can provide strong, successful examples of how to make a start. </p>",
  "<p>The number of 18 to 24-year-olds in England entering treatment for addiction to heroin has plummeted 79% in 10 years, as the stigma surrounding the drug and changing tastes in intoxication have made it increasingly unfashionable. </p> <p>In the year to March, 2,367 people from that age group presented with heroin and opiate addiction at the approximately 900 drug treatment services in England, compared with 11,351 10 years earlier, according to statistics from the <a href=\"https://www.ndtms.net/default.aspx\">National Drug Treatment Monitoring System</a> (NDTMS).</p> <p>They constituted a tiny fraction of the 149,807 opiate addicts who came for help to kick their habit throughout the year, a number that is itself 12% down on a peak of 170,032 who came for treatment in 2009-10. The median age of those users was 39, the statistics showed. </p> <p>Michael Linnell, the coordinator of <a href=\"http://michaellinnell.org.uk/drugwatch.html\">UK DrugWatch</a>, a network of drug treatment professionals, said many of the heroin users currently accessing treatment would have become addicted during a boom in the drug\u2019s popularity in the late 1980s.

Among opiate addicts, 41% were also addicted to crack cocaine, with the next highest adjunctive drugs being alcohol (21%) and cannabis (19%).</p> <p>About half of those presenting to treatment \u2013 144,908 \u2013 had problems with alcohol, a fall of 4% compared with the previous year. Among those, 85,035 were treated for alcohol treatment only and 59,873 for alcohol problems alongside other substances. </p> <p>The most problematic drug among the 13,231 under-25s who came into contact with drug treatment services in the past year was cannabis, which was cited as a problem by 54%, followed by alcohol (44%) and cocaine (24%). </p> <p>The numbers from this age group accessing treatment had fallen 37% in 10 years, which the Public Health England report accompanying the statistics said reflected shifts in the patterns of drinking and drug use over that time, with far fewer young people experimenting with drugs than in the past. </p> <p>Karen Tyrell, the spokeswoman for the drug treatment charity <a href=\"http://www.addaction.org.uk/\">Addaction</a>, said the decline in problem drug use among young people reflected what drugs workers see on a daily basis, and credited evidence-based education, prevention and early intervention programmes for the change. </p> <p>The shift, though, was precarious, Tyrell said, warning that yearly spending cuts to treatment services risked reversing the gains. </p> <p>She added: \u201cOf course, what this also means is that we have an ageing population of heroin users, many of whom have been using since the 80s or 90s, and who are now dealing with poor physical health and increasing vulnerability. In an environment of ever rising drug-related deaths, it\u2019s imperative we don\u2019t lose sight of their needs.\u201d</p>",

That the \u201cfourth nation\u201d have yet to win a single game is certainly a worry but rather than hinder the opportunities of burgeoning nations at elite level, the Rugby League International Federation is instead working behind closed doors to ensure tournaments such as these are enhanced in the hope the playing field can eventually be levelled.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re always seeking to improve the developing nations, and our focus right now is primarily on those ranked between four and eight,\u201d says the RLIF\u2019s&#xa0;chief executive, David Collier. \u201cThe intent in the future is to play at least two more global events in a four-year cycle to help develop funding and player pools for those emerging nations.\u201d</p> <p>But despite more tournaments being planned for the next decade, the Four Nations\u2019 future on a revamped international calendar remains unclear. There are, as yet, no confirmed plans for the international game beyond next year\u2019s World Cup, and the decision about a Four Nations taking place again in the future falls to the relevant governing bodies, not the RLIF, although it is understood that all parties, including the Rugby Football League, are keen for it to continue.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to those guys to decide what the best format for the Four Nations is, but it\u2019s vital to have a packed, cohesive calendar so we can get used to having international rugby league on a regular basis,\u201d Collier says. \u201cThe Four Nations is great from our point of view because it puts international rugby league in the spotlight, and anything that enhances the profile of the game is something we openly welcome.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We take pride from playing in the European Cup but it doesn\u2019t match up to having a crack at England in the Four Nations</p> <footer> <cite>Steve McCormack</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As for Scotland, their game against England may not command too much attention north of the borderon Saturday, but their coach insists that opportunities such as this will enable the sport to stand a fighting chance in developing nations in the future.</p> <p>\u201cWe get some valuable exposure from this,\u201d says Steve McCormack, the Bravehearts coach. \u201cWe can increase the player pool off the back of a tournament like this and with the World Cup next year too, compete well there and then hopefully two straight years of exposure to the world\u2019s best will be a major plus for rugby league in Scotland.\u201d</p> <p>But how does the Four Nations solve its problem of one nation being repeatedly cut adrift? Five different sides in as many editions raises the question about whether it would be more beneficial to invite the same nation back regularly, as with Italy\u2019s addition to rugby union\u2019s Six Nations in 2000. However, Collier believes the proposed introduction of regular tournaments \u2013 the RLIF will confirm its plans for the next cycle leading up to the 2025 World Cup later this month \u2013 will solve that problem.</p> <p>\u201cIt really helps when nations like Scotland are afforded the opportunity to get more experience but traditionally it\u2019s only at World Cups: that\u2019s something we need to change,\u201d he says. \u201cScotland will benefit this year but we need a second regular event in the calendar with a number of developing nations consistently playing the best sides in the world.\u201d</p> <p>McCormack adds: \u201cWe take pride from playing in the European Cup against fellow developing nations but it doesn\u2019t match up to having a crack at England in the Four Nations.\u201d With more tournaments and more opportunities to play the world\u2019s best yet to materialise, opportunities such as the one Scotland have this year are vital. Taking it away from them or any other qualifying nation would wreck hopes of a more competitive international field in the future.</p> <p>Having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/28/australia-scotland-four-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">lost 54-12 to Australia last week</a>, Scotland may well fall short again this Saturday, and that winless record for the fourth nation could easily extend to 15 by the end of this tournament. But giving up and closing the door seems like a somewhat myopic option for a sport that has spent its history fighting so hard to establish itself.</p>",

  "<p>Last week, I was privileged to spend two days at the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota. Thousands of Native Americans have been camping along the Missouri river for months in an effort to defend clean water and sacred land from the Dakota Access oil pipeline. </p> <p>I had my heart broken listening to the testimony of Chase Iron Eyes and Bobbi Jean Three Legs in a town-hall-style meeting. I had my hope renewed standing under grey prairie skies beside the Rev Jesse Jackson, bearing witness to the largest gathering of Native Americans in modern history. Representing hundreds of tribes, these courageous water protectors support the Standing Rock Sioux, defending their water and their way of life.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/02/dakota-pipeline-protest-bundy-militia\">Why do we punish Dakota pipeline protesters but exonerate the Bundys? | Ladonna Bravebill Allard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Plans call for the Dakota Access pipeline to carry highly toxic fracked oil across four states, 200 waterways, and land sacred to the Standing Rock Sioux. The protesters know that pipelines leak, explode, pollute and poison land and water, and they don\u2019t want that happening to any of the millions of people who depend on the Missouri river. So they protest \u2013 peacefully. Inspired by a band of young Lakota runners crisscrossing the country on foot, they spend their days praying and chanting, and saying \u201cno\u201d to violations of their land, their health and their freedom.</p> <p>But their peaceful efforts are being met with force. I heard first-hand accounts of violent encounters with armed private security guards, police bearing assault rifles, and aggressive arrests by the hundreds. I see the faces of the people I met on my Facebook feed, now marred by rubber bullets, eyes watering from teargas. Against these unarmed protesters, North Dakota\u2019s governor has spent millions of dollars on additional security forces and even sent in the national guard.</p> <p>This makes no sense. North Dakota is not in a state of emergency; it is in a state of grace. The protesters threaten nothing except an outdated system of dirty, dangerous energy.</p> <p>What if, instead of brutalizing these protesters, we took a moment to listen to them? Not only are these men and women putting their bodies on the line to protect precious resources \u2013 they are charting the way to a better future for all of us.</p> <p>I went to North Dakota at the invitation of Wahleah Johns, founder of Native Renewables. She grew up in a traditional Navajo community poisoned by a giant strip-mining operation and now works to create low-cost clean energy solutions for Native American families. Together, we delivered Navajo-made portable solar panels to provide clean energy to power medical tents and other camp facilities as winter approaches. The solar trailers symbolize a healthy, equitable, prosperous energy future made possible by clean renewable energy.</p> <p>Kandi Mossett of the Indigenous Environmental Network is working ceaselessly to stop the Dakota Access pipeline. She grew up on the Fort Berthold Reservation in North Dakota and witnessed the terrible toll oil drilling and fracking took on the health of native people who lived nearby. She came to Standing Rock with her toddler on her hip and a powerful sense of justice.</p> <p>David Archambault II is the Standing Rock Sioux tribal chairman. As I arrived in North Dakota, he was in my home state of New York sharing what\u2019s happening at Standing Rock with a room full of philanthropists, inviting them to stand on the right side of history and support those working to stop the pipeline. </p> <p>These indigenous leaders are just a few of the thousands of water protectors who know first-hand the toxic legacy of fossil fuel extraction and exploitation.

Worldwide, renewables have now overtaken coal as the largest source of installed electric-generating capacity, according to the <a href=\"http://www.iea.org/newsroom/news/2016/october/iea-raises-its-five-year-renewable-growth-forecast-as-2015-marks-record-year.html?utm_content=bufferec133&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter-ieabirol&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\">International Energy Agency</a>.

  "<p>The UK\u2019s climate targets are at risk if the government does not reverse its decision to end support for windfarms, the head of one of the Big Six energy companies has warned.</p> <p>Keith Anderson of ScottishPower said onshore wind power should be opened up to the government\u2019s new subsidy regime because the technology could be deployed quickly, help energy bills and cut carbon emissions. </p> <p>The government will end existing subsidies for new onshore windfarms from April next year, leading the utility rushing to complete eight projects that already had planning permission, all in Scotland. The Spanish-owned company is currently putting up turbines at a rate of almost one a day.</p> <p>\u201cOur view would be if you want to hit your climate change targets you need onshore wind, otherwise you\u2019re going to struggle to hit them and it\u2019ll cost you significantly more money,\u201d said Anderson. </p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian he called on ministers to open up windfarms in Scotland to contracts for difference, which pay operators a guaranteed top-up above the wholesale price of energy. \u201cWhere we are in the energy sector as a whole right now, nothing is being built without some sort of mechanism or support,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s statutory climate advisers say that, while technically the UK\u2019s carbon budgets could be met without onshore wind, doing so without it would be more expensive because it was so cost effective. Constraints on it would \u201cnecessitate deployment of more costly technologies and increase the cost of decarbonising the power sector,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2016-CCC-Progress-Report.pdf\">the Committee on Climate Change said in the summer</a>.</p> <p>Analysts at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/07/onshore-wind-farms-cheapest-form-of-uk-electricity-report-shows\">Bloomberg have said that wind power is already the cheapest form of new power in the UK,</a> and Anderson said that more onshore wind would be essential to keep energy bills down. But he said it was \u201cextremely doubtful\u201d the company would build any new onshore wind without support.</p> <p>While he said he understood the Conservatives had a manifesto pledge to end subsidies for onshore wind due to some local opposition in England, there was no reason the contracts for difference could not be opened to future windfarms built in Scotland, which has a target of sourcing 100% of its electricity from renewables by 2020.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf you lower the level of support what you do is drive people looking for the windiest and most productive sites \u2013 you will tend to find those north of the border. Developers like us are naturally shifting and focusing on Scotland,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The turbines the company is erecting now are mostly expansions of existing windfarms, and will add 474MW of capacity, or enough to power 287,000 homes. ScottishPower has built around 1,600MW of onshore wind in the past two decades. </p> <p>Lindsay Roberts, senior policy manager at trade body Scottish Renewables, echoed the company\u2019s warning on the importance of onshore wind to Britain\u2019s climate budgets. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe Committee on Climate Change, their [the government\u2019s] own advisors, say if we are to stand any chance of meeting our climate change targets we need to at least double our renewable energy capacity. So it\u2019s vital that the UK government tells us what the future of onshore wind is going to be and that they simply allow it to compete in that energy market.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the government did not address the question of opening up subsidies to onshore wind but said: \u201cWe are fully committed to providing secure, affordable and clean energy for the UK\u2019s homes and businesses.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe renewables industry has been a strong success in Scotland thanks to UK government support. Last year we invested a record \u00a313bn in renewables across the UK, with Scotland continuing to benefit significantly from that support.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/20/onshore-windfarms-more-popular-than-thought-uk-poll-finds\">poll last month</a> found most people underestimate the support for onshore wind power, which is backed by 73% of the British public.</p>",

The ANC Women\u2019s League, which had vociferously defended Zuma during the rape trial, greeted her demise with an offer of routine condolences. The organisation\u2019s secretary general made a sheepish nod to an apology, observing in an interview that Kuzwayo had been <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2016-10-10-khwezi-was-brave-fearless-ancwl\">\u201cbrave and fearless\u201d</a> for coming forward with the accusation.</p> <p>Rape is notoriously difficult to prosecute.

However, you can be sure that Adorno \u2013 or, as he occasionally called himself, \u201cHektor Rottweiler\u201d, or \u201cHippo King\u201d \u2013 wouldn\u2019t have approved of Jeffries\u2019 jaunty writing style.</p> <p>This book is a group biography, which starts with the Jewish bourgeois childhoods shared by most of the school\u2019s protagonists, leading to some speculation about Oedipal motivations. This extends even to the manner in which the Institute of Social Research was formed, in the early 1920s. In Jeffries\u2019 telling, it was a gift from the world\u2019s largest grain trader, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weil\" title=\"\">Hermann Weil</a>, to his son, Felix. Although it had close links early on with the <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Marx-Engels Institute in Moscow</a>, there was a decision to avoid the controversial name \u201cInstitute of Marxism\u201d. The Institute for&#xa0;Social Research was a compromise choice, which didn\u2019t stop it being nicknamed \u201cCafe Marx\u201d.</p> <p>The school\u2019s early work, dominated by sociologist <a href=\"https://thecharnelhouse.org/2014/11/05/on-the-work-of-friedrich-pollock/\" title=\"\">Friedrich Pollock</a> and economist <a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/grossman/\" title=\"\">Henryk Grossman</a>, was devoted to unsurprising socialist subjects such as \u201cinternational trade unions, strikes, sabotage\u201d. Jeffries sketches Frankfurt in the 20s, caught between the progressive Weimar era and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/25/blitzed-norman-ohler-adolf-hitler-nazi-drug-abuse-interview\" title=\"\">the horrors that would follow</a>. The&#xa0;home of IG Farben and centre for modernist social housing, it would later become one of the major hubs of the Third Reich; Zyklon B was devised there. Franz Roeckle, the architect of the stripped classical HQ for this Jewish Marxist thinktank, was later a&#xa0;committed Nazi and murderer.</p> <p>The institute, with its private funding, stayed aloof both from the Social Democratic and Communist parties. \u201cAlready in 1923,\u201d when the organisation was formed, Jeffries tells us, \u201cGerman Marxism resembled the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WboggjN_G-4\" title=\"\">Judean People\u2019s movements in Monty Python\u2019s <em>Life of Brian</em></a>.\u201d Or not \u2013 given that it was divided into two mass parties with hundreds of thousands of members and millions of voters, a division based on genuine political differences. This moment indicates quite nicely the problems with this book: there\u2019s nothing inappropriate about pop cultural references, as readers of Adorno and Horkheimer\u2019s <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em> will appreciate \u2013 that book shifts from Immanuel Kant to Donald Duck and back. But it helps if they actually elucidate the point being made.</p> <p>Oddly, given how populist it is \u2013 an easy, witty, pacy read \u2013 <em>Grand Hotel Abyss</em> is weakest precisely on popular culture and the institute\u2019s engagement with it. This shift came when Horkheimer became the presiding force at&#xa0;the end of the 20s, moving it from political economy to, in&#xa0;his words, \u201claw, customs, fashion, public opinion, sports, leisure activities, lifestyle, etc\u201d. This is cultural Marxism as we know it.</p> <p>Mostly, however, Jeffries reproduces the standard idea of the institute standing in lofty judgment over mass culture, something that has long been questioned in studies such as Esther Leslie\u2019s <em>Hollywood Flatlands </em>or Frederick J Schwartz\u2019s <em>Blind Spots</em>. The&#xa0;two figures that were occasional residents in the grand hotel, Benjamin and Marcuse, are given their due as enduring influences on the new left and on student movements; but Horkheimer and Adorno remain the forbidding hotel managers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23e981b5c93067205ddfd801ec46ae5e2f0715ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23e981b5c93067205ddfd801ec46ae5e2f0715ae/0_0_1067_696/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heidelberg, 1964: Horkheimer, left, shakes hands with Adorno, as Habermas runs his hand through his hair in the background.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heidelberg, 1964: Horkheimer, left, shakes hands with Adorno, as Habermas runs his hand through his hair in the background.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeremy J.

Though the institute\u2019s inner circle escaped, eventually to California, Benjamin killed himself on the Spanish border, in fear of capture by the Gestapo. Some members even worked for the nascent CIA during the war.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Jeffries traces very well how the Frankfurt school was decisively affected by nazism, war and the Holocaust</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The institute had never had an official line on the USSR, but although some members, such as Grossman, and&#xa0;associates such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/apr/29/frankfurt-school-ernst-bloch-principle-of-hope\" title=\"\">Ernst Bloch</a> and Hanns Eisler, would go over to East Germany after 1945, most returned to the rebuilt school in the West. Jeffries is&#xa0;smart in outlining the compromises they made in the process. Adorno and Horkheimer claimed that they would have \u201clong since been killed\u201d had they opted for the GDR. Jeffries makes clear, though, that Horkheimer enforced, first on Benjamin in the late 30s, and later on the young Habermas in the 50s, a regime of mild censorship, coded language, subject avoidance and \u201cAesopian language\u201d that closely resembled the means by which critical Marxists such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/22/philosophy-1968-the-year-of-revolt\" title=\"\">Leszek Ko\u0142akowski</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/01/christa-wolf\" title=\"\">Christa Wolf</a> survived within the eastern bloc.</p> <p>Their reaction to the emergence in the 60s of an explicitly Marxist new left was ambiguous. Horkheimer was horrified, and committed himself to the American struggle against North Vietnam, while Adorno shifted from embracing the student movement to moving suddenly against it, calling the cops on an occupation, which elicited the famous \u201c<em>Busenaktion</em>\u201d when students bared their breasts at him. He&#xa0;died soon afterwards.</p> <p>Marcuse\u2019s attitude was different. Already, work such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eros_and_Civilization\" title=\"\"><em>Eros and Civilisation</em></a> showed a utopian optimism that contrasted with the sombre tone of Adorno\u2019s late writing; and when the student movement arrived, he told Adorno: \u201cI am willing to come to terms with patricide, even though it hurts sometimes.\u201d One of his students was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/dec/14/angela-davis-there-is-an-unbroken-line-of-police-violence-in-the-us-that-takes-us-all-the-way-back-to-the-days-of-slavery\" title=\"\">Angela Davis</a>, who is interviewed for the&#xa0;book; she tells Jeffries her writing on such singers as Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/billie-holiday\" title=\"\">Billie Holiday</a> was influenced by Marcuse\u2019s \u201cnotions of art as a semi-autonomous zone or another dimension where utopias could be imagined\u201d.</p> <p>From there, though, the temperature drops, as Habermas brings the institute closer to mainstream liberalism, favouring strong institutions and the rule of law. \u201cOnly an academic,\u201d Jeffries notes, \u201ccould find \u2018constitutional patriotism\u2019 inspiring.\u201d The Frankfurt school, which began as a means of spreading revolutionary values, or so its critics \u2013 and some of its supporters \u2013 would contend, became committed to the defence of European order.

  "<p>Rob Savours is looking forward to his big 60th birthday party later this month. He\u2019s not long back from a Mediterranean cruise and, what with his photography, gym sessions, coffee mornings and one-day-a-week job at a local factory, life is pretty full. Most importantly, though, it\u2019s a life he chooses for himself with the help of support workers, who ensure that his learning disability is no barrier to him exercising choice and control.<br></p> <p>\u201cI say what I want to do, and when I want to do it, and the staff will take me out,\u201d says Savours, who shares a house in Gorseinon, Swansea, with three other people with learning disabilities. \u201cWhere I was before I didn\u2019t have much of a social life. Now I have a good social life.\u201d</p> <p>Christian Cowap, who helps support Savours, says the key to his satisfaction and wellbeing is that he is treated as an individual who happens to have a disability. \u201cIt\u2019s about being open and honest, allowing him to take risks, to make mistakes, but enabling him to be a person in his own right. We\u2019re all of us going to come to a brick wall sooner or later, when we need a little bit of help, and we should treat others as we would want to be treated ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>Cowap is a support manager with <a href=\"https://www.communitylives.co.uk\">Community Lives Consortium</a> (CLC), a not-for-profit social enterprise that uses co-operative principles in its decision-making and management. The 300 people with care needs that it supports, most of whom have learning disabilities, are treated as partners in the way it operates. In the words of chief executive Rick Wilson, it is \u201da company run by people\u201d.</p> <p>The example of CLC is held up by the Welsh government as the kind of venture it wants to foster under a three-year programme, <a href=\"http://www.everyonesbusiness.coop/en/2016/02/29/care-to-co-operate-our-new-social-care-project/\">Care to Co-operate</a>, which aims to develop the role of co-operatives, social enterprises and consortia in the care system. The programme, being run by the Wales Co-Op Training and Development Centre, reflects growing interest in the potential of not-for-profit care co-operatives.</p> <p>According to the Co-ops UK network, there are 88 co-operatives in the UK delivering adult social care, with a combined annual turnover of almost \u00a3100m. Only 33 of these are in England, however, where they represent less than 1% of the total market.</p> <p>\u201cCo-ops are still happening, but very much at the margin of the system,\u201d admits James Wright, Co-Ops UK\u2019s policy offier. \u201cBut a lot of the most interesting and hopeful stuff is to be found around the margins at the moment, rather than at the centre.\u201d</p> <p>In a new appraisal of the care system, the Co-operative Party, the political arm of the co-operative movement, argues that the dominant for-profit model of care provision has impaired quality, undermined pay and conditions and reduced cost-effectiveness. By contrast, a co-operative approach would empower both people who need care and care workers, reduce profit \u201cleakage\u201d from the system and help create a sector fit for the demands of the ageing population.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/nov/02/social-care-threat-level-reaches-new-high\">Social care threat level reaches new high</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt is care recipients, their families and care workers who know how to create a care system that will deliver consistently high-quality care,\u201d says the party\u2019s report, <a href=\"https://party.coop/wp-content/blogs.dir/5/files/2016/09/taking-care-FINAL-web.pdf\">Taking Care</a>. \u201cThey should be allowed to lead the care sector.\u201d</p> <p>Wilson and CLC have been saying the same for years. The consortium was set up in 1989, initially as the West Glamorgan Housing Consortium, and it now employs some 770 staff to provide care and support to disabled people under contract to either Swansea or Neath Port Talbot councils.</p> <p>Could it grow farther afield? Wilson says it is \u201cprobably not\u201d interested in breaking into fresh territory \u2013 at least geographically. \u201cWhat we are interested in is breaking into new areas of capital and resources for change, supporting social care to become more efficient. There is increasing demand for care, but declining resources to meet that demand. If we rely on financial capital to do so, we are going to be pushed into a race to the bottom. So where do we find those other capitals?</p> <p>\u201cWhen you give the people you support a sense of ownership, they get quite skilled at knowing when things are not what they shouild be. They push us to use our resources ever more wisely.\u201d</p> <p>Of the 207 consortium members of CLC, 65 are people who receive support. Its 12-strong board of management includes two people who are supported, two family members (one of whom is chair) and two staff. Staff turnover is low by the standards of the sector: average length of stay is eight years and some staff have been with the consortium more than 20 years.</p> <p>\u201cWe call it \u2018social care\u2019 but in what way is it actually social?\u201d Wilson asks. \u201cWe are trying to think of it as \u2018social social care\u2019, not just enabling and supporting people to live together or in close proximity, but to do so in a way that uses their mutual skills, interests and ambitions.\u201d</p> <p>While CLC\u2019s history mirrors that of a number of care co-ops established 20-30 years ago, another group has emerged more recently as spin-outs from local authorities. Typical of these is <a href=\"http://www.leadinglives.org.uk\">Leading Lives</a> (LL), created in 2012 as a social enterprise and employee-owned co-operative from the former learning disabilty service of Suffok county council.</p> <p>A total of 390 staff transferred from the council on protected terms and conditions. Such has been the success of the venture that LL now employs 565 people, having taken over services provided by two other organisations, and has been making a surplus from day one for reinvestment \u2013 into annual staff bonuses (\u00a350 or \u00a3100 a time) and small grants to local community groups, amounting to \u00a375,000 and counting.</p> <p>Tony Carr, managing director, scoffs at any suggestion that LL has enjoyed preferential treatment from the county council. Although the co-op was awarded an initial three-year contract for services, when it came to re-tender it had to cut its price by 17% to win a two-year extension. Back-office costs have been reduced by 29% and staff recruited since 2012 are on inferior pension arrangements to those transferred across, and on different conditions, although Carr says their pay is \u201cpretty much the same\u201d.</p> <p>Growth has taken LL into new areas of work, with older people, those with physical disabilities and young people in transition from children\u2019s services, but the great majority of its 1,500 \u201ccustomers\u201d have learning disabilities. The organisation has also started to work in north-east Essex.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/nov/01/the-three-conversations-model-turning-away-from-long-term-care\">The 'three conversations' model: turning away from long-term care</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like CLC, it has a 12-strong board. But board members are all employees, nine of them elected, and external expertise is brought in at the top level only as and when required.</p> <p>Does that slow up decision-making and inhibit change? Far from it, says Carr. \u201cHaving spent 30 years in a local authority environment before this, I would say it\u2019s pretty nimble. The board meets once a month, but if we need an urgent decision we can call an extraordinary meeting. In four years we have done that twice. I can get a decision on the day if I really need to. I think that\u2019s quite agile.\u201d</p> <p>Carr believes co-ops could play a bigger role in the care sector, but sees them as only one model in an increasingly mixed economy. James Wright at Co-ops UK is equally measured in his expectations, looking to \u201creinsert\u201d a co-operative approach in some services that were outsourced direct to the private sector in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are desperately trying to find new ways of making the system work,\u201d says Wright. \u201cWe are part of that. And we are also part of getting the voluntary sector to operate in a more community-focused way. There is a lot of thinking going on, but such is the scale of the crisis that we do need to see more urgency.\u201d</p> <h2>Co-operative commissioning </h2> <p>Part of the transformation of care and health services in Plymouth was adoption of \u201cco-operative commissioning\u201d \u2013 the arrangement of services in association with care providers and those receiving care.</p> <p>Plymouth council described the practice as \u201can approach that puts citizens and outcomes at the centre of commissioning and creates stronger relationships between key stakeholders. [It] looks beyond cost and \u2018value for money\u2019 to put greater emphasis on the social costs and benefits of different ways to run services.\u201d</p> <p>The council\u2019s pioneering work is highlighted by the Co-operative Party in its report Taking Care. And although political control of the authority switched in May, its new Conservative leader, Ian Bowyer, insists it remains \u201cfully committed to co-operative commissioning principles\u201d.</p> <p>Bowyer says: \u201cAlthough we are not part of the co-operative councils network, this does not have any impact on our work around health and social care commissioning.\u201d</p> <h2>Care and Share Associates: \u2018Giving people a stake taps into their creativity\u2019</h2> <p>One of the biggest social care co-ops traces its origins back to the 1970s, when there was a burst of enthusiasm for workers\u2019 control in many sectors of the economy.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.casaltd.com/\">Care and Share Associates (Casa)</a>, which provides homecare across the north of England, was set up in 2004 but grew out of <a href=\"http://www.sunderlandhomecare.co.uk/\">Sunderland Home Care Associates (SHCA)</a>, which in turn came from Sunderlandia, a pioneering building co-operative set up in 1973.</p> <p>One of Casa\u2019s founders, Margaret Elliott, was married to a bricklayer who worked for Sunderlandia. She had the idea for a women\u2019s co-operative, Little Women, which opened first a food shop and nursery in 1976 and then, in 1983, a home help agency. A decade later, SHCA won its first council homecare contract.</p> <p>Although Elliott was instrumental in establishing Casa, which is based in Newcastle upon Tyne, SHCA has remained separate and continues to operate successfully. But Casa has grown from scratch to employ more than 850 people, who are also its owners; it provides 20,000 hours of care a week in the north-east, north-west and Leeds and has an annual turnover of \u00a314m.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve tapped into people\u2019s natural creativity and commitment by giving them a stake in their business,\u201d says Guy Turnbull, Casa\u2019s managing director and co-founder.</p> <p>The co-op sets recruits from, and invests in, low-income communities and has a strong track record of helping people break out of long-term unemployment, Turnbull says. Training is provided by the Casa Academy and employees are guaranteed a minimum 16 hours\u2019 work a week, holiday and sick pay and, after six months\u2019 probation, a profit share.</p> <p>Not that there is much profit to be made in the care market at the moment. \u201cWe\u2019re hardly making anything currently,\u201d Turnbull admits, \u201cbut because we don\u2019t have external shareholders, and we\u2019re backed by [social investor] Big Issue Invest, we don\u2019t have to make a 10% return like others do.\u201d DB</p>",

Refugees in Jordan are not permitted to work as teachers, civil servants or any other state-supported job, with the tourism business closed to them as well. So, too, is free schooling after grade 9 (aged 16), which denies most the chance to get their high school diploma \u2013 a ticket into the formal labour market.</p> <p>Running a viable business in a refugee camp is no easy task, Ventura concedes. For many women in the camp, simply persuading their husbands to allow them to work can represent a cultural challenge. Technological literacy is also low, so SEP\u2019s inventory and production processes remain largely un-computerised. </p> <p>An even bigger headache is red tape. All the fabric needed has to be imported but customs clearance procedures are \u201cbeyond nightmarish\u201d, says Venture. On top of that, courier companies frequently refuse to transport goods to and from the camp, deeming it too dangerous for their drivers. <br> </p> <p>Three years in and SEP\u2019s field team of five full-time staff plus a small management team in Geneva (which includes Ventura and her husband) have more or less navigated through the production challenges.

Under the Montreal Protocol of 1987, countries agreed to phase out gases known to be harmful to the ozone layer. Some of the substitutes, however, turned out to be much more potent than carbon dioxide in warming the planet.</p> \n<p>Under a new addition to that agreement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/15/climate-change-environmentalists-hail-deal-to-limit-use-of-hydrofluorocarbons\">countries around the world have agreed to remove the harmful HFCs</a> used in some air-conditioning and refrigeration systems. If fully implemented, this could result in a 0.5C reduction in future warming. Given the goal set in Paris for limiting global temperature rises to 2C, this would make a significant difference to the world\u2019s actions on climate change if it is fully endorsed. Phasing out the relevant chemicals may take much of the rest of the decade, however, and could face resistance in some industries.</p> \n<p>Solheim urged countries to embark on more ambitious programmes to improve energy efficiency, increase the amount of energy coming from renewable sources, and look to meet the national targets they set in Paris.</p>",

That\u2019s why I am joining the strike in Spain. Our eight-year-old regularly brings home with her nearly two hours\u2019 of work, which she has been given for the following day. It mostly involves copious amounts of copying from a book. As a group of concerned parents we have tried to have a formal discussion with the head and teachers from our children\u2019s school, but we were told they didn\u2019t have time to meet us. I hope the strike will be a starting point for discussion about the type and amount of homework set. </p> <p>I feel the current amount of homework leaves little or no time for children to relax, pursue other interests, play or be with family. My son gets very tired and bored doing this work and isn\u2019t efficient at all. I\u2019m not sure by the end of it he has learnt anything; he just goes through the motions to get it done and misses on playing outside. It affects the whole family because we cannot leave the house until it\u2019s done, and often this means that we miss trips to the park or afternoon walks etc. I don\u2019t think children should just repeat class bookwork after school. I would like to see more creative homework as a follow-up to what is learnt at school: identifying local trees, collecting rock/leaf/shell samples, baking, modelling etc.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e1c66fe5f9076c8291c74a922318b7a6f7ec8ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e1c66fe5f9076c8291c74a922318b7a6f7ec8ad/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A girl plays with a pencil as she does her homework in Ronda, southern Spain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A girl plays with a pencil as she does her homework in Ronda, southern Spain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Nazca/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Utpalavajri, 43, from Shrewsbury: \u2018I understand why there\u2019s a strike in Spain.

It\u2019s understandable that he wants to let off steam when he\u2019s been working all day.<br></p> <p>At the beginning of the year they were set a challenge of reading 10 minutes every night and then writing about the characters in the book. On top of this, the children have to do spelling every night. My oldest boy doesn\u2019t really like reading the books he gets at school, he prefers his own choices and when he reads them he can sit and do it for hours. I feel by forcing him to read certain books I am just ruining his love of reading, which is a shame.<br></p> <p>I don\u2019t think children should have to do homework in primary school, it\u2019s not necessary. They spend all day working and they should be able to rest and take in the world around them when they get home. I remember telling a teacher that I didn\u2019t think my eldest needed to do spelling every night as he picked up words quickly and she said perhaps I could get him to write synonyms instead. I thought, why? Does he really need to know these big words at eight? There\u2019s so much pressure on him to do all this extra work and he feels that too. My older son gets stressed and cries, worrying that he won\u2019t get a certificate or complete the reading challenge etc.<br></p> <p>I completely understand why there is a homework strike in Spain.

The Country School is progressive and learning happens in a very hands-on way in the classroom. The lack of rote homework creates an environment that really fosters our son\u2019s curiosity and leads him to be more inquisitive about topics that interest him after school.</p> <p>We are able to have a lot more positive interaction as a family and our son is able to engage in various activities after school, formal or informal, without the pressure of running home to do homework. We all spend time together in the evenings having conversations on a wide variety of topics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c94cf69ffa9e463cb59052e9833e10497905ccd8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c94cf69ffa9e463cb59052e9833e10497905ccd8/0_0_5100_3393/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children playing in park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Our son is able to engage in various activities after school, formal or informal.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Craig Turp, 44, from Romania: \u2018My son often stays up until midnight finishing off homework\u2019</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5ead8066e4bef1152200ef1b9fb64f57e9592ac7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ead8066e4bef1152200ef1b9fb64f57e9592ac7/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Craig Turp\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>We live in Bucharest and our children go to a state school. Our eldest is in class eight (age 14, last year of middle school) and gets hours upon hours of homework every night. Often he is still awake at midnight finishing it. This is not unusual here: the Romanian education system is obsessed with homework.</p> <p>What exacerbates the issue is that my son\u2019s school is oversubscribed (it\u2019s very good) so his classes run from 12pm to 6pm \u2013 junior classes have the building in the morning. Once my son Max has got home, eaten, relaxed, there is not much time left for homework or anything else, which is why he can still often be scribbling away at midnight. Even then, he often has to get up early in the morning to finish homework.</p> <p>The work set is very hard. Maths in particular is at a level way beyond that of 14-year-olds in the UK. What\u2019s more, occasionally he is expected to tackle problems that he has not even been shown how to do in class. An hour a night to revise what was learnt in class is enough extracurricular work. </p> <h2>Zainab, 39, from London: \u2018My son is constantly stressed about work and no longer sees learning as fun\u2019</h2> <p>My child is six and she gets set about six hours of homework to do a week. The workload is heavy and unnecessary. Revision books have been handed out \u2013 I didn\u2019t even know there were revision books for six-year-olds. My son is expected to spend hours and hours researching a topic such as the first world war for a poster. This takes up a lot of time and my son ends up gaining nothing from it besides stress and a lack of sleep. </p> <p>I understand that it is important for children to be aware of current affairs or of any historical events but too much is expected of them and, as a child, he should be able to treasure the innocence of youth before being introduced to the brutality of a corrupt world. He is also set weekly homework booklets based on questions that are usually very difficult for him. </p> <p>He is constantly stressed. Last year, in year 1, there were end of year assessments that they were expected to \u201crevise\u201d for. As a five-year-old he was confused and constantly paranoid about failing the exam. He began comparing himself with other students in the class and would say that he would not pass or would tell us about some of his friends who didn\u2019t end up passing. All this means that he doesn\u2019t view learning as fun or engaging anymore \u2013 he sees it as a task that defines how he is perceived.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f624407edb03e9ea2a29ee24179d85a91e5092df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f624407edb03e9ea2a29ee24179d85a91e5092df/0_195_3616_2171/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boy working on computer at night\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My son often stays up until midnight finishing off homework.<strong>\u2019</strong></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ossi Lehtonen/REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Alex, 37, from Swansea: \u2018My child gets little homework and the stuff they do get set is really easy. I want more\u2019</h2> <p>My child is 12 and I don\u2019t think they get too much homework. The difficulty of work has dropped significantly, even in the past 20 years. My child has very little homework and there is no follow-up when they don\u2019t do it. It seems like it is optional. </p> <p>What\u2019s more, when they do get homework it is a struggle to get them to sit down to do it because they are not used to it and know they won\u2019t get in trouble if they don\u2019t do it. Homework often requires internet access and a printer, and the standard of the set tasks is poor. It can also lead to my child playing games online as they are surfing the web. I think three to five hours a week of homework is the ideal amount, but at the moment they only get one hour. </p> <h2>Edward, 38, from London: \u2018I get just as stressed about my daughter\u2019s homework as she does\u2019</h2> <p>The emphasis on the work my children bring home is too much. I understand regular reading, but the other type of work they get is too much. At the moment I am working in Denmark and when I say my six-year-old has homework they look at me like I\u2019m crazy. The Danish don\u2019t give young children homework and their kids seem fine. Children spend the day in school, get out and then have fun. My six-year-old is also often asked to do things that need to be managed by us, so go on the internet or do quite complicated tasks. This means homework can become stressful for parents too. She is never set tasks that she can just sit down and get on with on her own.</p> <p>I get just as stressed about my daughter\u2019s homework as she does. We feel the need to make sure she doesn\u2019t miss out on anything and fall behind and sometimes it can lead to arguments. I don\u2019t think homework should be banned altogether but I do think that there should be less. Reading books for 10-15 minutes every evening is one thing, but other homework that requires a lot of parental interaction causes stress. Some of the arts and crafts tasks my daughter has been set are seriously complicated, for example she was recently asked to make a 3D pyramid and cube out of paper. How is a six-year-old expected to do that on her own? It\u2019s all well and good but it takes time.</p>",
  "<p>A \u00a3285m airport built on a remote South Atlantic island with UK government cash will require \u201can open chequebook\u201d if it is to ever welcome commercial airlines as planned, a select committee hearing has been told. <br></p> <p>Plans to build a clifftop runway on St Helena were approved in 2010 by then ministers Andrew Mitchell and William Hague, making it the single largest investment made in an overseas territory. But its inauguration ceremony for commercial flights was suspended indefinitely in May after tests showed that planes could be blown off course. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jun/09/planes-unable-to-land-at-285m-cliff-top-airport-on-island-of-st-helena\">St Helena airport costing \u00a3285m of UK money is delayed over safety concerns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Wednesday, civil servants from the Department for International Development (DfID) were unable to tell the public accounts committee why they had not tested for wind shear \u2013 a sudden powerful change in wind direction that can destabilise large aircraft \u2013 before the airport was built. Meg Hillier, the chair of the committee, said more public money would have to be spent if the airport was to ever function for the island\u2019s 4,000 inhabitants.</p> <p>One of the more drastic options that has been considered and rejected by officials was to blow the top off two mountains adjoining the airfield, the committee was told. The more likely option to make the airport useable would be to allow smaller planes to fly to the island instead of the planned Boeing 737s. </p> <p>Hillier said civil servants had already spent money allocated to them to make the airport useable. \u201cGiven that there is a UK commitment to the Saints [inhabitants of St Helena] and they are UK citizens, given that it is your responsibility and DfID\u2019s to make that happen, and given that there is an airport there, it does seem that there is frankly an open chequebook because you have spent all that good money and you aren\u2019t going to get anything for it,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Mark Lowcock, DfID\u2019s permanent secretary, told the committee repeatedly that he would prefer not to say who might be to blame for failing to discover the strong winds at the airport because of an ongoing internal review. </p> <p>He said officials were in talks with carriers about launching flights, but it would involve much smaller planes than previously envisaged. </p> <p>Stephen Phillips, a Conservative committee member, pointed out to Lowcock that in the 19th century the anthropologist Charles Darwin in his travel journal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Voyage_of_the_Beagle\">The Voyage of the Beagle</a> referred to the wind shear on St Helena. </p> <p>\u201cDarwin wrote this: \u2018The only inconveniences I experienced on my walks [on St Helena] were from the impetuous winds. One day I noticed a curious circumstance: standing on the edge of a plain, terminated by a great cliff of about a thousand feet in depth, I saw at the distance of a few yards right to windward, some tern, struggling against a very strong breeze, whilst, where I stood, the air was quite calm.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cIf Charles Darwin, as he does in this passage, gives a very good example of wind shear in St Helena in 1836, how have we got a position where DfID commissioned a \u00a3285.5m airport, paid for by the British taxpayer, without appreciating the danger of wind shear?\u201d</p> <p>Lowcock replied: \u201cThat is a very good question, and one I will attempt to answer in my review.\u201d </p> <p>Phillips also raised the possible option, mentioned in previous media reports, of blowing up the tops of two mountains. \u201cI have the greatest respect for the civil service but I did not realise that it could move mountains,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Lowcock replied: \u201cIt is not my plan currently to spend a lot of money exploring that option. My plan is to put in place a safe air service.\u201d </p> <p>Caroline Flint, the former Labour minister, asked Lowcock if he was aware that the businessman and former Conservative donor Lord Ashcroft had argued in favour of the airport weeks before it was approved by ministers. Lowcock replied that he had not been approached by Ashcroft. </p> <p>Ministers are resisting offering any compensation to those who made investments on the basis that up to 30,000 tourists would fly to visit the remote island. At present, it takes a five-day trip by ship to reach St Helena from southern Africa. </p> <p>One airline, Atlantic Star, on Wednesday urged the government to discuss a rapid introduction of \u201ca much-needed air service\u201d in and out of St Helena. Its proposal would involve using a specialist Avro RJ100 jet, with the airline able to begin flights next spring.</p> <p>The airline ran a test flight to St Helena on 21 October.

In person he\u2019s energetic and flamboyant, with a penchant for driving yet meandering conversation. </p> <p>The Terranauts, his 26th<em> </em>book, fictionalizes a notable 90s Arizona experiment. Eight scientists, coined the Terranauts, lived under glass in E2, a model of a possible off-Earth colony. Their closed, three-acre compound encompassed five biomes \u2013 rainforest, savanna, desert, ocean and marsh \u2013 to sustain them over two years.

He takes a spoonful of his lunchtime cereal. \u201cWar and climate change and some microbe will decimate us and we\u2019ll go back to The Road or The Road Warrior or some scenario like this and maybe build another civilization again.

  "<p>The first voter I heard mention Donald Trump\u2019s name was a mechanic in a small town near my upstate New York home. It was days after Trump announced his run, and I was at the start of a drive across the United States.</p> <p>The man, like many Trump supporters then, didn\u2019t want his name used or his picture taken. An outraged press was loudly mocking Trump and he was embarrassed. But he was clear why he would vote for Trump. \u201cThere\u2019s no American dream for anyone who isn\u2019t a lawyer or banker,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone else, we are getting a raw deal.

I continued my drives around the US and saw a feedback develop: the loud distaste voiced against Trump by who they saw as \u201cthe establishment\u201d only added to his appeal.</p> <p>Florence Johnson, 69, was like that.

He is putting on a great show, pissing them other bastards off. They deserve it!\u201d </p> <p>Natchitoches was like many other towns with their share of enthusiastic Trump supporters. It had suffered a devastating economic downturn in the 1970s and 1980s when the cotton gin mills closed. Other than jobs related to the state university, it has since offered little opportunity. Those in town whose lives were not connected to the university lifeline were the Trump voters. </p> <p>Well, the white people in town. Natchitoches, like the US, has long been divided along racial lines, with black residents confined to a lesser choice of jobs, homes, and schools.

Many residents often fail to go beyond high school, and if they do, it is an education cobbled together by night classes and community colleges, together with a concoction of loans, programs and overwhelming debt. </p> <p>All of this is humiliating and painful, and has made the perfect setting for populist politics built on blaming minorities and immigrants. And that is what Trump has exploited. He has come into these communities with white identity politics, a message that is both simple and loud: He will make America great again.</p> <p>It is a message that resonates, because viewed from these places, America no longer seems a great country.</p>",
  "<p>Once a week, troubled children in Plymouth battling emotional problems can slip out of lessons and speak to a mental health professional \u2013 at their own school.</p> <p>Teams of mental health staff started working across 27 secondary schools in September as part of an early-intervention scheme aimed at supporting city youngsters when they need help. Backed up by counsellors, the teams offer a wide-ranging package of support including talking therapies and play therapy.</p> <p>The \u00a31.2m project, one of the first of its kind, comes at a time of growing concern over children\u2019s mental health. Figures revealed last month by the Guardian showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/03/quarter-of-a-million-children-receiving-mental-health-care-in-england\">almost 250,000 under-19s in England are receiving NHS mental health care</a>. The Plymouth scheme aims to build resilience in youngsters before problems escalate.</p> <p>The scheme stems from a partnership between schools, the city council and the local NHS, in the form of child and adolescent mental health services and the Northern, Eastern and Western Devon clinical commissioning group (CCG). They have pooled their budgets to co-commission the schools service from a range of providers.</p> <p>Developed in consultation with young people and parents, the initiative is the latest product of a quiet revolution in Plymouth that is integrating a range of services with the aim of improving the local population\u2019s health and wellbeing.</p> <p>In April last year, the council and CCG set up an integrated finance system for wellbeing, covering a large range of services including not just health and social care, but also leisure, housing and education. It was a radical move by the city\u2019s debt-laden health and care system and, as its leaders say, one that benefitted from flying \u201cunder the radar\u201d of central government: by not being part of any national integration programmes, the city agencies can follow their ambitions in their own way and at their own pace.</p> <p>What distinguishes Plymouth\u2019s integration journey are the barriers that have been faced and overcome. The CCG is not \u201cco-terminous\u201d with the council \u2013 in other words, it has different boundaries \u2013 and it has been in severe financial distress, with one of the worst records for hospital discharge in the country. The council, meanwhile, has undergone political upheaval \u2013 Labour lost control last year to a Conservative/Ukip alliance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/nov/01/the-three-conversations-model-turning-away-from-long-term-care\">The 'three conversations' model: turning away from long-term care</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet demand for services is soaring \u2013 the city\u2019s population of 261,000 is expected to pass 300,000 by 2031 \u2013 and it was a determination to find new ways of working that prompted the setting up of the cradle-to-grave, integrated fund, as well as the creation of Livewell South West, an integrated community health and adult social care provider.</p> <p>The result has been significant and encouraging improvements in services in the first year, with joint and co-located teams carrying out single assessments of people\u2019s needs and a reduction in hospital stays. However, the ambitions go much further.</p> <p>\u201cPlymouth has been in Torbay\u2019s shadow for too long,\u201d says Gerry Clough, chief operating officer at the CCG, referring to neighbouring Torbay\u2019s reputation for integrating health and social care. \u201cThere was a feeling we wanted to do something on integration. We have adopted the slogan \u2018one system, one budget\u2019 \u2013 the right care, at the right time at the right place.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is distinct about Plymouth is that we started a programme of integration of health and wellbeing and didn\u2019t want to limit it. We have widened it as much as possible.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not a \u2018pioneer\u2019 or \u2018vanguard\u2019, which means we have been off the radar. This has allowed us to retain local control and ambition and meant we have had nobody measuring what we are doing and nobody to report to.\u201d</p> <p>By pooling resources, the council and the CCG created a net integrated fund of \u00a3483m \u2013 cash that could be spent on four aims: improving health and wellbeing outcomes; reducing health inequalities; improving people\u2019s experience of care; and improving the sustainability of health and wellbeing. This meant setting up an integrated commissioning board and creating Livewell South West, which, in turn, necessitated the transfer of more than 170 council staff.</p> <p>In the first 12 months, services were changed dramatically, as money was directed into new models of care and support. The city\u2019s urgent-care system was transformed (see below) and new initiatives were launched to support people with chronic illnesses, avoid unnecessary hospital admissions and help them continue living independently for as long as possible. Dementia diagnoses rose 12% and dementia-friendly services were opened across the city.</p> <p>A special \u201cplace of safety\u201d was set up for vulnerable adults and children who would previously have ended up in custody, while an \u201cearly-help gateway\u201d for children and young people brought quicker assessment of need.</p> <p>With integration entering its second year, change continues apace. Following the launch of mental health support in Plymouth\u2019s schools, there are now plans to reduce the number of children in care by offering more early help to families.</p> <p>However, there is a recognition that effective change doesn\u2019t happen overnight. Carol Burgoyne, the council\u2019s strategic director for people, says: \u201cIt really takes time to change the way of doing things. We are tackling some really challenging topics \u2013 like how we deliver emotional and health wellbeing of young people. It is important to get things right, which can take extra time, and involves the co-design of services.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/nov/02/children-with-positive-care-experience-outperform-at-school\">Children with positive care experience outperform at school</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe fact that we delivered an integrated budget in our first year is incredible and is thanks to the sheer commitment of staff. We have lots of stories here: integration has made a real difference to people. If staff can see that things make a difference, it makes them want to go even further.\u201d</p> <p>Clough thinks that the achievements of the past 18 months have been the highlight of his career. Yet he says that the journey is only just beginning.</p> <p>\u201cHospital discharge procedures have shown a steady improvement, with the area going from having one of the worst records for delayed discharge to just below average. This has been achieved without extra funding, but through recycling money and creating integrated discharge teams.</p> <p>\u201cThere is still more to be done, but there is a huge amount of creative thinking. What has happened has been remarkable. I have spent most of my life talking about meeting short-term targets.

Staffed by a multi-disciplinary health and social care team, the GP-led unit offers a range of onsite investigations, from X-rays to full blood screening, as well as intravenous rehydration, oxygen therapy and access to mobility equipment and aids for daily living. </p> <p>With eight beds, eight treatment chairs and high- and low-observation areas, the clinic \u2013 set up on the principle of \u201ckeeping care closer to home\u201d \u2013 is open seven days a week and can offer treatment for up to 72 hours.</p> <p>It is just one of a number of Livewell South West urgent care services aimed at supporting people with acute conditions to stay in their own homes and prevent inappropriate emergency hospital admissions. Other services include a community crisis response team - a multi-disciplinary squad that offers access to physiotherapy, occupational therapy and social work to people in their own homes \u2013 and an acute care team, which carries out tests and medical investigations for diagnosis in the home and can provide intravenous therapy.</p> <p>For patients such as Willis, who has a recent history of falls and walks with a frame, the Robin hub offers a calm and reassuring environment. Many of its patients are old and may, like her, be seen after a fall. </p> <p>As if to prove that the hub is not about diverting people from hospital at all costs, it emerges that Willis does need hospital treatment \u2013 but for a skin infection, not the fall \u2013 and she is admitted to Derriford hospital, where she stays for a fortnight before being discharged to Mount Gould district hospital for rehabilitation. </p> <p>Now back in her bungalow in Plympton, where she has lived on her own for five years, Willis has nothing but praise for the care she received. \u201cWhat happened was a bit of a shock, but all the staff at Robin were very helpful,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was very relaxing.

  "<p>Spanish parents are revolting \u2013<a href=\"https://www.thelocal.es/20160923/spanish-parents-to-go-on-strike-over-too-much-homework\"> against homework</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.ceapa.es/\">CEAPA</a> (which represents 12,000 parent/teacher organisations) is organising protests against what it claims is too much homework set by schools. A recent survey revealed that 82% of parents asked believed it was too much or excessive. Over half thought it harmed family life. And with a few caveats, I couldn\u2019t agree more with their complaint.</p> <p>Interestingly, compared with other countries, the <em>estudiantes</em> have it relatively easy.

Finnish pupils dodge the bullet with a skinny 2.8 hours. Shanghai clobbers its students with 13.8 hours (so they know what it feels like to be a teacher, I imagine). The UK doles out a comparatively palatable 4.9 hours. Given that <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/pisa/\">Programme for International Student Assessment</a> chart-toppers Finland and Shanghai appear at either end of this survey, there doesn\u2019t appear to be a clear link between length of homework set and systemic grade outcomes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-grammar-school-selection-middle-class\">Theresa May\u2019s grammar school nostalgia is heartfelt - but wrong | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So what does the research say about it? A 2001 <a href=\"https://www.nfer.ac.uk/publications/HWK01/HWK01.pdf\">meta-study</a> by the National Foundation for Educational Research concluded that there was \u201ca positive relationship between time spent and outcomes at secondary level\u201d but \u201cevidence at primary level is inconsistent\u201d. And even at secondary, homework \u201cexplains only a small amount of variance in pupils\u2019 achievement\u201d. More recently John Hattie\u2019s seminal <a href=\"https://headguruteacher.com/2012/10/21/homework-what-does-the-hattie-research-actually-say/\">Visible Learning study</a> concluded that homework overall had an effect size of 0.29 \u2013 in other words, a very small impact. He too noted a difference between the effect on young pupils (0.15, minuscule) and older children (0.64, significant). Other studies <a href=\"http://classtap.pbworks.com/f/Does+Homework+Improve+Achievement.pdf\">concur</a>. So if there is at least some utility, are the Spanish parents right to rebel?</p> <p>Si. Because there is a huge variance between the effect different types of homework have on students. And homework differs from classwork in many ways. It\u2019s normally done independently of supervision; it requires that the task is understood, and that all resources to complete the task (from IT to prior, understood knowledge) are availableThe student needs uninterrupted time and space to finish it, and the qualities of character to complete it. Obviously, mileage varies enormously in all of these categories. In a classroom you can attempt to create a controlled environment where conditions are optimised for everyone\u2019s benefit. But setting homework is an act of faith about what will return; a boomerang thrown into the darkness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cd0a207cad2b2d9766f76d8881ecae19c30c16e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cd0a207cad2b2d9766f76d8881ecae19c30c16e/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Girl doing homework\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Homework by candlelight in San Cristobal, Venezuela.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Eduardo Ramirez/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Plus, some homework is useful, and some is not. One thing that amazed me when I entered teaching was how much homework appeared to be entirely mad, and set for little purpose beyond bureaucracy. Writing a poem about how you felt about litter was one of my favourites, but there were countless other examples. Writing a letter from Jesus about what it was like to be on the cross. Making \u201cwanted\u201d posters for Mr Hyde for English teachers. Colouring in the Great Fire of London for history. Writing scripts for roleplays about Greek medicine. Building volcanoes out of papier mache for geography. I mean, come on. These kind of activities indicate a purposelessness that we need to say goodbye to for ever in teaching. Set meaningful homework, or not at all. It\u2019s their time you\u2019re wasting.</p> <p>For example, asking pupils to read independently is great, and useful at most ages, although by itself it won\u2019t help someone struggling with the basics. It demonstrates what is called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect\">Matthew effect</a>: to those that already have, shall be given. In other words it\u2019s the children with poor background knowledge or difficult home environments who benefit least from it, and the most fortunate who get any effect at all. Which isn\u2019t an argument against homework, but a reminder that when you set it, you have to be aware of the different impacts it can have.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/nov/03/my-son-works-until-midnight-parents-around-the-world-on-homework\">'My son works until midnight': parents around the world on homework</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course the teacher\u2019s lens is important here too: homework produces marking. And if you set it, the student deserves constructive feedback. But if you see 200+ children as a secondary humanities teacher every week, weekly marking becomes a Sisyphean task. Even flicking and ticking the toils of that number of pupils becomes an extra day out of your week. And the effect of such minimal feedback is microscopic at best. Given that this might burn anything up to 25% of your notional working life, it\u2019s heart-breaking, not to mention pointless.</p> <p>Finally, the parents\u2019 view: homework steals family time that doesn\u2019t get refunded elsewhere in the week. And that is indisputably true, and the theft is compounded when the return is so small in general. Those few hours between getting home and closing your eyes are precious to the inter-family relationship. If you\u2019re going to steal any of that, you better be damn sure that the reward is greater than the loss. And for a lot of homework, for a lot of children, it just doesn\u2019t add up. <em>Abajo el sistema opresor</em> \u2013 down with the oppressor \u2013 as they say in Spain.</p>",
  "<p>Sarah Todd always sensed a gap in her ability to offer all-round care to residents in the nursing home where she works. As a senior care worker, she knew what to do if somebody had a stroke or heart attack, but she sometimes felt at a loss with routine nursing care, like changing a dressing or giving medicines.</p> <p>\u201cI did the best with the training that I had and what you think you should be doing,\u201d says Todd. \u201cBut I would have to ring the district nurse for advice and they can\u2019t always come in there and then.\u201d</p> <p>But all that has changed since Todd qualified as a nursing assistant \u2013 a new hybrid role which sits between senior care assistant and registered nurse.

The first 1,000 trainees will be recruited by the end of the year, with another 1,000 to follow in a second cohort. Training is expected to take two years.</p> <p>Todd predicts that most of these associates will go to the acute sector, doing little to lift the pressures in homes. \u201cI think the role may be more geared towards acute trusts. Care is a different environment to health and maybe we need a different approach. It\u2019s also going to take some time [for this new role] to reach fruition. The problem is facing us here and now and we can\u2019t wait for other people to come up with solutions.\u201d</p> <p>New career paths are also being developed for care and support staff working with children and families.

At the time it was called the Bert Kelly Research Centre, where there were some ultra-conservative outfits as tenants, including Cory Bernardi\u2019s Conservative Leadership Foundation, the Samuel Griffith Society (dedicated to upholding the constitution!), the Australian Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance and Menzies House, plus Family First. Books by the likes of David Flint and Ian Plimer were launched from the Fullarton Road property.</p> <p>Bert Kelly, a free trade Liberal member of parliament from 1958 to 1977 and the original author of the Financial Review\u2019s Modest Member column, would be turning in his grave if he knew what was being carried on in his name. </p> <p>It was from here in 2010 that Day set about rebuilding Family First, which at that stage looked like the political arm of the Assemblies of God parishioners in Adelaide. His aim was to remodel the party along the same organisational lines as his Homestead Homes business \u2013 ie, Builder Bob in charge of everything, which might have something to do with the current mess.</p> <p>There were other hairy issues in the party\u2019s post-Steve Fielding era, with attempted preference deals between Family First and the Australian Sex party, and tweets from a Queensland Family First member <a href=\"http://m.theage.com.au/federal-election/sex-debt-and-heads-that-roll-a-family-saga-of-biblical-proportions-20100814-12489.html\">equating gay marriage to \u201clegalising child abuse\u201d. </a></p> <p>The party had racked up $200,000 in debts, including money owned to members of Family First\u2019s executive committee. Up to that point the party\u2019s main financial backer was Peter Harris, <a href=\"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/business/sa-business-journal/west-lakes-apartment-developer-falls-into-receivership-with-877-million-debts/story-e6fredel-1225997522890\">whose building development companies went into liquidation</a> in 2010-11.</p> <p>The dangers of Family First depending on property developers was a lesson that should have been learned in 2010, which proves once again that the godly are not possessed of special insights. While Day has been comfortably warming a Senate seat the customers of companies he controls have been complaining about shoddy workmanship and semi-completed homes.</p> <p>Day says he would \u201crelish the opportunity to get to the high court\u201d and is clinging to Garfield Barwick\u2019s 1975 interpretation in Webster\u2019s case of <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/~/link.aspx?_id=074367F0015D42C2B005207F5642376A&amp;_z=z#chapter-01_part-04_44\">s.44(v) of the constitution. </a></p> <p>As he was fond of doing with the Tax Act, Barwick constructed the constitutional protection so narrowly as to make it useless. He found that a family company of Senator James Webster (Nat. Vic), which had been contracted to supply timber to the government was not in breach of section 44(v) because they were not standing contracts, rather arrangements to supply from time to time.</p> <p>This seems to fly in the face of the <a href=\"http://www.aec.gov.au/about_aec/Publications/Backgrounders/s44-constitution.htm\">purpose of the parliamentary eligibility provision of the constitution</a> which is designed to disqualify candidates whose conflicts of loyalty risk affecting their performance. </p> <p>Day was actually in the <a href=\"https://jade.io/article/475980\">high court this year</a> in a doomed challenge to the new Senate voting amendments. It led the then solicitor general, Justin Gleeson, to remark to Chief Justice Robert French that Day\u2019s challenge to the law effectively was also a challenge to the process by which he was elected to the Senate in 2013. <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/HCATrans/2016/73.html  http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/HCATrans/2016/73.html  http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/HCATrans/2016/73.html\">Here\u2019s Gleeson in March 2016</a> at a preliminary round in the high court: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They [the submissions] have the rather startling proposition that Senator Day is, in fact, not Senator Day, he is Mr Day. He has been sitting invalidly in the Senate for the last three years. No legislation has validly been passed by the Senate. Now, why \u2013 I will call him Senator Day \u2013 would leave it until, as it were, five minutes to midnight before this election to bring before this court three arguments which impugn his own position as a senator has been left totally unexplained.</p> </blockquote> <p>To press the point, the chief justice asked Day\u2019s counsel, Peter King: \u201cBut do you accept that you are challenging the validity of a process of voting in Senate elections which has been in place for many years, long before the current amendment?\u201d</p> <p>In other words, the solicitor general and the chief justice were of the view at that point that the logical extension of Day\u2019s argument was that he was ineligible to sit from the moment he was elected in September 2013. These are not the same grounds for ineligibility that are now in contention, but nonetheless show that Day had long been confused about his entitlement to sit as a senator. </p> <p>As for Rod Culleton, if he does appear in the high court it promises to be memorable. <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/decoding-15-quotes-from-one-nation-senator-rod-culletons-hilarious-press-conference-20161102-gsgjee.html\">He told the media yesterday</a> in the hokey, blokey, bush-wacking tone of One Nation: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m not sure whether I\u2019m gonna participate in any high court jurisdiction and if I do I\u2019ll simply go down, shear a sheep and take the belly fleece and stick it over my head and represent myself, because I\u2019m a true Australian standing up for the Australian people.</p> </blockquote> <p>Oi, oi, oi. </p>",

  "<p>I first set foot in <a href=\"http://www.thegreenbackyard.com/\">The Green Backyard</a> in May 2014, when the threat of a proposed development on the site by its owner, <a href=\"https://www.peterborough.gov.uk/\">Peterborough city council</a>, was imminent. While that threat is ongoing, the voices that resist it are stronger still.</p> <p>The Green Backyard is situated on a publicly owned, 2.3-acre strip of land in Peterborough city centre. Founded in 2009 by Renny Antonelli and his daughter Sophie, it has been transformed with the help of volunteers from a former derelict allotment site into a thriving community growing project.</p> <p>But this is not simply a place of rest and repose from which to escape the world. It is a site for critical thought and action, in which democratic struggles for the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/19/right-city-social-movement-transforming-urban-space\">right to the city</a>\u201d are voiced, contested and fought for. <br></p> <p>Inside its imposing metal gates (built to protect \u201cwhat the people inside love\u201d, says one volunteer) is a spontaneous ordering of the land which has grown out of negotiations. You pass several shipping containers, an orchard, a wildflower meadow, a pond, a collection of sheds and a caravan before reaching a large vegetable garden sheltered by a hazel hedge, fruit bushes and several willow arches. Next to this is the social heart: the cob oven, picnic benches, a covered outdoor area, and the \u201cHub\u201d building. Nearby is the children\u2019s play area, and towards the back of the site are the compost toilet and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/2009/nov/13/composting-urine\">pee bales</a>, the animals and the polytunnels.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"782a07d4db6a523735e8629a60efe2f12701f885\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/782a07d4db6a523735e8629a60efe2f12701f885/0_0_3970_4971/799.jpg\" alt=\"8 Jessie Brennan Ashtray cyanotype from Inside The Green Backyard (Opportunity Area) 2015-16\" width=\"799\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jessie Brennan \u2018Ashtray\u2019: cyanotype from <a href=\"http://www.jessiebrennan.co.uk/inside-the-green-backyard-opportunity-area/\">Inside The Green Backyard (Opportunity Area)</a>, 2015-16</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessie Brennan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What brought me to The Green Backyard \u2013 a <a href=\"http://www.plummer-parsons.co.uk/not-profit/charities/charitable-incorporated-organisations-cios\">charitable incorporated organisation</a> run by an elected board of trustees \u2013 were questions of land ownership and value, framed by the long history of community land rights struggles. Of course, feelings of belonging to a place in no way necessarily mean it belongs to you, as visitors, volunteers and trustees here are all too well aware.</p> <p>Peterborough is one of the fastest growing cities in the UK, fuelled by a <a href=\"http://peterborough.gov.uk/pdf/871559sm.pdf\">\u00a31bn regeneration scheme</a> in the form of a city centre plan that sets out major changes for its future over the next 15 years. In keeping with the rest of the UK, this economic growth has produced many benefits for this city, but it has also created deep inequalities.</p> <p>In Peterborough as elsewhere, the \u201cfinancialisation\u201d of land and property means that regeneration plans and development proposals purporting to foster diverse and creative new neighbourhoods typically displace precisely the qualities, activities and communities they claim to support. Framed by the austerity politics of successive governments, and reinforced by cuts to local authorities, the apparent need and justification for redevelopment has <a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/urbanlab/research/urban-pamphleteer/UrbanPamphleteer_2.pdf\">become a well-trodden narrative</a>.<br></p> <p>So despite the current social value that The Green Backyard provides, debates around the proposed development of this urban green space (and many other volunteer-run spaces) have been dominated by arguments for the financial value of the land \u2013 referring to the short-term cash injection that its sale would generate, rather than the long-term social benefit of the site.</p> <p>And when many users of the garden speak of their feelings of care and love for the space \u2013 and why it must be safeguarded \u2013 those qualitative responses are increasingly ignored by policies that prioritise private development over public green space.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ed21cfcae97141476ae313027522fb266f7bb4c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed21cfcae97141476ae313027522fb266f7bb4c3/0_174_3543_2127/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Green Backyard with artwork If This Were to Be Lost by Jessie Brennan 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The former derelict site transformed into a community garden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Booth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Being closer to nature, finding peace and recovering from trauma; being accepted and forming mutually supportive social relationships; partaking in a community that would not otherwise survive in the city, or learning about food growing and environmental sustainability \u2013 these are all deeply valued, even if the state institutions and private interests fail to fully grasp it.</p> <p>(If we must calculate the economic equivalent, however, recent research shows that such qualities and experiences are exceptionally valuable: <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110118095356/http:/www.cabe.org.uk/files/urban-green-nation.pdf\">green spaces have a powerful impact</a> on <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110118095356/http://www.cabe.org.uk/files/community-green-full-report.pdf\">reducing health inequality and social disadvantage</a>, saving financial costs on community centres and the NHS.)<br></p> <p>During my time in residence in Peterborough, we questioned the capitalist logic of The Green Backyard\u2019s proposed development. We offered alternative evidence for the current social use and value of the land, in the form of a visual and audio archive of more than 100 <a href=\"https://www.silverprint.co.uk/cyanotype-instructions/\">cyanotypes</a> and oral recordings, plus a large-scale installation in the garden. The process raised many questions about what this community \u2013 and many other volunteer-run projects \u2013 stands to lose if the land were to be given over to development.</p> <p>As I write, the decision as to whether or not The Green Backyard will be allowed to continue as a community garden is being made by Peterborough city council \u2013 which also has aspirations for the city to become the <a href=\"https://www.peterborough.gov.uk/council/campaigns/environment-capital/\">UK\u2019s Environment Capital</a>.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b4a56f396ee97e43a5ea55451740765815d69220\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4a56f396ee97e43a5ea55451740765815d69220/0_0_3538_4018/881.jpg\" alt=\"2 Jessie Brennan Cotton lavender cyanotype from Inside The Green Backyard (Opportunity Area) 2015-16\" width=\"881\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jessie Brennan \u2018Cotton lavender\u2019: cyanotype from <a href=\"http://www.jessiebrennan.co.uk/inside-the-green-backyard-opportunity-area/\">Inside The Green Backyard (Opportunity Area)</a>, 2015-16</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessie Brennan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the time I have known this place, there has been a marked shift in the relationship between it and the local authority, in how the space and its occupants are perceived. In December 2014 a \u201cfor sale\u201d sign was erected in front of the site by its owner; yet by April 2016, after a period of intense collaboration and discussion with council members, they had submitted a business plan detailing the site\u2019s financial viability. This signals a willingness to listen and adapt which gives fuel to the hope that local authorities are not completely impervious to local concerns, or blind to grassroots change.</p> <p>But this shift brings with it fresh challenges and new economic imperatives. The future of the site may be hopeful, but until a lease is signed it is still uncertain.</p> <p>The spaces of The Green Backyard, and instructions for how they are interacted with, cannot be found in a blueprint; nor are they inscribed in a private development proposal or business plan. People find what they need here through their active contribution to the land \u2013 which collectively belongs to them \u2013 and towards those who tend it. In a shared garden, time opens up for conversation and debate in the very act of slowing down.</p> <p>But today, considering the rapid reconfiguration of urban space from communal to private ownership, perhaps what is most radical about The Green Backyard is its politics of hospitality: the gentleness with which it hosts people whose conflicting views, contested voices and vulnerable lives (as, indeed, we all lead) are utterly welcomed.</p> <h2>Voices of The Green Backyard</h2> <p><strong>Renny Antonelli, co-founder</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was one of the people who began the project seven years ago. It\u2019s grown from a very little tent and a couple of volunteers doing a bit of digging, into a much bigger project which people come to see from far and wide.</p> <p>We give to people by allowing them to come here and share the space, giving them the time of day, and the opportunity to just relax and see the place. It\u2019s the encouragement to grow things, to do things communally, which we\u2019re sort of piloting, in a very small way \u2013 some steps into a new way of being, a new way of living.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Rosemary Steel, volunteer</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I came here first of all about three years ago when I was told I couldn\u2019t garden where I was in sheltered housing. You might as well have cut my hands off, and this \u2013 The Green Backyard \u2013 was a lifesaver.</p> <p>I met people who just took you as you were. We could talk about anything. Everyone, of course, has their challenges. So there were people who were having a tough time \u2013 as I was at that moment \u2013 and it was a touch of sanity and fellowship.</p> <p>Families come, children are free to be who they are and they can run around and see chickens and things in their natural environment. For me it\u2019s a point of stillness in a crazy world, and a very important point in Peterborough. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6fc13f10940115edd1af7b1c62cfb1f3e56b32c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fc13f10940115edd1af7b1c62cfb1f3e56b32c9/0_108_3245_1947/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018What is necessary here?\u2019, 2014, by Jessie Brennan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>\u2018<a href=\"http://www.jessiebrennan.co.uk/what-is-necessary-here/\">What is necessary here?</a>\u2019 (</em>2014), by Jessie Brennan</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessie Brennan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Katie Bliss, visitor</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the wonderful things about The Green Backyard for me, as an agroecologist, is to see the incredible diversity of crops that are grown here: how they\u2019re all interspersed, integrated together; and all the benefits that come from those interactions.</p> <p>That\u2019s also reflected in The Green Backyard as a community space: in the diversity of people who come here.

  "<p> The Pensions Regulator has begun formal legal proceedings against Sir Philip Green and Dominic Chappell that could force them to fill the \u00a3571m deficit in the BHS pension scheme, marking a dramatic escalation of the scandal surrounding the demise of the high street chain.<br></p> <p>The regulator said that after a \u201ccomplex investigation\u201d and months of talks with Green about a rescue deal for the pension scheme it was sending warning notices to the billionaire tycoon, Chappell and their companies.</p> <p>Lesley Titcomb, chief executive of TPR, said it was yet to receive \u201csufficiently credible and comprehensive offer\u201d to bail out the BHS pension scheme, which has more than 20,000 members, despite Green pledging to fix the problems facing it.</p> <p>The tycoon has rebutted TPR\u2019s claim, saying he had made a \u201ccredible and substantial proposal\u201d and shown he had cash available to support the pension scheme. Green said that his proposal would mean the BHS scheme avoids entering the Pension Protection Fund and be a \u201c better outcome\u201d for pensioners.</p> <p>The warning notices run to more than 300 pages and explain why TPR believes the parties are liable to make a financial contribution to the pension scheme and provide ongoing support. The notices mark the start of a so-called enforcement action against Green and his investment company Taveta, and Chappell and his consortium Retail Acquisitions. The action could end in a legal battle if Green and Chappell do not agree to TPR\u2019s demands.<br></p> <p>Frank Field, the Labour MP, said TPR had \u201clost patience with Sir Philip Green\u2019s excuses and empty promises\u201d. Field was the joint chair of the parliamentary committee that investigated the collapse of BHS, which concluded the department store chain had been systematically plundered by its former owners.</p> <p>BHS collapsed into administration in April, leading the loss of 11,000 jobs and leaving a pension deficit of \u00a3571m. Green controlled BHS between 2000 and 2015, during which time his family and other shareholders collected more than \u00a3580m. Green sold BHS in March 2015 to Chappell, a serial bankrupt with no retail experience, for just \u00a31. Retail Acquisitions collected an estimated \u00a317m from BHS despite owning it for just 13 months until it fell into administration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f283253c16bc7e548dabe9f5651cac228c9672a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f283253c16bc7e548dabe9f5651cac228c9672a/0_216_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Field\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frank Field was one of the MPs that investigated the collapse of BHS.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Rose/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Green told Field\u2019s parliamentary committee that he would \u201csort\u201d the problems facing the BHS pension scheme in June when he appeared in front of MPs to answer questions about the collapse of the department store chain. However, no deal has been forthcoming and the billionaire tycoon was photographed on his new yacht throughout the summer.</p> <p>Last month the House of Commons <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/20/philip-green-labelled-billionaire-spiv-in-commons-debate-on-knighthood\">voted unanimously to strip Green of his knighthood</a>, which was awarded a decade ago for services to retail. During a fiery debate in parliament, Green was lambasted and described as a \u201cbillionaire spiv\u201d.</p> <p>TPR launched an anti-avoidance investigation into BHS in March 2015 after Green sold it to Chappell. It has trawled through nearly 100,000 documents and held talks with the parties involved. The warning notices sent to Green and Chappell are different, TPR confirmed.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been clear in our public commitment to make significant progress by the end of 2016 and the issue of these notices meets that commitment,\u201d Titcomb said.</p> <p>\u201cOur decision to launch enforcement action is an important milestone in our work to attain redress for the thousands of members of BHS schemes who have been placed in this position through no fault of their own.</p> <p>\u201cIssuing warning notices at this time reflects the outcome of our investigations and that we are yet to receive a sufficiently credible and comprehensive offer in respect of the BHS schemes.</p> <p>\u201cWe continue to pursue the best deal for members of the BHS pension schemes.

He claims that they have strong links to the Sikh Council, an organisation set up in 2010 to deal with issues affecting the Sikh community in Britain and Europe. The council denies any affiliation with the group, and say they have no involvement in the organisation of protests.</p> <p> Shortly after the Sikh Council was formed, it issued an edict saying weddings between Sikhs and non-Sikhs could not take place in temples, arguing that the Sikh wedding ceremony, Anand Karaj, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34043575\">should be reserved only for Sikhs</a>.</p> <p> Marrying people of other faiths is acceptable, they say, but conducting that marriage in a Sikh temple is not.

We did the first one in June 2003 and, obviously, I interviewed him.\u201d As a journalist, Lydon had already covered presidential campaigns for the New York Times, run for mayor of Boston in 1993 and hosted the Ten O\u2019Clock News on WGBH TV. He was, it\u2019s fair to say, a safe pair of hands. \u201cWe just recorded our conversation at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard, posted it on the web, and told people about it.\u201d Did he realise what they\u2019d done? \u201cI felt like Samuel Morse tapping out his first code: \u2018What hast God wrought?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Lydon quickly followed up that first recording with a happy birthday episode dedicated to the American essayist and poet Ralph Waldo Emerson. \u201cIn the middle of the 19th century, Emerson had the idea of a global species, living in a realm of ideas, with a human universal equality in rational thought and interactive culture,\u201d says Lydon. \u201cAnd suddenly, we had the tool.\u201d</p> <p>The tool was a special RSS-with-enclosures feed for Lydon\u2019s Harvard weblog, through which he could post his interviews with leading internet thinkers, politicians and self-proclaimed futurists.

Especially in this Trump-Clinton debacle, we need a public language that means something, that\u2019s credible.\u201d When almost all of us are now walking around with the technology to record, upload and distribute our own voices to the internet sitting in our pocket, isn\u2019t Lydon worried that the world of podcasting will become a Tower of Babel, with everybody shouting and nobody listening? </p> <p>\u201cAt the beginning we used to say, \u2018Every man, woman and child a broadcaster, a publisher.\u2019 We couldn\u2019t stand it if everybody was talking at the same time. But there\u2019s that quote from Saint Augustine: God is a circle whose centre is nowhere and whose circumference is everywhere. Podcasting is kind of like that; anyone who strikes a resonant note may be heard anywhere, and if it\u2019s a great resonant note it might be heard everywhere.\u201d </p> <p>Lydon is happy that his Open Source recordings can be heard all over the world, but it\u2019s just as important, he says, if one person in Myanmar hears it. \u201cJames Joyce said that he would love to have a million readers of his works, but it\u2019s just as fine if one person reads it a million times.\u201d</p> <p>The original podcaster describes the medium with the kind of zeal others might have when describing jazz or poetry or politics \u2013 as something universal, emotional; something that can and should make a difference. \u201cDespite what you might find from the Trump-Clinton campaign, there is an American conversation going on that\u2019s very diverse, with a global attitude,\u201d says Lydon, whose guests on Open Source have included Noam Chomsky, Mary Beard, Frank Rich, Joan Didion, Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn and Philip Roth. \u201cListening and working the range of human curiosity, in fiction, in political news, in science is important.

The human voice is loaded with signals we can\u2019t even begin to map. It\u2019s very intimate, revealing.

  "<p>In Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s novel <em>The Gift</em>, published in 1952, a character called Shchyogolev holds forth about world affairs: \u201cFrance was AFRAID of something or other and therefore would never ALLOW it \u2026 Someone was PLOTTING and someone was STRIVING for something.\u201d Such speculations defined the then new field of international relations. Positing realpolitik as a sphere separate from that of domestic politics, the field had emerged as a distinct study in the early 20th century from white supremacist fears about rising competitors (its most prestigious periodical in the Anglosphere today, <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/\">Foreign Affairs</a>, originated in the Journal of Race Development).</p> <p>Writing in the 1930s, Nabokov intuited how the typical practitioner of international relations would reduce internally complex and diverse countries to a standoff between \u201cfaceless and abstract bullies\u201d: \u201cthe more brains, cunning and circumspection he found in their mutual activities, the more stupid, vulgar and simple his world became\u201d.</p> <p>Two superpowers threatening the planet with total annihilation did actually make the world seem simple (and, often, stupid and vulgar): it\u2019s no accident that the speculations of international relations were exalted into an academic discipline in the US during the cold war. The discipline now has a degree of theoretical sophistication and intellectual respectability, but crude empiricists continue to flourish in the intellectual-industrial complex \u2013 thinktanks, foundations, research institutes: Shchyogolev is incarnated today by the columnist for whom some country or other is always rising or falling.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Globalisation, the pundits sang, is lifting millions out of poverty, without clarifying where they would go next</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A commentariat unable to analyse political economy and able to see international politics only at the level of faceless bullies was intellectually neutered from the start. Devoted, above all, to legitimising their own existence, the cold warriors in the media routinely exaggerated the Soviet Union\u2019s military and economic capabilities, and the threat from communism. Even in the mid-80s, few of them noticed that the evil empire was near collapse. After 1991, many rushed to hail the new \u201cunipolar\u201d world where America was the \u201cindispensable nation\u201d.</p> <p>Some settled into a vigil for liberal democracy worldwide, believing that it would be eventually ushered in by capitalism, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/21/bring-back-ideology-fukuyama-end-history-25-years-on\">end history</a> altogether. Fervently promoting free markets in Russia, the pundits failed to foresee the country\u2019s descent into gangster capitalism. Globalisation, they sang almost in chorus, is \u201clifting\u201d hundreds of millions of people in India and China out of poverty, without anticipating that these numerous beneficiaries might get trapped in the limbo of frustrated ambition and rage where strongmen thrive. Hardly any of those who hailed the flattening of the world by consumer capitalism paid attention to the simple but devastating fact that, as the novelist Amitav Ghosh writes in his new book T<em>he Great Derangement</em>, \u201cthe patterns of life that modernity engenders can only be practised by a small minority of the world\u2019s population\u201d.</p> <p>This fatal indifference can be blamed on the peculiar ideological and professional commitments of globalisation\u2019s cheerleaders. An academic study recently revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/19/haze-indonesia-forest-fires-killed-100000-people-harvard-study\">the toxic haze</a> that spread across south-east Asia from Indonesian forest fires last year caused the deaths of about 100,000 people; this periodic smog is only one of the many social, political and environmental disasters routinely suffered by billions of Asians. Yet in his new book <em>Easternisation</em>, which chronicles the economic potency and the diplomatic and military posturing of Asian elites, the Financial Times columnist Gideon Rachman, standing on the roof of Singapore\u2019s flashiest hotel, can only see a busy port through the \u201cmorning haze\u201d \u2013 and other awesome evidence \u2013 of \u201cglobalisation in action\u201d.</p> <p>The Czech writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/18/vaclav-havel\">V\u00e1clav Havel</a>, writing from a communist prison, once marvelled at \u201cthe extent to which so many westerners are addicted to ideology, much more than we who live in a system which is ideological through and through\u201d. Today, there are few prominent Anglo-American columnists on foreign affairs whose worldview was not decisively shaped by the Reagan and Thatcher revolutions, or their Clintonite and Blairite legacies.</p> <p>Indeed, as Washington\u2019s (and New York-London\u2019s) consensus hardened, many journalists and commentators joined politicians in floating free of traditional allegiances to region, nation and democratic institutions. The much-derided <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/may/21/highereducation.news\">Thomas Friedman</a> is merely the most egregious among many syndicated Shchyogolevs, who were more likely to be found hanging out with CEOs and hedge-funders at Davos, or with FT and Economist-reading technocrats in Seoul and Delhi, than reporting on non-unionised labour in Guangzhou and Dhaka. The conceits and complacencies of this glamorous new transnational class were legitimised by the technocratic-managerial revolution: the fact that, as Ghosh writes, \u201cthe countries of the west are now in many senses \u2018post-political spaces\u2019 that are managed by apparatuses of various kinds\u201d.</p> <p>Massive earthquakes in their own backyard, such as Brexit and Trumpism, have now cruelly exposed many \u201copinion-makers\u201d, as Pope Francis calls them in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/live/2015/jun/18/pope-encyclical-climate-change-live-reaction-analysis\">encyclical on climate change</a>, to be nearly as complicit as politicians, bankers and corporates in acts of concealment and even deception. \u201cTwenty years of good times and global economic integration,\u201d Rachman wrote in 2010, \u201ccreated a \u2018win-win world\u2019, which ensured that all the major powers had reason to be satisfied.\u201d</p> <p>To the inevitable questions \u2013 who exactly are the winners, and how do you know that \u201cthey\u201d are satisfied? \u2013 Rachman had an answer that in our age of revolt against globalised elites can only seem audacious: the \u201ccreation\u201d, he said, \u201cof a Davos mentality \u2013 by which I mean that you could get leaders from China, the US, western Europe and India to all show up at the same meeting and to a significant extent they would be talking the same language.\u201d</p> <p><em>Easternisation</em> is also fuelled by the belief that insights into our present and future are guaranteed by constant proximity to the 1% of the 1%, who all talk the same language. As the financial crisis erupted, Rachman \u201csat down in Milan\u201d, he tells us, \u201cwith Carlo De Benedetti \u2026 one of Italy\u2019s leading industrialists through much of the postwar period\u201d. Indeed, <em>Easternisation</em> opens with a private audience with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping\">Xi Jinping</a>, and, after recording many such intimacies with the uber-powerful, ends by hailing the World Economic Forum as \u201chugely useful\u201d.</p> <p>It should be noted that Rachman is one of the few sensible pundits in the Anglo-American establishment. Certainly, he has no truck with unrepentant neocons across the Atlantic. To these exponents of western supremacism, the possibility of decline remains incomprehensible, or too painful to accept; they still fantasise about America becoming great again by assuming, in Robert Kagan\u2019s words, the \u201cleadership of a united democratic bloc\u201d against the many bullies out there. To his credit, Rachman recognises that not even Kim Jong-un, let alone Vladimir Putin, will start quivering at the prospect of a new concert of democracies. In <em>Easternisation</em>, however, he falls victim to what Orwell once called a \u201cmajor mental disease\u201d afflicting public intellectuals: \u201cthe instinct to bow down\u201d before anyone who appears to be powerful.</p> <p>In 2003, the year of shock-and-awe in Iraq, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/fareed-zakaria/\">Fareed Zakaria</a> voiced a general consensus among the Anglosphere\u2019s sages when he wrote that \u201cAmerica\u2019s dominance now seems self-evident\u201d. Just three years later, a \u201cpost-American world\u201d had suddenly dawned as America struggled against insurgencies in both Iraq and Afghanistan, China suddenly appeared to be rising, and even India had metamorphosed, as Foreign Affairs announced, into a \u201croaring capitalist success story\u201d. The imperative to worship power made it inevitable that the spine-stiffening tale of westernisation would give way to a stirring new fable of easternisation. Rachman brings to the latter myth, already much-faded, the naive fervour of the recent convert.</p> <p>\u201cThe economic development that allows China and India to push for great-power status has already happened,\u201d he claims. The empowering of a toxic political movement in India that reveres Gandhi\u2019s assassins and threatens to demolish India\u2019s pluralist traditions and democratic institutions does make him slightly uneasy. Nevertheless, the country\u2019s new leader is pushing for the economic reforms that foreign investors crave, and so in Rachman\u2019s wary formulation, it is Modi\u2019s \u201cleftwing critics\u201d who \u201caccuse [him] of \u2018xenophobic nationalism\u2019\u201d. The adjective \u201cleftwing\u201d is of course a trigger warning among Davos men, and code for deluded losers. Presumably, Rachman has to protect the fantasy, much loved by financial elites, that India might \u201cbe at the fulcrum of global economic development\u201d.</p> <p>How such \u201cprogress\u201d changes the global environment is revealed, along with other true faces of easternisation, by Ghosh in his short but broad-ranging and consistently stimulating indictment of our era of the \u201cgreat derangement\u201d. It has been a time, he writes, when \u201cmost forms of art and literature were drawn into the modes of concealment that prevented people from recognising the realities of their plight\u201d. Ghosh details the original damage inflicted by the west\u2019s carbon-fuelled modes of economic and political imperialism. But it was, he adds, the \u201cexpanding industrialisation of Asia\u2019s most populous nations, beginning in the 1980s, that brought the climate crisis to a head\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The two ways in which human\u00adkind can do away with itself \u2013 war or environmental destruc\u00adtion \u2013 have rapidly converged</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>China\u2019s carbon emissions per head of population have now surpassed the EU\u2019s; India is not far behind. Briskly, Ghosh outlines the devastating consequences: the loss in India of \u201csome of the country\u2019s most fertile lands\u201d; the disappearance of \u201cmany of the subcontinent\u2019s low-lying islands, like the Lakshadweep chain\u201d; the \u201cmigration of up to 50 million people in India and 75 million in Bangladesh\u201d; not to mention that \u201cif the glaciers continue to shrink at the present rate, the most populous parts of Asia will face catastrophic water shortages within a decade or two\u201d.</p> <p>Unlike many Panglosses of globalisation, who generalise from their own experience of rapid social mobility, Ghosh is keenly self-aware. He, too, started out as a writer in the late 80s, in a \u201cbreathtakingly exciting time\u201d; but for him Asia\u2019s history proves that \u201cthe universalist premise of industrial civilisation\u201d cherished by politicians and commentators is \u201ca hoax\u201d. Describing the \u201cbroader imaginative and cultural failure that lies at the heart of the climate crisis\u201d, Ghosh is most critical, in the way few journalists are, of the basic assumptions of his own vocation. Imaginative writing, as he sees it, has also failed to grasp the perilous new human condition, inhibited by its founding devotion to bourgeois orderliness, and scorn for the improbable. In Ghosh\u2019s view of literary fiction, \u201cthe very gestures with which it conjures up reality are actually a concealment of the real\u201d.</p> <p>Ghosh\u2019s account of literary omissions can occasionally feel selective. The German Romantics protested eloquently against the despoiling of the natural world right at the beginning of the modern era; the counter-tradition inaugurated by them has informed much modern literature. He doesn\u2019t linger long enough on the technical difficulties of incorporating climate change into artistic practice, or whether many novelists haven\u2019t already described its consequences, such as civil war and ethnic cleansing. But his indictment of a complacent avant gardism in the arts is original and subtle. And he is of course right to assert that the era of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/01/generation-anthropocene-altered-planet-for-ever\">Anthropocene</a> \u201cpresents a challenge not only to the arts and humanities, but also to our commonsense understandings and beyond that to contemporary culture in general\u201d.</p> <p>A few writers, journalists and academics have already stepped up to this challenge: for instance, a book such as David Blackbourn\u2019s 2006<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/apr/15/featuresreviews.guardianreview6\"><em>The Conquest of Nature: Water, Landscape, and the Making of Modern Germany</em></a> suggests one way in which the discipline of history can renew itself. But a whole new intellectual culture is needed to effect the shift from shattered assumptions of continuous progress to a mode of thinking that assumes, with the minimum of melodrama, that human violence has finally escaped its millennia-old cultural, social, political and geographic constraints, and now threatens to destroy the planet itself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/28/amitav-ghosh-where-is-the-fiction-about-climate-change-\">Amitav Ghosh: where is the fiction about climate change?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gnostic sects in the past, and fundamentalists in the present, were prone to warn that the end of time is near. But belief in the apocalypse is now widespread, and with good reason. The two ways in which humankind can self-destruct \u2013 civil war on a global scale, or destruction of the natural environment necessary to its survival \u2013 have rapidly converged. Today, global warming manifests itself in not just a rise in the level of the oceans, the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, the emptying of fish stocks or the desertification of entire regions on the planet. It can also be seen at work in violent conflict in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Syria and many other places exposed to food price rises, drought and declining water sources. Water shortages <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/15/india-angry-clashes-karnataka-water-wars-run-deep-tamil-nadu\">sparked riots</a> in Bangalore, India\u2019s hi-tech capital, in September. Africans, Bangladeshis and black residents of the Mississippi delta have long been the victims of the extravagant use of fossil fuels by rich consumers, corporations and governments. The large-scale flight of refugees and migrants from damaged areas, which has already caused wars in Asia and Africa, is now provoking political turmoil in the heart of Europe.</p> <p>It is as though a vengeful Earth is mocking, in Ghosh\u2019s words, the \u201cCartesian dualism that arrogates all intelligence and agency to the human while denying them to every other kind of being\u201d. Ghosh is sceptical of recent climate change agreements; investing hope and initiative in figures of religious authority such as Pope Francis, he seems to echo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/martin-heidegger\">Martin Heidegger</a>\u2019s warning: \u201cOnly a god can save us now.\u201d But then his book is not prescriptive so much as a bold meditation on ethical and cognitive failure and an impassioned call to think the unthinkable in our new geological age of the Anthropocene. Western ideologues, as Havel pointed out, missed the real significance of the discrediting of communism in 1989, which was that \u201cthe era of arrogant, absolutist reason is drawing to a close\u201d. That era has now finally ended with the discrediting of neoliberal capitalism, and <em>The Great Derangement</em> is a bracing reminder that there is no more vital task for writers and artists than to clear the intellectual dead wood of a vulgarly boosterish age and create space for apocalyptic thinking \u2013 which may at least delay, if not avert, the catastrophes ahead.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 November.

It was only <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obama_nungara#cite_note-AP2014-1\">described as a new species</a> last year. </p> <p>Populations of New Zealand and Australian flatworms are already established in the UK and there are <a href=\"https://peerj.com/articles/430/\">at least 18 flatworms</a> that have been introduced in Europe, including the New Guinea flatworm, listed as one of the <a href=\"http://www.iflscience.com/environment/new-guinea-flatworm-one-worst-known-invasive-species-found-us/\">100 worst invasive alien species</a> in the world.</p> <p>Flatworms prey on earthworms and land snails, and in areas where they have already colonised the soil they have <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10530-012-0309-7\">reduced some earthworm populations by 20%</a>. </p> <p>These invertebrates are considered essential for soil health as they aerate and fertilise the earth, maintain its structure and support plant growth. Fewer invertebrates would also have an impact higher up the food chain, while the resulting poorer quality soil could have knock-on effects on everything from flooding - making the soil less able to absorb water - to farming - where crops would be harder to grow. </p> <p>\u201cThe importation of pot plants into the UK is bringing with it an avalanche of harmful and unwanted species. At Buglife we are regularly alerted to exotic grasshoppers, wasps, beetles, spiders and moths arriving at nurseries and garden centres, many of these animals have the potential to damage agriculture, destroy wildlife or distress gardeners,\u201d said Matt Shardlow, Buglife CEO.</p> <p>\u201cOur biosecurity is feeble, it is time for the government to take control of this problem before it gets completely out of hand and we are unable to recognise the wildlife in our own gardens.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-trees-and-plants-to-england-and-wales-from-the-eu\">Current government guidance</a> for importing trees and plants to England and Wales from the EU requires certain species to carry a \u201cplant passport\u201d or be declared. But Shardlow said for the vast majority of plants there are no biosecurity measures to exclude or check for eggs or hibernating animals in the soil.<br></p> <p>There has been an increasing volume and speed of movement of plants in recent years and this increases the chances of exotic pests arriving with imported goods and travellers. </p> <p>Other stresses such as climate change and changes in land use have increased the risk of invasive species establishing themselves and spreading.

  "<p>Those who can\u2019t rule today try to rule yesterday. This week\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/31/orgreave-inquiry-burnham-accuses-rudd-of-nakedly-political-act-video\" title=\"\"> demand by Labour\u2019s Andy Burnham</a> for a show trial of police&#xa0;tactics at the battle of Orgreave, 32 years ago,&#xa0;was a piece of pure politics. His rebuff by the home secretary, Amber&#xa0;Rudd, was proportionate and wholly reasonable.</p> <p>We know <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/nov/01/what-happened-at-the-battle-of-orgreave-video-explainer\" title=\"\">what happened at Orgreave</a>. The police reaction to the miners\u2019 union picketing was excessive. But this fact has been examined, fought over and iconised for decades. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/01/orgreave-class-war-96-dead-hillsborough-amber-rudd-inquiry\" title=\"\">To equate it with Hillsborough</a> or Bloody Sunday is an offence to those who died in those tragedies. There were no deaths at Orgreave. There was violence on both sides. But the arrested miners were tried and acquitted. That some suffered through being bailed is sadly true of thousands of innocent citizens every year.</p> <p>Why does Burnham suddenly want an inquiry into Orgreave? Back in 2005 he was a junior minister at the very Home Office he now wants to put on trial. There was no inquiry then. Could it be that Burnham was part of Tony Blair\u2019s New Labour establishment, eager to forget the taint of Scargillism, whereas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/andy-burnham-selected-labours-candidate-manchester-mayor\" title=\"\">he now wants to be mayor of Manchester</a>?</p> <p>Orgreave was miserable for those involved, but pit closures are history. The miners were victims of that history, as were workers at the same time in dockyards, steel foundries and newspapers. Protest was understandable and probably inevitable. But does Burnham really want to go back to subsidising dirty coal? Public policy \u2013 and resources \u2013 should surely go into helping the stranded, demoralised communities left behind. Buy jobs, not lawyers. Who will invest in these places if they continue picking at old sores? This was a third of a century ago.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve had Alder Hey (1999), Climbi\u00e9 (2001) and Soham (2004). What good did they do?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Public inquiry has become a catch-all salve to any political embarrassment or lingering grievance. No one asks if it really delivers \u201cjustice\u201d, which is strictly a job for the courts. No one asks the opportunity cost. No one doubted that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/feb/01/derry-bloody-sunday-1972\" title=\"\">what happened in Derry on Bloody Sunday in 1972</a> was a ghastly mistake. The 12 years and \u00a3179m spent re-investigating it by Lord Saville would surely have been better spent compensating victims\u2019 families and on wider community rebuilding. As for the three inquiries into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/26/hillsborough-disaster-deadly-mistakes-and-lies-that-lasted-decades\" title=\"\">1989 Hillsborough football disaster</a>, they have still not laid&#xa0;it to rest, with calls for yet more criminal&#xa0;investigations.</p> <p>The supposition that a drawn-out \u201cjudicial\u201d inquiry is somehow macho accountability is bizarre. The brisk inquiries familiar in the 1950s and 1960s lasted on average three months. By the 1990s this had tripled to 10 months. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/nov/17/archive-1992-scott-inquiry-arms-iraq\" title=\"\">1992 Scott inquiry</a> drooled over a relatively trivial issue of arms for Iraq for four years, to no particular end. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/bbc_parliament/3631505.stm\" title=\"\">Franks on the Falklands</a> took six months in 1982. By this year, Chilcot on Iraq had taken seven years and \u00a310m.</p> <p>The current inquiry into child sex abuse has become an industry, a parody of the genre. We have had inquiries into the inadequacies of the child care system for decades. There has been Cleveland (1987), North Wales (1996), Alder Hey (1999), Victoria Climbi\u00e9 (2001) and Soham (2004), among many others. What good did they do, that we need yet&#xa0;another?</p> <p>We do not know if <a href=\"https://www.iicsa.org.uk/about-us/who-we-are/professor-alexis-jay-obe\" title=\"\">this abuse inquiry, under Professor Alexis Jay</a>, is to be a court hearing of a number of elderly men or an encyclopaedia of past maladministration. All we know is that it has spawned 13 sub-inquiries, 180 staff and a battery of victim lobbyists. Meanwhile, victims\u2019 hopes of compensation are inflated \u2013 and postponed \u2013 as lawyers pump up each line of inquiry and costs soar. Is&#xa0;it really sensible to starve a desperately under-resourced care service for this circus?</p> <p>It seems no longer to matter how long these inquiries take. Politicians and officials alike have a vested interest in distancing themselves from publicity and blame. Accountability postponed is accountability denied. Public inquiries have become a cynical appendix of modern government, like honours, tsars and special advisers.</p> <p>Inquiries should be for specific system failure, like investigating a political scandal or a dreadful accident. They used to be incisive exposures, as of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/apr/10/past.derekbrown\" title=\"\">Profumo affair</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/09/aberfan-50-years-owen-sheers-the-green-hollow-film-poem\" title=\"\">Aberfan disaster</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/apr/02/brixton-riots-anniversary\" title=\"\">Brixton riots</a> and the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/lawrence\" title=\"\">Stephen Lawrence</a>, where no other mechanism seemed appropriate. Such a case today might be the collapse of audit and regulation in the BHS/Philip Green affair. All we got was an abusive torrent from the prime minister and MPs alike.</p> <p>Meanwhile, there has been no inquiry into the Bank of England\u2019s handling of the 2008/9 crash, or the chaotic state of NHS finances, or allegations of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/31/rolls-royce-middlemen-may-have-used-bribes-to-land-major-contracts\" title=\"\">bribery by Rolls-Royce</a> and BAE. Inquiries into project cost-concealment, as with the Olympics legacy, HS2 or Hinkley Point, must presumably await the retirement of the politicians concerned.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/01/orgreave-class-war-96-dead-hillsborough-amber-rudd-inquiry\">Orgreave was part of the class war that ended with 96 dead at Hillsborough | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Public inquiries have assumed from parliament the job of debating public policy. As such they upstage both the House of Commons and the investigative functions of select committee. They anaesthetise controversy, lancing some political boil by removing it from the theatre of parliament. But they have come to seem more like kangaroo courts, with the voices of victims loudest, and little attempt to balance blame. Chilcot lost credibility by being absurdly indulgent of Downing Street officials. Leveson sought to chain the press, yet let the police and BBC off the hook.</p> <p>Inquiries are always bidden to \u201clearn lessons\u201d. A few do, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/1999/feb/17/guardiansocietysupplement4\" title=\"\">Scarman on riot policing</a>, but most tell us little more than we already know: that public services operate under stress, must take risks and can sometimes fail. Inquiries seldom acknowledge risk, because risk is not a concept known to law.</p> <p>Trial and error is part of the relationship between ministers and officials. It is a trial and error that should be vulnerable to constant scrutiny by parliament, the courts and the media, not delegated to some passing judge. As for the past, there should be some statute of limitation. History is for historians. I cannot believe Tony Blair\u2019s \u201capologies\u201d for slavery and the Irish famine were about \u201cjustice\u201d, or made anyone feel better, except him.</p> <p>The poet George Santayana warned us not to not forget history, lest we repeat it. But harbouring old grievances blights too many societies around the world. Sometimes we should put our faith in the future and move on. More misery is caused by those who cannot forget the past than by those who cannot remember it.</p>",
  "<p>We knew we were going to get wet, probably very wet, but it was the kind of morning that turns landscape into dramatic theatre; dark clouds unleashing torrential showers, then sunshine breaking through gaps in the clouds, sweeping across fields and fell side.</p> <p>The first downpour arrived just as we made our way along the footpath that skirts the edge of the dene, a steep-sided cleft in the hillside cut by Stanhope burn, clothed with ash, Scots pine, oak and beech.

Standing under the shelter of a beech with our gaze confined to our immediate surroundings, turned out to be a revelation. If we had not been forced to stop we would have walked past the glossy white toadstools of porcelain fungus (<em>Oudemansiella mucida)</em>, jutting from the trunk high above us. Nor would we have seen the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/17/buzzard-hunting-licences-threat-to-uk-pheasant-industry\">buzzard</a>, hunched in the topmost branches of a dead sycamore in the field beside the dene.</p> <p>Water trickling down the tree trunk pooled at its roots then became a rivulet, uniting with others as it flowed past our boots and down the sides of the dene, towards the burn below. We could not see it but the sound, of fast-flowing water over rocks, told of a torrent swollen by a week of days like this.</p> <p>Then the clouds parted and for a few moments the falling rain became a silver sunlit curtain as it swept across the tree canopy above. Then it stopped, as suddenly as it had begun.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"804d877cf3bc73417096170c25c37fada65c8228\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/804d877cf3bc73417096170c25c37fada65c8228/0_0_2339_1419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sun breaks through the cloud cover at Stanhope Dene.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"607\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sun breaks through the cloud cover at Stanhope Dene.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Gates</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the field there was an aura around the buzzard as, dog-like, it shook water from its feathers.

It was the highest-rated Game 6 since the New York Yankees\u2019 2009 clincher against Philadelphia drew a 13.4/22 and the most-watched since Cleveland\u2019s win at Florida in 1997 was seen by 23.7 million.</p> <p>The game drew 425,000 for Spanish-language coverage on Fox Deportes and 151,000 for digital coverage on Fox Sports Go, for a total audience of 24 million.</p> <p>This year\u2019s Series entered Game 7 averaging an 11.3/20 and 20 million viewers, the most watched since Boston\u2019s four-game sweep of St. Louis in 2004.</p> <p>The rating is the percentage of television households tuned to a program, and the share is the percentage showing a broadcast among those homes with TVs on at the time.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a79cee4b0d073c27d0dd4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T23:45:15.622Z\">11.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Email</strong></p> <p>Here\u2019s a little numerology from reader Mark Wagner.

Remember Clayton Kershaw in Game 5 of the NLDS coming out of the bullpen to get the last two outs of the clinching game for the Dodgers? It feels like about four months ago. Both managers tonight have that same dilemma but in different ways.</p> <p>Cleveland\u2019s Terry Francona has a reasonably-rested ace reliever Andrew Miller to use tonight if he needs. Francona gave no indication about how long he will pitch Miller \u2013 if at all \u2013 but he talked about how he has brought Miller into games in the fifth inning in the past and left open the idea that he would again in this game.</p> <p>Cubs manager Joe Maddon talked to Game 5 starter Jon Lester after last night\u2019s game and suggested that Lester could pitch at least an inning or two if the Cubs needed him.</p> <p>\u201cJon\u2019s able,\u201d Maddon said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put him into a dirty inning, I don\u2019t think that would be appropriate. But being that it\u2019s on his regular workout day, he\u2019s probably got a solid two in him.\u201d<br></p> <p>Maddon also said he did not regret using his closer Aroldis Chapman for long stretches in the last two games, potentially weakening Chapman\u2019s effectiveness.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about winning now,\u201d Maddon said. \u201cYesterday that was a real clear-cut decision for me, how to work (the 7<sup>th</sup> inning when Chapman came in) the threat there was that had we not done it then Aroldis would have had a mores stressful 1- 1 2/3 innings in the eighth and ninth.\u201d</p> <p>END - David here again...</p> <p>It\u2019s interesting about Lester - and remember, his entering the game also means a switch at catcher, a move that means less in the American League. David Ross has caught all but three of Lester\u2019s innings this season. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T23:43:21.517Z\">at 11.43pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581a777ee4b07ceadb3a1d00\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T23:38:15.282Z\">11.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Tito Francona</strong></p> <p>He is one of the more successful big game managers in recent history, and tonight, he\u2019ll have the luxury of a reasonably rested big-game bullpen. The airwaves were buzzing all day long about a possible formula for Francona - four innings from starter Corey Kluber, three from Andrew Miller and two from Allen. That\u2019s a best case scenario of course, and is likely if the Indians manage to get on top of Cubs starter Kyle Hendricks. </p> <p>Just a quick note about his benching of Tyler Naquin - in an era of cagey coaches and managers, it was refreshing to hear his candid comments, where he said that he was \u201cpressing a little bit. During the regular season you might kind of let him get through it, but with one game left and with [Corey] Kluber pitching, we\u2019re trying to put a premium on catching the ball.\u201d</p> <p>But that\u2019s just Tito, a tremendous managerial talent, who also is also cool enough let the world in on how he fell asleep eating pretzels and peanut butter last night, waking up now and then to take another bite. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a70a2e4b0d073c27d0db9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T23:18:32.697Z\">11.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A big night ahead...</strong></p> <p>David Lengel here...</p> <p>If a certain iconic baseball broadcaster were writing this live blog, perhaps he would start off with \u201cHello everybody and a very pleasant evening to you wherever you may be.\u201d </p> <p>And actually, it\u2019s much more than a pleasant evening, or morning or afternoon for baseball fans, and that\u2019s because we\u2019re about an hour away from what is unquestionably the most highly anticipated finish to a season in recent memory. </p> <p>Personally speaking, I\u2019ve been jumping out of my skin all day long waiting for first pitch, waiting to watch what happens right along with what will be a mammoth global baseball audience. </p> <p>It\u2019s perhaps less pleasant for fans of the Chicago Cubs and the Cleveland Indians: their supporters have been tortured for decades, and are agonizing about what may or may not happen right up until the very end of one of their age-old title droughts.

I think that we\u2019ve all really enjoyed ourselves. I think we can take a lot from the way we approached it, and not treating it more than just each game is another game and trying to go out and win that day. Not trying to look too far ahead or things like that. I think there\u2019s value to taking that approach throughout the course of a season, too.</p> <p><strong>For years and years, the regular routine was to have starters pitch on three days\u2019 rest, and then in seven days it became four days. For you, what is the difference now that you\u2019ve come back once on three days and might do it again tomorrow?</strong></p> <p><strong>Kluber</strong>: I mean, I guess for me personally I spend a little more time doing the different methods of recovery and stuff like that that we have available to us.</p> <p>But I still get in the same amount of work in between, it\u2019s just a little bit more condensed. I haven\u2019t, for me personally, I haven\u2019t found much of a difference yet in the way I feel when I go out there on three days\u2019 rest as opposed to four. And I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just doing the extra recovery stuff to where you get as close to normal as you can possibly get. But that\u2019s really the only difference for me is spending more time trying to recover on those three days instead of having four days to do it.</p> <p><strong>All season long you knew when you were going to pitch, and tomorrow obviously you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to pitch. So what is your mental frame thinking about tomorrow as of right now?</strong></p> <p><strong>Kluber</strong>: I mean, doing all my work in between the last start, and if it gets to tomorrow, that start. In doing all my work it was the same trying to get myself prepared. I\u2019ll be rooting as hard as anybody for us to win tonight. But I think that my mindset was I\u2019d rather be prepared and not have to pitch than try to will us to not get to a Game 7 and then not be ready when it comes.</p> <h2>Kyle Hendricks</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3934c814c91622ae71377a6f490547d04e7400a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3934c814c91622ae71377a6f490547d04e7400a5/0_0_4096_2282/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kyle Hendricks is on the mound for Chicago.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"557\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kyle Hendricks is on the mound for Chicago.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tannen Maury/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Kyle, knock on wood, there\u2019s a Game 7 for you tomorrow, what would it mean? It\u2019s the ultimate in baseball to pitch a Game 7.</strong></p> <p><strong>Hendricks</strong>: Exactly, this is the ultimate dream. You dream of getting to the World Series, winning the World Series. When you\u2019re out in your backyard as a kid, playing Little League at the field with your friends, this is the moment you dream about, Game 7, 3-2, two outs, something like that, bottom of the 9th. But it\u2019s always Game 7 of the World Series.</p> <p>So when we get there tomorrow, I\u2019m just going to embrace the opportunity like I have the rest of this postseason, honestly. Approach it like any other game, simple thoughts, the same old thing.</p> <p><strong>You have a guy on your team who won a Game 7 in 2002 and won a Game 6 three years ago in John Lackey. Has he imparted any wisdom on you about how to handle tomorrow?</strong></p> <p><strong>Hendricks</strong>: Not particularly in regards to tomorrow, but I\u2019ve learned so much from John already. I think the way he approaches every single game, you know, I think that\u2019s what prepares him for those big games and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned watching him, and I\u2019ve tried to implement some of that into my routine, just taking that same ruthless approach, every day, every single start, even the regular season. So that when you get to these big moments, it\u2019s basically like it has been the whole year, I think.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s your take on a team having a guy starting games 1, 4, and 7 and Kluber in particular?</strong></p> <p><strong>Hendricks</strong>: You know, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s too many guys that could do it to start, so obviously he\u2019s a special guy. But Kluber, you can just see it. The way he takes to the mound, he\u2019s always locked in. He has a very, very good mental approach from what you can see from the outside, keeping things simple, just trying to execute pitches.</p> <p>Like I said, there\u2019s not many guys in this league that could do that. I think it speaks volumes to him as a pitcher and what he can do.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T19:26:09.531Z\">at 7.26pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581a247de4b0d073c27d0c18\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T17:46:05.628Z\">5.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hello and welcome</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><em>Game seven</em>.</strong> It\u2019s been said they\u2019re the two greatest words in sports \u2013 besides, perhaps, <em>free beer</em> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2015/apr/06/meat-cheese-and-lots-of-calories-mlb-stadium-foods-in-pictures?CMP=share_btn_tw&amp;page=with:img-12#img-12\"><em>brunch burger</em></a> \u2013 a one-off crucible where the winners through the years have been minted as legends and the losers cruelly fitted with goat horns.</p> <p>Tonight the Chicago Cubs and Cleveland Indians will face off in the seventh game of a World Series that\u2019s deadlocked at three games apiece.

But that is precisely why workers are so deeply and bitterly disappointed in the federal government at this time.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to be hiding under a rock not to know the electricity sector is changing, it has been doing so for years. These changes are occurring because of long-term economic restructuring and policies designed to shift from non-renewable energy sources to renewables.\u201d</p> <p>The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said the government established a ministerial task group \u201csome time ago\u201d to ensure support for the community in the event of a closure.</p> <p>The group would now work with the Victorian government to ensure support for jobs and business opportunities, he said. The federal government will also provide $43m in support to support the workers including $20m in support for local infrastructure, $3m to help employees and a $20m regional jobs package.</p> <p>\u201cOur thoughts today are with the tough times for the men and women who work at Hazelwood and of course the many others in that community whose jobs depend on that power station,\u201d Turnbull said.</p> <p>The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is chair of a Latrobe valley cabinet taskforce which he said had been preparing for the announcement. He announced a $22m package of support including a workplace transition centre in Morwell, education, counselling, and financial advice, and subsidised jobseeker training.</p> <p>An additional $20m will fund the establishment of a dedicated Latrobe valley authority to manage the transition and the future economic development, he said.</p> <p>But despite calls for the government to focus on renewable energy jobs and begin transitioning away from coal, Andrews told reporters that coal industry would \u201chave a significant presence in this community for a long time\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cPerhaps some of those who have been given the bad news today at Hazelwood [could be] deployed at other power stations,\u201d he said. \u201cIf their production goes up, they may need more staff.\u201d</p> <p>In May, Engie\u2019s chief executive, Isabelle Kocher, told a French Senate committee the company planned a gradual withdrawal from coal-fired power generation, and that the share of coal in its energy mix would fall to about 10% from 15% over the next couple of years.</p> <p>Environment Victoria\u2019s chief executive, Mark Wakeham, described Hazelwood as \u201cthe oldest and most polluting power station in Australia\u201d.

A Frontier Economics report published in May predicted that closing Hazelwood would lead to electricity price rises of up to 25% in the immediate aftermath. </p> <p>The report said: \u201cGiven brown coal power stations are the cheapest thermal plants to run in the NEM [national electricity market], it follows that the removal of these power stations will result in higher cost generation running more to meet demand.\u201d</p> <p>But Victoria\u2019s energy minister, Lily D\u2019Ambrosio, said separate modelling done for the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning had found that household energy bills may rise only 4%, or less than $1 a week.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sad fact of reality that in the case of Hazelwood\u2019s possible closure, there will be an impact on electricity prices,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said before the announcement. \u201cWhile that seems small, we know there are Victorian families already doing it tough.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Roger Dargaville, an expert on energy efficiency and energy systems from the University of Melbourne, said there was an oversupply of electricity nationally. Any gap left by Hazelwood would be filled by other power stations in La Trobe or possibly in New South Wales, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThere is more supply than required and given that Hazelwood is one of the oldest and most carbon-intensive, it seems logical that it should be the next one to exit the market,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cNSW plants are running at very low capacity and though they run at slightly higher costs, as they run on black coal rather than brown coal, I\u2019d say any electricity price increases would be minimal. That being said, energy markets are fickle beasts and are sometimes unpredictable.\u201d</p>",

But a new surveillance network across eight countries in the region has found that drug resistance is a much greater threat than had been assumed. </p> <p>The WHO had estimated that up to 2% of new TB infections in west Africa were resistant to drugs, but the researchers found the true rate was 6%.</p> <p>The rate among people who had already been treated for TB was much higher: the WHO had estimated 17% of these infections in west Africa were resistant to drugs, but the network has found the average is 35%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/mar/24/pills-treat-tb-research-multi-drug-resistant-tuberculosis\">14,600 pills over two years \u2013 there has to be a better way to treat TB | Philippe Douste-Blazy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The hotspots are in Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s largest city, where 66% of people previously treated for TB have a drug-resistant strain.
