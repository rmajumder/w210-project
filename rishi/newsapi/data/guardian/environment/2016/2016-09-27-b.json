  "<p>Motherwell\u2019s Dalzell steelworks, which were closed last winter amid an industry-wide crisis, will be formally reopened by Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, on Wednesday.</p> <p>The international industrial group, Liberty House, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/24/tata-scottish-steel-works-rescued-by-liberty-house\">rescued the plant in March</a>, confirmed that at least 70% of those starting work at Dalzell this week are former employees. </p> <p>The event will officially mark the restart of the plant following its mothballing in December 2015 after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/20/tata-steel-expected-to-announce-1200-job-losses-in-uk\">Tata Steel confirmed it was cutting 1,200 jobs</a> at its plants in Scunthorpe, Motherwell and Clydebridge in Cambuslang. </p> <p>Tata, which owned the remnants of the former British Steel, <a href=\"http://www.tatasteeleurope.com/en/news/news/Restructure-announced-at-Tata-Steel%E2%80%99s-Long-Products-Europe-business\">blamed cheap Chinese imports, the strong pound and high electricity costs</a> for its decision to stop production of steel plate.</p> <p>Sturgeon described Dalzell\u2019s revival as \u201ca very positive signal that the steel and engineering industries still have a future here in Scotland\u201d. <br></p> <p>Liberty House said it had spent the last five months rebuilding the workforce and recommissioning equipment at the site, which includes the UK\u2019s largest and most versatile plate mill.</p> <p>Liberty has already recruited about 120 staff for Dalzell, including a majority of returning employees, with the aim of increasing to more than 200 within 18 months as production rises.</p> <p> Liberty aims to initially produce 150,000 tonnes of plate a year at Dalzell, with the longer-term aim of building up to previous levels of output as the market allows.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/12/tata-steels-uk-crisis-hits-global-results\">Tata Steel's UK crisis hits global results</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The executive chairman of the Liberty House Group, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/06/sanjeev-gupta-uk-steel-tata\">Sanjeev Gupta</a>, thanked the Scottish government and Scottish Enterprise for assisting the rescue package: \u201cThere is an impressive spirit of partnership here and a determination to give the Scottish steel industry a real future. From our side we promised we would get this important plant open again by the autumn and today we are proud to be fulfilling that promise.\u201d</p> <p>He added that the neighbouring Clydebridge works would come back on stream \u201cin due course as market conditions allowed\u201d. </p> <p>Callum Munro of Community union welcomed the reopening, but warned that there still remained huge gaps in the Scottish government\u2019s industrial strategy to support steel and other manufacturing interests. He added that it was crucial to invest in building skills to ensure that when large construction opportunities, such as the new Forth Road Bridge, presented themselves the workforce was equipped.</p>",

  "<p>Britain\u2019s sharp rise up the league table for global competitiveness to its highest place in a decade risks being reversed by the vote for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>, according to the World Economic Forum.</p> <p>The body that runs the annual Davos event said Britain had risen three places in the past year to rank seventh, but said the analysis for its <a href=\"http://www3.weforum.org/docs/Media/GCR1617/GCR_16.pdf\">Global Competitiveness report</a> had used data collected before the 23 June referendum.<br></p> <p>Noting that the UK was currently one of the most competitive economies in the world, the WEF said: \u201cAlthough the process and the conditions of Brexit are still unknown, it is likely to have a negative impact on the United Kingdom\u2019s competitiveness through goods and financial markets as well as market size and, potentially, innovation\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/26/brexit-anxiety-financial-services-sector-cbi-\">Brexit anxiety taking its toll on financial services sector, CBI finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The WEF study chimes with reports from other global institutions - including the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development - which said ahead of the referendum that Brexit would have a long-term impact on the UK in terms of weaker inward investment and less trade.</p> <p>The studies have been challenged by Brexit supporters, who say the UK will be able to forge closer trade links with countries outside the EU and will benefit from a reduction in the red tape generated in Brussels.</p> <p>The WEF\u2019s report is published at a time when the government is mulling over its exit strategy from the EU. Some ministers favour a soft Brexit under which the UK would prioritise access to the single market, while others back a hard Brexit that would make immigration control the priority in negotiations.</p> <p>The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said: \u201cToday\u2019s report demonstrates our ability to sharpen our edge and improve our competitiveness. This government will build on that progress, as we demonstrate to the world that Britain continues to be highly competitive and open for business.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/22/uk-economy-faces-challenging-period-after-brexit-vote-says-bank\">UK economy faces challenging period after Brexit vote, says Bank</a> </p> </aside>  <p> <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/launch-of-the-world-trade-report-2016-inclusive-trade-and-smes\">Speaking at the World Trade Organisation in Geneva on Tuesday, the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, </a>said the UK would push for more trade liberalisation after Brexit.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe decision of the British people to leave the EU is not symptomatic of looking inwards, but a people who want to take more control over our laws, our money and our borders,\u201d Fox said. \u201cWe are a proud and outward-looking trading nation.\u201d</p> <p>The WEF said the UK\u2019s competitiveness relied on highly efficient goods and labour markets, in which it ranked 9th and 5th respectively out of the 138 countries assessed. The UK was third for technological readiness and scored more highly than the EU as a whole in11 of the 12 categories covered.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Britain scored less well than the EU for its macro-economic environment, largely because of its large budget deficit, high debt ratio and weak performance in savings. Despite a rise of 23 places in the category, the UK still ranks only 85th in the world. </p> <p>The three top countries in the league table \u2013 Switzerland, Singapore and the US \u2013 remain unchanged from 2015, with the rest of the top 10 made up of the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, the UK, Japan, Hong Kong and Finland.</p> <p>European countries made up half of the top 10, but the WEF said there was a marked divide between the north and south of the continent. Spain was up one place to 32nd, Italy dropped a spot to 44th and Greece dropped five places to 86th. France, the second biggest country in eurozone rose one position to 21st.</p> <p>\u201cFor all economies in Europe, maintaining and improving prosperity levels will depend heavily on their ability to harness innovation and the talents of their workforces\u201d, the WEF said. </p> <p>The report also noted an increase in both the developed and developing world in non-tariff barriers to trade, more burdensome customs procedures and tighter rules affecting both foreign direct investment and foreign ownership. The trend was most evident in high and upper middle-income countries.</p> <p>Klaus Schwab, the WEF\u2019s founder and executive chairman, said: \u201cDeclining openness in the global economy is harming competitiveness and making it harder for leaders to drive sustainable, inclusive growth.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The cartoonist Mike Stokoe neatly sums up the madness of the England job with a wonderful little sketch that hangs from one of the walls of the National Football Museum in Manchester.

Everything had been going so well after that win in Slovakia. England\u2019s next opponents are Malta a week on Saturday and three days later, to quote the man himself, there is a trip to \u201cSlovenia or something\u201d. Gareth Southgate will be in charge while the man who has overseen the shortest and most ignominious reign of any England manager will presumably have to find another home for his lucky coin. The bottom of a river, perhaps.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/sep/28/sam-allardyce-leaves-england-job-latest-news-and-reaction-live\">Sam Allardyce leaves England job: latest news and\u00a0reaction \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He is a clot, that\u2019s for sure. If you have followed Allardyce\u2019s career, the infamous Panorama documentary and the chequered past of his agent, Mark Curtis, it is not any surprise the man the FA appointed in July was ripe for a newspaper sting. It is unusual, perhaps, that it is the Daily Telegraph having a go at playing the Fake Sheikh and there are parts of its coverage that, to be blunt, are questionable, to say the least. Yet there is no doubt about it: Allardyce has caused his employer an extreme form of embarrassment. He had his chance, he blew it and one of the most arrogant men in the business will have a long time to mull over what he should have done differently.</p> <p>Whether that means he deserved to lose his job is another matter entirely and, even as a non-Allardyce fan, having questioned his relationship with Curtis more than once, it is still not entirely straightforward understanding what the FA has seen in those secretly taped recordings to warrant the guillotine.</p> <p>Presumably, the relevant people have decided it is untenable for an organisation that stands in judgment on others to employ someone who just informed two undercover reporters, posing as representatives from a football agency based in south-east Asia, that it is \u201cnot a problem\u201d to get round the rules of third-party ownership, despite the practice being banned in 2008. Yet that quote is referring to the fact that when Allardyce was managing West Ham they signed Enner Valencia despite him being precisely in that position. The ownership agreement ended when the transfer went through and West Ham signed him \u201cwhole\u201d. Something similar happened with Manchester United and Marcus Rojo. It is not a problem, as Allardyce says, getting round it.</p> <p>He should not expect a great deal of sympathy but in the grand scheme of managerial scandals it is certainly a few notches down from the passage in Joey Barton\u2019s newly released autobiography about the \u201ccreative accounting\u201d of one manager (though not one, he says, he ever played under) whose \u201cspeciality was making late substitutions on the understanding his assistant would later collect a percentage of the player\u2019s match fee\u201d. That manager, according to Barton, was infamous for giving homegrown players their debuts, sometimes just for a few minutes, so the academy director would collect a bonus, to be split again. The manager would re-sign players he had worked with at other clubs and take a cut from them, too \u2013 paid monthly, and invariably in cash.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/27/sam-allardyce-england-managers-controversies-terry-venables-fabio-capello\">England managers and off-field controversies: from Revie to Hodgson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Compare that with Allardyce\u2019s response when asked about paying people to secure business. \u201cOh, oh, you\u2019re not \u2013 do not,\u201d he says. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard that. I haven\u2019t heard that, you stupid man. What are you talking about? You idiot. You can have that conversation when I\u2019m not here.\u201d</p> <p>Allardyce is so aghast by the suggestion he leans back and drapes a napkin over his face. Later he gives the man who brought it up, his long-term friend and football agent Scott McGarvey, another going-over. \u201cYou slipped up tonight. You can\u2019t go there any more. You can\u2019t pay a player, you can\u2019t pay a manager, you can\u2019t pay a CEO. It used to happen 20 odd years ago, 30 years ago. You can\u2019t do it now. You can\u2019t do it now. Don\u2019t ever go there.\u201d None of which really falls in line with the caricature of the man who regards rules as optional.</p> <p>If this sounds like a defence of Allardyce it is merely to give that part of the story some extra prominence given the Telegraph buried the quotes somewhere near the bottom of the 2,000-word article that has brought him down. There is no Friends-of-Sam public-relations operation swinging into gear, not here anyway. This isn\u2019t the first time he has been a buffoon, far too full of his own self-importance and nothing like as streetwise or intelligent as he likes to believe.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/28/sam-allardyce-quits-england-manager-67-days-video-report\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/55xzx\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2756998\"            data-video-name=\"Sam Allardyce quits as England manager after just 67 days \u2013 video report\"            data-video-provider=\"theguardian.com\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57eb7aa7e4b08ca277ca0eeb\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/29/samfinal_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/29/samfinal_V5.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/29/samfinal.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/28/sam-allardyce-quits-england-manager-67-days-video-report\">Sam Allardyce quits as England manager after just 67 days</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Allardyce is, conversely, a more sophisticated manager than many people want to recognise. Unfortunately, he also comes across in the clandestine recordings as a 24/7 braggart operating on a mix of avarice and out-of-control ego. He often does, truth be told. He was given the job almost by default \u2013 the best bad idea the FA could come up with \u2013 and it is no surprise whatsoever he has landed himself in trouble, only that it has happened so quickly. Maybe, when the dust settles, the three FA executives who appointed him \u2013 Martin Glenn, Dan Ashworth and the vastly overrated David Gill \u2013 can explain what they did by way of due diligence. Glenn did, in fairness, warn us he was \u201cnot a football expert\u201d. His first appointment as the chief executive has been a PR disaster.</p> <p>As for Allardyce, he probably understands now what Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson meant after the Swede taught himself about the role by reading The Second Most Important Job in the Country, Niall Edworthy\u2019s account of the various England managers and how they survived the pressures. \u201cThey were more or less killed, all of them,\u201d Eriksson said. \u201cWhy should I be different?\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, Allardyce is probably entitled to a few grievances of his own. He has been accused of a potential conflict of interests by affiliating himself with a company whose clients could purportedly be England players when, in reality, it is a much more mundane truth. He made it absolutely clear that before he committed to anything he would have to run everything by the FA.</p> <p>What, you might wonder, was the greedy old fool, already on a \u00a33m\u2011a\u2011year contract, doing hawking himself around a couple of weeks after getting the England job? But that is the nature of the business, whether you like it or not. Managers exploit their position for speaking engagements, public appearances and other commercial activities, and Allardyce is not the only one who would be tempted by \u00a3400,000 (eventually bumped up to \u00a3600,000) for four \u201cmeet-and-greets and nothing else\u201d in Singapore and Hong Kong. \u201cEngland manager for sale\u201d was the headline that jumped off Tuesday\u2019s newsstands. Allardyce, the opening sentence informed us, had been using his position to negotiate the deal. Well, of course he was.</p> <p>The rest of it is the kind of standard pub talk most football people would come out with on a night out. Lots of people have questioned whether Gary Neville, Roy Hodgson\u2019s assistant, was \u201cthe wrong influence\u201d during Euro 2016. Even more have expressed wonder about the vast riches spent on rebuilding Wembley.</p> <p>Allardyce\u2019s relationship with Hodgson is bound to suffer given what he said about his predecessor being, in short, the kind of public speaker who sends his audience to sleep. The two were never close anyway and, yes, it is awkward in the extreme to hear Allardyce mimic \u201cWoy\u201d when the FA once locked horns with the Sun, calling it \u201cunacceptable\u201d for doing the same.</p> <p>Equally, this is a manager talking in what he thinks is an off-the-record environment, possibly half-cut, with an undercover journalist chucking in a question he knows may elicit an unguarded answer. \u201cWhere did Roy go wrong then, as a manager?\u201d and hey presto. It is the kind of journalism the Telegraph would once have considered beneath it and, even with a man\u2019s P45 on the way, it is difficult to find the killer line, no matter how many times you read it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/27/sam-allardyce-leaves-england-manager-role-fa\">Sam Allardyce leaves England manager job after one game in charge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The weirdest part \u2013 not that it particularly matters now \u2013 is that Allardyce did not appear to know Marcus Rashford\u2019s name, referring to him as \u201cRushford\u201d before someone in his party corrected him. No one can be sure, however, how much booze had been demolished and it is faintly ludicrous to suggest his relationship with the players may have suffered because he was on tape saying they had a \u201cpsychological barrier\u201d and could not cope with the pressures of an international tournament.</p> <p>Allardyce has said exactly the same in his interviews \u2013 more in the way of fact, rather than criticism \u2013 and the players will, for the most part, admit it anyway. Many of them were unenthused about Allardyce getting the job in the first place but, two months in, the last thing they would have wanted is the disruption of another managerial change.</p> <p>And Southgate? He turned down the caretaker role after Euro 2016 because, in part, he knew the players wanted someone with a higher standing. The whole thing is a mess and, at the heart of it, the damage to Allardyce\u2019s professional reputation is irretrievable.</p>",

He also points out New Zealand will retain all the revenue generated from the 2017 Lions tour and sees no reason to amend existing arrangements.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I get this argument,\u201d said Ritchie, stressing the northern hemisphere unions have all invested heavily in building bigger, better stadiums. \u201cIf we manage to sell out 82,000 here it\u2019s because of our efforts and because we\u2019ve invested in the stadium. If you look at the amount of money the RFU has spent on Twickenham \u2026 of course we should get a return on that. Of course they would say they want more money. There is nothing to stop Australia or New Zealand building a [bigger] stadium. Go and build a stadium if you want to increase your revenue growth. When we went to Australia in the summer we didn\u2019t get anything out of that. I didn\u2019t ask for a revenue share from Australia. And ditto from the Lions.

  "<p>It\u2019s a scene that has played out hundreds of times before, heard by millions but seen by only a small roomful of people. Bruce McAvaney, adopting the unshakable postural arc of a veteran racing caller, stands from his chair and stoops forward slightly in the Seven broadcasting booth, binoculars firmly pressed to his eyes as he motors through another rapid-fire description of the action unfolding beyond the glass. His voice deepens to the kind of ecstatic growl every football fan knows well. The growl is the same whether McAvaney\u2019s calling the opening bounce of a cut-throat final or junk time in a pre-season blowout. </p> <p>Calmly seated beside him is Dennis Cometti; immaculately blazered, liberally hairsprayed and laconic. From his chair Cometti alternates between a panoramic view of the ground, his carefully-prepared notes and a small TV monitor on the desk in front of him. He absorbs McAvaney\u2019s description through his right ear, mentally limbering up for his own entrance. The opening is something Cometti can sense from decades spent as McAvaney\u2019s co-pilot on hundreds of football broadcasts but also by his colleague\u2019s cadence \u2013 sometimes wearied and flagging but with McAvaney, just as often a spittle-inducing parabola whose upward peak pushes the limits of human oxygen intake. When Bruce\u2019s bolt is shot, his left arm comes down and he tags his offsider into the fray with a collegial hand on the shoulder. Dennis Cometti is away.</p> <p>So endures Australian sports broadcasting\u2019s premier double act, or so it has, until this weekend, when at the conclusion of the AFL grand final Cometti peels off his headset, rolls back his chair and rises next to his favourite colleague one last time. After 49 years in broadcasting \u2013 30 of them calling AFL football on network television \u2013 Dennis Cometti himself is tapping out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b516eac2c2febe73dd128ed579e5c0a51e34749\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b516eac2c2febe73dd128ed579e5c0a51e34749/0_65_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Cometti interviewing Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dennis Cometti interviews Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson before an AFL game in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Morne de Klerk/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018You can go back to the place but not the time\u2019</strong></h2> <p>To fully understand Dennis Cometti you need to start with family. To do that you have to begin with the lowlight of Cometti\u2019s life: the sudden death in 1969 of his father James, the son of working class Italian migrant Giovanni, who travelled to Australia in 1909 from Tirano in the Northern Italian Alps and walked 800km through blistering sun from Perth to find backbreaking work and a new life in the harsh, dust-swept terrain of the Meekatharra goldfields.</p> <p>When James Cometti collapsed on a Perth street and died of a heart attack his 18-year-old son and only child was busy training with WAFL team West Perth. Dennis was by that point a teen sensation. The winter before he\u2019d kicked 60 goals and played alongside the club\u2019s legendary captain-coach Graham \u201cPolly\u201d Farmer in a league semi-final. </p> <p>Expectations for Cometti\u2019s fledgling football career were lofty, and the father-son bond shared by James and Dennis had been strengthened by the game. It was James Cometti who passed on so many of the fundamentals that would later appear in his son\u2019s oft-quoted commentary. Their conversations, and all the long afternoons spent sitting side-by-side at the footy had become a roadmap for Dennis Cometti\u2019s understanding of the game.</p> <p>The day before James Cometti died, he and his son had what seemed at the time a trivial argument. Dennis returned home late from a night on the town \u2013 not the commitment to his burgeoning sports career his father expected of him. Their disagreement was not a screaming match and there were no histrionics, just disappointed silence. What they didn\u2019t know was that they\u2019d never speak again. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/27/it-still-feels-close-vin-catoggio-on-grand-final-heartbreak-and-finding-peace\">'It still feels close': Vin Catoggio on grand final heartbreak and finding peace | Russell Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt lingered on until the next day and I didn\u2019t see him in the morning and he passed away that afternoon,\u201d Cometti tells me as we look back on his life. \u201cI always felt that was a terrible thing to have happened because the relationship was so close. I was an only child and he was more a mate than he was my Dad, and just a really good bloke. I felt that I\u2019d let the team down a little bit by doing that.\u201d</p> <p>The manner in which Cometti learned of his father\u2019s death has always stuck with him, too. Razzed onto the training track by West Perth players, a young police constable accommodated his nerves by laughing at the gibes as he approached the lanky young spearhead. It was a misleading portent. Guided to the sidelines, Cometti was bluntly presented with the news: \u201cBy the way, your dad is dead.\u201d Shocked, he left the ground and had to identify the body to spare his mother Dulcie the task. </p> <p>After his father\u2019s death Cometti drifted from footy, withdrawing into himself and pushing the game away. Meanwhile, the gravitational pull of his alternative life as a rookie FM radio disc jockey was proving strong, so he only half-heartedly committed himself to West Perth and wouldn\u2019t return to the fold properly until well over a decade later, in a middling three-year stint as coach.</p> <p>\u201cWith my Dad not there, because we\u2019d really had an adventure together with footy from when I was about 11 and we\u2019d had a lot of fun with it, I think I was able to drift a lot more readily,\u201d Cometti says. \u201cHad he been there I\u2019m sure he would have pulled me into line. I respected him greatly and I would have felt that I was letting him down. When he\u2019d gone I let my standards slip because he wasn\u2019t there to safeguard my standards.\u201d</p> <p>What kind of man did Dennis Cometti become as a result of the events of March 1969? Perhaps it\u2019s best to consider a pair of facts from the life he made following his father\u2019s death. The first is that at some point, adapting the lyrics to an obscure song called Waking Up Alone by 1970s singer-songwriter Paul Williams, Cometti settled upon a revealing credo for his life: \u201cyou can go back to the place but not the time.\u201d</p> <p>The second is that despite the fame and millions of dollars that his career in broadcasting has brought him, Dennis Cometti still lives in the house he grew up in \u2013 Jack and Dulcie Cometti\u2019s family home in Perth.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018You know he\u2019s in the room\u2019</strong></h2> <p> When you speak to people who\u2019ve spent a lot of time around Dennis Cometti you encounter a few recurring observations; nobody who has ever worked alongside him has a bad word to say about the guy; his preparation for every broadcast is exhaustive \u2013 whether it\u2019s a NAB Challenge pre-season junket in Dubai or a finals blockbuster \u2013 and that the retiring broadcaster is an irreplaceable talent.</p> <p>Colleagues also talk about his <em>presence, </em>a statesmanlike aura that makes even champion footballers self-conscious in his company. \u201cYou know he\u2019s in the room,\u201d his Triple M and former Channel Seven colleague Michael Roberts says. \u201cAnd when he speaks, people listen.\u201d</p> <p>Cometti is tall, gangly and easy to imagine as his youthful self \u2013 flying high into the backs of defenders for pack marks. His long, crooked nose bends across his face like a crow swooping down from a streetlamp, a Cometti family trait he\u2019s traced back to the old country. His ears are long and droopy, lending him the air of a friendly basset hound. That face, unmistakable to old-timers when he\u2019s out and about, is a type you don\u2019t really see on TV anymore. Cometti is the Toby jug commemorative version of a 1970s newsreader.</p> <p>Most who know him mention Cometti\u2019s unique and occasionally flamboyant dress sense, which would probably sit somewhere between a comfortably unhip veteran rock star and Alan Partridge; carefully pressed denim, sunglasses and leather jackets. Older colleagues remember the youthful era in which the jeans were subbed out for outrageous leather pants. \u201cThey were fashionable leather pants, if leather pants can be fashionable,\u201d laughs Cometti\u2019s former Seven commentary colleague Drew Morphett. \u201cHe was a product of the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll era. You wouldn\u2019t see Jonathan Brown or Jason Dunstall or anybody else going out in leather pants. It became a bit of a signature for him.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgAOrWVHsz0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DgAOrWVHsz0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Dennis Cometti quits as West Perth football coach.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>When Cometti lobbed at Triple J for an appearance in the late 90s, the station\u2019s staff were delighted to note that the commentary legend not only travelled with a leather man-bag tucked under his arm but that it contained a miniature can of hairspray. Cometti\u2019s never been shy about the haircare routine. Before he goes on air he will confer with make-up artists as to the specific brand they\u2019re using, often carefully applying the finishing touches himself. The Cometti barnet is now almost as iconic as the voice \u2013 a perfectly sculpted helmet of hair. \u201cHe\u2019s rock n roll,\u201d says Roberts. \u201cYou know him in a crowd.\u201d</p> <p>As his retirement heralds the end of an era, Cometti is also one of the few remaining denizens of Australian showbiz whose employers consider worthy of limousine service. He\u2019s only ever been late to a game once, after a cancelled flight to a Sunday fixture in Adelaide, for which he didn\u2019t arrive until quarter time. His Melbourne driver, Raj, has ferried Cometti and his wife Velia around town for years. When a network boss joked that Seven were paying Raj more than some of Cometti\u2019s co-commentators, the broadcasting icon shot back: \u201cWell you should be paying your commentators more.\u201d</p> <p>Co-workers consider a ride in the Cometti limo a bit of thrill, though none can claim an anecdote as colourful as that provided by Seven boundary rider Jude Bolton. \u201cOne day we left Etihad stadium and I jumped in, myself and Dennis with Raj,\u201d Bolton tells me. \u201cI\u2019d eaten something really dodgy at Etihad Stadium during one of the calls and I just turned green. Literally green in the face.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI started getting the cold sweats and I said, \u2018I\u2019m just going to jump out at the first terminal and I\u2019ll walk to our spot.\u2019 And Dennis said, \u2018Whatever you do, don\u2019t do it in Raj\u2019s car.\u2019 So I ended up having to get out of the car and he\u2019s jumped out with me and he\u2019s helped me through it as I\u2019ve just vomited on the side of the road, and he\u2019s handing me water and telling me he hopes I\u2019m alright.\u201d Then, as Bolton gathered his composure, Cometti appraised the scene in signature style: \u201cCentimetre perfect.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnbelievable,\u201d Bolton laughs. \u201cJust one of my highlights along the way.\u201d</p> <p>Cometti\u2019s rock star transport arrangements also featured prominently in his colleague Matthew Richardson\u2019s first day in broadcasting, a story that also highlights the fastidiousness of Cometti\u2019s preparation. \u201cI remember rocking up to my first game at Subiaco,\u201d Richardson tells me. \u201cI had a coffee with him the day before. I remember being told to make sure I did my homework, so I had three or four pages of notes and I thought I was going pretty well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI pulled up in the old yellow cab there outside the gate at Subiaco feeling pretty good about things, but there was a big black limousine in front of me and out jumped Dennis Cometti. He\u2019s always got the sunglasses on and looks immaculate. He\u2019s a very cool-looking man. And here I am with my four pages of A4 notes and he gets out of this black limo with his massive briefcase of notes and immediately I just thought to myself, \u2018Gee I\u2019ve got a long way to go\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Cometti doesn\u2019t sweat football 24/7, and rarely seeks conversation about the game when he\u2019s off the clock. Richardson says they normally chat about music, pop culture and news. When I speak to Cometti myself we talk at length about gonzo journalism, The Carpenters, various JFK assassination conspiracies and his aborted documentary on the latter, which he\u2019d started tackling in his final year at the ABC.</p> <p>Cometti has diverse reading tastes and a lot of time to indulge them on long-haul flights between Perth and the east coast, on which most colleagues think he also dreams up many of his signature commentary quips. His favourite writers are Hunter S Thompson and PJ O\u2019Rourke, and he revisits Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas every year. It\u2019s rarely noted, but Cometti has been for most of his career a prolific writer himself \u2013 not just his fastidious pre-broadcast notes and Rodney Dangerfieldesque one-liners but newspaper, magazine and online columns, plus books. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/tom-wills-grave-restoration-project-reveals-footballs-heart-soul-and-history\">Tom Wills grave restoration project reveals football's heart, soul and history</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If he\u2019s given to invoking the past, with his nods to The Easybeats and Big Bob Johnson, Cometti might also be the least sentimental romantic in the business. He fulfilled radio obligations on the night his father died and read Perth TV news the night his mother passed. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make me a cold person,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/chris-beck-talks-to-dennis-cometti/2008/05/14/1210444510098.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1\">he once said</a>. \u201cBut what it does, it probably understands that life and the job run side by side.\u201d</p> <p>Cometti also missed the births of both his daughter Ricki and his son Mark due to work commitments. Mark, now a professional wrestler, was born as his Dad called a Sheffield Shield cricket match (\u201cWe named him Mark, because you\u2019ve never heard of a kid named handpass or kick,\u201d Cometti told listeners).</p> <p>He is avowedly apolitical in his broadcasting, an approach that has had the unintended consequence of courting trouble at times. He was on the mic when Sydney Swans great Adam Goodes performed his famous war dance towards Carlton fans in 2015, and drew stinging criticism for suggesting that he wouldn\u2019t have done it himself before claiming that it wasn\u2019t in Goodes\u2019 best interests either, but he has paused to consider the incident since.</p> <p>\u201cThere was nothing sinister in it,\u201d Cometti says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I fully understood what that was all about. It was certainly going to make him the centre of attention in perhaps a difficult way for him, and it turned out to be that way, although I think in the end he got more support than opposition and that was a good thing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"682981272fbb87876312f0df9f0c5814179b36f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/682981272fbb87876312f0df9f0c5814179b36f2/0_83_3781_2270/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Footballer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dennis Cometti was criticised for his reaction to a war dance performed by AFL legend Adam Goodes against West Coast in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Mcdonough/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think I said at the time that I wouldn\u2019t have done that, probably at the time not fully understanding what was involved. I didn\u2019t think it was as significant as it perhaps played out to be. But that\u2019s the problem with live television sometimes. It was the opposition cheer squad, so I thought it was provocative in that way, but it was one of those situations looking back that I probably should have bitten my lip.\u201d</p> <p>The question of keeping schtum on his own views is a recurring theme for Cometti, who prefers to remain a neutral observer. \u201cI just don\u2019t think sporting commentary is the place for them, to be honest. That\u2019s just a personal view,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a forum. The audience is certainly widespread in its political views and its views on most things in live in general, so to go too deeply or too far down that track probably does the broadcaster no good, the organisation he represents no good.\u201d</p> <p>To understand Cometti\u2019s reticence on loaded issues like gender and race, and their intersection with sport, it possibly pays to acknowledge the two people who most obviously influenced his early philosophies in life: his mother Dulcie, who was an aspiring novelist when she met Cometti\u2019s father, and his Aunt Esme Fletcher, who opened Western Australia\u2019s first child daycare centre and also a women\u2019s refuge. The strength of the women in his family had an impact on his outlook in life.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that Esme and my mother were feminists, perhaps before feminists were invented,\u201d Cometti once told SBS. \u201cWhat do I think about it? Well I think they were both admirable people. I mean, I agree with what they were on about, there\u2019s no question about that. Sometimes, it needs to be said, they saw men as the enemy and as a young man in that environment you needed to be careful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMost of what I have I owe to them ... a lot to be thankful for.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Dennis will know him back to front because he\u2019s watched the videos\u2019</strong></h2> <p>What they say about Dennis Cometti\u2019s swotting before games is true: for as long as he\u2019s been calling football on TV he\u2019s spent 15-20 hours per week watching game tapes in a room dedicated to the task. Sometimes he sits and makes notes, studying patterns of play or doing reconnaissance on new players. Other times he does a workout as he watches, chugging away on an exercise bike or the treadmill set up in front of the screen. </p> <p>Not only does this habitual process enhance his knowledge of form, tactics and precisely what he can expect from the games he\u2019ll be calling, it pays practical dividends, enabling him to nail the basics like correctly identifying players, a fundamental component of broadcasting expertise in which he often puts younger colleagues in the shade. \u201cSometimes a bloke runs straight at you and you can\u2019t see a number,\u201d notes Drew Morphett. \u201cYou know he\u2019s got blonde hair and bandy legs or something like that, but you think \u2018Who the hell is that?\u2019 if he\u2019s playing game number five or something, but Dennis will know him back to front because he\u2019s watched the videos. Dennis is fantastic at that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s been doing it for so long and his preparation is just second to none,\u201d says Matthew Richardson. \u201cThe amount of work he puts into each game is probably the thing I noticed right from the start and probably something you take away \u2013 that someone who has been doing it as long as him but was still putting in as much time as anyone on the preparation. I guess that\u2019s what makes him so good.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/bulldogs-faithful-pray-afl-miracle-wandering\">Bulldogs faithful pray for one more AFL miracle to end the wandering | Craig Little</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However Cometti\u2019s quest for knowledge doesn\u2019t extend to fraternising with players or getting to know them on a personal level. \u201cCertainly I try to avoid planes with teams on them,\u201d he tells me. \u201cObviously there\u2019s not many planes to Adelaide, so you get what you get. I get on well with the teams but there\u2019s so much small talk and you sort of get tired of that.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes Cometti has taken that separation of duties to a level that amuses colleagues. Morphett remembers waiting for him at Adelaide airport before a Crows game against West Coast. Cometti arrived on the same flight as Eagles players but went missing when Morphett was trying to find him at the baggage carousel. \u201cI\u2019m thinking \u2018where the hell is Cometti?\u2019\u201d he remembers. \u201cAll of a sudden he appears out of the dunny after half an hour. I said \u2018where have you been?\u2019. He says \u2018I don\u2019t like talking to the players. You\u2019re bumping into them all the time\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe flies by his own rules a little bit.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Spinning the platters that matter\u2019</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s impossible to see that an AFL broadcasting talent of Dennis Cometti\u2019s versatility and widespread appeal will emerge from the present media landscape, and now probably unfair to expect it. That\u2019s partly because the culture and times from which Cometti sprang \u2013 the Fleetwood Mac double shots, vaudeville wisecracks and unapologetic schmaltz of 1960s FM radio \u2013 no longer exists. </p> <p>Neither does the regimented ABC of Cometti\u2019s 14-year stint running from 1973 to 1986. On FM radio Cometti found his inner court jester. From the national broadcaster\u2019s Perth offices on Adelaide Terrace, he painstakingly learned his trade as a broadcast journalist from some of the best teachers and practitioners the country has ever produced. At the ABC there were standards to be maintained and structure to be adhered to and a proper way of doing everything; in cricket, batsmen were always named before bowlers. </p> <p>Cometti\u2019s first foray into radio was spinning the platters that mattered for Perth station 6KY, which in the late-60s battled head-to-head with 6PR for the loyalties of Perth\u2019s Top 40 radio listeners. In those formative years there was no rulebook and no internet resources to crib his style from, so Cometti imported cumbersome reel-to-reel tapes of America\u2019s best rock DJs and studied them for hours once they\u2019d finished their six-month sea freight journey to Perth. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"85025c2fea390932b3ef0b03da2a76273371ceb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85025c2fea390932b3ef0b03da2a76273371ceb4/318_265_5725_8067/710.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Cometti\" width=\"710\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 1980s promotional photograph of Network Seven AFL broadcaster Dennis Cometti.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seven Network</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cometti\u2019s first proper radio gig, in mid-1968, fell into place when an old school friend forwarded his \u201cless than sophisticated audition tape\u201d to veteran 6KY announcer Alan Robertson, who in turn got it to the station\u2019s program director John Lehman. The early days were a bit of a lark but not always smooth-sailing. In one gaffe, Cometti mispronounced a live-read ad for an incense boutique, which he described as \u201cspecialising in incest\u201d. For Cometti, each weekend brought the chance to run out onto football grounds alongside Polly Farmer and during the week he was not only lost in music, but in love. In his first summer of broadcasting he also met Velia, who he would marry.</p> <p>But if Robertson taught Cometti the fundamentals of preparing for a broadcast, and instilled in him the idea that he couldn\u2019t just fly by the seat of his pants, he also might have mentioned that nobody in broadcasting is invincible. Between Cometti\u2019s 6KY debut in 1968 and his move to the ABC in 1973, his CV \u201cread like a greyhound bus schedule.\u201d No job was safe.</p> <p>In 1971 a lack of opportunities in Perth sent him to Melbourne, where he balanced an oddball football comeback in the reserves at Ted Whitten-coached Footscray with the weekday night shift and Sundays on 3DB, Victoria\u2019s home of footy, racing and Top 40 hits. For the day job he\u2019d leave training early and jump on the 6:15 to Flinders street. \u201cMr Part-time,\u201d Whitten would call him. Seven or eight reserves games and his best-paid year in radio behind him, he was back in Western Australia.</p> <p>The sidestep into sports broadcasting didn\u2019t come until \u201873 and in unexpected circumstances: a late call-up to play second fiddle to 3KZ footy stalwart Ian Major for the Victoria-WA state game at Subiaco. Soon he was regularly calling games with WA broadcasting star Oliver Drake-Brockman (\u201cOliver could make dogs weep,\u201d Cometti once said). </p> <p>ABC program director Jim Fitzmaurice came after him not long after, with a view to the young gun calling sport full-time. Given the tumult of Cometti\u2019s previous five years the security appealed. \u201cWe were middle class and I was an only child and my mother wasn\u2019t working, so there was, if you like, a realisation that I needed to be careful with my next step,\u201d Cometti tells me.</p> <p>In the following 14 years at Aunty, Cometti refined the impeccable broadcasting habits that would form the basis of his calling style over the next four decades. At the ABC\u2019s Perth headquarters he shared a tiny office with fellow newcomer Drew Morphett. \u201cIt was 12 feet by 20 feet or something like that,\u201d remembers Morphett. \u201cWe lived in each other\u2019s pockets early on.\u201d</p> <p>Cometti was an instant hit. Morphett jokes that having slaved away trying to climb the ladder himself, he was immediately leapfrogged by his new colleague, and was told by Fitzmaurice to work around Cometti\u2019s Sunday league football coaching commitments. \u201cHe was always the favoured son,\u201d Morphett laughs. \u201cHe had it over me right from the word go.\u201d</p> <p>Experienced help was always at hand. \u201cOur superiors were <em>broadcasters</em>,\u201d Morphett says, pointing to Fitzmaurice as a key mentor. \u201cHe was a legendary broadcaster. When Jim tapped you on the shoulder and told you you were ready to go, it was coming from a good source.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe were all taught the basics of broadcasting. He (Cometti) didn\u2019t need much coaching to do football broadcasting because he was a coach and a former player. He got a very early nod to be the ABC\u2019s Test cricket caller on radio. I thought at the time it was a very quick elevation.\u201d</p> <p>Though it was an odd fit at first, Cometti rose to the challenge of calling cricket beside Alan McGilvray and former Test captain Lindsay Hassett during the 1974-75 Ashes, starting a lifetime habit of over-preparing to avoid any chance of being caught short. Each morning he\u2019d arrive with a long list of headlines to work from; weather, the toss, the batting order and other stories of the day. \u201cHe did it almost by indexing,\u201d says Morphett, \u201cso that if he ran out of something to say, he went to the next topic.\u201d</p> <p>To this day, Cometti still tenses up at the start of broadcasts the same way he did back then and delivering the opening monologue to camera has always been something of an ordeal. \u201cEven this year, I think he still probably gets nervous,\u201d says Matthew Richardson. \u201cThat\u2019s probably what makes him so good. He\u2019s not taking any call for granted no matter where it is, whether it\u2019s a big game or a final, or maybe a game between teams on the bottom of the ladder.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/20/from-the-footy-almanac-vault-barry-dickins-remembers-mud\">From the Footy Almanac vault: Barry Dickins remembers mud</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As late as the early 90s, Cometti remained so concerned about nailing his opening lines that he instituted his own homespun autocue. \u201cDennis set up this little system,\u201d says Morphett, who adds that Cometti would be mortified by people knowing. \u201cHe had a piece of dowel. He put it across the lens of the camera and he had two pieces of paper left and right of the lens, and on them he\u2019d have headlines.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe first line would be \u2018Hi, I\u2019m DC\u2019. Second line would be \u2018West Coast v Richmond\u2019. Third line would be, \u2018fighting for a finals berth\u2019 or whatever. I used to say, \u2018why have you got to write down \u2013 \u2018Hi, I\u2019m DC\u2019? It was a piece of wood across the lens of the camera and two foolscap bits of paper. This was just his way of getting under way without making any blues right from the start.\u201d</p> <p>Yet no amount of preparation could prevent the chaos around him. When a nervous Cometti took the chair for his first ever stint at the mic in a Test, during the Perth Test of 1974, he was mortified when he turned and realised his expert offsider Hassett had picked up his trademark pipe and wandered off into the distance for a smoke. \u201cIn many ways that day was helpful,\u201d Cometti later noted, \u201cif for no other reason than to illustrate how isolated and vulnerable broadcasters could be.\u201d</p> <p>Cometti himself has grown into a thoughtful and generous colleague, ever-conscious of injecting his less experienced co-workers into the broadcast and putting them at ease. Before Richardson\u2019s debut broadcast as a Seven boundary rider and knowing he was nervous, Cometti and McAvaney walked down to the fence together and reassured him that he\u2019d be fine. \u201cRight from day one I was made to feel welcome by Dennis,\u201d Richardson says.</p> <p>That extends to the call itself. \u201cHe always throws down to you in a great way and brings you into the conversation with a perfect little lead-in,\u201d says Seven newcomer Jude Bolton. \u201cThat\u2019s made my transition as easy as possible.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl7y7zlsJqE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Hl7y7zlsJqE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Dennis Cometti calls the 2011 Meredith Gift.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Such grace and care for co-callers also helps Cometti\u2019s own image, says his long-time colleague Michael Roberts. \u201cHe\u2019s looking after you, looking after the brand, and looking after himself,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cThere\u2019s blokes that I work with that just get their kicks out of putting you on the spot and getting a laugh out of seeing you stuff up. But Dennis is all about looking after you. He\u2019s a team player. He looks after his team-mates and he makes sure that the brand is winning.\u201d</p> <p>At the ABC Cometti was actually being groomed as McGilvray\u2019s long-term replacement, though his bosses might have known that jig was up when he knocked back a chance to accompany the cricket broadcasting great on an Ashes tour, preferring instead to focus his energies on the WAFL season at hand. It\u2019s rarely mentioned these days but Cometti\u2019s cricket broadcasting days spanned from that fiery 1974-75 Ashes through the World Series schism and the troubled early seasons of the Border years, and he\u2019d also return for Seven in the 1990s, calling Australia\u2019s 1997 tour of South Africa.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb-XKc8Idnw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gb-XKc8Idnw?start=240&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=240\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Dennis Cometti calling Australia\u2019s 1997 Test tour of South Africa.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Cricket was also the scene of one of his rare tantrums. Ray \u201cSlug\u201d Jordon once recalled an ABC call of a New Zealand-Sri Lanka one-day international at Bellerive Oval, for which the ABC was provided 30-minute shifts each from the travelling Nine TV broadcast team \u2013 Richie Benaud, Bill Lawry, Tony Greig and Ian Chappell.</p> <p>To get into the broadcast area both sets of callers needed to ascend a narrow and amateurishly-constructed piece of scaffolding, which gave the operation the feel of a tree house. Chairs, desks and broadcast equipment had been lifted into position with a rugged pulley system. Cometti started to baulk. Come the morning shift, Benaud hit his head on the scaffolding as he climbed a rickety ladder. </p> <p>\u201cThat was the end for Richie,\u201d said Jordon, \u201cand Dennis spat the dummy in sympathy. Richie retreated to the luxury of the channel Nine box while Dennis headed back to his hotel room and locked the door.\u201d By 1987, when Cometti departed the ABC to star in Broadcom\u2019s VFL football coverage en route to Seven, his days of schlepping around on a public service budget were done.</p> <p>We forget it now, because his name is synonymous with AFL, but Cometti has been a versatile caller in the past two decades, an adaptability that came from those days at the ABC. His calls of Kieren Perkins\u2019 1500m gold medal and Susie O\u2019Neill\u2019s triumphs at Atlanta \u201896 are classics in the annals of Australian sports broadcasting. As ever, success came from preparation. \u201cHe just did the homework and worked hard at it,\u201d Morphett says. \u201cHe would just find a little corner in the broadcast centre and just be poring over notes and preparing himself perfectly.\u201d </p> <h2>\u2018He was a very quiet man\u2019</h2> <p>If Dennis Cometti will be remembered best for his iconic one-liners, what will be missed most is his voice \u2013 a deep and humming baritone that croons its way through football matches. When Dennis Cometti calls upon his entire vocal range and enunciates it\u2019s as though the words are echoing up from the bottom of a French oak wine barrel.</p> <p>Cometti is not really sure where that voice came from, but says there\u2019s some similarities with his father\u2019s. \u201cHe was a very quiet man,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not to say he didn\u2019t have a deep, manly voice, my father. It was hardly ever raised in anger or raised in any way. It was just a different time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t like me getting too loud at the footy and I suppose that tempered my view in terms of when I do the broadcast now. I certainly don\u2019t have any skin in the game. I don\u2019t barrack for teams. As a result I find that helpful. He sort of imbued me with that in the early days when I\u2019d get a little too vocal.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/14/afl-and-nrl-grand-final-entertainment-the-worse-it-is-the-better-it-is\">AFL and NRL grand final entertainment: the worse it is, the better it is | Russell Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the Cometti pipes have been passed on his professional wrestler son Mark, who could prove one of football\u2019s great father-son selections if things go right. \u201cHe\u2019s got a better voice than I have,\u201d Cometti says. \u201cI think he\u2019s flirting with the idea of going into broadcasting and I\u2019m trying to help him a little bit at the moment, because he\u2019s back nursing a shoulder injury in Perth. He was supposed to be my superannuation package when I sent him away but now he\u2019s back here.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018You can have a good time at the footy\u2019</h2> <p>As he crosses the finishing line on a 49-year broadcasting career, Cometti is by such a margin the numero uno of AFL broadcasting that you forget it wasn\u2019t always so. In the late 80s and early 90s there was a perception on the eastern seaboard, quite unfair, that he favoured his home-state West Coast Eagles. At times Seven overlooked him for key finals, and he certainly wasn\u2019t the face of the network\u2019s coverage.<br></p> <p>He first moved to Seven in 1988, the season after his shambolic and strange year with Broadcom, joining the likes of McAvaney, Morphett, Sandy Roberts, Don Scott and Peter Landy as household names in AFL states. Though Seven still has the strongest claim on Cometti, it\u2019s also true to say that through the 1990s, neither they nor the staid nature of sports broadcasting in Australia allowed him to emerge as the universally-loved caller we now know.</p> <p>\u201cThere was no overt \u2018you can\u2019t do that\u2019,\u201d Cometti says of that period, \u201cit was just that you understood the environment you were in, and it was very hardcore football.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f1a80c139743a9b91e388d766ca02a4ef84999fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1a80c139743a9b91e388d766ca02a4ef84999fa/298_58_3212_4521/710.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Cometti\" width=\"710\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A promotional photograph of Network Seven AFL broadcaster Dennis Cometti.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seven Network</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was out of the great TV rights war of 2001 that Cometti was able to find a new gear and unprecedented levels of popularity where so many other callers of his generation faded from view or disappeared from our TV screens entirely. Drafted in alongside Eddie McGuire as a star attraction of the Channel Nine team, he spent six years reinventing himself as the most consistently entertaining caller in the business, an evolution in his calling style that Nine encouraged.</p> <p>Cometti likens the transition period to a rediscovery of his lazy late-1960s days out at the footy, when he\u2019d try to make his friends laugh on the banks of Leederville oval in Perth, whose amphitheater design allowed wisecracks to ring out across the ground. \u201cYou can have a good time at the footy,\u201d he says. \u201cNot to the detriment of the game and not pushing yourself up, but a few lines here or there in the course of the afternoon \u2013 particularly if the game is a little dull \u2013 doesn\u2019t add up to much time compared to the game itself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy recollections of the footy was that you went and had a good time and you made a lot of smart alec remarks about the players and whatever else might be happening. It\u2019s probably an insight into my personality that I do like to do that. I probably am a bit of a smart alec, which may have come from being in the disc jockey business and trying to be funny. I had no trouble just trying to be me. I felt that sometimes I pulled back from that in the early days at Seven.\u201d </p> <p>By 2008, when Nine lost the rights and Cometti returned to Seven, the network\u2019s bosses were more than happy to let him do his own thing. Entertainment was back on the agenda. \u201cYou can\u2019t be making light of what\u2019s happening too often,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting line to walk, and you can\u2019t be disrespectful. The contest is the thing. It\u2019s everything.\u201d</p> <p>But what Cometti has learned across his career is that a special kind of relationship develops between commentator and listener, one that needs to be tended to. Some callers, he says, prefer to keep the audience at a distance and not reveal much of themselves, but for Cometti it\u2019s been a gradual process of letting people in. He wants his fans to know him, to see who he is.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes you can watch a bloke on TV for 20 or 25 years and really be none the wiser about who he is,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is not a criticism. That is a choice that someone has made and they can do it very well. I\u2019m of the opinion, if I watch and invest so much time in somebody or something, I would like at the end of that to know someone I\u2019ve spent all that time with a little better.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s how I view a relationship: you\u2019ve gotta let people in. Some people say it\u2019s not a relationship, but I think it is. For me, that was important. To have people say \u2018he seems like a reasonable bloke\u2019. When I finished I wanted to be better known to the people I was broadcasting to, especially if they\u2019d put that time and energy into listening to me. I owe them a debt of gratitude.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018We don\u2019t live in each other\u2019s pocket but we work in each other\u2019s pocket\u2019</h2> <p>Of course Dennis Cometti\u2019s disappearance from our TV screens means not only the loss of a singular broadcasting talent but also spells the end of his enduring double-act with McAvaney, with whom he\u2019s formed a professional dynamic that will be impossible for Seven to replicate. Dennis and Bruce. Bruce and Dennis. They\u2019re like an old couple, right down to the biscuits McAvaney brings to every game, always from the same shop on Flinders lane.</p> <p>Their longstanding rapport has been possible due to immense mutual respect and the kind of casual comfort among each other that allows them to sit alone at opposite ends of hotel dining rooms without acknowledging one another, lest they stifle their on-air chemistry. \u201cWe\u2019re such good friends we can tell each other to bugger off,\u201d Cometti once said. Another key to their partnership, he thinks, is that they never compete against each other for attention. Each caller knows his role.</p> <p>When I talk to Cometti about the closeness of that bond, I mention a theory floated by ESPN\u2019s Tony Kornheiser about his on-air partnership with his PTI co-host and friend Michael Wilbon; that the secret to the successful on-air partnership is like the old joke made by the Wimbledon groundskeepers when they\u2019re asked how they keep the courts so green: you just start with 5000 years of rain. Cometti laughs. He and Bruce have had their 5000 years of rain, and they\u2019re sad that it\u2019s coming to an end.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s never been a harsh word,\u201d Cometti says. \u201cWe\u2019re good friends. We don\u2019t live in each other\u2019s pocket but we work in each other\u2019s pocket. It\u2019s been a wonderful relationship. I\u2019ve got the utmost respect for him.\u201d</p> <p>For those around them, it\u2019s also the end of an era. \u201cAs long as I can remember, it\u2019s been \u2018Bruce and Dennis\u2019, you know? You can\u2019t replace that overnight,\u201d says Matthew Richardson. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s irreplaceable really. Not many Dennis Cometti\u2019s come along in broadcasting. I guess it\u2019s like a superstar footballer. They only come along once in a while. I guess it\u2019s going to be the same with Dennis and that\u2019s the challenge \u2013 finding that chemistry up in the box when he does retire.\u201d</p> <p>The only time Cometti seems anything other than comfortable in his decision to call it quits is when he discusses Bruce. \u201cHe is certainly the thing I will miss most from broadcasting footy,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll treasure it for the rest of my life. I envy my replacement in that regard.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m starting to punish myself now\u2019</h2> <p>As his final game approaches, Cometti is at pains to point something out: he\u2019s not quitting football broadcasting per se, he is just retiring from travelling. \u201cThe weekend before last I had three games in three states,\u201d he says. \u201cNow a man of my advancing years can\u2019t be doing that too often.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cI just feel that now I\u2019m not enjoying it because of the travel. Once I\u2019m at the ground and being with Bruce and watching the game, and Hamish and Basil on Sundays, it\u2019s terrific. It\u2019s really good fun. I\u2019ve met some great people along the way, and that\u2019s all good and well, but at the same time you think \u2018I\u2019m starting to punish myself now\u2019. At my age it\u2019s probably not the time to be taking the punishment.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s been mooted that he wouldn\u2019t mind calling some local games. \u201cI could wander down to the WAFL and just sit in on the telecast,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d like that. It\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, because not many go to the WAFL, but that\u2019s where my youth is. I\u2019m sort of mired back in the 50s and 60s\u201d. But he\u2019s not so keen on learning nine new team lists and says \u201cit\u2019s all up in the air\u201d for now. </p> <p>\u201cI could see myself being an \u2018expert\u2019 in inverted commas,\u201d he adds. \u201cAs a failed coach I\u2019m perfectly credentialed to do that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/28/the-joy-of-six-afl-player-coach-feuds\">The Joy of Six: AFL player-coach feuds | Russell Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Either way Cometti will continue his association with Seven, doing some blogging and filling the odd gap for Western Australian events. His mood after the grand final, he thinks, will depend on how his call has gone. \u201cIf I thought the broadcast has gone well, I\u2019ll probably have a little elation after the grand final, you know, that you got through.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve made the choice and I\u2019m comfortable with it. I\u2019m looking forward to the game, but I\u2019m also looking forward to the Sunday night after it when I go out for dinner. I dunno what that tells me. I\u2019ll be happy with the decision.\u201d</p> <p>Cometti is also happy for fans to remember him at his peak, rather than hanging on too long. \u201cA lot of people are talking to me now, saying that it might be a Johnny Farnham retirement,\u201d he jokes. \u201cI use the analogy that sooner or later, if you stay out long enough, forget about Johnny Farnham, you become Meatloaf. So we don\u2019t want to do that either.\u201d</p> <p>And that is more or less that. Though not quite. Just when I think I\u2019m done sifting over Dennis Cometti\u2019s life in broadcasting and finished speaking to the people who\u2019ve sat beside him along the way, a phone call arrives one morning from the man himself. Our conversation has stirred a memory in him and his effort to call back and share it seems revealing of his professional generosity.</p> <p>At this stage Greater Western Sydney are still a decent shot of making their first AFL grand final, and with that in mind Dennis has remembered an anecdote he thinks would work perfectly. In 2011, before the Giants had played a single league game, Cometti was receiving a tour of their training facilities when then-assistant coach Mark Williams roped him into giving the fledgling club\u2019s young players a pep talk. </p> <p>He hadn\u2019t thought of it again until earlier this season when he bumped into Williams again, and the coach thought Cometti would get a kick out of knowing that the Giants had picked a choice phrase out of the motivational spiel and had it plastered over their locker room walls: \u201cYou can go back to the place but not to the time.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Support our journalism with a <a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/au/supporter?INTCMP=mem_au_editorial_cometti_footer\">monthly</a> or <a href=\"https://contribute.theguardian.com/au?INTCMP=co_au_editorial_cometti_footer\">one-off</a> contribution to Guardian Australia</p>",
  "<p>You might think the worst Star Wars movie of all time has to be The Phantom Menace, the film that introduced Jar Jar Binks, midichloreans and the tedious galactic senate. But you\u2019d be wrong, for there are far worse episodes of the long-running space saga lurking in the more fetid corners of a galaxy far, far away. </p> <p>First up is the 1978 Star Wars Holiday Special, featuring an obviously wasted Carrie Fisher, what seems like hours of wookie grunting, and a deeply weird segue in which <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CRTow8hFvM\">Chewbacca\u2019s freaky-looking dad, Lumpy, has a private sexual moment with his brand-new virtual reality machine</a>.

The ewoks achieve this goal by enlisting the help of some fairies (who help to distract the giant, hairy, bipedal hog-nosed alien) and a horse to ferry them about. There is never any explanation of how an animal from 21st-century Earth, let alone the magical winged creatures of European folklore, ended up on the frickin\u2019 forest moon of Endor.</p> <p>The most interesting thing about Caravan of Courage and its sequel, 1985\u2019s Ewoks: The Battle for Endor, is that up until recently they were the only live-action Star Wars movies not to feature a single member of either the Skywalker or Solo clans. Even the appalling prequel trilogy placed whingy teen Jedi knight Anakin Skywalker centre stage.</p> <p>JJ Abrams might have chosen to go a different way with last year\u2019s Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but instead made the decision to bring back the three major stars of the classic 70s and 80s films. He even gave us a new Solo scion, in the darkling form of Adam Driver\u2019s Kylo Ren, to replace departing sardonic space scoundrel Han. And it worked: fans young and old instantly understood the new movie as a continuation of the story begun by Lucas with 1977\u2019s Star Wars, the decision to reveal that Han and Leia\u2019s son had turned to the dark side was an ingenious tool to revive near-legendary characters while also moving the story forward. </p> <p>And yet, by confirming Star Wars\u2019 dependence on its traditional clans, might Abrams also have unwittingly derailed Disney\u2019s plans to widen the scope of the space saga? Because the other movie to shift away from the series\u2019 focus on the Skywalker and Solo families is the upcoming Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, and this far out from the film\u2019s 16 December release date, fans don\u2019t seem to be clutching it to their breasts with anything like the level of gusto that welled up months before The Force Awakens actually arrived in multiplexes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/01/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-reshoots-disney\">Rogue One: A Star Wars Story set for reshoots to 'lighten film's mood'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This time last year, the Disney publicity machine had just made the jump to hyper space. Websites were full of stories suggesting that Abrams\u2019 film might challenge Avatar for the mantle of highest-grossing movie of all time (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/06/star-wars-the-force-awakens-becomes-highest-grossing-film-of-all-time-in-us\">it succeeded at the domestic box office while falling short worldwide</a> thanks to widespread indifference in China.) But <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/film/news/star-wars-rogue-one-vs-force-awakens-bob-iger-1201866852/\">Disney chief Bob Iger admitted last week that Rogue One is unlikely to match its predecessor\u2019s $2.1bn global take</a>, and there\u2019s a general sense that Gareth Edwards\u2019 movie might now have to settle for being little more than an appetizer for Rian Johnson\u2019s Episode VIII, rather than the full-fat, regular calorie Star Wars installment fans had been hoping for.</p> <p>Rogue One centers on the band of rebel grunts who stole the plans to the first Death Star, and is led by Felicity Jones\u2019 Jyn Erso. This week has seen <a href=\"http://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/tv/fall-star-valene-kane-admits-11935240\">reports that Irish actor Valene Kane will play the character\u2019s mother, Lyra</a> (possibly in flashback), and we know that Jyn\u2019s father Galen (Mads Mikkelsen) will play a vital role in events. Edwards\u2019 film is being pitched as very much a standalone movie, so it\u2019s unlikely the Ersos are being set up to join the grand pantheon of Star Wars families. Still, there they stand, somehow expected to have the same impact as more famous clans did in earlier movies.</p> <p>Rogue One faces further challenges, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/01/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-reshoots-disney\">such as June\u2019s damaging reports of reshoots</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/rogue-one-drama-writer-tony-916695\">more recent suggestions</a> that Edwards, the British director of 2014\u2019s semi-decent Godzilla, is now being supervised in the edit room by Michael Clayton\u2019s Tony Gilroy. There\u2019s also the fact that the new installment seems to be jettisoning lightsaber battles and the eternal battle between the dark and light sides of the Force \u2013 all the good stuff, in other words \u2013 in favor of highlighting the lives of those citizens of a galaxy far, far away who have to deal with the fallout every time the Empire decides to mash up a new planet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/15/rogue-one-panel-star-wars-celebration-europe\">What we learned from the Rogue One panel at Star Wars Celebration Europe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lucasfilm of course deserves praise for deviating from the traditional Star Wars path, and showing us a side to the saga that we\u2019ve not yet seen. And yet the timing of Rogue One\u2019s imminent debut in cinemas is troubling: just as Abrams has confirmed what ingredients these movies need to find success with audiences and critics, other film-makers have been asked to deliver something completely different.</p> <p>Disney\u2019s plans for a Marvel-style Star Wars cinematic universe won\u2019t be completely ruined if Rogue One is only a middling hit, but the studio will be forced to embark on a planned trilogy of Alden Ehrenreich-led young Han Solo movies from a position of weakness. And critics will begin to question if the beloved space opera really has foundations strong enough to support oodles of spin-off movies alongside the main saga. Iger revealed last week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/22/star-wars-anthology-movie-2020-disney-confirms-rogue-one\">a new writer has been recruited for a mysterious 2020 Star Wars film</a>, details of which remains nebulous. But will we really ever get to see it if Rogue One struggles?</p> <p>Star Wars is unlikely to ever plumb the depths of Caravan of Courage again, but you have to wonder why Lucasfilm failed to learn its lesson from the independently-produced TV spinoff. Star Wars without the Skywalkers and Solos is like Batman without Bruce Wayne, Harry Potter without Ron and Hermione, James Bond without M and Moneypenny. </p> <p>It\u2019s not that audiences can\u2019t be persuaded, in the long-run, to buy into adventures with new heroes, but the chances of them doing so straight off the bat are probably up there with the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field with Imperial star destroyers on one\u2019s tail. Still, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvJDItC6tE0\">at least Star Wars fans have seen those odds beaten before</a>.</p>",

Yet wasn\u2019t it rich Victorian colonial westerners who commercialised an industrial ivory trade&#xa0;in the first place?</p> <p>Today the vast majority of African nations favour banning ivory markets, knowing that history has shown, time and again, that an&#xa0;uncorrupted, legal ivory trade is one of conservation\u2019s great canards?</p> <p>Between 1975 and 1989, legalised trade halved African elephant numbers and enriched traders, not rural communities.

So what does this mean? Thanks to <a href=\"http://priceofoil.org/content/uploads/2016/09/OCI_the_skys_limit_2016_FINAL_2.pdf\">a report by Oil Change International</a>, we can now answer this question with a degree of precision.</p> <p>Using the industry\u2019s own figures, it shows that burning the oil, gas and coal in the fields and mines that is already either in production or being developed, is likely to take the global temperature rise beyond 2C. And even if all coal mining were to be shut down today, the oil and gas lined up so far would take it past 1.5C. The notion that we can open any new reserves, whether by fracking for gas, drilling for oil or digging for coal, without scuppering the Paris commitments is simply untenable.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are tax breaks for North Sea oil and gas companies, and fracking, but not of course for renewables</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is not an extreme precautionary case. Quite the opposite, in fact: the report uses the hazard assessment adopted by the United Nations. This means a 66% chance of preventing 2C of global warming and a 50% chance of preventing 1.5C \u2013 an assumption of risk that in any other field would be regarded as reckless.</p> <p>Even so, to prevent the odds from becoming any worse, a 2C target means that we can use only around 85% of the fossil fuel that\u2019s currently good to go, while a 1.5C target means we can extract little more than a third (the figures are explained <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/136987/recalculating-climate-math\">by the US environmentalist Bill McKibben in an article in New Republic</a>). So what\u2019s the point of developing new reserves if the Paris agreement precludes the full extraction of those already in production?</p> <p>The only means of reconciling governments\u2019 climate change commitments with the opening of new coal mines, oilfields and fracking sites is carbon capture and storage: extracting carbon dioxide from the exhaust gases of power stations and burying it in geological strata. But despite vast efforts to demonstrate the technology, it has not been proved at scale, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/25/uk-cancels-pioneering-1bn-carbon-capture-and-storage-competition\">and appears to be going nowhere</a>. Our energy policies rely on vapourware.</p> <p>As for the belief among some governments that they can overshoot the climate targets, then at a later date suck carbon dioxide out of the air: this depends on scenarios that would be <a href=\"http://kevinanderson.info/blog/the-hidden-agenda-how-veiled-techno-utopias-shore-up-the-paris-agreement/\">no less realistic if they involved sorcery</a>. The most popular proposal is to combine the capture and storage phantasm with biofuel plantations covering an area between one and three times the size of India, then harvesting the material they grow, burning it in power stations and burying the emissions. The use of a mere few hundred million hectares of fertile land would have to compete with all the other problems the biofuel wand is meant to magic away, such as the use of petroleum in cars and kerosene in planes, as well as the minor issue of feeding the world\u2019s people.</p> <p>All this nonsense is a substitute for a simple proposition: stop digging. There is only one form of carbon capture and storage that is scientifically proven, and which can be deployed immediately: leaving fossil fuels in the ground.</p> <p>Not developing fossil fuel reserves is much easier than breaking them open then having to close them later. As the Oil Change report points out, shutting working mines and wellheads means confronting and compensating companies that have invested heavily in production, and retraining and re-employing the people who would lose work. Some of this will have to happen anyway, if governments are to honour their promise in Paris. But their effort should be to minimise pain, not to extend it.</p> <p>Their choices are as follows. First: a gradual, managed decline of existing production and its replacement with renewable energy and low-carbon infrastructure, which offer great potential for employment. Second: allowing fossil fuel production to continue at current rates for a while longer, followed by a sudden and severe termination of the sector, with dire consequences for both jobs and economies. Third: continuing to produce fossil fuels as we do today, followed by climate breakdown. Why is this a hard choice to make?</p> <p>Our governments seem determined to choose option three. Globally, <a href=\"http://priceofoil.org/content/uploads/2016/09/OCI_the_skys_limit_2016_FINAL_2.pdf\">some $14tr is being lined up </a>for new fossil fuel extraction and freight over the next 20 years.

This year it began melting a month earlier than usual.</p> <p><a href=\"https://news.agu.org/press-release/melting-ice-sheet-could-release-frozen-cold-war-era-waste/\">The researchers studied US army documents and drawings</a> to work out how deep the camp and its waste \u2013 estimated to include 200,000 litres of diesel fuel, similar quantities of waste water and unknown amounts of radioactive coolant and toxic organic pollutants such as PCBs \u2013 were buried.</p> <p>Then they ran regional and global climate change simulations to work out how much longer they would remain interred. Based on the \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d climate change scenario, Colgan said, snowfall would continue to be greater than ice melt for a few more decades. \u201cBut after that, melt will be greater than snow. Every year, another layer of ice will be removed. Our estimate is that by 2090, the exposure will be irreversible. It could happen sooner if the magnitude of climate change accelerates.\u201d</p> <p>Once that starts to happen, the question of who is responsible for the clear-up \u2013 already the subject of discussion \u2013 will become more pressing, the report said, presenting \u201can entirely new form of political dispute resulting from climate change\u201d.<br></p> <p>With no established agreement on the question, the report says the \u201cmultinational, multi-generational\u201d problem posed by Camp Century and its waste could become a source of tension between the US, Greenland and Denmark.</p> <p>Denmark allowed the US to build Camp Century and other bases on Greenland in a 1951 agreement, but it is not clear how much it was told about the work being done there or the waste left behind. Complicating matters further, Greenland became largely self-governing in 1979.</p> <p>Vittus Qujaukitsoq, Greenland\u2019s foreign minister, said he was concerned about the camp\u2019s future and determined to establish responsibility. His Danish counterpart, Kristian Jensen, has said the issue was being examined in close contact with Greenland.</p> <p>The Pentagon has said it \u201cacknowledges the reality of climate change and the risk it poses\u201d for Greenland, adding that the US government has pledged to \u201cwork with the Danish government and the Greenland authorities to settle questions of mutual security\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>Northern Ireland is the most contented region of the UK, while London is the most anxious and least satisfied, according to statistics on local wellbeing published on Tuesday. </p> <p>It will be little comfort to stressed-out, dissatisfied Londoners that their overall satisfaction has improved faster than other parts of the country. </p> <p>The survey by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which is part of the larger labour force survey with 158,000 respondents, asks people to rate out of 10 their overall satisfaction with their life, the extent to which they feel things they do are worthwhile, how happy they felt yesterday, and how anxious they felt the previous day. The national data, published in July, shows wellbeing has improved each year since 2011, but this masks regional differences.</p> <p>These differences are not large, but taken together they paint a nuanced national picture. In Northern Ireland, for example, people ranked their life satisfaction at 7.85 out of 10 on average. In London this was 7.51. Londoners rated their own anxiety at 3.04 out of 10, while those in the West Midlands put it at 2.75. Those in Northern Ireland put their happiness at 7.70, while for those in the north-east it was 7.36. </p> <p>The data includes almost every local authority, but sample sizes for many are very small, meaning comparing the regional picture is more reliable. The Northamptonshire town of Corby came bottom on life satisfaction and worthwhile measurements. However this was based on responses from 80 people. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0b45edfc60421bc5b455693c3dd7954232381c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0b45edfc60421bc5b455693c3dd7954232381c9/0_0_3968_2380/1000.jpg\" alt=\"London Canary wharf and council houses\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In London \u2018the very poor and extremely rich live within sight of one another\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photofusion/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The national \u201cwellbeing index\u201d was one of David Cameron\u2019s flagship policies when he entered Downing Street. \u201cIt\u2019s time we admitted that there\u2019s more to life than money and it\u2019s time we focused <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/nov/14/david-cameron-wellbeing-inquiry\">not just on GDP but on GWB \u2013 general wellbeing</a>,\u201d he said, and ordered the ONS to start gathering data.</p> <p>Annie Quick, who leads inequality and wellbeing work at the New Economics Foundation, a thinktank that has championed the gathering of such data, said London\u2019s gloom may be understandable. \u201cThere are real challenges about living in cities,\u201d she said. \u201cCommuting is very bad for wellbeing: the long periods of time spent travelling to work are ... bad for our families, and bad for community cohesion.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The deeply unequal nature of London, where the very poor and extremely rich live within sight of one another, adds to dissatisfaction, she added.</p> <p>But Northern Ireland\u2019s apparent contentment has the experts confused \u2013 one press officer blurted out, \u201cReally?\u201d when the Guardian explained the ONS\u2019s findings. </p> <p>Quick said: \u201cNorthern Ireland is really interesting: if you go to Northern Ireland and talk to them, they are very surprised. We don\u2019t have the answer.\u201d</p> <p>The local authority of Mid and East Antrim in Northern Ireland tops the table on \u201clife satisfaction\u201d and \u201cworthwhile\u201d measures and is second on the \u201chappiness\u201d measure. Its mayor, Audrey Wales, said she was delighted with the finding. </p> <p>\u201cEnsuring the good health and wellbeing of our citizens is a key strategic aim for Mid and East Antrim borough council and we are delighted that this survey shows that we are certainly going in the right direction.\u201d </p> <p>She added: \u201cWith a rich heritage and culture, our borough is a beautiful, welcoming and unique place with a huge offering for its citizens and visitors alike. What sets us apart is our strong community spirit and the diversity of our citizens.\u201d</p> <p>Quick said the things that affect wellbeing are well known: good-quality housing and environment, stable jobs, and functioning communities. Simply asking people how happy they feel incorporates these factors, she said, but \u201cit\u2019s a very sensitive measure that picks up all sorts of other things ... The challenge is for local authorities to look at those things.\u201d</p> <p>Dawn Snape, a quality of life officer at the ONS, said: \u201cWe have seen personal wellbeing improving on a UK-wide basis over the past five years. But today\u2019s data paints a richer picture, enabling people to explore what\u2019s been happening in their local area.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThis will help individuals, communities and local authorities to look at wellbeing locally alongside other more traditional measures of progress.\u201d</p> <p>Quick said the UK is a \u201cworld leader\u201d at gathering these statistics. But she added: \u201cWe need to embed this thinking into devolution debates: these are often focusing on maximising economic growth but building the economy is a means to an end. What could be more important than making sure we have good quality of life?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Deutsche Bank is facing questions about whether it can afford a penalty of $14bn (\u00a310.5bn) from the US Department of Justice for mis-selling mortgage bonds a decade ago. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/26/deutsche-bank-share-price-lowest-mid-1980s\">Shares in Germany\u2019s biggest bank have sunk to near-30-year lows</a> and are trading just above \u20ac10 a share, illustrating investors\u2019 concerns that they will be asked to bolster the institution\u2019s coffers through a cash call. </p> <p>Shareholders are in turn wondering whether the bank should have acted sooner to preserve its financial health and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/sep/26/its-no-surprise-berlin-is-telling-deutsche-bank-its-on-its-own\">whether the German government will step in to prevent a collapse</a>.</p> <h2>How did it come to this?</h2> <p>Once a big beast of the banking world, Deutsche Bank is grappling with a string of problems that are raising questions about its need to gain more funds in order to survive. </p> <p>John Cryan, the Briton who took the helm at the bank 14 months ago, already faced a daunting task in turning around the bank even before its situation worsened in the face of reports it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/16/deutsche-bank-14bn-dollar-fine-doj-q-and-a\">could face a $14bn penalty from the US Department of Justice</a> for bond mis-selling.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/26/deutsche-bank-share-price-lowest-mid-1980s\">Deutsche Bank shares fall to lowest level since mid-1980s</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cryan is tackling the problems in the investment banking arm that generated 85% of its revenue but lost its shine after a string of scandals \u2013<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/23/deutsche-bank-hit-by-record-25bn-libor-rigging-fine\"> including a \u00a31.7bn fine for rigging Libor </a> \u2013 hit the bank. The reputational hits were accompanied by new regulations put in place after the banking crisis that made it tougher for banks to make profits. The bank\u2019s costs are also too high, so Cryan has embarked on a plan to axe a quarter of the workforce and raise capital by selling its Chinese arm and retail business Postbank.</p> <p>However, matters have been complicated by a prolonged low interest rate environment, which has made Deutsche Bank investors realise it would be difficult for the bank to generate as much revenue as it did in the past. It also expected the penalty for mortgage bonds mis-sold a decade ago in the US to be closer to $2.5bn.</p> <p>\u201c[Deutsche Bank] finds itself in the position it is because of a failure to shrink its balance sheet, cut costs and restructure when times were good,\u201d said Tim Crockford, European equities portfolio manager at fund manager Hermes.</p> <h2>Why does Deutsche Bank matter?</h2> <p>The bank\u2019s assets are valued at about \u20ac1.8tn (\u00a31.5tn), which is half the size of the German economy. This illustrates the size and scale of the bank. </p> <p>Even before the bank\u2019s latest crisis emerged, the International Monetary Fund had been sounding the alarm about the significance of Deutsche Bank on the world stage, saying it \u201cappears to be the most important net contributor to systemic risks\u201d. It is a key player in the market for derivatives, which are complex financial instruments used in a range of activities from insuring against interest movements to taking bets on stock market movements. These products were at the heart of the 2008 global crisis when a collapse in US property prices hit valuations of certain derivatives. </p> <h2>What would happen if it collapsed like Lehman Brothers did?</h2> <p>On the basis of the IMF\u2019s assessment, the consequences of a Deutsche Bank collapse could be worse than the signature event of the global banking crisis. However, few are predicting that the bank will go the way of Lehman. Christopher Wheeler, banks analyst at Atlantic Equities, points out that Deutsche Bank is not running out of cash, as it has \u20ac250bn of readily sellable assets it can sell to meet any demands from customers.</p> <p>Shareholders are alarmed, though. Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares have fallen more than 50% this year and so far that its stock market value is now approximately \u20ac14.5bn \u2013 or in dollar terms barely $2bn more than the proposed $14bn penalty.</p> <h2>Will the German government bail out its flagship bank?</h2> <p>This looks unlikely. Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s chancellor, would not want to prop up a bank that survived the 2008 crisis without a bailout. And even if she wanted to do so, new rules mean bond holders would be forced to take losses first. But if it was a last resort, analysts have said they expect her to intervene. </p> <h2>What are the options?</h2> <p>The one that shareholders fear is a cash call on shareholders, although the shares have fallen so low that any capital raising would dilute existing investors. The market reckons Deutsche can afford a DoJ settlement of up to \u20ac6bn without raising cash. Other options involve more restructuring.</p> <p>Crockford said: \u201cOne option would be to sell asset management, or other parts of the business that have a more attractive return profile than the core business and investment bank, such as private wealth management.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Liam Fox has used a speech to the World Trade Organisation to portray post-Brexit Britain as a \u201cproud and outward-looking trading nation\u201d that would battle for liberalised commerce outside the EU.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/launch-of-the-world-trade-report-2016-inclusive-trade-and-smes\">address in Geneva</a> was billed in advance as the international trade secretary making a significant push for a so-called hard Brexit, taking the UK outside the EU\u2019s single market. However, critics said the lack of any new details on the terms of Brexit indicated confusion in the government over the issue.</p> <p>Fox, speaking at the WTO\u2019s headquarters in Geneva at the launch of the organisation\u2019s annual report on world trade, began by quoting free trade champion Adam Smith, saying he was as much advocating \u201cthe moral case\u201d for unhampered global commerce as arguing for economic reasons.</p> <p>\u201cThe message I want to leave you with today is that, at the multilateral level, you will have no greater champion than the UK in the push towards further trade liberalisation,\u201d Fox said. \u201cWe will lead the charge for a fair and rule-based system for global trade and investment.\u201d</p> <p>Noting that at present, the UK had global trading commitments established via the EU, Fox said these would remain in place after Brexit was completed. </p> <p>\u201cThere will be no legal vacuum,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this will not stop us pursuing a more liberalised trade agenda. As I have said, the decision of the British people to leave the EU is not symptomatic of looking inwards but a people who want to take more control over our laws, our money and our borders.\u201d</p> <p>Amid globalisation, the UK must be \u201cfree to help shape an even more transparent, more open and more liberal trading environment\u201d, he argued.</p> <p>Fox\u2019s address was <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/24/liam-fox-britain-will-be-great-again-after-brexit/\">briefed in advance to newspapers</a> at the weekend as a \u201cmajor\u201d speech that would help begin to outline the UK\u2019s trading position in the wake of leaving the EU.</p> <p>However, political opponents said the trade secretary, who attracted criticism earlier this month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/10/business-leaders-politicians-attack-fox-over-lazy-accusations\">for describing UK businesses</a> as \u201clazy and too fat\u201d, had said nothing of any real note.</p> <p>Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the contrast between the briefings and the actuality meant Fox was confusing businesses \u201cby sending mixed messages about our membership of the single market\u201d.</p> <p>Farron added: \u201cClearly, Liam Fox is incapable of speaking for our government or country; he is a second-class cabinet minister enjoying first-class travel around the world.\u201d<br></p> <p>Chuka Umunna, the Labour MP who chairs the Vote Leave Watch campaign, which aims to scrutinise the Brexit process, said: \u201cFor Liam Fox to brief the Sunday papers that he would give a major announcement, before delivering bland platitudes today, showcases the total confusion at the heart of government on this issue.\u201d</p> <p>Tensions within the Conservatives over whether Brexit should see the UK leave the single market were highlighted last week when the former chancellor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/23/george-osborne-brexit-won-majority-hard-brexit-did-not\">George Osborne warned against</a> a \u201ctake-it-or-leave-it bravado\u201d in negotiations with the EU.</p> <p>Theresa May has been at pains to prevent her ministers outlining potential visions of how Brexit might happen before the government forms a coherent plan. </p> <p>Earlier this month Downing Street was quick to stress that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/06/david-davis-single-market-stance-not-government-policy\">prediction by David Davis</a>, the secretary of state for exiting the EU, that Britain was unlikely to remain in the single market was very much his own view. </p> <p>On Tuesday, the former pensions secretary and avowed Tory Brexiter, Iain Duncan Smith, dismissed Osborne\u2019s argument that the 23 June referendum did not necessarily endorse a hard Brexit.</p> <p>Writing for <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2016/09/iain-duncan-smith-sticking-to-the-plan.html\">the ConservativeHome website</a>, Duncan Smith said Osborne was wrong to portray himself as \u201cthe representative of the liberal mainstream majority\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cAfter all, the British people voted to take back control of their borders, their money and their laws; that seems pretty mainstream to me.\u201d</p>",

The Delevingne brow sits low on the face, is long, extending towards hairline and nose, and darker than your hair. \u201cShe brought brows to the masses, and it\u2019s been so powerful,\u201d says Bailey. \u201cThey\u2019re a bit oversized, but the way she has embraced them and made them a good thing has made women want natural brows.\u201d</p> <p>Delevingne is not the only brow reference. There\u2019s the scouse brow, a much-maligned strong eyebrow seen on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/nov/25/desperate-scousewives-boss-entertainment\">Desperate Scousewives</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-only-way-is-essex\">The Only Way Is Essex</a>\u2019s tattooed eyebrow, almost as much part of Amy Childs\u2019 look as the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2OLZO4Tvm8\">infamous vajazzle</a>.

There are the pencil-like styles of Marlene Dietrich in the 30s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/audrey-hepburn\">Audrey Hepburn</a>\u2019s thick eyebrows to emphasise her doe eyes in the 50s, glossy brows on Marie Helvin in the 70s and bushy brows on Brooke Shields in the 80s. When I was growing up in the 90s, it was all about the pencil-thin look, and celebrities such as Pamela Anderson or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/drew-barrymore\">Drew Barrymore</a>. I duly plucked mine to almost nothing and proceeded to draw them on, in kohl. The noughties went further. The likes of Sophie Ellis-Bextor or model Lara Stone had squeaky-clean skin with brows as an afterthought.</p> <p>Over the 20 years since then, I\u2019ve laboriously, painstakingly grown mine back. If, once, brows were an afterthought of beauty, they are now a focus. Alice Casely-Hayford, the 27-year-old fashion and beauty editor of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/23/refinery29-launch-uk-site-sarah-raphael-id\">Refinery29</a>, says features on brows are universally popular on the site because \u201cpost-Cara, everyone cares about their brows. I don\u2019t wear that much makeup, but I religiously get my brows done every 30 days. It\u2019s my biggest beauty extravagance and heaven forbid she [the beauty therapist] takes off too much.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae764699196c2f63dbc13e502c6b2f9203cdd33f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae764699196c2f63dbc13e502c6b2f9203cdd33f/10_696_1599_959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marlene Dietrich\u2019s pencil-thin look in 1944.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marlene Dietrich\u2019s pencil-thin look in the 40s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The variety of brow appointments are astonishing. At <a href=\"http://nailsandbrows.me/\">Nails &amp; Brows</a>, Sherrille Riley\u2019s salon in Mayfair, the appointments are booked up for months in advance for Sylvia Delbar, who is in possession of a pair of beautiful, glossy black eyebrows peeking out over glasses. For an appointment called a \u201cbrow makeover\u201d, she tints my brows, threads the area, and generally provides brow wisdom. Delbar is originally from Iran where, she says, with only slight irony: \u201cEyebrows are our life.\u201d My eyebrows come out looking smart, more groomed, but also natural.</p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.browhaus.com/\">Browhaus</a>, a chain that started in Singapore, I go for a consultation for the \u00a3550 \u201cbrow resurrection\u201d, a semi-permanent, vegetable-dye treatment. At the Covent Garden salon, therapist Chermaine Patia, who herself has square-edged, precise brows, gives me an idea of what my brows would look like resurrected, with skilful use of pencil and knowledge of the geometry of brows \u2013 lining up the corner of my nostril to make my nose look smaller, and aligning the \u201ctail\u201d of the brow to the outer corners of the eye. The result is closer to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/02/simply-nigella-bingo-lawson-bbc\">Nigella Lawson</a> \u2013 thick and wider than in their natural state.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c6ea95a723c6f7a51c03732be8a6a9ce20764652\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6ea95a723c6f7a51c03732be8a6a9ce20764652/0_197_3615_3614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Audrey Hepburn\u2019s thicker brows emphasised her doe eyes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Audrey Hepburn\u2019s thicker brows in the 50s emphasised her doe eyes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>HD is the ultimate in the celebrity-like brow \u2013 as the No 1 salon brow brand in the UK, with clients including <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rita-ora\">Rita Ora</a>, Nicole Scherzinger, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ellie-goulding\">Ellie Goulding</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/nick-grimshaw\">Nick Grimshaw</a>. It was set up in 2008 by The X Factor makeup artist Nilam Holmes Patel (Twitter handle: @EyebrowQueen) and became associated with the strong, glam brows seen on Towie. Brow trends have changed since then, and it\u2019s now all about the \u201cfluffy brow\u201d, using all the tiny hairs to create a more natural finish. At the Notting Hill salon, full of women with designer handbags, therapist Rebecca Morris says Delevingne and model Chloe Lloyd (a woman with serious brows, and more than 200,000 followers on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chloelloyd/?hl=en\">Instagram</a>) are the most common eyebrow icons. Morris gives me the 45-minute treatment, which costs \u00a340 and involves tinting, waxing, threading, tweezing and filling in with two types of pencil. There are three colour choices for dark hair like mine \u2013 the Bombshell, the Foxy and the Vamp. My eyebrows, post-HD makeover, are now a defined, Instagram-ready statement. Most of Morris\u2019s clients have this treatment every two weeks.</p> <p>If the very English Delevingne is one face of brows, the general aesthetic could suggest there is a widening of the beauty ideal beyond blonde and caucasian. As Delbar suggests, brow beauty has long been a focus in the Middle East. \u201cThreading and the heavy brow has heritage in the Asian and Arab communities where there isn\u2019t really a history of the thin brow,\u201d says Anna-Marie Solowij, beauty editor and co-founder of site <a href=\"http://thisisbeautymart.com/\">Beautymart</a>. \u201cThose cultures have shaped, strong brows.\u201d Bailey describes the Middle East as an influence: \u201cIt is so interesting for me to go there. Brows have been huge there for such a long time.\u201d He namechecks Kuwaiti-based beauty blogger <a href=\"http://www.dalalid.com/\">Dalalid</a> \u2013 with 1.8m followers on Instagram and avatar-like brows \u2013 as one of his top influences. Meanwhile, at Browhaus, Patia says the so-called Korean brow \u2013 a straighter, but still strong look \u2013 is becoming popular.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce9dafdc6b338d92ff5744db67215e639767bf2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce9dafdc6b338d92ff5744db67215e639767bf2b/0_312_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lauren Cochrane has her eyebrows enhanced at High Definition Beauty Boutique Notting Hill London Photograph by David Levene 20/9/16\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lauren Cochrane has her eyebrows enhanced at High Definition Beauty Boutique, Notting Hill, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Women of Indian descent dominate the brow industry, partly because threading originated in India. Vaishaly Patel, the woman credited with popularising threading in the UK, has Indian parents, as does Holmes Patel. <a href=\"https://www.shapesbrowbar.com/\">Shapes</a>, a brow threading bar worth more than $14m (\u00a310.8m), was set up by Indian-born Reema Khan. Blink Brows\u2019 Vanita Parti, whose parents are from India, is profiled in the most recent issue of <a href=\"http://thegentlewoman.co.uk/\">the Gentlewoman</a> magazine.

Young girls are being warned by their mothers who overtweezed in the 90s.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s lots of debates on forums about whether girls who are 15 or 16 should get Brazilian waxes,\u201d says Solowij. \u201cIt is a moot point, really, because they are, along with blowdries and mani-pedis. You can put brows into that.\u201d At all the salons I visit, the therapists say teenagers are now regulars, although they won\u2019t give them treatments until they are 16.</p> <p>In 2005, Ariel Levy wrote in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/feb/18/highereducation.news2\">Female Chauvinist Pigs</a> about teenage girls\u2019 dressing and grooming not as a hobby but \u201cas a kind of Sisyphean duty\u201d to engage \u2013 and keep \u2013 the attention of men. More than a decade later, with the advent of social media in the mix, the perceived necessary grooming levels have increased. Treatwell\u2019s Hambleton admits: \u201cThere\u2019s an increasing pressure on women and men to look groomed at all times.\u201d Contouring \u2013 a makeup technique first practised by drag artists to feminise features using shadow and concealer \u2013 is now standard for twentysomethings who grew up watching reality TV stars on Towie and Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and consuming a constant stream of Glam Squad-created \u201cselfies\u201d on Instagram. Are brows part of a cartoon-like femininity designed for a phone screen rather than IRL?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd5330b6c16ffaa4e82cc6d8854c0488acea876d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd5330b6c16ffaa4e82cc6d8854c0488acea876d/571_52_3143_1885/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Selfie queen Kim Kardashian with power brows.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Selfie queen Kim Kardashian with power brows.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Desmond Boylan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Victoria Anderson, a researcher at Cardiff University who writes about social media, believes brows are a part of the power play underlying every selfie. She points to the Latin for eyebrow \u2013 supercilium. \u201cIt is the root of \u2018supercilious\u2019, a way to be superior and look down on other people,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s mapped into the selfie culture, where there\u2019s an image to let other people see that you have status and power in the world.\u201d The profile of the eyebrow and the selfie have no doubt grown side by side in the 2010s, with selfie queens such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/kim-kardashian\">Kim Kardashian</a>, Kylie Jenner and Delevingne all in possession of power brows, but Anderson sees the connection between brows and power going back to Dietrich\u2019s day. \u201cAll of these women were about control of their image,\u201d she says. \u201cWith those Hollywood women, there was a weight behind them. Without wanting to sound judgmental, there\u2019s a lot of emptiness in these images [selfies].\u201d</p> <p>If this is some of the cultural symbolism of brows, they are \u2013 for most women \u2013 the minimal toe-dipping into this extreme beauty world. \u201cWomen are aware they will be perceived and judged at any time and that\u2019s not just the male gaze, it\u2019s the peer gaze,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cEyebrows are about power and self-definition.\u201d Most women I know have a brow story, and a preoccupation. They\u2019re the discussion topic around bar tables \u2013 a kind of beauty obsession that might be part of an objectified Identikit face designed for men but, on their own, not something generally on the male radar. \u201cMy friends who have no interest in fashion are engaging with beauty more, especially brows,\u201d says Refinery29\u2019s Caseley-Hayford. \u201cFalse lashes and lip fillers, as seen on the Kardashians, are not for everyone. But everyone can do their brows.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has called on the government to end uncertainty over Brexit, amid claims it is causing some big businesses to engage in \u201ccorporate bullying\u201d by refusing to pay smaller firms.</p> <p>Speaking to a gathering of small businesses at the Labour party conference in Liverpool, McDonnell said he suspected the government would enact article 50 \u201ctowards the end of next year\u201d, but that a lack of direction was having a detrimental impact on small business.</p> <p>Martin McTague, policy director for the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), claimed larger firms had stopped paying suppliers in order to protect themselves against a possible Brexit backlash.</p> <p>McTague said: \u201cThere is almost an element of corporate bullying. After Brexit a lot of large companies decided they needed to boost their balance sheet so they made a unilateral decision not to pay their suppliers. I think that is scandalous.</p> <p>\u201cThe government has introduced a proposal which is trying to address that but it is a major problem for many of our businesses.\u201d</p> <p>McDonnell said the lack of clarity over Brexit was creating problems for businesses. \u201cMy own view [before Brexit] was that the economic consequences wouldn\u2019t be felt immediately but would be incremental, with the undermining of certainty and confidence in our economy.<br></p> <p>\u201cSo far there\u2019s been an uncertainty in government in terms of who\u2019s leading on what and who\u2019s taking the decisions, and also what the negotiating timetable is.</p> <p>\u201cPeeping down letterboxes and whispering through keyholes at No 10 it looks as though they\u2019ll be looking to trigger the article later next year rather than sooner, due to the outcome of various European elections which are being awaited.\u201d</p> <p>McTague said the FSB wanted to secure the \u201cbest possible Brexit deal\u201d for small business, which included access to the single market.</p> <p>McDonnell said he believed that although membership of the single market would be preferable, simple access was the more realistic prospect. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/26/john-mcdonnell-10-an-hour-living-wage-plan-labour-conference\">John McDonnell announces \u00a310 an hour living wage plan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During a question and answer session, one small business owner, Gary McDonnell of catering company Empty Plates, claimed he had lost almost \u00a350,000 due to companies changing their name in order to avoid having to pay him. </p> <p>He said: \u201cIt\u2019s daylight robbery.

It\u2019s not so much about our desire to suppress wages but our members need time to adjust to the changing environment.</p> <p>\u201cOne example that was brought to me recently is a company supplying the automotive industry. They\u2019re on a declining contract so they have to cut costs every year. If at the same time the government is increasing those costs you\u2019re going to get a lot of companies going out of businesses.\u201d</p> <p>McDonnell said a policy review body would look at introducing \u201ccompensatory measures\u201d for small business. He said: \u201cThe last thing we want to do is introduce a living wage that has a detrimental impact on jobs.</p> <p>\u201cBut what we can\u2019t have is a situation where we\u2019re in the fifth richest economy in the world and children are in poverty even though both of their parents are in work.\u201d</p> <p>McTague said a study by the FSB had revealed confidence among its membership had fallen this year for the first time since 2012, blaming uncertainty over Brexit and general concerns about the underlying health of the UK economy.</p> <p>He added that although 55% of members said they were optimistic about the future, the impact of big business postponing investment was \u201cfiltering down\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/small-business/\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.</strong></p>",

That is hardly surprising, given that Mr. Trump has taken a particularly bellicose stance towards Mexico.

Although business activity showed the largest monthly rise since April, inflows of new business slowed and employment growth was the weakest for three-and-a-half years. A drop in optimism about the year ahead to a near post-crisis low meanwhile cast a shadow over the outlook.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, even with the latest uptick in activity, the overall rate of economic growth remains subdued. Add these service sector results to the manufacturing data and the PMI surveys suggest that the economy is growing at an annualised rate of only around 1% again in the third quarter.</p> <p>The slowdown in hiring means the survey results are consistent with a 120,000 rise in non-farm payrolls in September, which is a solid rate of expansion but somewhat disappointing compared to the gains seen earlier in the year.</p> <p>The slowdown in hiring is perhaps a natural symptom of the economy reaching full employment, but companies also reported a reduced appetite to hire and job losses due to weaker inflows of new business and worries about the outlook.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"531855a6a86e79d451b3227c4afa6c1efb9c2062\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/531855a6a86e79d451b3227c4afa6c1efb9c2062/0_0_736_558/500.jpg\" alt=\"US service sector\" width=\"500\" height=\"379\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US service sector</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IHS Markit</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T14:03:57.641Z\">at 3.03pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ea79f8e4b091b7fa2b5a06\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T13:58:06.056Z\">2.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back with the US, and more better than expected economic data.</strong></p> <p>Markit\u2019s initial purchasing managers\u2019 index for the service sector in September came in at 51.9, higher than the forecast 51.1 and August\u2019s final reading of 51.</p> <p>The composite index was up from 51.5 last month to 52.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Danske_Research/status/780767223510134784\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">According to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkitEconomics\">@MarkitEconomics</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/US?src=hash\">#US</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GDP?src=hash\">#GDP</a> only grew around 1% q/q AR in Q3 supporting our view that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fed?src=hash\">#Fed</a> will not hike this year <a href=\"https://t.co/zCRXavmbDT\">pic.twitter.com/zCRXavmbDT</a></p>&mdash; Danske Bank Research (@Danske_Research) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Danske_Research/status/780767223510134784\">September 27, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea77e1e4b091b7fa2b59fc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T13:53:53.529Z\">2.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The outlook for Deutsche Bank continues to be uncertain, analysts reckon. Carlo Mareels, a credit analyst at MUFG Securities, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We don\u2019t see any immediate catalysts that could change the uncertain outlook on Deutsche Bank and the weakness in Deutsche Bank spreads is hard to reverse in the absence of proper constructive news on the capital story. Profitability will remain challenging but capital is certainly the most pressing factor right now.</p> <p>We believe that the sub and senior will be subject to volatility but that they are essentially money good. On the AT1s [CoCo bonds] our central scenario is that they won\u2019t switch off coupons, but it can\u2019t be ruled out. We still see risk as significant and that needs to be priced in. However, if the Department of Justice\u2019s fine is in the area of $6bn or higher, our view is that a capital raise will become necessary (which would most likely be very beneficial to the AT1s). </p> </blockquote> <p>ABN Amro analysts believe significant restructuring is required:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Equity investors are fearful they will have to be called upon to support the capital position of the ailing Deutsche Bank (DB), as equity prices are down 64% since October 2015....</p> <p> Crucially, despite restructuring, continual low and even negative net income quarters are draining the ability DB has to naturally increase its capital position. Their capital position needs to be improved, and the ability of it to achieve this naturally is being severely questioned. Significant restructuring, including major asset sales, will likely be needed if DB wishes to achieve an increased capital position without calling on shareholders.</p> <p> The delayed sale of DB\u2019s stake in Hua Xia will be vital to help facilitate a suitable capital position for this year end. However, this is not a silver bullet and would only add a temporary \u20ac1.6bn uplift to [its Tier 1 capital ratio]. So more is needed...</p> <p>The payment request from the DoJ is just the tip of the iceberg of issues surrounding DB, as a number of other litigation suits remain open. The potential fines dwarf the \u20ac5.5bn DB have set aside for litigation. </p> <p>AT1 coupons are potentially at risk dependent on the timing/amount of the recent DoJ fine. Anything over \u20ac6bn will cause real problems for the payments. At present, we believe, the bank could weather short term capital issues for AT1 write-downs not to be an issue... In February DB were adamant in protecting their AT1 investors, but it is something that may not be so happy with going forward as already embattled equity holders would get stung for providing this benefit.</p> <p>The going concern for the company should be maintained provided the payment of the litigation charges is not demanded in the short term. We see a demand for the fines to be paid urgently as an unlikely scenario. It is both in the interest, of the bank to continue to function, and of the authorities to receive payment.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea71cde4b04cbd30bc39b0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T13:37:43.641Z\">2.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More on Deutsche Bank and the repercussions if there was to be state aid from Germany, with some saying the country\u2019s finance minister Wolfgang Scha\u00fcble will be the key player:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Halsrethink/status/780743545493880832\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Schauble,not Merkel will decide: Save DB opens gates for Italy,Portugal,Spain,other banks on brink.Bail in starts EZ-wide bank runs? <a href=\"https://t.co/wXfn1HjR3J\">https://t.co/wXfn1HjR3J</a></p>&mdash; Harald Malmgren (@Halsrethink) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Halsrethink/status/780743545493880832\">September 27, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Meanwhile Thomas Oppermann of the Social Democratic Party has weighed in:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lemasabachthani/status/780760066131628032\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">*DEUTSCHE BANK MUST SOLVE ITS OWN PROBLEMS, SPD&#39;S OPPERMANN SAYS</p>&mdash; lemasabachthani (@lemasabachthani) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lemasabachthani/status/780760066131628032\">September 27, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>As has Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lemasabachthani/status/780759710601453568\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"nl\" dir=\"ltr\">*DIJSSELBLOEM SAYS DEUTSCHE BANK NEEDS STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENTS</p>&mdash; lemasabachthani (@lemasabachthani) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lemasabachthani/status/780759710601453568\">September 27, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lemasabachthani/status/780761934685700097\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"de\" dir=\"ltr\">*DIJSSELBLOEM SAYS DEUTSCHE BANK MEETS CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMNTS</p>&mdash; lemasabachthani (@lemasabachthani) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lemasabachthani/status/780761934685700097\">September 27, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T13:38:52.982Z\">at 2.38pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ea7419e4b08ca277ca0b89\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T13:36:29.972Z\">2.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens lower</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Clinton rally in US markets has fizzled out before it even began.</p> <p>Banks - in the wake of Deutsche Bank\u2019s share price fall - and Brexit continue to weigh on investors\u2019 minds, while a fall in the oil price is also undermining confidence.

  "<p>A former headquarters of a property management company that rents empty buildings to tenants who act as guardians to prevent them from being squatted has itself been occupied by protesters.</p> <p>The upmarket building in Shoreditch, east London, was used by Camelot Europe and has been targeted by activists who say the property guardians are not getting a good deal and do not have full tenancy rights.</p> <p>The squatters say they simply entered the former Camelot building through an open door. The building is empty, but the Camelot logo is still displayed clearly on the front of it.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what we would expect from Camelot, a company that prides itself on supplying property guardians to landlords of commercial and residential buildings to prevent them being squatted,\u201d said Frank Freeman, 29, one of the activists who has moved into the property.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbc9ef71aed5791f93b3dd37f5384b2bbb0d0a88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbc9ef71aed5791f93b3dd37f5384b2bbb0d0a88/0_435_3834_2300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A squatter inside Camelot Europe\u2019s former offices in Shoreditch, east London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A squatter inside Camelot Europe\u2019s former offices in Shoreditch, east London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe are doing this on behalf of dispossessed, homeless people and guardians who are being exploited,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cWe hope to run art workshops, yoga classes and exhibitions. London is built on culture, but artists and creative people can no longer afford to live here. It is becoming a sterile and unaffordable place.\u201d</p> <p>Property guardianship was once considered a good option for priced-out tenants, who were offered low-cost temporary homes in return for protecting empty buildings, but rents have been rising and concerns growing about the limited rights occupiers have.</p> <p>The Green party\u2019s Si\u00e2n Berry recently described the schemes as the \u201czero-hours contract of housing\u201d, because occupants can be evicted at short notice if they are deemed to have violated the licence agreement.</p> <p>The irony of targeting a property guardian business has not been lost on the squatters, who have adapted Camelot\u2019s castle logo, inserted the squatters\u2019 sign and renamed the premises Camesquat.</p> <p>Literature from the estate agents Currell, whose marketing materials the squatters found when they moved into the building, shows that it has been marketed for sale for \u00a33.1m, exclusive of VAT. The activists have cracked jokes about the irony of Camelot\u2019s failure to protect its own building from squatters, but they say their occupation has a serious purpose.</p> <p>Dr Sarah Keenan, a lecturer in law at Birkbeck, University of London, said: \u201cThe rights of tenants and licensees are generally very weak in England and Wales. In January this year the government voted against a proposed amendment to the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/society/housing\">housing</a> and planning bill, which was designed to ensure properties are fit for human habitation. Because guardians are licensees rather than tenants, they can be easily evicted and they don\u2019t have the right to have their deposits protected.\u201d</p> <p>Complaints by current and former property guardians for Camelot in a number of different buildings in the London area include allegations over failure to repair fire alarms, asbestos removal work carried out while they were in the property, and recently an accident involving a man, Mace Richards, who was looking after a property in Walton-on-Thames. On 22 August, a glass panel broke on his hands causing severe injury. He had to have reconstructive surgery at St George\u2019s hospital.</p> <p>\u201cI was in absolute agony,\u201d said Richards. \u201cI work as an actor and a hand model \u2013 my hands appeared in the opening of a Jimmy McGovern series called Banished \u2013 but I can\u2019t get any work at the moment because of the damage to my hands. I hope that I will recover enough to be able to work again, but I have lots of scarring on my hands and I have been evicted by Camelot after I asked for their insurance details so I could make a personal injury claim about my hands.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"419a8fbc0cf49b7abea9fbd65dafd2a05933502e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/419a8fbc0cf49b7abea9fbd65dafd2a05933502e/70_257_4113_2468/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Squatters pose in the former offices of Camelot Europe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Squatters pose in the former offices of Camelot Europe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Monday night, security guards appeared at the door of the premises barring entry to a group of squatters who had congregated on the pavement to support those inside occupying the building.</p> <p>Police were called and a dispersal order was put in place between 3am and noon on Tuesday requiring both the Camelot security officials and the squatters to move away from the front of the former Camelot building.</p> <p>After the order was lifted squatters reported that the security team returned and were joined by squatters and the standoff between the two groups resumed.</p> <p>Paul Ridge, of Bindmans Solicitors, who is advising the squatters, said: \u201cAt midnight last night I spoke to the police about the \u2018self help\u2019 approach being used by Camelot\u2019s security people. I advised the police that the legal process needs to take its course with this occupation.\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Mike Goldsmith, chief operating officer of Camelot Europe, said: \u201cCamelot are not planning to evict the squatters. We have security staff outside the building (no member of staff or security company have entered or attempted to enter the building) to prevent further squatters from accessing the building illegally.\u201d</p> <p>Commenting on the specific allegations made by the squatters, Goldsmith said: \u201cMr Richards was told by the property manager that his licence was being terminated because of his injury. The manager wrongly assumed this, as Mr Richards received his injury in an area of the building which was clearly marked out of bounds.</p> <p>\u201cWhen this was brought to my attention, Mr Richards was informed that his claim would be forwarded to Camelot\u2019s insurer [and was done a number of weeks ago]. The claim will still be processed irrespective of Mr Richards\u2019 status with Camelot. Mr Richards is having his licence revoked because he was in a clearly signed out of bounds area and because he has stated that he can\u2019t pay his licence fee going forward.

  "<p>Paris fashion week has long been code for chic \u2013 the rarefied world of Avenue Montaigne, bird-like couture clients in Chanel suits and gamines in ballet flats. But, on the eve of the spring/summer 2017 shows, there\u2019s a new mood blowing into the city of Chanel, Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton. Chic is out, cool is in. London fashion week was once the home of new talent and cutting-edge trends, but now Paris is moving in for this territory. </p> <p>This season there will be several debuts of designers at established brands \u2013 beginning with Anthony Vaccarello at Saint Laurent on Tuesday evening. Vaccarello, a 33-year-old Belgian-Italian, takes over from Hedi Slimane. His aesthetic, seen at both his own brand and work with Versus, is brazenly sexy, and his show promises to be more in-your-face than Slimane\u2019s indie-influenced work. In a statement announcing his appointment in April, Francesca Bellettini, president and CEO of Saint Laurent, commented that Vaccarello \u201cimpeccably balances elements of provocative femininity and sharp masculinity in his silhouettes\u201d. His first work for the brand, an advertising campaign released in July, kept the fashion crowd guessing: the images featured no clothes at all. An Instagram post earlier this month was more revealing \u2013 in both senses. It featured model Anja Rubik in a high-cut metallic swimsuit, tan lines from a bikini visible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3ee69e58ad59f786cd88c1151fbf7ee38bd3c5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3ee69e58ad59f786cd88c1151fbf7ee38bd3c5e/0_269_5568_3339/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli walk the runway during the Valentino haute couture in July.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli walk the runway during the Valentino haute couture in July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other debuts see women designers moving into positions more recently held by men. The relative unknown Bouchra Jarrar will show her first collection for Lanvin on Wednesday and Maria Grazia Chiuri \u2013 ex of Valentino \u2013 does the same at Christian Dior on Friday. Chiuri is the first female designer to take up the Dior helm in the house\u2019s nearly 60-year history. Her work at Valentino with Pierpaolo Piccioli since 2008 has gained fans for its modern, younger take on femininity. Chiuri\u2019s Dior is set to be one of the most anticipated shows of the week. \u201cI am very excited to see what Chiuri does at Dior, and Jarrar at Lanvin,\u201d confirms Kenya Hunt, fashion features director at Elle. \u201cI love the idea of women designing for women at two of Paris\u2019s most storied houses.\u201d</p> <p>While Chanel, Balenciaga, C\u00e9line and Louis Vuitton remain the blue-chip Parisian houses, newer labels are gaining hype with an aesthetic that has more of an street edge to it. Tuesday has shows from Koch\u00e9 and Jacquemus \u2013 both brands led by a new generation of Paris designers, playing with sportswear and staples such as trenches in new ways. Koch\u00e9\u2019s designer, Christelle Kocher, told the Guardian this month that \u201cParis has always been the centre of creativity. Now, there is a new area of fashion with youth taking over.\u201d This is further emphasised with street labels from America \u2013 Rihanna\u2019s Fenty Puma line and Virgil Abloh\u2019s Off White \u2013 also on the Paris schedule. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c8d574794375d3acae6381bf265c4b4b70f61c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c8d574794375d3acae6381bf265c4b4b70f61c1/0_311_5184_3111/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rihanna walks the runway at the Fenty Puma show in February in New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rihanna walks the runway at the Fenty Puma show in February in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JP Yim/Getty Images for Fenty Puma</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cParis fashion week has always been major, but we\u2019re seeing much more newness now,\u201d says Sarah Rutson, vice-president of global buying at Net-a-Porter. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the big established brands any more, there are so many debuts on and off schedule.\u201d She namechecks Jacquemus, Off White, Atlein and Vetements as key players.</p> <p>Paris\u2019 new street cred is arguably led by Vetements, founded by Demna Gvasalia and collective in 2014. \u201cGvasalia\u2019s work has been the most agenda-setting in that we\u2019ve seen his influence all over the spring/summer catwalks, and all over the street style circuit,\u201d says Hunt. This is achieved through a youth-infused look. Gvasalia told the Guardian last year that the inspiration was \u201cwhat young people are wearing on the streets of Paris\u201d. Rather than the white shirts and ballet flats of the old guard, this translates to oversized hoodies, logo T-shirts and vintage-y floral dresses. <br>Gvasalia has now reached the top of Paris fashion: he will show his second collection for Balenciaga this week. Vetements, meanwhile, has the ultimate Paris fashion accolade: they were nowhere to be seen on the schedule this week. Instead, they showed their spring collection at couture in July \u2013 a sure sign that the new generation have been accepted by the Paris fashion establishment.</p>",

Though dwarfed by an estimated television audience of up to 100 million people, they included well-known political figures including former presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and New York City mayor Bill de Blasio as well as celebrities such as billionaire Mark Cuban and controversial boxing promoter Don King. </p> <p>At first Trump appeared to be trying to rein in his more aggressive tendency. \u201cIs that OK? I want you to be happy. It\u2019s very important to me,\u201d he said to Clinton, using her title, Secretary Clinton. </p> <p>But Trump, who was sniffing and sounded nasally congested, quickly grew agitated, repeatedly interrupting Clinton and often shouting over her as she attempted to respond to questions. </p> <p>In particular, he aggressively went after her record on trade \u2013 interjecting as Clinton spoke, by pointing to her husband Bill Clinton\u2019s signing of Nafta in the 1990s. </p> <p>Clinton immediately jabbed at Trump, making reference to the $14m that the Republican nominee got in a series of loans from his father, Fred, to start his business empire. The older Trump, a successful real estate developer, helped to fund his son\u2019s effort to remodel the Grand Hyatt hotel in midtown Manhattan and also aided his son with his political connections.

Clinton fired back and proceeded to lay out all the hypothetical reasons that Trump, who has claimed he is under a tax inspector\u2019s audit, was not releasing his tax returns. Clinton said perhaps Trump was \u201cnot as rich as he says he is, not as charitable as he says he is\u201d and even suggested that Trump hadn\u2019t paid any income tax for several years. The Republican nominee responded \u201cthat makes me smart\u201d and Clinton continued to admonish him by suggesting: \u201cI think he is probably not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of the country see because it must be something really important, even terrible that he is trying to hide.\u201d </p> <p>Afterwards, Jason Miller, Trump\u2019s senior communications adviser, avoided repeated questions from reporters about whether the Republican nominee has paid federal income taxes. Miller insisted \u201cof course he pays taxes\u201d and that \u201che has paid taxes at every level\u201d but repeatedly declined to state whether Trump had paid federal income tax every year in the past 20 years.

Between 1985 and 2007, real world trade grew on average twice as fast as global GDP, whereas over the past four years it has barely kept pace. Such prolonged sluggish growth in trade volumes relative to economic activity has few historical precedents during the past five decades.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/trump-clinton-free-trade-policies-tpp\">Calls for greater protectionism have featured in the US presidential race</a>, but the IMF said three-quarters of the decline in trade growth since 2012 relative to 2003\u201307, the four years prior to the global crisis, was the result of weaker economic activity and in particular subdued investment growth.</p> <p>However, it said other factors \u2013 including the lack of new trade deals \u2013 had also shaved 1.75 percentage points off trade growth. \u201cThe pace of new trade policy initiatives at the global level has slowed notably. At the same time, the uptick in protectionism since the global financial crisis is not innocuous.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the quantitative contribution of trade policies to the slowdown in trade growth has been limited so far, protectionist measures could significantly weigh on global trade if they become more widespread.\u201d<br></p> <p>In a separate chapter, the IMF said there were signs that the anti-deflation policies being pursued by central banks around the world were becoming less effective, and urged a broader mix of actions to increase demand.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the broad-based nature of the disinflation and the corresponding fact that many countries are easing monetary policy at the same time, dampening the downward pressure that monetary policy easing exerts on the exchange rate, monetary policy stimulus on its own may not be sufficient to keep medium-term inflation expectations anchored at central bank targets. </p> <p>\u201cA comprehensive package consisting of a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policy, an expansionary fiscal stance where fiscal space is available, demand-supportive structural reforms and measures aimed at addressing weaknesses in bank and corporate balance sheets should play a complementary role in mitigating the risk of protracted weak demand and low inflation.\u201d </p>",

But the truth is economic growth does not exist in the abstract. It happens in particular places when a business like yours is set up, or takes on more people, or expands its production. </p> <p>\u201cYet for too long government policy has treated every place as if they were identical. Many of the policies and decisions that form our industrial strategy will not be about particular industries or sectors, but will be cross-cutting.\u201d </p> <p>Warning that the UK\u2019s economic strength is geographically imbalanced, he said: \u201cFor all the assets and skills and reputation we have as a nation, for all of the astonishing economic progress we\u2019ve made in this country, it is visibly uneven.\u201d</p> <p>Clark also told the annual Institute of Directors convention in London that there has been \u201cenough drama\u201d in the UK over the last year amid the EU referendum, adding: \u201cI want us to recover our reputation for stability and predictability as a business environment.\u201d</p> <p>His comments provide in an insight into how Theresa May\u2019s government will approach the economy and develop relationships with businesses. The previous business secretary, Sajid Javid, expressed his dislike for industrial strategies while the coalition government focused on working with certain sectors, such as the automotive and aerospace industries.<br></p> <p>Responding to Clark\u2019s comments, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor,<br>said he wanted to see the minister\u2019s rhetoric matched with action.

For many people, they will have included entirely reasonable doubts and reservations about the EU. It is, after all, an imperfect organisation,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cBut in part, Brexit was a product of a sense of disenfranchisement and disillusionment. It was borne of inequality, of feelings of powerlessness \u2013 of austerity budgets which hurt the public services and social safety nets that so many people depend on.\u201d</p> <p>Scotland\u2019s leader also claimed there is \u201cno meaningful mandate\u201d for a hard Brexit that would involve Britain leaving the single market, adding that remain and leave campaigners had spoken of the benefits of free trade prior to the vote. </p> <p>Sturgeon said there was a strong democratic justification for remaining part of the single market and that it was crucial for Scotland and the \u201cleast damaging outcome for individuals, communities and businesses across the whole of the UK\u201d.</p> <p>In his opening remarks to the conference, Simon Walker, the director general of the IoD, made a dig at Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, who said earlier this month that British business leaders were <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/09/fat-and-lazy-britain-is-ill-prepared-to-secure-future-outside-eu-says-fox\">lazy and preferred playing golf</a> to agreeing export deals.</p> <p>Walker said: \u201cI\u2019m delighted to see so many of you here this morning, when \u2013 who knows? \u2013 you could so easily have been out on the golf course having a couple of rounds with Liam Fox.\u201d</p> <p>The IoD boss also questioned whether the government should rescue the steel industry. \u201cWill \u2018industrial policy\u2019 involve reskilling those who make bulk steel, so that they can move to sophisticated high tech products where Britain retains a competitive edge?\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cOr will Britain simply block steel imports from China and pour funds into subsidising uncompetitive plants as a method of retaining jobs?</p> <p>\u201cDown one path lies adapting to change \u2013 to thrive by finding new opportunities in the global marketplace.

Central to Malawi\u2019s mining industry is Karonga district, which borders Tanzania and is located on the north-western shores of Lake Malawi. The nation\u2019s first uranium mine opened here in 2009, and the district now houses two of the four largest coal mines in Malawi as well, the report claims.</p> <p>The government has said that the private investment brought by mining \u2013 from both local and international companies, including those from Australia and Cyprus \u2013 would in turn create jobs for Malawians and improve locals\u2019 access to infrastructure. HRW investigated the coal and uranium mining operations of Eland Coal Mining Company, Malcoal, and Paladin Africa Limited (Paladin).</p> <p>Most of those living in Karonga district depend on subsistence farming, including of crops like maize as well as international and governmental food aid, according to HRW.

They only told us that we would all become very rich once they start with the mining. We didn\u2019t know anything about mining and we believed them.\u201d</p> <p>HRW claims the Malawi government lacks sufficient legal standards and safeguards to promote the mining industry while protecting local communities. The report says that a new draft law regarding mines and minerals also fails to address a key issue facing the mining industry \u2013 transparency about the risks associated with mining.<br></p> <p>\u201cMalawi shouldn\u2019t repeat the mistakes made in resource extraction in other countries in southern Africa,\u201d said HRW researcher Katharina Rall. \u201cIt is not enough to create a fertile investment climate for mining companies.

We built a clinic in Kayelekera, roads, and school houses. [We] provided direct support to the community in the form of donations of food, non-mining vocational training and school supplies,\u201d Molyneux said.<br></p> <p>Malcoal director Hastings Jere described the allegations as \u201cbaseless and unfounded\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cI was one of the people that surveyed the area [for the mine\u2019s operations] in 2005,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that time there was not even a single village within the EPL [exclusive prospecting licence]. When the mine opened in 2006, people from all over the district flocked to the mine as jobseekers and erected shacks within the mine area. We tried to move them without success. No single village was relocated and no compensation issue has ever been discussed \u2026 Malcoal has never refused to test the water \u2026 With due respect, the stories are totally false.\u201d</p> <p>Reinford Mwangonde, executive director of Citizens for Justice, which hosts the Secretariat of the <a href=\"http://www.nrjnmalawi.mw/\">Natural Resources Justice Network</a>, a Malawian network of non-governmental organisations pressing for sustainable resource extraction, said: \u201cThe push for industrialisation and growth needs to be accompanied by a social licence and companies should deliver on their promises.\u201d</p> <p>Rall added: \u201cThe Karonga district mines are just the first in many extractive projects in Malawi, making the lessons they have to offer extremely important.

You rightly say that it has always been a broad church and that the two wings of the party must respect each other.</p> <p>However, I find baffling your conclusion that allowing the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) to elect the shadow cabinet would heal the wounds. Leader Jeremy Corbyn was elected by an overwhelming majority of members a year ago and the re-run of his election this year due to the undermining of that vote has caused ill-feeling among members towards the PLP.</p> <p>Gerrymandering and a McCarthy-style purging of members by the National Executive Committee has made the feelings all the more bitter. So the question is: how do we re-unite ? There must be some form of negotiations.

Resourcing, partnership development and the ability to mobilise programming is so much easier within the UN. Yes the UN is at its heart a political beast and it\u2019s frustrating as hell. It\u2019s filled with bottlenecks and cynical, regressive thinking.

Through no fault of its own, the NGO sector has no autonomy. It is always beholden to its donors. And so is the UN.</p> <p>Despite its reputation, the UN is actually a collection of rather small players in a hardcore realist political game. Like the NGO sector, it functions on extremely limited resources on a tightrope of political and donor appeasement. Do either of us, the NGO sector or the UN, get the job done?

If there\u2019s been any uniting theme of the conference it is virulent condemnation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/sep/05/bloody-mindedness-isnt-working-for-sports-direct\" title=\"\">Mike Ashley</a>, who has overseen a regime of exploitation and zero-hours insecurity in his role as Sports Direct proprietor. Speaker after speaker has castigated Ashley\u2019s business practices as inhuman and Dickensian, to guaranteed enthusiastic applause.</p> <p>It\u2019s not enough, though. For all of the rhetoric, the reality is that trade union membership has long been in decline. Even more troublingly, it\u2019s the workers most vulnerable to casualisation, low-pay and underemployment who are least likely to have union representation. To what extent can the Labour party claim to speak for ordinary working people when the movement it is founded on is failing to convince those people it can help.</p> <p>I sat on a panel on Monday where a young woman explained that she\u2019d not been able to join a trade union as an apprentice \u2013 earning well below the so-called living wage of \u00a37.20 that has been introduced for people over the age of 25 \u2013 because the union active in her workplace didn\u2019t offer a reduced rate that took into account her lower earnings. Other women spoke about feeling excluded by a macho culture that infested the labour movement, and about the lack of attention given to parenting and the need for workplace flexibility.</p> <p>Harking back to past victories reminds us why the Labour party was created, so it\u2019s no surprise that speakers from all factions have made mention of the minimum wage, gender equality legislation and the founding of the NHS. What\u2019s sorely lacking, however, is any sort of coherent vision for the future.</p> <p>There seem to be two extreme camps dominating \u2013 though many members find themselves stuck somewhere in the middle desperately hoping for a resolution. On one side are those who wish to operate as if nothing has really changed since the mid-1970s. Though popular understanding of class, community and the role of the welfare state has altered wildly in recent decades, they\u2019re still using the same language they always have and expecting it to resonate with voters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/27/low-paid-workers-sports-direct-university-staff-rights-mike-ashley\">Think only low\u2013paid workers get the Sports Direct treatment? You\u2019re wrong | Aditya Chakrabortty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the opposite end of the spectrum are the self-described \u201cmodernisers\u201d. Those who contend that the labour movement is dead in the water and that a viable Labour party has to develop different focuses and priorities. These are the people who argued that it was a mistake for Ed Miliband to criticise zero-hours contracts in the run-up to the last general election, as it gave the impression he was \u201canti-business\u201d.</p> <p>The solution, surely, cannot come from either of these camps.

  "<p>The poet and critic Bernard Bergonzi, who has died aged 87, was long associated with the teaching of 20th-century English literature at Warwick University. His books shed new light on the English writing of the first world war and the 1930s, and on developments in criticism since the 60s, which he largely disliked. Monographs on HG Wells, TS Eliot, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Thomas Arnold and Graham Greene showed Bergonzi at his sensible and lucid best.</p> <p>Though principally known as a critic, it was as a poet that Bergonzi began to find a place in the English literary scene in the early 50s. Within a year of beginning research on the early writings of Wells in 1958, he was appointed assistant lecturer at Manchester University. A full lectureship soon followed. He published two books while at Manchester: The Early HG Wells (1961) and a study of the literature of the first world war, Heroes\u2019 Twilight (1965), in which he gave innovative attention to David Jones and the nearly forgotten Henry Williamson. In the following year he was appointed senior lecturer at Warwick, where he remained until he formally retired in 1992. He became professor of English in 1971 and served as pro-vice-chancellor from 1979 until 1982. His career was closely tied to the ascending fortunes of the Warwick English department.</p> <p>For a time Bergonzi sought to be something of an arbiter of contemporary writing. A series of talks, Novelists of the Sixties, was broadcast on the Third Programme and he became a frequent contributor to the New York Review of Books. He edited Innovations (1968), an influential collection of essays on the avant garde, which may have given the impression that he was devoted to experimental writing. He was not. In The Situation of the Novel (1970), he expressed much liberal bafflement at the \u201cfacile apocalypticism\u201d of 60s fiction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"653799453b0a3e679b1f84df949eb76a3e9a90cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/653799453b0a3e679b1f84df949eb76a3e9a90cd/40_25_355_592/300.jpg\" alt=\"The Early HG Wells, 1961\" width=\"300\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Early HG Wells, 1961</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Writers such as Thomas Pynchon began to make their presence felt in Bergonzi\u2019s writing. But his book hardly celebrated new cultural energies. Nor was he particularly interested in American literature or French critical theories. In truth he posed \u201cthe ideology of being English\u201d as a direct challenge to the cult of experimentalism. The English, he wrote, are an untheoretical people, who cherish their idiosyncrasies and amateurishness, and have a distaste for the systematic and the doctrinaire. Bergonzi hoped that \u201chappy enclave of tradition and liberalism\u201d might long endure.</p> <p>He wrote with gusto against the perversity of Marxist, structuralist and psychoanalytic criticism. Feminist criticism seemed to him little more than special pleading. In The Myth of Modernism (1986) and Exploding English (1990) he argued that the gang of theorisers led by Terry Eagleton would find a happier home outside traditional English departments. The emergence of theory in literary education was itself a \u201csymptom of disorder\u201d. He deplored the fact that literary judgment no longer seemed to have a place in the global anglophone academy. Remaining true to the idea of evaluative criticism, he proposed an English degree course that would concentrate on the study of poetry, without its \u201cculturalist\u201d baggage. In all this, Bergonzi thought of himself as a defender of humane values against leftwing onslaughts.</p> <p>His biographical and critical study TS Eliot appeared in 1972, avoiding the awkward personal questions about Eliot\u2019s marriage and his politics that increasingly preoccupied critics in the decades after Eliot\u2019s death in 1965. When the lawyer and academic Anthony Julius raised important questions of antisemitism in Eliot\u2019s work in TS Eliot, Antisemitism and Literary Form (1996), Bergonzi was fair-minded in responding to a topic that he had largely ignored in his own study.</p> <p>He attempted a wider survey of the major figures of the 30s in Reading the Thirties (1978). To his credit, when discussing the rightwing writers of that decade Bergonzi did not duck the question of Wyndham Lewis\u2019s admiration for fascism, or Roy Campbell\u2019s authoritarianism and Catholic triumphalism. But the politics of that supremely political generation is downplayed. Bergonzi published a critical b iography of Gerard Manley Hopkins in 1977, and in 1981 The Roman Persuasion, a novel set in 1936-38, about a pious Catholic literary family negotiating the perilous political crises of that decade. It offers a counter-history to the mythologies of the antifascist left in the 30s. As a novel, the family councils of the Cartwrights and Tolleybeares perhaps go on a bit too long about the church\u2019s \u201cinfallible wisdom\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5c51dc65ba00be9f4ff258f1804b181946783444\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c51dc65ba00be9f4ff258f1804b181946783444/0_0_301_479/301.jpg\" alt=\"A Victorian Wanderer, 2003\" width=\"301\" height=\"479\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Victorian Wanderer, 2003</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1982 an essay by Bergonzi was included in Why I Am Still a Catholic, a collection edited by Robert Nowell. Bergonzi remained a lifelong practising Catholic, though of a distinctly liberal temperament. Occasionally describing himself as a \u201cpapist critic,\u201d he was a man of the second Vatican council, and the winds of change that were blowing through the church in the 60s.</p> <p><a href=\"http://timewitnesses.org/english/doodbug.html\">Bernard was born in Lewisham</a>, south-east London, the son of Carlo Bergonzi, a dance band musician in the 20s and later a white-collar worker in factories, and his wife Louisa (nee Lloyd). Ill-health, which resulted in an operation on his ear in 1937, dogged his childhood but spared him what he later came to regard as \u201cignorant and unenlightened\u201d Catholic schooling.</p> <p>Strong on the need for authority and discipline and deeply suspicious of private judgment, Catholicism in the 40s was a difficult natural home for an inquiring spirit such as Bergonzi. He caused some consternation when he asked his parish priest if he might see a copy of the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, the list of books and authors proscribed by the church to which Jean-Paul Sartre was added in 1948 and Andr\u00e9 Gide in 1952. (The Index was discontinued in 1966.) Bergonzi found few English writers on it, but was quietly shocked at how questions about the Index, and whether it actually applied to his own reading, were dismissed as being of little consequence.</p> <p>After leaving school before his 16th birthday, he worked as a junior clerk in the City, and continued to read widely if unsystematically in Catholic books and periodicals. The wartime Faber edition of Eliot\u2019s collected poems, bought in 1946, had pride of place in his small library. He read successive issues of Penguin New Writing, greatly admiring an essay by <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-john-wain-1438370.html\">John Wain</a> on William Empson in the last number in 1950. Bergonzi thought of himself as an autodidact, not unlike the unfortunate Leonard Bast in EM Forster\u2019s Howards End.</p> <p>In his 20s he began to write poetry, strongly influenced by Eliot. Two of his poems were featured in Wain\u2019s radio series First Reading on the Third Programme in 1953. Later that year he participated in a reading to launch Springtime, an anthology of poetry edited by GS Fraser and Iain Fletcher. Kingsley Amis, who was also a contributor, wrote to Philip Larkin the day after the reading that \u201ca chap named Bernard Benghazi or some such name was good, I thought\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f04a2dc21f36a5c1d7684dc3e22692314f6822ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f04a2dc21f36a5c1d7684dc3e22692314f6822ae/4_0_321_494/321.jpg\" alt=\"Heroes\u2019 Twilight, 1965, by Bernard Bergonzi\" width=\"321\" height=\"494\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heroes\u2019 Twilight, 1965, by Bernard Bergonzi</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No Credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bergonzi contributed to George Hartley\u2019s literary magazine Listen in 1954 and became co-editor of the later numbers of Oscar Mellor\u2019s Fantasy Poets series. Godolphin &amp; Other Poems appeared in 1952. A more substantial collection, Descartes and the Animals, followed in 1954. Three small-press pamphlets of poems, containing careful, disciplined and thoughtful work, were subsequently published.</p> <p>At the suggestion of Fraser, in the autumn of 1953 Bergonzi enrolled at Newbattle Abbey, an adult residential college near Edinburgh. In 1955 he won a mature entrant scholarship at Wadham College, Oxford, where his tutor was FW Bateson. Bergonzi was an active member of the Critical Society, founded by Al Alvarez in the early 50s, and became friends with Martin Dodsworth and Christopher Ricks. He thought of himself as an ambitious, upwardly mobile scholarship boy.</p> <p>The energy he displayed as a writer continued well after he became professor emeritus. His broad range of interests, and approach to the business of introducing literature to the general public, changed little over the decades. Wartime and Aftermath (1993), a study of English literature and its background in the 40s and 50s, drew heavily on his earlier publications and established judgments. War Poets and Other Subjects appeared in 1999. A Victorian Wanderer (2003), a biography of Thomas Arnold, brother of the Victorian poet, was warmly received. It was followed by A Study in Greene (2006).</p> <p>Deploring those academics who chose to write for each other in jargon-laden prose, Bergonzi particularly objected to the way theorists seemed to ignore general readers. He was undogmatically certain that he had always written with those readers in mind, however much England and Englishness had changed since he began his career as a writer and teacher.</p> <p>He is survived by his second wife, Anne Samson, whom he married in 1987, and three children, Ben, Clarissa and Lucy, by his first wife, Gabriel Wall, who died in 1984.<br><br><strong>Eric Homberger</strong></p> <p><strong>David Lodge writes:</strong> Bernard Bergonzi was one of my oldest friends. We met for the first time at a conference in Cambridge in 1961, when Bernard told me he had recently read my first novel, The Picturegoers (1960), and recognised its setting as the rather shabby part of south-east London, incorporating Lewisham, New Cross and Brockley, where like me he had grown up. He was six years older, but we had other things in common: both Catholics, both only children (an unusual combination) of lower-middle-class parents, both in the early stages of academic careers, specialising in modern literature, trying to add to it in poetry and fiction respectively, and earning extra income from reviewing.</p> <p>When Bernard moved with his family from Manchester to the new Warwick University, less than an hour from Birmingham, where I was a lecturer, the friendship developed to include regular Sunday lunches at both venues. After the devastating death of his first wife, Gabriel, from cancer at the age of 46, this custom was revived during his second marriage, to Anne. I always looked forward to these meetings because we had plenty to talk about: new books, our current projects, literary and academic gossip, and the state of the Catholic church. Bernard took a particular interest in my novels that dealt with this last subject, and wrote perceptively but not uncritically about them.</p> <p>In his prime he was an imposing figure, confident, witty and urbane, a man of letters in a traditional mould, and this was a personal triumph over a disadvantaged childhood, including two years in hospital that seriously retarded his education. The long row of his books on my shelves display an impressively wide knowledge of modern literature and culture, communicated in effortlessly readable prose at a time when academic criticism became increasingly heavy with jargon. Bernard deplored the impact on his profession of structuralism and poststructuralism, in which I found some ideas of value, but unlike many hostile commentators he read the work of their proponents carefully and described it fairly. He was a gentleman of letters.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Bernard Bergonzi, poet, critic and academic, born 13 April 1929; died 20 September 2016</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 September 2016.

  "<h2>Clinton, Holt put Trump on defensive</h2> <p>Goaded by Clinton and pressed by moderator Lester Holt, Donald Trump angrily defended his record against charges of racism, sexism and tax avoidance for much of the first presidential debate.

  "<p>With space for roughly 20,000 cars, the parking lot that surrounds the West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, Canada, is recognised as the <a href=\"http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-car-park/\">largest car park</a> in the world.</p> <p>Spread across vast expanses of asphalt and multi-storey concrete structures, these parking spots take up about half the mall\u2019s 5.2m sq ft, on what was once the edge of the city of Edmonton. A few blocks away, a similar amount of space is taken up by a neighbourhood of nearly 500 homes. </p> <p>Despite its huge scale, the West Edmonton Mall\u2019s parking lot is not all that different from most car parks around the world. Requiring roughly 200 sq ft per car plus room to maneuvre, they tend to be big, flat and not fully occupied. Often their size eclipses the buildings they serve.</p> <p>Even when they\u2019re hidden in underground structures or built into skyscrapers, car parks are big and often empty: parking at homes tends to be vacant during the workday, parking at work vacant at night. A <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837709000350\">2010 study</a> of Tippecanoe County, Indiana found there was an average of 2.2 parking spaces for each registered car. </p> <p>The US has long been the world leader in building parking spaces. During the mid 20th century, city zoning codes began to include requirements and quotas for most developments to include parking spaces. The supply skyrocketed. A <a href=\"http://www.accessmagazine.org/articles/fall-2011/parking-infrastructure-environment/\">2011 study</a> by the University of California, estimated there are upwards of 800m parking spaces in the US, covering about 25,000 square miles of land.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nobody goes to a city because it has great parking</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Kodransky</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAs parking regulations were put into zoning codes, most of the downtowns in many cities were just completely decimated,\u201d says Michael Kodransky, global research manager for the Institute of Transportation and Development Policy. \u201cWhat the cities got, in effect, was great parking. But nobody goes to a city because it has great parking.\u201d</p> <p>Increasingly, cities are rethinking this approach. As cities across the world begin to prioritise walkable urban development and the type of city living that does not require a car for every trip, city officials are beginning to move away from blanket policies of providing abundant parking. Many are adjusting zoning rules that require certain minimum amounts of parking for specific types of development. Others are tweaking prices to discourage driving as a default when other options are available. Some are even actively preventing new parking spaces from being built.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b25c28ebb1030265e038b9357530d8a7ba6e5c96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b25c28ebb1030265e038b9357530d8a7ba6e5c96/0_956_4752_2212/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A typical road in San Francisco.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"465\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A road in San Francisco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To better understand how much parking they have and how much they can afford to lose, transportation officials in San Francisco in 2010 released the results of what\u2019s believed to be the first citywide census of parking spaces. They counted every publicly accessible parking space in the city, including lots, garages, and free and metered street parking. They found that the city had <a href=\"http://sf.streetsblog.org/2010/03/29/san-francisco-first-city-in-the-nation-to-count-its-parking-spaces/\">441,541 spaces</a>, and more than half of them are free, on-street spaces.</p> <p>\u201cThe hope was that it would show that there\u2019s actually a lot of parking here. We\u2019re devoting a lot of space in San Francisco to parking cars,\u201d says Hank Willson, principal analyst at the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. \u201cAnd though the perception is always that there\u2019s never enough parking, the reality is different.\u201d</p> <p>Knowing the parking inventory has made it easier for the city to pursue public space improvements such as adding bike lanes or <a href=\"http://pavementtoparks.org/parklets/\">parklets</a>, using the data to quell inevitable neighbourhood concerns about parking loss. \u201cWe can show that removing 20 spaces can just equate to removing 0.1% of the parking spaces within walking distance of a location,\u201d says Steph Nelson of the SFMTA.</p> <p>The data helps planners to understand when new developments actually need to provide parking spaces and when the available inventory is sufficient. More often, the data shows that the city can\u2019t build its way out of a parking shortage \u2013 whether it\u2019s perceived or real \u2013 and that the answers lie in alternative transportation options.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64258763deb0dafc0cc2b090fd0e8eb7a8c7e2bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64258763deb0dafc0cc2b090fd0e8eb7a8c7e2bf/229_0_3620_2172/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Parking atop a supermarket roof in Budapest, Hungary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A parking lot on a supermarket roof in Budapest, Hungary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With this in mind, the city has implemented the type of dynamic pricing system proposed by Donald Shoup, a distinguished research professor of urban planning at the University of California, Los Angeles. In <a href=\"http://www.uctc.net/research/papers/351.pdf\">his book</a> The High Cost of Free Parking, Shoup explains that free or very cheap on-street parking contributes to traffic congestion in a major way. A <a href=\"http://shoup.bol.ucla.edu/CruisingForParkingAccess.pdf\">study</a> of the neighbourhood near UCLA\u2019s campus showed that drivers cruised the area looking for parking for an average of 3.3 minutes. Based on the number of parking spaces there, that adds up to about 950,000 extra miles travelled over the course of a year, burning 47,000 gallons of gasoline and emitting 730 tons of CO2.</p> <p>After San Francisco implemented a pilot project with real-time data on parking availability and dynamic pricing for spaces, an <a href=\"http://sfpark.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SFpark_Eval_Summary_2014.pdf\">evaluation</a> found that the amount of time people spent looking for parking fell by 43%. And though there\u2019s no data available on whether that\u2019s meant more people deciding not to drive to San Francisco, various researchers have <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/media/workshops/2016/behaviour/Session_2_Ng.pdf\">shown</a> that a 10% increase in the price of parking can reduce demand between 3-10%.</p> <p>Sometimes, the supply of parking goes down because nobody needs it. Since 1990, the city of Philadelphia has conducted an <a href=\"http://www.phila.gov/CityPlanning/aboutus/planningservices/Documents/2015_Parking_Study.pdf\">inventory of parking</a> every five years in the downtown Center City neighbourhood, counting publicly accessible parking spaces and analysing occupancy rates in facilities with 30 or more spaces. Because of plentiful transit options, a walkable environment and a high downtown residential population, Philadelphia is finding that it needs less parking. Between 2010 and 2015, the amount of off-street parking around downtown shrank by about 3,000 spaces, a 7% reduction. Most of that is tied to the replacement of surface lots with new development, according to Mason Austin, a planner at the Philadelphia City Planning Commission and co-author of the most recent parking inventory.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3171475eeb18206c8ba2c496633a350a563a5ee1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3171475eeb18206c8ba2c496633a350a563a5ee1/0_335_5060_3038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philadelphia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Planners in Philadelphia have noted the decrease in demand for parking, and reduced spaces accordingly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andriy Prokopenko/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAt the same time, we\u2019re seeing occupancy go down by a very small amount. So what that\u2019s telling us is the demand for this public parking is going down slightly,\u201d Austin says. \u201cAnd that could be alarming if we were also seeing some decline of economic activity, but actually that\u2019s happening at the same time as we\u2019re seeing employment go up and retail vibrancy go up.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p>And though many cities in the US are changing zoning and parking requirements to reduce or even eliminate parking minimums, cities in Europe are taking a more forceful approach. Zurich, has been among the most aggressive. In 1996, the city decreed that there would be <a href=\"http://www.streetfilms.org/zurich-a-world-class-transit-metropolis/\">no more parking</a>: officials placed a cap on the amount of parking spaces that would exist there, putting in place a trading system by which any developer proposing new parking spaces would be required to remove that many parking spaces from the city\u2019s streets. The result has been that the city\u2019s streets have become even more amenable to walking, cycling and transit use.</p> <p>Copenhagen has also been reducing the amount of parking in the central city. Pedestrianising shopping streets raising prices of parking and licences and developing underground facilites on the city\u2019s outskirts has seen city-centre parking spaces shrink and the proportion of people driving to work fall from 22% to 16%.</p> <p>Paris has been even more aggressive. Starting in 2003, the city began <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2011/07/110713-cutting-down-on-city-parking/\">eliminating on-street parking</a> and replacing it with underground facilities. Roughly 15,000 surface parking spaces have been eliminated since.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2016/sep/26/world-without-cars-cities-go-car-free-in-pictures\">A world without cars: cities go car-free for the day - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But progress is not limited to Europe. Kodransky says cities all over the world are rethinking their parking policies. S\u00e3o Paulo, for instance, got rid of its minimum parking requirements and implemented a maximum that could be built into specific projects. Beijing, Shenzhen and Guangzhou are hoping to emulate San Francisco\u2019s dynamic pricing approach.</p> <p>And as cities begin to think more carefully about how parking relates to their urban development, their density and their transit accessibility, it\u2019s likely that parking spaces will continue to decline around the world.</p> <p>\u201cUltimately parking needs to be tackled as part of a package of issues,\u201d Kodransky says. \u201cIt\u2019s been viewed in this super-narrow way, it\u2019s been an afterthought.

The \u00a311.8m business worked with cognitive neuroscientist, Dr. Jacob Jolij, to create some short VR films designed to enhance the pleasure of drinking beer to create an experience it calls \u201cBeer Goggles\u201d. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPKfB2iIT0A\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oPKfB2iIT0A?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Video from Innis and Gunn.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Drinkers at the selected bars could gaze at forests in the highlands, open waters and sunsets while drinking beer, which the brewer hoped would be a memorable experience. \u201cWhen you sip a beer you don\u2019t simply taste the water, grains and the hops, your brain adds in previous memories, surroundings and expectations to the flavour \u2013 it\u2019s why taste is always somewhat subjective,\u201d says company founder and head brewer Dougal Sharp. \u201cIt\u2019s these brain processes that we wanted to tap into, we wanted to immerse the drinker in a truly unique tasting experience.\u201d<br></p> <p>But does it make beer taste better? \u201cFrom speaking to many people who have experienced it, I\u2019d say most go in sceptical and leave surprised and impressed,\u201d says Sharp.</p> <h2>Virtual surgery</h2> <p>The breadth of possibilities VR offers are just being realised, but for surgeon and entrepreneur Shafi Ahmed, co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.medicalrealities.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Medical Realities</a>, which he launched with Steve Dann earlier this year, the potential to improve training in the medical sector using technology is huge. </p> <p>\u201cSurgical teaching and training hasn\u2019t really evolved very much over the past 100 years,\u201d says Ahmed. \u201cWe\u2019ve always taught surgery in the operating theatre, where students and trainers are often at the back of the room and not always being part of the action.\u201d </p> <p>In April this year, Ahmed performed an operation removing a cancerous tumour from a 70-year-old patient at the Royal London Hospital. What made this procedure extraordinary was that it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/apr/14/watch-the-worlds-first-virtual-reality-view-operation-live\">live-streamed</a> to over 45,000 people worldwide, who watched it through VR headsets. Formal consent was given by the patient, and steps were taken to ensure they remained anonymous. </p> <p>Ahmed now wants to scale up this kind of experience and, later this year, will launch an app enabling medical students to virtually sit-in on operations.</p> <p>The business, which has eight staff, is also working with universities to create learning suites where student doctors can train with VR. Ahmed says this could rapidly speed up the time it takes to train surgeons.</p> <h2>Fashion</h2> <p>Enabling people to enter hard-to-reach or unexplored realms is the aim of startup <a href=\"http://www.curiscope.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Curiscope</a>. Earlier this year, the business raised \u00a382,000 in a <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/curiscope/virtualitee\" rel=\"nofollow\">crowdfunding campaign</a> for the Virtuali-Tee, an augmented reality t-shirt that lets you see inside the human body via a mobile phone app. </p> <p>The app locates a code hidden in the design of the t-shirt and then shows the user an image of internal organs (where they would be located on the t-shirt\u2019s wearer) when looked at through the mobile\u2019s screen. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d1c835bac2c550c02273cb15fe14987b355cd1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d1c835bac2c550c02273cb15fe14987b355cd1e/0_128_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"t-shirt and mobile app\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Virtuali-Tee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: curiscope virtualti</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ed Barton, CEO of Curiscope, says: \u201cThe app is looking for the specific design that\u2019s on the t-shirt. When it finds that, it is able to interpret where the t-shirt is and where you are in 3D space, allowing you to navigate and explore,\u201d says Barton. </p> <p>The business has several other projects on the go, including a virtual swim with great white sharks. Barton says: \u201cThe majority of people can\u2019t jump on a plane whenever they\u2019d like, we can\u2019t learn scuba diving in an instant and dive to the bottom of the ocean, we can\u2019t all become astronauts and go into space. VR opens up these inaccessible worlds, sometimes even impossible worlds, like being at a microscopic level.\u201d </p> <h2>Entertainment</h2> <p>While some entrepreneurs want to educate, others hope to entertain. Ken Henderson is the co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.breakingfourth.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Breaking Fourth</a>, a VR studio in London. The company recently launched a new VR drama called control CTRL \u2013 a dark, dystopian tale of a young boy trying to succeed in a video games tournament \u2013 on Oculus.com (a virtual reality headset maker) where it can be downloaded by users.</p> <p>Henderson says cheaper headsets and \u2018mobile VR\u2019, where simulations can be powered by mobile phones, is leading to a surge in usage. However, he says the industry lacks content and he is hoping to take advantage. \u201cWe\u2019ve jumped ahead and are trying to be in the forefront of that,\u201d says Henderson. To make CTRL, Breaking Fourth hired actors, screenwriters and other creatives, suggesting that VR could provide the UK\u2019s creative industries with a much needed boost. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8643f45a12d8d285bbdeb9c03051cd242f6d4c70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8643f45a12d8d285bbdeb9c03051cd242f6d4c70/0_256_1380_1725/800.jpg\" alt=\"man wearing mask\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A promotional shot from In the eyes of the animal, one of the VR experiences at the Brighton Digital Festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brighton Digital Festival</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The film was also recently shown at the <a href=\"http://brightondigitalfestival.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brighton Digital Festival</a>, which had a strong VR focus this year.

Three Lao companies who were also named yesterday by the Guardian have been deeply involved in the traffic, both legal and illegal. Our evidence shows that each of them has been supported by deals with the Lao government.<br></p> <p>The earliest deal that we have seen involved the Xaysavang Trading Company, which was established in October 2002 by a Lao businessman, Vixay Keosavang. He is \u201cso well protected that nobody can arrest him in Laos\u201d, according to a source who has worked closely with Keosavang.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c69234c6cdad790529c6395ec3af82772b4831d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c69234c6cdad790529c6395ec3af82772b4831d/0_24_719_485/500.jpg\" alt=\"Vixay Keosavang (centre) pictured shirtless and on holiday with the Bach brothers, \u2018Boonchai\u2019 and Van Limh\" width=\"500\" height=\"337\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vixay Keosavang (centre) pictured shirtless and on holiday with the Bach brothers, \u2018Boonchai\u2019 and Van Limh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A report by Thai intelligence, seen by the Guardian, shows Keosavang signed formal agreements with the finance department of the Lao government that allowed his company during 2003, its first year of business, to traffic more than $11m worth of animals through the country into Vietnam and China to be eaten in restaurants, displayed as decoration or blended into supposedly medicinal tonics.<br></p> <p>These agreements granted Keosavang permission to trade twelve different species including crocodiles, monkeys and pangolin anteaters; the skins of 100,000 pythons; 250 tonnes of soft-shelled turtles (which would mean killing about 45,000 of them); 100 tonnes of dogs, which are commonly cooked in Vietnamese restaurants; 1,000 magpies; and 20 tonnes of animal bones, which are used in supposedly medicinal wine.<br></p> <p>The agreements called for Keosavang to pay a tax of 2% of the value of the transactions \u2013 4% in the case of the python skins \u2013 yielding $246,550 for the Lao treasury. These 2003 agreements appear not to have broken Lao or international law, which came into effect soon afterwards.

That finally provoked the Thai police into denouncing him as \u201cthe big boss\u201d and, a few months later in November 2013, the US government offered a $1m reward for information that led to the dismantling of his syndicate. </p> <p>Yet still the Lao authorities did not arrest Keosavang, who continued to bring in animal parts from southern Africa. Finally, in January 2014, the Lao government revoked his licence to trade wildlife. By that time, however, the Lao prime minister\u2019s office had silently snubbed the international community by signing off on more agreements to help two other companies replace him.<br></p> <p>The Guardian has had access to compelling evidence that in December 2013 the then Lao prime minister\u2019s office ordered four government ministries and two provincial governors to help these companies traffic wildlife with huge annual quotas. The agreements were worth a fortune \u2013 up to $30m in a single month for one company \u2013 with the government once again taking its 2%. Unlike the original deal with Keosavang, these agreements specifically sanctioned the sale of the three iconic species that are closest to extinction as a result of this trade: tigers, rhinos and elephants.

This included 20 tonnes of ivory, valued at $5m \u2013 a straightforward breach of international law. <a href=\"https://eia-international.org/\">The Environmental Investigation Agency</a> in London estimates that one elephant yields an average of 6.7kg of ivory, meaning that the Lao government that year was allowing Vinasakhone to trade on the criminal death of 2,985 dead elephants. The quotas also included 10 tonnes of lion bone, which is used in tonic wine; and 1,300 tonnes of live turtles, snakes, lizards and pangolin ant-eaters whose scales are used in traditional medicine \u2013 all of it potentially illegal by breaching CITES quotas.<br></p> <p>The other company, Vannaseng Trading, was authorised to traffic even more. In ivory alone, according to our evidence, the government agreed that during 2014 they could traffic 90 tonnes of ivory with an estimated value of $22.5m. That equates to 13,432 elephants lying dead in the African bush; also 4 tonnes of rhino horn that was valued at only $240,000; and 20 tonnes of tiger skin and bone and claws worth $1.2m. All of that trade in all three of those species is illegal.<br></p> <p>Also agreed was potentially illegal trade in live turtles, water monitors, pangolins and exotic birds; 6 tonnes of python skin and 120 tonnes of dead and frozen pangolin. The total package agreed with Vannaseng for 2014 was worth $28.2m \u2013 all to be officially taxed at 2% for the government\u2019s treasury.<br></p> <p>Both Vinaskhone and Vannaseng have a track record of wildlife crime. Until last week, the Lao government had failed to take action against them even though some of this crime has been recorded in internal government reports.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1cb14256c1db3829fd9a9b22f560dfa7d477cf2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cb14256c1db3829fd9a9b22f560dfa7d477cf2b/318_0_3520_2852/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Animal rights activists carry placards outside the Sandton convention centre in Johannesburg, where the Cites summit is being held.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"810\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Animal rights activists carry placards outside the Sandton convention centre in Johannesburg, where the Cites summit is being held.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kim Ludbrook/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When inspectors from the Ministry of Agriculture checked the companies\u2019 farm records in October 2014, they found that so far that year, they had traded a combined total of 7.7 tonnes of lion and tiger bone. At least some of that trade must have been illegal. All international trade in tiger bone is illegal under Cites; trade in lion bone is allowed only if it is covered by Cites permits. Even if the entire 7.7 tonnes was lion bone, at an average weight of 10kg per skeleton that would represent 770 dead lions. But Cites records show that during the whole calendar year of 2014, Laos had permits to import the skeletons of only 360 lions.</p> <p>If there was any doubt, the inspector\u2019s report explicitly accused both farms of breaching Cites by importing and exporting endangered species without having any paperwork to show that it was within legal limits. Crucially, the inspectors added that the law could not be enforced against them \u201cbecause they have got approval from government\u201d.<br></p> <p>In March this year, inspectors from the Ministry of Natural Resources went to the farm run by Vinasakhone since 2002 near the town of Thakek in central Laos. According to the report, seen by the Guardian, the farm, which houses about 400 tigers in pens, is involved in speed-breeding \u2013 using females as young as two years old to produce cubs twice each year. The inspectors note that this is regarded as bad practice. But their report goes on to make a much more serious allegation: that Vinasakhone has been killing its tigers to order for sale to Vietnam and China \u2013 a brazen breach of the law.<br></p> <p>The report says: \u201cTraders usually come to the farm to select the animal they want, take pictures and record an identity. The selection is whether that animal is pretty, pretty teeth, paws and tail, basically no scar on its body. The animal is killed at the farm by injection, all intestines are removed so they keep only the body with skin, bones and meat, covered with plastic sheet for shipment.\u201d<br></p> <p>The report adds that Vinasakhone managers admitted selling a hundred tigers to the notorious Golden Triangle on Laos\u2019s borders with Myanmar and Thailand. A 2015 investigation by the Environmental Investigation Agency described this area as \u201ca playground catering to the desires of visiting Chinese\u201d where \u201ca combination of weak laws, poor enforcement and official complicity allows the illegal wildlife trade to flourish\u201d. The EIA found traders openly selling tiger skins and stuffed tigers while restaurants sold bottles of tiger bone wine and \u201dsauteed tiger meat\u201d. All are illegal.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4983edcd9c44610cc76fb8699e9fe54e9985785\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4983edcd9c44610cc76fb8699e9fe54e9985785/0_399_5284_3170/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A female tiger and her cubs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A female tiger and her cubs.

In their report, the inspectors said they suspected the farm had been involved in the illegal purchase of monkeys captured in the wild. This echoed a 2010 report by the the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, which published emails in which the manager of the farm said that the business had been started with monkeys caught in the wild in Cambodia and smuggled into Laos, adding that he was planning to apparently break the law again by bringing in more wild monkeys in the near future.<br></p> <p>Laos remains a full member of Cites, although it was briefly suspended early in 2015 for failing to to deliver a national plan to deal with the ivory trade.

  "<p>China has been accused of deceiving the international community by allowing a network of farms to breed thousands of captive tigers for the sale of their body parts, in breach of their own longstanding ban on the trade.<br></p> <p>The Chinese government has allowed about 200 specialist farms to hold an estimated 6,000 tigers for slaughter, before their skins are sold as decoration and their bones are marinated to produce tonics and lotions. Campaigners say this has increased demand for the products and provoked the poaching of thousands of wild tigers, whose global population is now down to just 3,500.<br></p> <p>China is expected to come under pressure at this week\u2019s Johannesburg conference of nations who have signed the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites). The Guardian has found that Chinese delegates have tried to obstruct debate at the conference by rewriting a critical report and questioning the wording of a key decision.<br></p> <p>The Chinese say their domestic market is nobody else\u2019s business since Cites covers only international trade. They also point out that by breeding 6,000 tigers in captivity they have significantly increased the population of the species, and question why western countries should be allowed to breed cattle and pigs for their own markets if they are to be criticised for doing so with tigers.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98abb68a4c2a1a91b7d2d8e75ea52cb040904c98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98abb68a4c2a1a91b7d2d8e75ea52cb040904c98/0_501_4036_2421/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rows of tiger cages at the Xiongsen bear and tiger farm in Guilin, China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rows of tiger cages at the Xiongsen bear and tiger farm in Guilin, China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sinopix/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The argument gets to the heart of the debate about whether endangered species have an inherent right to exist in their own habitat, or should be allowed to survive only if they have some commercial value \u2013 \u201cif it pays, it stays\u201d.

A decade later, the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) discovered that, having opened the farms, the SFA had been quietly issuing licences for the sale of skins from the tigers that were bred there. The SFA claimed that the skins were only sold to museums and universities for scientific purposes, but the EIA found at least half ended up in the plush apartments of China\u2019s elite.<br></p> <p>Facing exposure, the Chinese disclosed that the wording of the State Council\u2019s 1993 ban had been much narrower than its public statements had suggested, and that it applied only to trade in products produced from tiger bones, primarily wine. But, as animal rights campaigners dug deeper, it soon became clear that the SFA were also licensing the sale of tiger bone products. And the profits were huge. The wildlife-tracking NGO Traffic found tiger bone wine selling at $257 for 500ml, while another group, the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), found one farm alone had a cellar full of vats containing 1.2 million litres, worth an estimated $617m. Wine from marinated tiger penis was even more expensive, at $490 per 500ml. Meat was being sold at $100 a dish; teeth at $660 each; and whole skins for up to $22,000.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/26/bach-brothers-elephant-ivory-asias-animal-trafficking-network\">The crime family at the centre of Asia's animal trafficking network</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Inspired by China\u2019s behaviour, Thailand, Vietnam and Laos also opened tiger farms, some of which were suspected to be not only breeding animals for body parts but also \u201claundering\u201d wild tigers that had been captured. Wild tigers are close to extinction in Vietnam and possibly already extinct in Laos. China is believed to have only 50.</p> <p>The issue came to a head in June 2007 at a conference at The Hague. Cites formally made a collective decision\u2013 numbered 14.69 \u2013 to go beyond its international remit, stating baldly that \u201ctigers should not be bred for trade in their parts\u201d and calling for all tiger farms to cut back their stock to the minimum needed for conservation of the species. Chinese delegates protested loudly that 14.69 was an intrusion in their domestic affairs, argued with the wording and formally noted their objection.<br></p> <p>Meanwhile, staff at the Beijing office of IFAW, which had been particularly vocal, became aware of men ostentatiously following them in the street, and the director\u2019s driver reported that some of the men had approached him and asked for detailed reports on the director\u2019s activity.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d1251f8f2c173fdd83a6b30f71530d3dbac27a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d1251f8f2c173fdd83a6b30f71530d3dbac27a1/0_0_5010_3352/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Activists march on the Cites conference in Sandton, Johannesburg, last Saturday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Activists march on the Cites conference in Sandton, Johannesburg, last Saturday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Farrell/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Minutes from Cites meetings show that since 14.69 was adopted, China has repeatedly quarrelled with its wording; claimed that the decision was not made by consensus; and consistently failed to produce information demanded by Cites about its tiger farms. When 13 heads of government met for the Global Tiger Initiative in St Petersburg in November 2010, the then Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, called for an end to the tiger trade, yet his delegates joined with those from Thailand, Vietnam and Laos to ensure that the meeting\u2019s final declaration was worded to allow their farms to continue trading.<br></p> <p>The effect has been devastating. An analysis by the EIA found that in the 12 years from 2000, law enforcement agencies seized 1,031 tiger carcasses or skins \u2013 90% of which were en route to China. Working on the standard police estimate that just 10% of illicit trade is seized, then somewhere in the region of 10,000 tigers were killed primarily for China\u2019s consumers in this period.<br></p> <p>In the buildup to this month\u2019s Cites conference in Johannesburg \u2013 and in spite of its track record \u2013 China took over the chairmanship of the working group on big cats, and used its position to water down the findings of a report that Cites had commissioned from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).<br></p> <p>The report, seen by the Guardian, embarrassed China by finding that they had \u201csystematically exercised internal trading privileges for companies dealing in big cat skins and derivatives, produced mainly from captive breeding\u201d.

I am joining them at the London demonstration of the <a href=\"http://millionsmissing.meaction.net/\" title=\"\">Millions Missing</a> campaign, outside the Department of Health.</p> <p>Many ME patients are too ill to take part the global day of action, so instead they will leave pairs of shoes in public places as a visual symbol of the millions of lives gone unlived, jobs undone, relationships never formed by people with the disease.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In my 20s, I faced a life in which I was unable to work, or even walk to the other side of the street</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I became suddenly ill with ME during my last year of university. It meant I was in constant pain and completely unable to function, struggling to leave my bed once a day to use the toilet. In my 20s, I faced a life in which I was unable to work, or even walk to the other side of the street. But a quarter of the 250,000 people with ME in the UK have more severe symptoms. Some of them are bedridden, for decades, unable to tolerate light or to touch, chew, swallow or talk.</p> <p>Most people \u2013 including many doctors \u2013 think ME is just extreme tiredness. Also known as chronic fatigue syndrome, ME can have multiple symptoms, ranging from severe muscle pain to digestive, sleep and autonomic problems. A landmark report in 2015 by the American Institute of Medicine <a href=\"http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/Reports/2015/ME-CFS.aspx\" title=\"\">defines ME</a> as \u201can acquired, chronic multi-systemic disease biological in nature\u201d symptoms of which include \u201cimmune, neurological and cognitive impairment\u201d. Yet patients are still being dismissed and disbelieved. In the UK, a <a href=\"http://www.meassociation.org.uk/archive-of-mea-surveys/\" title=\"\">survey</a> carried out by the ME Association earlier this year found that 46% of patients thought the care provided by their GP was \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cdreadful\u201d.

Two psychiatrists in the 1970s even tried to rename ME as <em>Encephalomyletis Nervosa</em>. Because it mainly affected women, they thought it must be a kind of hysteria. This attitude towards mainly female patients is still present. Sexism is part of the reason why diagnosis remains poor and prospects of treatment years away. I waited a year to see a specialist \u2013 only to be told by him that my ME was probably the result of being stressed by the \u201cposh boys\u201d at Oxford. That was the sum total of my treatment, and I was turned away after requesting further care at a different hospital.</p> <p>GPs continue to treat many people with ME as though it were a mental illness, referring patients for cognitive behaviour therapy and exercise. But being pushed to do more physically can make many people with ME worse, and lead to relapses that last for decades. Graded exercise and CBT came to be the standard treatments for patients on the NHS as a result of a hugely controversial \u00a35m trial \u2013 known as the Pace trial \u2013 which in 2011 claimed that the two treatments could lead to \u201crecovery\u201d.

What this will amount to <a href=\"http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/46310/title/NIH-Tackles-Neglected-Mystery-Illness/\" title=\"\">remains to be seen</a>.</p> <p>Breakthroughs are happening.

They found a clear pattern of abnormalities, or a chemical signature in the patients with ME which could be used in future to diagnose patients. Currently there is no single test that can diagnose the condition and it is partly due to this that there is so much controversy.</p> <p>ME patients have been treated with disdain for too long; the institutions that should be there to help and represent us have all too often dismissed our intense physical suffering as hypochondria or hysteria. Yet throughout it all, people with ME have never given up; many have worked (from their beds), <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2016/09/21/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-pace-trial/\" title=\"\">exposing bad science</a> and campaigning for their rights. The Millions Missing campaign is calling for the US government to increase funding from $7m to $250m a year.

It\u2019s not just that Chao has lived in the city for many years, his music also reflects the chaotic, hippyish melting pot that is the modern Catalan capital, a city where you\u2019re as likely to see someone juggling poi in the park or practising capoeira as studying <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/antoni-gaudi\">Gaud\u00ed</a>\u2019s architecture.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Last Saturday, Chao made his live return to Barcelona, playing a free outdoor gig as part of the festivities around the city\u2019s co-patron saint, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Merc%C3%A8\">La Merc\u00e8</a>. He hadn\u2019t played Barcelona in years \u2013 the Esperanzah! festival where he performed in 2015 takes place in the suburbs \u2013 and the last time he played as part of La Merc\u00e8, in 2001, 60,000 people showed up. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Saturday\u2019s gig, then, was a hero\u2019s homecoming, not unlike the Stone Roses playing a free concert in Manchester \u2013 if the Stones Roses were knit-cap-wearing world travellers.

Manu Chao was popular in the UK and the US in the 2000s, shifting about 500,000 copies of his debut album Clandestino in the States. But that was nothing compared to his fame in mainland Europe and Latin America, where he can still fill stadiums. </p> <p>With no new studio album since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/aug/31/worldmusic.shopping\">La Radiolina</a> in 2007 and no UK gigs since 2011, Chao may have slipped off the Anglophone radar of late, but that\u2019s not to say he\u2019s been slacking. As well as working on new material, Chao keeps up a busy schedule of summer festival appearances in Europe and Latin American and recently helped to produce the new album by Tobagonian singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/21/calypso-rose-im-fighting-for-everyone-regardless-of-sex\">Calypso Rose</a>. But for many music fans in Britain, Chao\u2019s success feels like a dream brought on by too many red wines and late nights, destined to be filed and forgotten alongside tie-dyed T-shirts. It\u2019s a shame, because this Barcelona gig showed precisely why Chao remains a global superstar, a stadium rocker who stands apart from conventional wisdom.</p> <p>The name of Chao\u2019s first live album, Radio Bemba Sound System, offers a clue as to why he is so far from the average rocker, its name hinting at a live modus operandi that owes almost as much to sound system culture as traditional rock mores. During Saturday\u2019s concert, which stretched from 11.45pm until almost three in the morning, Chao mixed and matched his best-known songs, with musical themes from one track layered on to another in the style of a giant DJ mix. So Bongo Bong, possibly his biggest hit, turned up rockified and steely in the extended coda to La Primavera, while the chorus to Mr Bobby was a returning musical theme throughout the night. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a042de3d9298d9f3fef3a789b9ad62a066cca9ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a042de3d9298d9f3fef3a789b9ad62a066cca9ad/0_149_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manu Chao \u2026 \u2018Hands up who wants to hear some Chas and Dave!\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manu Chao \u2026 \u2018Hands up who wants to hear some Chas and Dave!\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesc Meseguer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The impression of a freewheeling party megamix was underlined by the variety of guest singers and musicians who joined Chao on stage, including habitual support act Dani Lan\u00e7a and Basque punk rocker Fermin Muguruza, who contributed to covers of their own songs. The sound of ska could be heard throughout in the band\u2019s frantic off-beat guitar scratches and strident brass, while there were shades of everything from chanson to salsa to Catalan rumba in the mix, the latter notable on a scorching Rumba de Barcelona, one of several nods to Chao\u2019s hometown.<br></p> <p>The conflagration of ska, rumba and salsa felt appropriate in a city with a large Latin American population and where Bob Marley is a god. However, that\u2019s not to say Manu Chao entirely shuns the Anglo musical lexicon. The influence of punk was strong, both in the frenetic lurch of Radio Bemba and the way a good two-thirds of the songs ended up in a double-time punk thrash, a trick that was both effective and wearing on the ears.

Certainly, the crowd was delighted, exhibiting the kind of fleet-footed bounce you don\u2019t often see two and a half hours into a gig in the early hours of a wet Sunday morning. The atmosphere was spectacular, too, with up to 20 people pogoing away on stage and the crowd following the peculiarly Catalan tradition of showering each other with firework sparks while singing along loudly.<br></p> <p>But doubts remain as to where Manu Chao goes from here. His work with Calypso Rose on her recent album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/10/calypso-rose-far-from-home-review\"> Far From Home</a> opened new vistas, but you would be hard pressed to spot the difference between the Manu Chao of 2016 and the singer who played <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/oct/04/worldmusic\">three nights at the Brixton Academy in 2007</a>. He covered Fuera Monsanto, a 2013 song by Argentinian band Perro Verde, but there was no sign of new material that might indicate a long-awaited follow up to La Radiolina, nine years on (though it can be hard to work out exactly what Chao is playing at any given point).<br></p> <p>For the 60,000 who sang their lungs out on Saturday night, that didn\u2019t seem to matter. You could even argue that a record like Clandestino so comprehensively nailed Chao\u2019s unique musical charm that anything else will always pale in comparison. But for someone so obviously talented as Chao, a songwriter who can turn out a song as effortlessly emotive and enduringly relevant as Desaparecido, retreading old ground feels a little underwhelming. Local hero or not.<br></p>",

  "<p>When a South Africa Airways scheduled flight flew from Johannesburg to Cape Town last month, it carried nearly 300 passengers.</p> <p>Neither the passengers or the pilots would have noticed any difference between that flight and any other. </p> <p>But instead of the usual petroleum-based jet fuel, the plane was burning thousands of litres of a clear liquid derived from the oil of nicotine-free tobacco plants grown by farmers on acres of under-used land in the country\u2019s Limpopo province.</p> <p>Boeing, KLM, South African Airways, the Dutch government and others who partnered in the trial were cock-a-hoop with the results, which came as part of something called <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.projectsolaris.co.za/\">Project Solaris</a>.</p> <p>It appeared that the fuel was not only efficient, but it was also more or less \u201csustainable\u201d, because it did not take up farmland needed to grow food or lead to deforestation or ecological problems. </p> <p>\u201cIt showed that a low-carbon aviation biofuel could be be grown that will not affect the environment and could reward farmers,\u201d said Joost Van Lier, a director of South African Sunchem biofuel development, one of the project\u2019s partners.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The tobacco fuel used was much more expensive than regular jet fuel, but because many airlines have committed to reducing CO2 emissions and substituting biofuels for some of their jet fuel by 2020, Project Solaris hopes to ramp up the acreage of tobacco grown to eventually produce millions of litres of the fuel in other southern African countries such as Malawi.</p> <p>So far, there have been around 2,500 successful flights fuelled by biofuels. In March, United Airlines became the first US airline to use biofuel <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://newsroom.united.com/2016-03-11-United-Airlines-Makes-History-with-Launch-of-Regularly-Scheduled-Flights-Using-Sustainable-Biofuel\">for regularly scheduled commercial flights from Los Angeles airport</a>, and in June Alaska Airlines <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://blog.alaskaair.com/alaska-airlines/news/gevo-biofuel-flight/\">flew commercial flights using biofuel based on isobutanol produced from corn</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cOslo airport now supplies airlines with alternative fuels for regular daily flights. Los Angeles is following and we expect John F Kennedy and other New York airports to stream from 2019,\u201d said Michael Gill, executive director of the Air Transport Action Group, a coalition of aviation industry companies. </p> <p>But despite successful tests and trials with different crops and waste streams, is there any hope in the forseeable future of aviation biofuels taking off on the scale needed to make even the slightest dent in the <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm?tid=5&amp;pid=63&amp;aid=2&amp;cid=ww,US,&amp;syid=1990&amp;eyid=2012&amp;unit=TBPD\">300bn litres </a>of jet fuel used worldwide every year? Worldwide, flights produced nearly 800m tonnes of CO2 in 2015, or up to 5% of all CO2 emissions. </p> <p>\u201cNo credible scenarios exist for large-scale production of biofuels at present,\u201d said Carlos Calvo Ambel, an energy analyst with Brussels-based watchdog group Transport &amp; Environment. \u201cSo far, only a handful of companies produce renewable jet fuel on a commercial scale, and a single airport , Oslo, is set up to provide it.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p> International aviation and shipping werenot mentioned in the Paris agreement, so it is unclear how their rapidly growing emissions are to be addressed. But the need for the industry to adopt a global scheme is seen as urgent if there is any hope of meeting the Paris agreement\u2019s aspiration of holding temperature rises to 1.5C. As it is, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-aviations-battle-to-limit-rising-emissions\">the current industry projections</a> expect aviation emissions to quadruple, potentially to account for 22% of global emissions by 2050. </p> <p>Instead of relying on biofuels, governments are pinning their hopes on a UN global carbon offset scheme. This is to be negotiated this week in Montreal when 191 governments meet for the UN\u2019s International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) summit. A draft scheme is backed by US, Canada, Mexico, EU countries including the UK, and Singapore.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>According to Transport &amp; Environment, the US wants the new deal to cover as many countries as possible. \u201cIts strategy has been to weaken the agreement\u2019s environmental effectiveness so as to attract more states. China is pursuing a similar strategy, and it has yet to commit itself to signing up,\u201d it said. </p> <p>But there are grave reservations among NGOs that an offset scheme, which could see other industrial sectors cutting emissions to allow aviation to continue growing, is not ambitious enough and may not even work. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The proposal in <a href=\"http://www.icao.int/Meetings/a39/Documents/WP/wp_052_en.pdf\">the draft text</a> released earlier this month defines a voluntary \u201cpilot and implementation\u201d period from 2021-27 after which countries would have to join in. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cOne of the discussions in Montreal will be whether to include Redd [Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation] offsets [offsets based on avoiding deforestation] in ICAO\u2019s offsetting scheme. As a way of addressing climate change, offsetting flying against the carbon stored in forests would be insane,\u201d says Chris Lang, editor of <a href=\"http://www.redd-monitor.org/\">Redd Monitor</a> which has analysed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/dec/19/what-is-redd-climate-change-deforestation\">UN proposals to reduce forestry emissions with a similar offset scheme</a>. </p> <p>\u201cNot only would such a scheme allow the aviation sector to continue expanding and to continue burning fossil fuels, it would rely on carbon being stored in forests. Yet as climate change worsens, the risk of these forests burning and returning the carbon to the atmosphere is increasing,\u201d he said.</p> <p> The offsetting scheme, which hopes to stabilise aviation emissions at 2020 levels, is strongly defended by Michael Gill, director of the Aviation Transport Action Group (ATAG), an industry coalition. </p> <p> \u201cOffsetting is not a new concept,\u201d he says. \u201cIndeed, a large number of airlines already offer offsetting to passengers on a voluntary basis. What the industry does need is certainty, with a clear set of metrics defined before the scheme commences and consistently applied throughout its lifetime.\u201d</p> <p>Alexandre de Juniac, director general of the International Air Transport Association (Iata), said: \u201cI am optimistic that we are on the brink of a historic agreement\u2014a first for an industry sector at the global level. The aviation industry would have preferred a more ambitious timeline than is currently outlined.\u201d </p> <p>Critics are not convinced. The International Coalition for Sustainable Aviation (ICSA), the only civil society body accredited to observe the aviation proceedings, has strong reservations about the proposed market-based scheme because it would rely on a system of \u201cvoluntary, unguaranteed participation with weak environmental safeguards\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe new proposed text would allow nations participating ... to opt out with only six months\u2019 notice, raising serious concerns about the durability of the programme,\u201d said the ICSA in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://uploads.strikinglycdn.com/files/afc9650e-aaeb-4741-a329-ebcc983e7280/ISCA%20Statement%209.7%20(3).pdf\">a letter to EU commissioners</a>. </p> <p>The coalition also fears that if the offsets used to achieve the goal of the UN scheme are also credited to other climate goals, emissions will increase while countries and airlines appear to meet their pledges. </p> <p>Instead they want to see ambitious states and regions allowed to go further in reducing their emissions and clear language introduced to avoid double counting.</p> <p>The environmental coalition prefers an expansion of the EU emissions trading system (ETS), which controversially <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/15/eu-airline-emissions-tax-success\">included aviation for 10 months in 2012</a>. The scheme involved the EU imposing a cap on carbon dioxide emissions for all planes arriving or departing from EU airports, while allowing airlines to buy and sell \u201cpollution credits\u201d , rewarding low carbon-emitting aviation. </p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/12/eu-airline-emissions-law\">the EU froze the scheme in November 2012</a> after the ICAO said it would take global action on emissions from planes. </p> <p>\u201cThe EU stopped the clock on its own ETS to give ICAO time to develop an environmentally meaningful measure, not a voluntary scheme which postpones serious action for a decade or more. Europe should be proud of setting the global benchmark, and never replace it with something inferior that is open to bogus offset programmes,\u201d said Andrew Murphy, aviation policy officer at Transport &amp; Environment.</p> <p><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

Scovell co-wrote Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s 2013 bestselling ode to the power of female negotiation. And it was but one job in a broad (to put it mildly) career. The first staff writer at Spy magazine, she got into television via a script she sent on spec to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/mar/24/garry-shandling-comedy-sitcom-legacy\">It\u2019s Garry Shandling\u2019s Show</a>. This led to writing gigs at Late Night With David Letterman (her Vanity Fair piece about <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2009/10/david-letterman-200910\">what a hostile environment it was for a woman is a must-read</a>) and the Simpsons before creating Sabrina. </p> <p>The show premiered to almost 18m viewers and became a venerable staple in ABC\u2019s 90s-era Friday night TGIF lineup. Today, Scovell views her career trajectory as utterly unsurprising. \u201cIt makes total sense to me,\u201d she says. \u201cSabrina was my attempt to create a show that I would\u2019ve loved as that weird young girl who grew up to write for Letterman and Spy and The Simpsons.\u201d</p> <p>The show lives on through syndication, exposing a new generation of teens to its unique, undeniable charm. When asked to explain the show\u2019s continued appeal to smart, weird, girls and boys, Scovell says: \u201cIt was unusual to have a girl as the star, so that was empowering. And the stories weren\u2019t cookie-cutter, either. In one of my favorite episodes, Sabrina wanted to know if [her best friend] Harvey liked her as more than a friend so she put \u2018truth sprinkles\u2019 on his bundt cake in home ec class. But the teacher ended up putting them on all the cakes and, for a day, everyone at school told each other what they really think. Sabrina came home and told her aunts that the lesson was that the world would be an awful place if everyone told the truth all the time.\u201d <br></p> <p>Scovell laughs. \u201cI bet no TGIF show ever landed on that moral before.\u201d And chances are, it never will again.<br></p>",
  "<p>From its iconic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/gallery/2015/oct/07/german-artist-tehran-freedom-arch-pictures\">Azadi (freedom) tower</a>, which has ridden out a revolution, an eight-year war and innumerable protest rallies, to the elegant museum of contemporary art or the city theatre, Tehran has long been home to a brand of wacky, yet distinctively Iranian, contemporary buildings. </p> <p>In the few decades leading up to the 1979 Islamic revolution, architects such as Houshang Seyhoun, Kamran Diba and Hossein Amanat pushed the boundaries of traditional Persian architecture by using traditional elements in modern designs; Amanat\u2019s freedom tower epitomises those efforts.</p> <p>After the revolution, however, the Iranian capital\u2019s architectural scene suffered a serious blow as the country was consumed first by war then by postwar reconstruction. But more recently, with young architects educating themselves in worldwide trends, and the relative stability of the country compared to its post-revolutionary upheaval, a new generation are following in the footsteps of the veterans.

But, similarly to cities like Tokyo, this means Tehran is constantly able to renew its visual identity.\u201d</p> <p>Tehran\u2019s mayors are also influential. Former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was one. And the incumbent, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, who has run eye-catching projects such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/07/tehran-swaps-death-to-america-billboards-picasso-matisse-hockney-iran\">installing Picasso and Matisse billboards</a> on the city\u2019s streets, has presidential ambitions himself \u2013 leading, says Ghaleghi, to \u201cthe motivation of Tehran\u2019s mayor to commission ambitious projects and improve the urban set-up\u201d.</p> <p>Architects in Iran also enjoy a great deal of freedom. \u201cTheir hands are not tied,\u201d says Kamran Rezaianpour, founder of the architecture firm Idehandish, which has offices in Tehran and Shiraz. \u201cThe mayor\u2019s office won\u2019t make obstacles; the main issue is to persuade the owner. In Tehran, the mayor\u2019s office is mainly concerned with two issues: parking spaces and the height of buildings.\u201d</p> <p>Nor is the new architectural freedom limited to the capital. \u201cIn fact, in other cities, such as Isfahan, Shiraz, Mashhad and Tabriz, you\u2019ll see more creative works than in Tehran,\u201d Rezaianpour says. \u201cIn the past, there was a huge difference between the capital Tehran and big provincial cities in that regard, now this has been narrowed.\u201d</p> <h2>Sharifi-ha house </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6aaf897dfe2e8da768cd494394e790d39a43b3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6aaf897dfe2e8da768cd494394e790d39a43b3e/0_571_2880_3599/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sharifi-ha House, Tehran.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharifi-ha House, Tehran.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Parham Taghioff</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Built in 2014 in Tehran\u2019s affluent Darrous neighbourhood, the Sharifi-ha house is a seven-floor building with three rotating blocks that turn 90 degrees.

  "<p>The issue of how climate change is affecting coffee production hit the headlines recently after the publication of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/29/climate-change-predicted-to-halve-coffee-growing-area-that-supports-120m-people\">new report</a> from the Climate Institute, which claims climate change will halve the area suitable for coffee production by 2050.</p> <p>While companies may once have diversified their suppliers in the face of supply risk, the systematic impact of climate change across coffee-growing regions requires a radical rethink of production models and sourcing relationships, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/may/11/coffee-supply-chain-arabica-climate-change-business-model\">according to</a> Alejandro Litovsky, the founder and CEO of the Earth Security Group.</p> <p>This inevitably affects the more than 120 million of the world\u2019s poorest people who rely on the coffee supply chain for their livelihoods. With this in mind, we brought together four experts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/live/2016/sep/16/coffee-climate-change-smallholders-central-america-ethiopia-technology-funding\">to debate</a> how coffee, and those who produce it, can be supported.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what you need to know:</p> <h2>1. Climate change is already causing problems </h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is threatening the livelihoods of producers we work with. We see the impact, they are producing less.</p> </blockquote> <p>These are the words of Steven Macatonia, co-founder of Union Hand-Roasted Coffee, who said that changing weather patterns such as erratic rainfall, increased temperatures, and more pests and disease are having a negative effect on the volume and quality of coffee produced.</p> <p>Aaron Davis, senior research leader of plant resources at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, said that while some of the more recently published work on coffee and climate change is probably too pessimistic, it is very clear that coffee farming worldwide is being negatively influenced by climate change.</p> <h2>2. The effects will be far reaching</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Climate change is happening already but its impacts will not be distributed equally.<br></p> </blockquote> <p>Emma Pinchbeck, head of climate and energy policy at WWF, said that as climate change worsens it is poor communities who bear the brunt of the impacts, especially if they\u2019re dependent for their income on natural resources such as coffee. A quarter of Ethiopians make a living from growing coffee, for example.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/may/11/coffee-supply-chain-arabica-climate-change-business-model\">Your morning espresso could be about to get a lot more expensive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pinchbeck also pointed out that the impact on coffee drinkers will be a useful reminder that climate change\u2019s impacts won\u2019t be restricted to developing countries.</p> <h2>3. There are steps coffee growers can take </h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A useful first step is to understand your local and regional climate, in order to work out the level of risk </p> </blockquote> <p>That\u2019s the advice from Davis, who added this can be done by investing in simple climatic monitoring equipment, which can be used to assess the performance of each season\u2019s crop in relation to climatic variables and the long-term climatic averages. This gives farmers a better understanding of where they are on the scale of risk, and what adaptation measures need to be implemented, said Davis. </p> <p>The most obvious interventions are irrigation, shade management and mulching, but terracing also has clear benefits. Shifting to another coffee species (for example, from Arabica to Robusta), or using more drought resilient cultivars of existing species, may also be an option.</p> <h2>4. Farmers need protection from financial instability</h2> <p>Hugo Villela, regional agribusiness specialist at Oikocredit, pointed out that as well as the problem of smallholder coffee producers being exposed to increased price volatility as a result of climate change, there is also the issue of long-term investors withdrawing their investments if they deem coffee too risky.</p> <p>Fairtrade is one solution, said Villela, as the certification provides a minimum price which buffers some of the effects of price volatility caused by the impact of weather on crop supply. But only a small portion of coffee producers can access this benefit, he said, since not all coffee producers hold a Fairtrade certificate.</p> <p>The increased challenges faced by farmers requires them to improve their commercial skills in order to buffer the blows. For example, said Villela, they will need better stock control, improved price risk management incorporating more varied financing options, tighter controls over their business commitments, and to adopt more long-term, diversified approaches to their small-holdings.<br></p> <h2>5. New technology won\u2019t solve everything</h2> <p>The technical ability to understand how climate change will influence each coffee growing area now exists, said Davis. Much of this work relies on modern technology, such as remote sensing \u2013 the use of satellite data \u2013 and advanced computer modelling.</p> <p>But not all farmers will be able to afford this technology, said Davis, and it is not a complete cure:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is clear that for many farmers even the most sophisticated adaptation interventions will not ensure resilience against climate change and climatic perturbations. </p> </blockquote> <p> </p> <ul> <li><strong>Read the full live chat here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/live/2016/sep/16/coffee-climate-change-smallholders-central-america-ethiopia-technology-funding\">Climate change is threatening the world\u2019s coffee supplies: what can we do?</a></strong><br></li> </ul>",

As he ducked and dived with incoherent excuses, she stared at him with thinly veiled contempt.</p> <p>Then, right at the end, like a long-suffering, frosty school principal, she decided to expel the ranting, sniffling, whining 70-year-old schoolboy who had not done his homework. </p> <p>Trump had said she did not have the stamina to be president. Icy and deadly, Clinton replied: \u201cWell, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a ceasefire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/debate-fact-check-trump-clinton-live-quotes-hofstra\">Presidential debate fact-check: a review of Trump's and Clinton's claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Elsewhere, the first female candidate to participate in a US presidential debate pointed to the Republican nominee\u2019s past derogatory comments toward women, invoking Alicia Machado<em tabindex=\"-1\">,</em> a beauty pageant contestant he had called \u201cMs Piggy\u201d and \u201cMs Housekeeping\u201d.

And then, as the mood quickly soured: \u201cI\u2019ve met a lot of people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald.\u201d</p> <p>Trump nearly always called his Democratic rival Secretary Clinton. At the outset he checked: \u201cIs that OK? I want you to be very happy.\u201d But the politeness very quickly faded as he interrupted, heckled, rolled his eyes and tried to throw the authority figure off her game with lies. She missed some opportunities to capitalise as she stared at him with thinly veiled contempt.</p> <p>The debate of the century at Hofstra University on Long Island, New York, began with Clinton and Trump striding out on a deep blue stage with white stars and a giant seal: the American eagle with an olive branch, a bunch of arrows and the words: \u201cThe union and the constitution forever.\u201d</p> <p>The nation that brought you Batman v Superman and Captain America v Iron Man held its breath for Mrs Know It All v Mr Know Nothing.</p> <p>Clinton said the central question of the election is what kind of country the US wanted to be: \u201cToday is my granddaughter\u2019s second birthday, so I think about this a lot.\u201d Trump, the former host of The Apprentice, narrowed his eyes, tightened his mouth and stared at the camera, as if trying to plant in the audience\u2019s mind the familiar phrase: \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d</p> <p>But the gloves soon came off.

As if to prove the point, Trump told Clinton later: \u201cYou\u2019ve been fighting Isis your entire adult life.\u201d</p> <p>Even Clinton hardly knew how to respond to that one. \u201cThat\u2019s a \u2013 that\u2019s \u2013 go to the \u2013 please, fact-checkers, get to work.\u201d</p> <p>Later Clinton mused: \u201cI have a feeling that by the end of this evening, I\u2019m going to be blamed for everything that\u2019s ever happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d asked Trump.</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d responded Clinton. \u201cYeah, why not?\u201d</p> <p>The pair also tangled over Trump\u2019s tax returns. Clinton was cutting: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to ask yourself, why won\u2019t he release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he\u2019s not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe he\u2019s not as charitable as he claims to be. Third, we don\u2019t know all of his business dealings,\u201d she said, adding that he may not have paid any income tax.</p> <p>Trump lobbed in: \u201cThat makes me smart.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/trump-sniffles-presidential-debate-clinton-hofstra\">Trump's sniffles distract viewers at first presidential debate with Clinton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Had the class clown just admitted on live television, before a global audience of tens of millions, that he has not in fact paid income tax? Clinton squandered the opportunity to pin him down on it.</p> <p>He offered to release his tax returns if she released her deleted emails, branding her handling of sensitive information \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. But even much-criticized NBC presenter Matt Lauer, in the recent \u201ccommander-in-chief\u201d forum between the two, had spent longer on the email issue than Trump managed.</p> <p>There was, finally, a more substantial section on race relations. Trump boasted of his travels to speak to African American voters, telling Clinton: \u201cYou\u2019ve seen me, I\u2019ve been all over the place. You decided to stay home and that\u2019s OK.\u201d</p> <p>But Clinton had a zinger up her sleeve: \u201cI think Donald just criticised me for preparing for this debate. And yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p> <p>Trump was asked about his crusade to sow doubts over Barack Obama\u2019s birthplace. He flunked the test and this was the turning point in the debate. \u201cI say nothing because I was able to get him to produce [his birth certificate]. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing.\u201d</p> <p>On national security and foreign policy, he was all over the place. Resurrecting one of the best lines from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/29/hillary-clinton-convention-speech-analysis\">her convention speech</a>, Clinton said: \u201cA man who could be provoked with a tweet should not have his finger anywhere near the button.\u201d</p> <p>Trump replied: \u201cThat line is getting a little bit old.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton came back: \u201cIt\u2019s a good one, though. Well describes the problem.\u201d</p> <p>Then, in the bottom of the final round, came the knockout punch over sexism and stamina. It was over. Despite the bad blood, the debate of the century ended as it began, with a handshake and Trump twice patting Clinton on the back. Later he told a TV interviewer that he had shown heroic self-restraint in not mentioning Bill Clinton\u2019s past infidelities out of respect for their daughter Chelsea. So yes, it could have been more childish still.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",
  "<p>Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo was in a terrible state, drunk. That, at least, is what his president thought, and exactly what Nuno wanted him to think. A young goalkeeper at Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es, he had been promised that if anyone came in with a $1m offer he could leave, and one day the Spanish club Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a did just that \u2013 only for Ant\u00f3nio Pimenta Machado to renege. \u201cI thought: \u2018It\u2019s done, perfect,\u2019\u201d Nuno says. \u201cBut I went in and he said: \u2018Now it\u2019s five [million].\u2019 I thought: \u2018This doesn\u2019t make sense.\u2019\u201d Denied the chance to leave, he considered giving up. Which was when they hatched a plan.</p> <p>Nuno\u2019s agent messed up his apartment and told Pimenta Machado that the player was in a bad way. \u201cIt was an act,\u201d Nuno recalls, pulling faces as he runs through his repertoire that day, 20 years ago, slumping back in his seat, mumbling and unresponsive. \u201cSo, the guy came to visit me, the president of Vit\u00f3ria, and my behaviour was \u2026 I was acting like I\u2019d come off the streets. And he said: \u2018Is he drunk?\u2019 When he left, the president said: \u2018Take him tomorrow.\u2019\u201d Nuno pauses then adds: \u201c\u2018Take him tomorrow \u2026 and don\u2019t let them do a test on him!\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/23/claudio-ranieri-danny-drinkwater-leicester-city\">Claudio Ranieri: Danny Drinkwater deal will keep him at Leicester</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The plan worked; the agent\u2019s name was Jorge Mendes. \u201cJorge knew exactly what time [Augusto C\u00e9sar] Lendoiro, the Depor president, left the club every evening,\u201d Nuno says. \u201cHe would leave the office, go downstairs and walk to a restaurant 100 metres away. And Jorge would be there, walking side-by-side. He would drive two-and-a-half hours there from Portugal for 100 metres \u2013 but he knew those 100 metres were golden. Then he would drive two-and-a-half hours back to tell me.\u201d Eventually Mendes got the $1m offer; what he didn\u2019t expect was to have to persuade Vit\u00f3ria\u2019s president twice.</p> <p>In the end, Nuno got the move to Spain. It was the first deal Mendes ever did. Nuno met him when Mendes ran a video shop and a disco; now he is the world\u2019s most powerful football agent. \u201cHe deserves it,\u201d Nuno says. \u201cPeople can\u2019t imagine the hours this guy works. [His reputation] is unfair; they don\u2019t know him.\u201d Mendes\u2019s most famous clients are Cristiano Ronaldo and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho; his first client is now the manager of Porto. On Tuesday night, he faces Leicester City in the Champions League.</p> <p>Nuno\u2019s journey began on the island of Sao Tom\u00e9, and has already taken in Portugal, Spain, Greece and Russia. Scotland, too: as a coach, that\u2019s where it all started. He is still only 42 and believes that one day it will end in England.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s to do with the global vision I have: we\u2019re so connected, [everything is] so fast now. Why not? The first thing I did everywhere was learn the language,\u201d he says, speaking English with a quiet, almost gentle authority. \u201cI think it also has to do with Portugal and with your family. My grandfather is African, my grandmother is from a small village in Portugal. He arrived on a boat \u2013 it was the first time they\u2019d seen a black man. Maybe it starts there; we lived near the Spanish border and my sister and I travelled a lot with our parents.\u201d</p> <p>Nuno crossed the border in January 1997 to play for Deportivo, before going to M\u00e9rida and Osasuna, Dynamo Moscow and Porto. If \u201cplaying\u201d is the right word, that is: at Deportivo he made four league appearances in five years. He went to Euro 2008 with Portugal, replacing Quim, but never won a cap. In his first spell at Porto, he won the Uefa Cup and the Champions League with Mourinho, but did so from the bench.</p> <p>That said, he did replace Vitor Ba\u00eda late in the Intercontinental Cup final and go on to win on penalties. And he scored a penalty in one game. It was Mourinho\u2019s idea. \u201cIt\u2019s strange \u2013 I didn\u2019t want it,\u201d he recalls. No? \u201cNo. I just put the ball down and kick it so hard. Put it down, three steps and bang! It could go there, there, there \u2026\u201d he says, pointing around the room.\u201d Instead, it went in. \u201cThe first thing I did when I scored was hug the other goalkeeper. \u2018I\u2019m sorry. For you this is a big humiliation, so I\u2019m sorry.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Besides, it all helped, even from there. Nuno watched, listened and learned, ideas forming. He took something from everyone. Emotional management from Mourinho, for example. \u201cMourinho really changed something,\u201d Nuno says. \u201cHe said: \u2018We\u2019re going to win\u2019 and we looked at him like: \u2018How can this guy be so sure?\u2019 It\u2019s colossal what he did at Porto. When you achieve something like that it is in your memory forever. What I take from him is that belief that he could create something and show us that we were going to succeed, [even] fighting against giants.\u201d</p> <p>The truism says that goalkeepers don\u2019t make good coaches, so what chance substitute goalkeepers? A good chance, he insists. \u201cYou see the game from the best place. All the analyses I do even now [as coach] are from a camera behind the goal. From the side, the perspective is different, you know the exact distances, but it\u2019s not real,\u201d he says, shifting his hands to signal a goalkeeper\u2019s perspective. \u201cBut this gives you a real view of the game as players see it. A player never experiences the game from the side.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt may not be better but it is my view. I know spaces, distances, and I can judge better the decision-making of the players. I know why this player did not pass to you \u2013 because there was an obstacle in front. From the side [you can think]: \u2018Why didn\u2019t you pass it \u2026?\u2019 but the lines are different,\u201d he says, laughing as he adds: \u201cI also saw a lot of games from the bench. I watched games, I listened to my coaches, and I talked to my team-mates. \u2018Hey, why is he taking off this guy?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>As a coach, he must know that his players are doing the same to him. \u201cYeah,\u201d Nuno smiles. \u201cOr the other way round: I can turn to them and say: \u2018Shut up, I know what I\u2019m doing, OK?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The decision to coach took him to Scotland at the age of 36. He took his coaching badges with the Scottish Football Association.</p> <p>\u201cThey did something I still use,\u201d he recalls. \u201cYou know how every meeting starts at the SFA? With a video. The best 50 goals from the 1980s: John Barnes, Ian Rush \u2026 and for three or four minutes afterwards everyone is quiet because you get hypnotised. And it was day after day: the best saves, the best one-on-ones, the best shots. I thought: \u2018This is brilliant.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI went to a meeting: \u2018Shhh, do you mind?\u2019 Normally a meeting starts and everyone is talking. This way, it was focused, quiet. And after the video \u2026\u201d Nuno clicks his fingers. \u201cYou start and everyone is listening. It\u2019s like opening a window. These guys knew what they were doing. I met so many good people: Jim Fleeting, Donald Park, so many people. They were a big influence on me.\u201d</p> <p>None more so than Ian Cathro, the young, dynamic Scottish coach who was Nuno\u2019s assistant at Rio Ave, where they were runners up in both Portuguese cups in 2013-14, and at Valencia \u2013 where they reached the Champions League places in 2014-15, before Nuno was sacked early in the following season, only for things to get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/30/gary-neville-leaves-valencia-immediate-effect\">far worse under his replacements, Gary Neville </a>and then Pako Ayestar\u00e1n.</p> <p>Nuno has called Cathro a \u201cgenius\u201d; now he is assistant to Rafa Ben\u00edtez at Newcastle. \u201cWe will be connected forever,\u201d Nuno says. \u201cWe built together. We were young, we started together, we did something nobody believed in. Now Rio Ave are in Europe. If I ever went to the Premier League he would be my first call, the first person I would tell. We have shared so much.\u201d</p> <p>And Nuno thinks that day will come, too. \u201c[England] is the league that I enjoy most. I love watching the Premier League. One day I am going to coach there, I am sure of it. I love it, I want to be there. If it takes longer, I don\u2019t know. If it takes less, maybe. But one day.\u201d As Nuno talks through his ideas, the influences are clear, the impact of British football. \u201cAs a kid, Liverpool was big for us [in Portugal],\u201d he says. \u201cI watched all the Wembley cup finals. [Neville] Southall with the big belly, the goalie: \u2018How can this guy stop \u2026 I can do that.\u2019 [Bruce] Grobbelaar, too.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81d82c1b9e341311aaf8a04a3edbe2d11360e9af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81d82c1b9e341311aaf8a04a3edbe2d11360e9af/0_0_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo during his time in charge at Valencia, with another former Porto coach, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, in the background during a Champions League game against Zenit St Petersburg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo during his time in charge at Valencia, with another former Porto coach, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, in the background during a Champions League game against Zenit St Petersburg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dmitry Lovetsky/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was also something a little \u201cBritish\u201d about that Valencia side, he agrees: quick, aggressive, pressing high, direct. \u201cAll coaches say: \u2018We want to control the game, we want the ball, blah, blah, blah, blah,\u2019 but it\u2019s impossible to have the ball all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cIf a team is organised it is really difficult to harm them, so you have to search for the moment they are unbalanced. And when is that? When you recover the ball.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a coach who likes to have the ball but what I really think is: \u2018How can you be in charge of the game?\u2019 I think, but maybe I am the only one, that the defensive process can take care of the game. Why is that? Because teams wait to defend. If you create something where you go to defend, to steal the ball where you want, it\u2019s different. A defensive process, yes, but you go for it.</p> <p>\u201cEnglish football is changing; it\u2019s not this long ball straight up the pitch. There are moments of possession, but the Premier League does allow you a box-to-box game and I enjoy that. Every possession has to have sense [a reason] and that sense has to be to unbalance the other team. English teams don\u2019t have long possession of the ball, but it\u2019s a curious fact: the Premier League has more ball in play than any other league. That tells you that your game has to be more intense, your players have to be more ready, there is more distance for the players to cover.\u201d</p> <p>The question is obvious: why have Spanish teams done so much better than English ones in Europe? \u201cDifficult,\u201d Nuno says. \u201cI was thinking about that the other day. In terms of the game, I don\u2019t find it [a reason], I really don\u2019t. I don\u2019t see, year by year, why English teams don\u2019t reach a final, with the resources they have. But [last season] you see [Manchester] City in a semi-final. Liverpool in a final. That tells you that it is not like that any more. Premier League teams are ready to [compete].\u201d</p> <p>Leicester City among them. Nuno knows them well; admires them, too. After he left Valencia last season, England became his main focus of analysis, not least because there was interest in him going there before he joined Porto, the club where he had been twice as a player. As he studied the English clubs, the application of sports science was one of the elements that most struck him. He spent time at Tottenham watching Mauricio Pochettino, while his assistant coach visited Manchester City and Leicester. \u201cYou go, you see, you share, you analyse: you see it and think: \u2018How can I adapt that? How can this fit my philosophy?\u2019\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cLeicester winning the league was a surprise to everyone but it proved that a united and strong team can achieve big things,\u201d Nuno says. Could it have happened in other leagues? \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think so: there are huge differences between the squads of big teams and the others and in long competitions that kind of achievement is very difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you can never say never.</p> <p>\u201cIt is going to be a big chance for us to face Leicester, a fantastic challenge, the opportunity to test our limits against the Premier League champions,\u201d he adds. Porto\u2019s limitations are clear, their chances slim. But, then, so were Leicester\u2019s. And, Nuno says: \u201cI have this absurd feeling that I can win every game with any team.\u201d</p>",

Our Skype conversation is interrupted by bursts of laughter as she talks at speed, emanating the restless energy that has enabled her to alternate between writing plays, film and TV scripts, with acting stints in between. <br></p> <p>Scorch, which <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/stage/stacey-gregg-s-play-scorch-wins-a-fringe-first-in-edinburgh-1.2769781\">won a Fringe First award at the Edinburgh festival</a> last month, was written in response to recent court cases in the UK. \u201cThese were cases taken by women who had been deceived into thinking they were having a sexual relationship with a man, but discovered that their partner was a woman or, in one case, a trans man. The accusations were of \u2018gender fraud\u2019, which for me is a contested term. I thought that the media coverage sensationalised these cases, and this drove me to try to communicate the questions they raised in a more complex way.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59826d91c4cabb8ec5f8be70c84a9253b75d7911\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59826d91c4cabb8ec5f8be70c84a9253b75d7911/0_133_5483_3289/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amy McAllister in Scorch at the Edinburgh festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy McAllister in Scorch at the Edinburgh festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Initially envisaging it as a TV script, Gregg reworked Scorch as a stage play, which she performed herself, before handing it over to the Northern Irish company Prime Cut. Directed by Emma Jordan, it was produced as part of the Outburst Queer Arts festival in Belfast last autumn. Poignantly performed by Amy McAllister, the solo piece captures the confusion of a teenage girl called Kes who wants to be a boy, and begins an online relationship with a young woman who assumes that Kes is male. The virtual world seems perfect to Kes, allowing her the freedom to present herself as she wants to be.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about the limitations of language, and of access to language. Kes doesn\u2019t have words for her feelings,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m interested in responses to the play, its interpretation as a trans piece, because that seems to ignore aspects of lesbian sexuality. It is as if butch lesbians have gone away \u2013 they haven\u2019t \u2013 and now we can only talk about this in terms of a medicalised idea of transition from one gender to another.\u201d</p> <p>Override examines what happens to relationships when people use technology to enhance or augment their bodies. It fizzes with ideas about <a href=\"http://www.biobasedworldnews.com/biohacking-everything-you-need-to-know-about-diy-biology\">biohacking</a>, prosthetic envy and robotics. Its central questions are philosophical, to do with human perfectibility and utopianism. \u201cAll of that, and how to be authentic,\u201d Gregg says, \u201cand the continuum we are on when we introduce wearable technology.

Gregg is one of seven female playwrights from around the world who have been commissioned to respond to the theme in the <a href=\"https://www.royalexchange.co.uk/whats-on-and-tickets/brth\">Birth</a> festival. The plays will subsequently tour. Her solo piece, Choice, interweaves two stories \u2013 one of a British woman who is trying to conceive by IVF and one of an Irish woman travelling to England for an abortion. The piece will be performed by Gregg herself. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to describe the form it\u2019s taking, but it is developed from workshops and research, and will be lo-fi. What\u2019s emerging from all of the writers is the global inequality relating to women\u2019s experience of birth.\u201d</p> <p>Gregg is the representative writer from the UK in this international programme. Moving between Dublin, Belfast and London, she enjoys what she calls her dual citizenship. \u201cDublin has been good to me. Rough Magic Theatre Company\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.roughmagic.ie/artist-development/seeds\">Seeds programme</a> was the start, and then the Abbey theatre gave me my first break, for which I\u2019m really grateful.\u201d Her first full-length play, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/jun/06/perve-review\">Perve</a> \u2013 a prescient work tackling the sexualisation of children and the pervasiveness of pornography \u2013 was produced by the Abbey in 2011, followed last year by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5GCUNZKnzE\">Shibboleth</a>, which took a chaotically satirical view of Belfast\u2019s peace walls.<br></p> <p>Having grown up in Belfast in the aftermath of the Troubles, Gregg left the city to study English at Cambridge, where she narrowly avoided being sent down and was acutely aware of her working-class roots. This was followed by an MA in documentary film-making in London. She is increasingly drawn to writing about Northern Ireland, with a number of her plays set there \u2013 Ismene, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/29/huzzies-review\">Huzzies</a>, Shibboleth \u2013 as well as two feature films in the pipeline. Her impulse is not only towards her native place, but also to her family background, captured in the class tensions of Huzzies, her comic play for Tinderbox Theatre in 2012 about a no-hoper Belfast rock band.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLDtP3a-zW8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BLDtP3a-zW8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Stacey Gregg on her play for Birth</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Currently developing a new play with the performance artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/mar/13/deborah-pearson-made-visible-yard-theatre\">Deborah Pearson</a> for <a href=\"http://www.cleanbreak.org.uk/\">Clean Break</a>, the theatre company that works with women in the criminal justice system, she says: \u201cI want to write about the working poor and women in prison in a way that is not voyeuristic, but empowering.\u201d Breaking new ground, experimenting with dramatic forms, Gregg is racing ahead, her antennae leading her towards performance art. \u201cI\u2019m more and more interested in live art, visual art \u2013 people like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/apr/21/kathy-acker-internet-erogenous-zone-emails-book\">Kathy Acker</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/jul/23/theatre1\">Gob Squad</a>, artists who combine philosophy and a kind of punk aesthetic, these attract me.

  "<p><a href=\"http://thurstonmoore.com/\">Thurston Moore</a> has had a soft spot for whistleblowers since he was growing up in a small town in Connecticut aged 12. That\u2019s an impressively young age, even for someone steeped in the radical business of rock music.<br></p> <p>Admittedly, the former <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/sonic-youth\">Sonic Youth</a> singer\u2019s fondness for whistleblowers was fairly literal. He explains the thought process like this: \u201cI liked the idea of a whistleblower. I still do like the idea of a whistleblower. There\u2019s something musically relevant to it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>That musical relevance of something as political as exposing corruption was laid down in Moore\u2019s preteen mind as the result of an extraordinary moment in television history dating 28 August 1970, a month after his 12th birthday. He\u2019d come home from school and, as was his wont, was watching The Merv Griffin Show on CBS when the program was suddenly disrupted by a crowd of musicians, most of them black, waving placards and blowing into wooden whistles.</p> <p>They were led by the saxophonist Rahsaan Roland Kirk, of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCKgm4Ctf_g\">Here Comes the Whistleman</a> fame. Shouting \u201cEquality for black artists!\u201d, they stormed the Merv Griffin stage in protest at the dearth of black musicians on shows like his, demanding to see more jazz performers on TV.</p> <p>It clearly made an impression on the young Thurston because today, almost half a century later, he still thinks of that formative TV-viewing experience whenever he reads about the latest official leaker to come a cropper at the hands of the US government. \u201cI think of that Roland Kirk invasion and of his song Here Comes the Whistleman whenever I hear the word \u2018whistleblower\u2019 \u2013 I think of it in a musical way.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNSMAuQieuc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VNSMAuQieuc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>History has now come full circle as Thurston Moore, singer-songwriter and guitarist as he was to become, has now lent the force of his music to support Chelsea Manning, the army private who dumped a vast collection of US state secrets on to the public in 2010. In a couple of weeks, Moore will release a special cassette version of his new single, Chelsea\u2019s Kiss, with part of the proceeds going to Manning\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.chelseamanning.org/\">support network</a> to help pay for her legal fees.</p> <p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/blank-editions/thurston-moore-chelseas-kiss/s-ppytr\">The song</a> is built around an instrumental track laid down last autumn by Moore together with the UK-based members of his group, Deb Googe of My Bloody Valentine on bass, guitarist James Sedwards and the Brooklyn drummer Ryan Sawyer. Cut at the studio used by Sonic Youth in Hoboken, New Jersey, it features a grainy guitar line that grows in intensity as the song builds.</p> <p>Moore says he was struck by the synergy between the rising mood of danger created by the lead guitar and the lyrics that had been written about Chelsea Manning by the poet <a href=\"http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2014/10/21/sonic-youths-thurston-moore-on-his-new-album-his-mom-and-the-whole-thing-about-being-experimental\">Radieux Radio</a>, with whom he has worked in the past. \u201cI thought the lyrics really fit the lead guitar that is in a way describing a lot of the possible psychosis that is going on with the situation, so I jammed them in and they really worked.\u201d</p> <p>Moore says he\u2019s been fascinated with the struggle faced by Chelsea Manning \u2013 the \u201cpunk princess\u201d, as the lyrics depict her \u2013 ever since the US soldier leaked hundreds of thousands of secret <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/25/afghanistan-war-logs-military-leaks\">war logs</a> and embassy cables to the open-information website WikiLeaks six years ago. \u201cI\u2019m always in admiration to people who step up in opposition to something they see as inherently criminal.\u201d</p> <p>He was also struck by how Manning, who was arrested in 2010 at a US military base outside Baghdad where she was working as an intelligence analyst, was charged with something as antiquated as the Espionage Act of 1917. \u201cMy understanding is that espionage is betrayal of your country for the benefit of the enemy. I see the history of whistleblowers, and Chelsea Manning in that lineage, as being people who want to protect their country.</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t the US a country built on the principle that the government is employed by the people, not the other way around?\u201d</p> <p>He felt moved to release the song after he learned in July that Manning had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/11/chelsea-manning-confirms-suicide-attempt-hospitalized\">tried to kill herself</a> in military prison, where she is serving a 35-year sentence, and then that she was being threatened with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/24/chelsea-manning-suicide-attempt-solitary-confinement-health-experts\">solitary confinement</a> for that attempted suicide because she had broken prison rules. \u201cI was really distraught learning that she had tried to take her own life \u2013 the reality of her imprisoned life in Fort Leavenworth seemed so frightening to me.\u201d</p> <p>His musical intervention for Chelsea Manning comes at an interesting time in the rock-whistleblower nexus. Moore recently called on Barack Obama to pardon the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden while Michael Stipe, whom Moore has known since REM had its first New York concert in the early 1980s, simultaneously but coincidentally also put out a <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/michael-stipe-posts-video-in-support-of-chelsea-manning-w439839\">video statement</a> in support of Manning.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-P5hCu59yTs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-P5hCu59yTs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Moore is quick to defend the right of artists to lend their influence to any political cause. \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly valid when you are a musician and you have the ability to share your thoughts, whether emotional or political. There are no restrictions on what an artist can express.\u201d</p> <p>Does that mean artists have a duty to engage politically? \u201cNo. Because I don\u2019t think all artists have an articulate political conscience. Having a duty? No. Your only duty is to share.\u201d</p> <p>He stresses that though it is important to him individually to be active, he does not see himself as a political singer. \u201cOver the years, Sonic Youth threw down some tracks that were that way, but it\u2019s never been the purpose of my singing. It isn\u2019t. But I do have complete admiration for artists who are demonstrably activists: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/05/yoko-ono-to-be-an-artist-you-need-courage\">Yoko Ono</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/ai-weiwei\">Ai Weiwei</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/billybragg\">Billy Bragg</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/27/allen-ginsberg-boxset-music-bob-dylan\">Allen Ginsberg</a> was a real inspiration for me.\u201d</p> <p>So does he think artists have done enough to make their views known on Donald Trump? Moore grows instantly animated. \u201cNo!\u201d he almost screams. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think they are doing enough! I think musicians should set up banks of speakers outside Trump Tower and blast him with a permanent litany of sonic noise. He needs to be flattened with it!\u201d</p> <p>For someone who has lived in London for the past 10 years, the Sonic Youth singer sounds very wrapped up in the affairs of the country he left behind. \u201cI am an American,\u201d he says. \u201cI have nothing but love for America.\u201d</p> <p>The only reason he is in London, he says, is \u201cmy love life and my professional life, as I have much more welcoming work in Europe than in the USA. It\u2019s love and rock\u2019n\u2019roll that keeps me over here.\u201d</p> <p>But he adds that should a certain real estate billionaire from New York grab the keys to the White House on 8 November, he might have to think again. \u201cIf for some bizarro reason Donald Trump gets voted into office, I\u2019m going to have to figure out what to do,\u201d he says. \u201cI could return to the US to fight in the streets, or I could stay in London, gather all the Americans I can find, and have a mass burning of US passports.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Chelsea\u2019s Kiss/Sad Saturday will be released on 8 October by Blank Editions.

  "<h2><strong>Donald Trump\u2019s claims</strong></h2> <h2><strong>Trump: \u201cOur jobs are fleeing the country, they\u2019re going to Mexico they\u2019re going to many other countries \u2026 Hundreds of hundreds of companies are doing this.\u201d</strong></h2> <p>Trump is primarily talking about the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the long-term decline in manufacturing around the US can\u2019t only be attributed to the trade deal. Economists still debate the effect of the deal on jobs, since US trade with Canada and Mexico is modest at best. In 2015, the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/06/22/483100251/fact-check-trumps-speech-on-clinton-annotated\">Congressional Research Service wrote</a>: \u201cNafta did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters.\u201d</p> <p>Manufacturing is down 37% <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP\">since its peak in 1979</a>, but this change has a great deal to do with the general shift toward a service-based economy, which the US has had surpluses in in recent years. It\u2019s true that many manufacturing jobs have been outsourced, especially since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, but it\u2019s also true that the US has added more than 800,000 factory jobs since 2010.</p> <h2><strong>Trump: \u201cMy father gave me a small loan in 1975.\u201d</strong></h2> <p>Trump never struggled for money or started with anything modest. In 1978 his father gave him a loan totaling almost $1m \u2013 about $3.7m today \u2013 and acted as guarantor for the young Trump\u2019s early projects. A 1981 <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/301761265/Report-on-Donald-Trump-to-Casino-Control-Commission\">report by a New Jersey regulator</a> also shows a $7.5m loan from the patriarch, and years later he <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/1991-04-09/news/25780577_1_casino-control-act-donald-trump-casino-owners\">bought $3.5m in gambling chips</a> to help his son pay off the debts of a failing casino, which was <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/1991-04-09/news/25780577_1_casino-control-act-donald-trump-casino-owners\">found to have broken the law by accepting them</a>.

Trump has a history of overstating his properties: he has, for instance, told the FEC that a New York golf club is worth $50m but also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/12/donald-trump-briarcliff-manor-golf-course-tax\">argued in court that it is worth only $1.4m</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Trump claimed that his tax plan will be the largest cuts since Ronald Reagan and create jobs, while in his words Clinton\u2019s would create a huge tax hike.</strong></h2> <p>Trump\u2019s tax plan would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">disproportionately help the wealthiest Americans</a>, saving them millions of dollars and adding trillions to the national debt, <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-donald-trump-tax-reform-plan-september-2016\">according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation</a>, a conservative thinktank. He would reduce the business tax rate to 15%, eliminate the estate tax (aka the \u201cdeath tax\u201d), which mostly affects wealthy inheritors, and would reduce revenue from taxes by about $5tn.

  "<p>In the garden of a terraced house in Oxford, on the hottest, sunniest day of the year, I meet Professor James R Flynn, an American-born academic who is a hero to many people. More than 30 years ago, he discovered a phenomenon that revolutionised the study of IQ and seemed finally to settle the argument over nature versus nurture. He showed that, across the world, average IQs had risen by roughly three percentage points every decade since at least 1930, and probably much longer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/23/james-flynn-iq-scores-environment\">James Flynn: IQ may go up as well as down</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since evolution doesn\u2019t work fast enough to produce genetic upgrading on that scale, it seemed that environment must be the dominant influence. According to Flynn, rising IQs went hand-in-hand with modernisation, which involves more years of education and more jobs that require analytic abilities and abstract thinking. The belief that better schooling, and positive discrimination in favour of disadvantaged children, could make a difference was seemingly vindicated.</p> <p>The view, put forward by a number of British and American academics at that time, that black people\u2019s IQs were genetically inferior to those of whites and Asians was finally discredited. So was the idea that African countries were poor because their inhabitants were stupid. IQs in developing countries also rise as they modernise and will eventually catch up those in developed countries. Best of all, rising IQs led to better moral reasoning, putting racism and sexism on the defensive.</p> <p>Nearly all psychologists now accept what they call \u201cthe Flynn effect\u201d, a remarkable accolade for a man who isn\u2019t even a specialist in psychology, his academic subject being political studies. This is not the only reason to admire \u201cJim\u201d, as family and friends call him. He is also an ardent democratic socialist who left an academic career in the US because he believed he was held back by his political views and his activity in the civil rights movement. He exiled himself to New Zealand in the 1960s, becoming a professor at the University of Otago in Dunedin. There, he helped found the Alliance party, and stood unsuccessfully for parliament against the local version of New Labour. He named his son, Victor, now an Oxford maths professor, after Eugene Victor Debs, five times presidential candidate for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/26/american-socialism-history-john-nichols\">Socialist Party of America</a>.</p> <p>This, I think, as we sit in Victor\u2019s garden, is like meeting Einstein or Freud, men who changed for ever the way we see the world. Flynn, now 82, speaks fluently and wittily in Irish-American cadences (his grandfather, a teacher, fled the 19th-century Great Hunger in Ireland). He runs twice a day \u201cthough not as fast as I did 10 years ago\u201d. He still teaches four-fifths of a timetable at Otago and writes nearly a book a year.</p> <p>We are here to talk about his latest book, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/does-your-family-make-you-smarter.html\">Does Your Family Make You Smarter?</a> Having explored IQ differences between generations, he has turned his attention to those within generations, which is a different matter. It is already evident to me, after reading the book, that the Flynn effect doesn\u2019t settle as much as some of us thought or hoped it did. And that by 21st-century standards, perhaps Flynn doesn\u2019t quite measure up as a liberal hero.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/feb/18/psychologist-robert-plomin-says-genes-crucial-education\">Psychologist on a mission to give every child a Learning Chip</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The answer to the question in the title, Flynn explains, is that your family environment\u2019s effect on your IQ almost disappears by the age of 17. An important exception is in the vocabulary component of IQ tests, where the effect persists into the mid-20s and can make a big difference, at least in the US, to the chances of getting into a top university. The home has most influence in early childhood but is swamped by later environments at school, university and work. And they will more closely match your genes because you will seek out (and be chosen for) environments that match your \u201cgenetic potential\u201d, whether it\u2019s basketball, carpentry or mathematics.</p> <p>So having taken genes out of the equation, Flynn has apparently put them back in. Nurture hasn\u2019t won after all. Over the years, a modernised environment will raise everyone\u2019s game. But within each generation, the gap between groups \u2013 classes, races, genders \u2013 can, at least theoretically, remain the same as they were. In practice, groups previously excluded from full access to education and professional careers will close the gap.</p> <p>Flynn emphasises that a rise in the potency of genes isn\u2019t matched by a corresponding decline in the potency of environment: \u201cThe potency of one is added to the potency of the other.\u201d Moreover, 20% of IQ differences are attributable to neither environment nor genes but to \u201cchance factors\u201d of which our ability to improve ourselves is the most important.</p> <p>\u201cYou can be at the 98th percentile [more intelligent than all but 2% of the population],\u201d he says. \u201cAt school, you kick teachers in the ankles, don\u2019t hand in your homework, get into fights and end up being suspended. You become a bricklayer in a humdrum environment and it costs you, say, 10 IQ points. Then you think: to hell with this, all these guys talk about is girls and football, I\u2019m going to university. Your IQ could rise from 120 to 130 and you\u2019ve leapfrogged four-fifths of the people ahead of you.\u201d</p> <p>We are talking averages, of course.

Except this isn\u2019t a joke. \u201cGo to the American suburbs one evening,\u201d says Flynn, \u201cand find three professors. The Chinese professor\u2019s kids immediately do their homework. The Jewish professor\u2019s kids have to be yelled at. The black professor says: \u2018Why don\u2019t we go out and shoot a few baskets?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>As I emit a liberal gasp, he continues: \u201cThe parenting is worse in black homes, even when you equate them for socio-economic status. In the late 1970s, an <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1986-24139-001\">experiment</a> took 46 black adoptees and gave half to black professional families and half to white professionals with all the mothers having 16 years of education. When their IQs were tested at eight-and-a-half, the white-raised kids were 13.5 IQ points ahead. The mothers were asked to do problem-solving with their children. Universally, the blacks were impatient, the whites encouraging. Immediate achievement is rewarded in black subculture but not long-term achievement where you have to forgo immediate gratification.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/19/america-schools-segregation-race-class-education-policy-bobby-scott\">America's schools are still segregated by race and class.

By 11, the two groups had identical average IQs. In Germany, there was no black subculture.\u201d</p> <p>Flynn refuses to speculate about the lingering effects of slavery and subsequent discrimination that have prevented African Americans from entering colleges and professional careers. Universities, he thinks, should do more research on racial differences and a new version of that 1970s study. \u201cI have shown \u2013 this wicked person who actually looks at the evidence \u2013 that <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/17/10/913.abstract\">blacks gained 5.5 IQ points on whites</a> between 1972 and 2002. There\u2019s been no changes in family structure [the incidence of single-parent families], no gains in income. I suspect it\u2019s an improvement in parenting. But I can\u2019t prove it.\u201d</p> <p>I leave that sunlit garden in a troubled frame of mind. Flynn has made a great contribution to human knowledge and understanding. But he hasn\u2019t settled the nature-against-nurture debate \u2013 and I wonder if he is now muddying the waters, constructing theories about parenting from flimsy evidence.</p>",

Here\u2019s a summary of what happened:</p> <ul> <li>Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump engaged in an occasionally raw series of clashes on topics from trade policy to the Iran deal to Trump\u2019s taxes.</li> <li>The Republican candidate came out swinging on Nafta and on, he said, his Democratic rival\u2019s failed record of public service. His most aggressive attacks had Clinton appealing to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/debate-fact-check-trump-clinton-live-quotes-hofstra\">fact checkers</a>\u201d instead of offering rebuttals.</li> <li>Clinton\u2019s performance was magisterial. She slipped easily into the details of many policy areas \u2013 cyber warfare, community policing, paid family leave \u2013 that Trump could not touch.</li> <li>Clinton also scored the biggest moment of wit, at the end of a long Trump boast about his temperament, which he delivered hotly. \u201cWhew, OK!\u201d she said when he was through, smiling.</li> <li>Clinton flayed Trump on his refusal to release his tax returns, on his \u201clong record\u201d of \u201cracist behavior,\u201d on his lack of knowledge about the deal to withdraw US troops from Iraq, on climate change being a Chinese \u201choax,\u201d and on and on. But his best line was: \u201cHillary\u2019s got experience but it\u2019s bad experience.\u201d</li> <li>Clinton\u2019s best line (apart from \u201cwhew, OK!\u201d): \u201cI think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And yes I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</li> <li>Clinton\u2019s runner-up best line, in reply to a Trump charge that \u201cwe don\u2019t have the money because it\u2019s been squandered on your ideas\u201d, was: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t paid your taxes!\u201d</li> <li>There were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/26/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-presidential-debate-live?page=with:block-57e9cf34e4b0a785ec48bcd8#liveblog-navigation\">lots of manterruptions</a>. Trump also had the sniffles.</li> <li>Trump lost altitude quickly after the first half hour, shifting from pointed interruptions to a more incoherent, sloppy pattern of interruption. </li> <li>Trump tried to deny five years of spreading birtherism \u2013 the conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was born outside the US. Clinton replied sharply: \u201cIt can\u2019t be dismissed that easily ... He has a long record in engaging in racist behavior.\u201d</li> <li>Trump cast doubt on the notion that the hacking of the Democratic National Committee was Russia-backed. He said it may have been China, or bizarrely, a \u201c400lb person sitting on their bed\u201d.</li> <li>Clinton said neighborhood security would come from community policing and getting guns off streets while Trump called for \u201claw and order\u201d and \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d.</li> <li>Clinton poked fun at Trump\u2019s unlimited indictment of her record. \u201cI have a feeling that by the end of this evening everything is going to be my fault,\u201d she said. Then Trump agreed with her.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ABCPolitics/status/780599581994209280\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton\">@HillaryClinton</a> after Trump&#39;s comment about her temperament: &quot;Whew!

To study dusting!\u201d says Will.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s what they teach,\u201d replies Karen.</p> <p>In the show, Karen had supposedly shot at Rosario, but that just became a comment about gun control.</p> <p>\u201cIf Crooked Hillary had her way, I wouldn\u2019t have that gun and I\u2019d have to use my cannon and Rosario would be dead,\u201d said Karen.</p> <p>When Will complains that Trump uses hateful language to talk about people, Karen turns to Grace.</p> <p>\u201cDid you hear what your pussy gay Muslim boyfriend just said?\u201d she asks.</p> <p>Will\u2019s friend Jack stars as the undecided voter who is considering not bothering to cast a ballot in November.</p> <p>\u201cBut does my vote even matter? How can one unemployed white fella registered in Pennsylvania make a difference?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>Grace attempts to appeal as Clinton being the first female president. But Jack isn\u2019t convinced, saying he hasn\u2019t heard \u201cthe one thing that will convince me to vote for one candidate over the other\u201d.</p> <p>But Will knows exactly what to stay to win over the urban gay Jack. \u201cKaty Perry likes Hillary,\u201d he says.</p> <p>At the end of the \u201cepisode\u201d, the words #votehoney appears.

The deal <a href=\"https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/statements/iaea-director-general%E2%80%99s-statement-iran\">gradually unfreezes assets</a> that belong to Iran but were frozen under sanctions related to the nation\u2019s nuclear program.

Treasury secretary Jack Lew has <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?327246-1/secretaries-kerry-moniz-lew-testimony-iran-nuclear-agreement\">put the number at $56bn</a>, and Iranian officials have said <a href=\"http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2016/01/19/446415/Iran-32bn-unfrozen-assets\">$32bn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/iran-claims-100-billion-now-freed-in-major-step-as-sanctions-roll-back/2016/02/01/edfc23ca-c8e5-11e5-a7b2-5a2f824b02c9_story.html\">$100bn</a>.

Economists still debate the effect of the deal on jobs, since US trade with Canada and Mexico is modest at best.

It\u2019s true that many manufacturing jobs have been outsourced, especially since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, but it\u2019s also true that the US has added more than 800,000 factory jobs since 2010.</p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cMy father gave me a small loan in 1975.\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump never struggled for money or started with anything modest.

Don\u2019t take my word for it (you probably wouldn\u2019t if I was reading this aloud) - this is based on a <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0051216\">study</a> into human voice pitch research conducted in 2012. The methodology couldn\u2019t be more relevant to this debate.</p> <p>In the study, 10 women and 10 men were recorded saying the phrase \u201cI urge you to vote for me this November\u201d - a sentence that\u2019s about elections and yet is politically neutral. The researchers then manipulated the sounds of the recordings to be lower or higher and played them to a bunch of men and women who were asked which hypothetical candidate they\u2019d vote for. They found that male and female leaders with lower-pitched voices (ie those that are more stereotypically masculine) were preferred by both men and women.</p> <p>Here\u2019s how the authors interpreted the results: \u201cThis bias could be a consequence of lower-pitched female voices being perceived as more competent, stronger, and more trustworthy \u2026 [and] in the case of men\u2019s voices, men with lower-pitched voices are larger, stronger, and more aggressive.\u201d</p> <p>The findings can be corroborated by any woman who has ever spoken in a meeting. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10dc7e1b5cd76e0ff01c4bd959ed0e6f3bb5510f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10dc7e1b5cd76e0ff01c4bd959ed0e6f3bb5510f/0_0_2629_1578/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reaction to female and male candidates compared\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reaction to female and male candidates compared</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Report</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e9be72e4b0a785ec48bc8e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T00:35:19.010Z\">1.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We\u2019ve asked for your favorite music to fact-check to.

Such a voter may not react to the same thing the crowd reacts to, the campaigns react to or, needless to say, the media reacts to. Watch and judge for yourself, America ... and the world.</p> <p>They\u2019re going to start soon. Both candidates arrive onstage as practiced debaters, though Trump does not have any experience facing just one other person. He participated in a dozen primary-season debates this cycle, while Clinton participated in nine \u2026 plus the two dozen she showed up for in 2008.</p> <p>Thank you for reading, and please join us in the comments!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/scottbix/status/780564439514963969\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Brb getting Oreos.</p>&mdash; Scott Bixby (@scottbix) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scottbix/status/780564439514963969\">September 27, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T00:31:12.742Z\">at 1.31am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e9ba98e4b0593b3cb15008\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T00:19:31.238Z\">1.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s Clinton aide Philippe Reines \u2013 best-known among journalists as the state department spokesman who <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/03/how-philippe-reines-handles-the-press-203496\">told a reporter to fuck off</a> \u2013 playing Trump in a debate prep session:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/brianefallon/status/780558043457196033\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There are multiple Trumps.

It\u2019s also because polls, which have come to be the manna of political analysts, now offer less help in making sense of it all.</p> <p>In past elections, the polls had settled down by Labor Day. This year, they continue to point all over the place. On Sunday, a survey by the <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/news/2016/09/25/yougoveconomist-poll-september-22-24-2016/\">Economist and YouGov</a> found that Hillary Clinton had a lead of 4%. Less than 24 hours later, a poll from the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/\">LA Times and USC Tracking</a> put Donald Trump 4% ahead.</p> <p>Both pollsters are considered credible, which makes this even more confusing.</p> <p>This series is intended to help you make sense of the ceaseless onslaught of numbers by taking a closer look at just one poll. But to start us off, I want to talk about a crucial tool in polling analysis: the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">average</a>.</p> <p>The site <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">Real Clear Politics</a> (RCP) takes the average of all recent credible polls to create a moving average. Right now, RCP has Clinton with 45.9% of the vote while Trump has 43.8%, meaning that the Democratic nominee is ahead by 2.1%.</p> <p>Notice how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a> aren\u2019t singing from the rooftops or gloating on Twitter? It\u2019s because 2.1% means nothing.</p> <p>It\u2019s so small, it could be down to errors in the ways that polls are conducted. It\u2019s so narrow, it could easily be reversed by individuals who change their mind or who are not honestly disclosing how they plan to vote. <br></p> <p>The takeaway? Going into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/25/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-debate-gennifer-flowers\">tonight\u2019s debate</a>, the two candidates are neck and neck.</p> <p>But how much do debates matter? As my former colleague Lauren Leatherby has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/hillary-clinton-polls-convention-trump-election-data\">pointed out</a>, they have hurt candidates in the polls (see Barack Obama in 2012 and George Bush in 2004). But ultimately those candidates have been able to recover by election day (see, uh, the same candidates).</p> <p>So even if tonight produces a clear loser, the November vote is not a done deal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/skeptical-polling-clinton-trump-before-first-debate\">How are Clinton and Trump polling before the first debate?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e949f3e4b0a785ec48ba9f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-26T17:00:24.328Z\">6.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Monmouth poll: Clinton has 4-point lead over Trump</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Eight hours before going toe-to-toe at the first presidential debate of the general election campaign, Hillary Clinton has a four-point lead over Donald Trump among likely voters nationwide, according to a just-released Monmouth University poll.

Libertarian party nominee Gary Johnson is polling at 8% in the survey and Green nominee Jill Stein is at 2%. Among all registered voters, and not just those most likely to vote in the upcoming election, Clinton leads with 45%, while Trump falls slightly further behind with 40% Trump.</p> <p>Among her compatriots in the Democratic party, Clinton has the support of 91% of party members, while Trump has won 85% of Republicans. This is an improvement for Trump, who previously counted only one-in-four Republican voters in his corner. Monmouth\u2019s polling suggests that independents are cutting right, supporting Trump over Clinton by 39% to 33%, a precipitous drop for the former secretary of state, who held a five-point lead among independent voters in late August.</p> <p>The generation gaps are in keeping with previous polling. Clinton leads among millennial voters under the age of 35 by 48% to Trump\u2019s 28%, while voters 35 to 54 support Trump at and Clinton at 41%. For voters older than 55, support is similarly divided, with 47% supporting Clinton and 46% supporting Trump.</p> <p>\u201cClinton\u2019s support has softened since the summer, but she has still managed to grab a share of those who tend to vote Republican,\u201d Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement.</p> <p>The historically unpopular major-party candidates are still viewed negatively by large majorities of the electorate. According to the survey, 36% of voters view Clinton positively, while 54% view her negatively.

Instead of one signature issue, Clinton has dozens of detailed policies on a host of subjects. It may make her a great president one day, but for now voters struggle to understand what slogans such as \u201cstronger together\u201d mean in practice. If Clinton were forced to pick one concrete thing for viewers to remember her for, what would it be?</p> <p><strong>Do you believe in globalisation?<br></strong>Over many years in public life, the former secretary of state has understandably embraced an evolving set of economic positions. But few have come further than Clinton on the subject of free trade deals and the damage they may or may not have done to American manufacturing. She says she opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership now proposed by Obama, but is it a principled opposition or a mere pragmatic response to Trump? Are there limits to the benefits of globalisation for US workers?</p> <p><strong>How would your counter-terrorism policy differ from Obama\u2019s?<br></strong>In the face of continued terrorist attacks, the issue of \u201cdefending America\u201d will be top of Monday\u2019s agenda. Yet Clinton risks being caught between defending the legacy of an Obama administration in which she served and acknowledging that not everything is working out well right now. How would she defeat Islamic State? Would she be more or less hawkish in Iraq and Afghanistan? If nothing changes, then Trump may be able to pin her to a range of foreign policy failures.</p> <p><strong>Why are you so secretive?<br></strong>From <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/03/hillary-clinton-email-server-potential-vice-presidents-defend-brown-booker-becerra-perez\">emails</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/hillary-clinton-returns-campaign-pneumonia\">pneumonia</a>, Clinton has repeatedly got herself into trouble by going out of her way to hide information from the public. The obvious question is: what does she have to hide? The usual explanation is that Clinton has been on the receiving end of so many smears over the years that she has learned to be cautious, but this should also teach her to be wary of cover-ups. Why should someone who ignores medical advice to rest, or legal advice to keep email on government servers, be trusted to take wise decisions in office?</p> <p><strong>How would you reduce income inequality?<br></strong>Supporters would argue that Clinton has provided many answers to this question: from infrastructure spending and a jobs program to minimum wage increases and taxing the rich. Yet many still wonder if a campaign so heavily funded by America\u2019s rich and powerful really understands or is committed to helping its middle class. Her answers may be more nuanced than Trump\u2019s crude protectionism, but they need to cut through with voters if she is to blunt his appeal in the rust belt.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/24/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-debate-awkward-questions\">10 awkward debate questions to put Clinton and Trump on the spot</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e94652e4b0593b3cb14e31\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-26T16:15:54.036Z\">5.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">What are the third-party candidates up to?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0616c809fe36cc82f4de448b19fda2454c10a9e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0616c809fe36cc82f4de448b19fda2454c10a9e4/0_0_3957_2727/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jill Stein\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jill Stein</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Derek Henkle/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will be the only two candidates to participate in tonight\u2019s presidential debate at Hofstra University on Long Island - polling limitations have limited the field to just the two major-party candidates, as has happened in every presidential debate since 1992 - but that doesn\u2019t mean that the other would-be presidents have given up on participating in some capacity.</p> <p>Former New Mexico governor and Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson will watch tonight\u2019s debate from New York City with his running mate, Bill Weld, and will be livetweeting the proceedings from Twitter\u2019s offices in Chelsea.</p> <p>Green party nominee Jill Stein, meanwhile, plans to \u201cliterally insert herself\u201d into the debate tonight, responding to each of the debate questions via Periscope livestream.

He has made a number of erratic comments appearing to suggest a cavalier approach to nuclear proliferation; he has also threatened to undermine both Nato and a longstanding commitment to non-nuclear allies in Asia. Combining all this with a general belligerence that terrifies even generals, Trump has much to do to reassure voters he is not a dangerous loose cannon.</p> <p><strong>Did you support US intervention in Iraq and Libya?<br></strong>Trump has tried to have his cake and eat it on the subject of Middle East policy, attacking Clinton for backing regime change in Iraq and Libya while implying he was opposed to both wars at the time. But though this real estate investor\u2019s foreign policy views were not then widely sought out, there is a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/02/25/timeline-of-trumps-comments-on-iraq-invasion-not-loud-not-strong-and-no-headlines/?postshare=7121471286662065&amp;tid=ss_tw\">plenty of evidence</a> to suggest he kept any opposition very quiet. Asked if he backed the invasion of Iraq, he said: \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Why would Mexico pay for you to build a wall?<br></strong>The flagship policy of building a physical wall on the southern border is frequently embellished with a boast that Trump would make sure Mexico paid for its construction. A recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration\">meeting with the Mexican president</a>, however, made clear that this is highly unlikely. Trump appeared to mislead supporters almost immediately afterward and continues to ignore evidence that Mexican net migration into the US has dropped to near zero in recent years. The mechanics of his deportation policy are even vaguer.</p> <p><strong>Is there anyone you regret offending?<br></strong>An open question that could lead Trump into uncharted territory. For over a year, the Republican nominee has outraged Muslims, African Americans, women, Latinos and disabled people with a series of ever-more outrageous comments. Any attempt to hold him to account for offensive language was dismissed as mere political correctness. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/07/humayun-khan-donald-trump-military-arlington-national-cemetery\">Attacking the family of a Muslim war hero</a> after the Democratic convention finally seemed to damage Trump in the polls, though, and prompted a half-apology. Who else will he say sorry to?</p> <p><strong>What evidence do you have against climate change?<br></strong>Like many Republicans, Trump has repeatedly suggested that action to prevent man-made climate change is unnecessary because he does not \u201cbelieve\u201d it is real. He is even <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/21/politics/scientists-open-letter-trump-climate-change/\">threatening to pull the US out of the Paris climate accord</a>. Yet in the face of overwhelming evidence from world scientists, surely the onus is now on skeptics to prove their claims with facts and numbers of their own.

Indeed, plenty of people continue to agitate behind the scenes for an institution rooted not only in history, anthropology and archaeology but in living culture, which would fill the present yawning void.</p> <p>Museology, especially in the Indigenous space, is on the edge of a significant global reformation. The Smithsonian is in some ways at the vanguard.</p> <p>Increasingly, museums that supposedly serve as portals into Indigenous worlds must re-evaluate whether their primary purposes rest in collecting or repatriating, keeping or returning. These vexing questions are challenging some of the world\u2019s oldest collecting institutions with significant Aboriginal holdings, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/25/the-gweagal-shield-and-the-fight-to-change-the-british-museums-attitude-to-seized-artefacts\">British Museum, which has some 6,000 Indigenous Australian pieces</a> in its collection. </p> <p>The British Museum is under increasing pressure, not least from Australian Indigenous peoples, to permanently return items in its collection, many of which were acquired under circumstances that were at best ambiguous or at worst extremely violent, as frontier conflict raged across the Australian continent in line with dispossession and pastoral settlement, after invasion in 1788.</p> <p>In Canberra earlier this year Richard West, chief executive of the Autry Museum of the American West and founding director of the Smithsonian American Indian museum, said that in the past decade both museums had returned tens of thousands of objects to contemporary native communities in the US and other parts of the Americas.</p> <p>\u201cIn the early days I would occasionally receive a letter decrying my purported decimation, as the director of the NMAI, of the native collection over which I presided,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2016/mar/22/indigenous-treasures-briefly-on-loan-to-australia-are-about-to-be-taken-away-again\">he said</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My response was simple, and it ran along these lines. First I am required to abide by federal laws with which, by the way, I happen to agree. Second the NMAI\u2019s collections originally consisted of almost 1,000,000 objects, and we have to date repatriated 30,000 of them which leaves us with 970,000 \u2013 I think we will be able to remain in business as a museum. In addition, as direct collateral of repatriation, both the NMAI and the Autry learned much more about their native collections.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile John Carty, the new head of anthropology at the traditionally conservative South Australian Museum, says he is determined to \u201copen the museum\u2019s custodianship\u201d of the collection and to start new discussions about best-practice models of curating Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artefacts.</p> <p>\u201cThere are many questions, many discussions, to be had about how and why museums must really only hold these things in trust for their owners \u2013 there are big discussions about how some materials should be reconnected with their people and country of provenance, loaned to them or, indeed, even returned,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2016/sep/03/an-indigenous-curator-for-indigenous-artefacts-south-australia-breaks-new-ground\">he said</a>. </p> <p>So, precisely what functions should any new institution dedicated to celebrating and showcasing Indigenous Australian history and culture serve?</p> <p>Canberra already has the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) \u2013 a celebrated research and collecting institution with an extraordinarily rich collection of archives, material and oral history, and much else besides. (It is, unfortunately, not physically capable of mounting large public exhibitions.)</p> <p>The National Museum of Australia also has a significant holding of Indigenous material. So, too, does the National Gallery of Australia (the only national institution in Canberra with a monument dedicated to the many tens of thousands of Indigenous Australians who died in frontier conflict).</p> <p>Significantly, the national museum is also the repository of remains belonging to hundreds of Indigenous Australians whose bodies were stolen \u2013 after murder in frontier conflict, from institutions or from their graves \u2013 and amassed in collections throughout the world.</p> <p>Museums in every Australian state have holdings of Indigenous human remains that cannot \u2013 for a variety of reasons \u2013 be returned to country.</p> <p>There is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2015/oct/13/keeping-place-for-stolen-indigenous-remains-should-take-priority-over-anzac-centre\">pressing need for a \u201ckeeping place\u201d</a> for these remains. The national capital would be the ideal place for it. Why not, then, combine such a keeping place with a memorial to those Indigenous people killed in the frontier war \u2013 and a museum/educational institution dedicated to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, culture and history? </p> <p>Such an institution could serve as a repository for Indigenous items returned from overseas museums such as the British Museum (which invariably cite as an impediment to repatriation the unavailability of suitable permanent keeping places for precious items in Indigenous communities). It could be a hub for repatriated items that could be returned temporarily to country or loaned to other smaller regional museums and galleries.</p> <p>The primary aim of the collection function of the museum could be reconnecting \u2013 physically, spiritually and in a literal sense of ownership \u2013 communities with long lost, significant cultural items.</p> <p>If mutually agreeable conditions could be met, such items could be returned to country or be hubbed in and out of Canberra to communities, nearby galleries and museums, as part of the conditionality of repatriation. But they would belong once again to communities to which they\u2019d be taken on visitation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2015/oct/13/keeping-place-for-stolen-indigenous-remains-should-take-priority-over-anzac-centre\">Keeping place for stolen Indigenous remains should take priority over Anzac centre</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Think, then, of a kind of reverse museum \u2013 one that exists not to appropriate and amass the cultural property of Indigenous people, but rather to repatriate them, to effectively turn collections back over to country.</p> <p>Successive federal governments have stalled on the need for a keeping place. Tony Abbott, self-declared prime minister for Indigenous affairs, sat on a report recommending the immediate establishment of a keeping place.</p> <p>The Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments, cognisant of the need, never moved on it.</p> <p>Rudd, of course, was the PM who apologised (in tightly legal terms so as to avoid reparations) to the stolen generations. But he never moved adequately on acknowledging the evils frontier war and the many other malevolent elements of Australian history that stemmed from invasion, violent dispossession and assimilation.</p> <p>There is a pressing need for a cutting edge museum/keeping place for the Indigenous Australian.</p> <p>But best we keep it out of the hands of the politicians.</p>",

As I was making numerous calls that day, this gave me less reassurance than I sought. Yet I was, and remain, very struck by the response. This was clearly someone who, for much of the day, answered the phone to students wanting to know the time of a lecture or to ask for an essay extension, or to a friendly local trader following up an invoice. It was not a voice expecting, say, an offer of an exciting new opportunity, not that this was what was on my mind either. The mix of local civic pride and narrow horizons left a deep impression on me.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2016/sep/22/oxford-university-vice-chancellor-research-funding-brexit-audio\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/546aq\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2740607\"            data-video-name=\"Oxford vice chancellor worried about post-Brexit funding \u2013\u00a0audio\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC Radio 4/TODAY \"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e3afe0e4b011f2eb7120d9\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/22/160922radio4richardson_KP-29359875_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/22/160922radio4richardson_KP-29359875.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/22/160922radio4richardson_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2016/sep/22/oxford-university-vice-chancellor-research-funding-brexit-audio\">Oxford vice-chancellor worried about post-Brexit funding \u2013 audio</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>And it is an impression that has returned in post-referendum, immigration-control Britain. Having done so much to build up the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/22/oxford-becomes-first-uk-university-to-top-global-rankings\">international standing of the UK\u2019s universities</a>, are we on a tipping point to proud insularity yet inevitable decline? Take, for example, the government\u2019s intention to <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/23/theresa-may-plans-new-immigration-crackdown-on-student-visas/\">reduce the number of visas</a> for overseas students. This, alone, is virtually guaranteed to lead to a fall in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/19/universities-fear-uk-global-reputation-in-jeopardy-brexit\">UK\u2019s standing</a> in at least those of the international league tables for which the proportion of international students is one of the factors taken into account.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/25/brexit-may-force-15-of-staff-at-uk-universities-to-leave-warns-group\">Brexit fears may see 15% of UK university staff leave, group warns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rankings, though, matter much less than reality. Consider <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/25/britain-universities-depend-openness-dont-let-brexit-destroy-it\">staff recruitment</a>. Whether or not there are formal restrictions, the changing atmosphere will not be good for attracting the international staff that characterise highly successful departments. Universities often talk about bringing in the \u201cworld\u2019s best\u201d but that can\u2019t really be the aim. After all, there are not enough of the very best to go round. What we need is to bring in staff who are both excellent and rather different from what we already have, to refresh the gene pool and protect against complacency. At the moment we reap the benefit of having one of the most open academic job markets in the world.</p> <p>Internationalisation of UK universities over the past few decades has been staggering, especially at postgraduate student level. To give a sense of the proportions, in <a href=\"https://www.hesa.ac.uk/data-and-analysis/publications/students-2014-15/introduction\">2014-15</a>, 71% of full-time master\u2019s level students and more than half of PhD students came from overseas. This now makes it impossible to sustain our present university system on the basis of demand from home students alone. Falling demand will mean course closures, and perhaps even the closure of universities, most likely in those parts of the country that can least afford it, where the university is a major employer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/02/academics-brexit-research-peat-fears-eu-funds\">Academics feel blight of Brexit \u2013 from cancer research to peat projects</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And if the overseas students cannot come to the UK, where will they go? Well, as they tell you at business school, today\u2019s customer is tomorrow\u2019s competition. Universities around the world, especially in the EU, have significant numbers of staff who were educated in the UK, and are fully capable of providing an innovative curriculum in English. In time UK universities would have felt this pressure in any case, but government policy promises our competitors a rosy future.</p> <p>The apparent silver lining, I suppose, is that slackening of demand will make it easier for the rising generation of UK students to get the place of their choice. The cloud, though, is that when they get there, they will find even the best universities to be less interesting, diverse and dynamic places than they may have been expecting.</p>",

Refuse to let people do their jobs, then punish them for it<br></strong>For example, hire someone to be your legislative director, then forbid them from calling certain legislators\u2019 offices directly, and then give them low marks on their evaluation for not developing those relationships.</p> <p><strong>7. Don\u2019t learn new skills or improve existing ones</strong> <br>You\u2019re the supervisor, why should you learn stuff when you have people to do stuff for you. Fail to learn even the most elementary technology like email attachments; make your younger staff do that in addition to their work.</p> <p><strong>8. Treat people as if they\u2019re idiots<br></strong>Manage your employees with 10+ years\u2019 experience with the same scrutiny you would apply to your interns. And then tell them that the interns are much more open to feedback.</p> <p><strong>9. </strong><strong>Never communicate about anything unless it\u2019s trivial</strong> <br>Focus your communication on small, insignificant things. Don\u2019t tell anyone about challenges such as delays in payroll, changes in the budget, elimination of departments, or an awesome new consultant you just hired.</p> <p><strong>10. Be inconsistent and unpredictable<br></strong>Keep people on their toes by being totally inconsistent in terms of communication (both style and content), expectations, feedback, and long-term vision for the organisation. Everyone loves a good game of workplace Russian roulette. Also, change the expectations every time you meet with your employees. Berate them for not meeting the new expectations you just told them about and for wasting all their time trying to meet the expectations you set last month. Then constantly ask your employees to validate you.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fdfc81b4ba01ec1c85807b8f0c3cbb14dce54d3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fdfc81b4ba01ec1c85807b8f0c3cbb14dce54d3b/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Spacey\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Number 16.

Build a sense of importance by talking about how busy you are all the time<br></strong>I had a supervisor constantly telling me how she worked late and on weekends. As if they are busier and thus work harder than everybody else. Often the same people who talk excessively at work. Remember, talking about being busy is just as good as actually accomplishing things.</p> <p><strong>12. Evaluate your employees on goals they have never seen before</strong> <strong>during a performance review<br></strong>Bonus points if some of those goals are actually impossible to achieve.</p> <p><strong>13. Belittle your team over things both significant and insignificant</strong><br> When a soft draft deadline is missed, raise it at a staff meeting by throwing your hands up and shouting about how everyone\u2019s incompetence will ensure the closure of the organisation. Keep telling everyone in staff forums how the whole organisation and its success is based on what you downloaded from your head 15 years previously. Keep saying loudly how you\u2019re the only one with any ideas and it\u2019s clear that no one else can think.</p> <p><strong>14. Don\u2019t set clear priorities<br></strong>Always imply that the latest idea is top priority but don\u2019t ever reschedule existing deadlines. Base your priorities on whoever spoke to you most recently, or whatever your horoscope is for the day.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/feb/02/cv-mistakes-how-to-apply-for-a-job-in-global-development\">CV mistakes: how to lose a job in development before you press send</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>15.

It\u2019ll remind your team that you have a great sense of humour.</p> <p><strong>16. Active-aggressively remind people of the power you hold over them<br></strong>First staff meeting (first day of supervisor\u2019s new job): \u201cI know you people have won all sorts of awards for being the best in the business, but I want you to know I have no problems firing anyone who is not doing their job.\u201d</p> <p><strong>17. Cross personal boundaries<br></strong>For example: take a member of staff out for a drink and get horribly and embarrassingly drunk. Have a great time being very friendly and joking around though so they form the impression that you have bonded. Then, when they return to work on the following Monday you should act as if you had never gone out together or interacted as friends.</p> <p><strong>18. Physically invade people\u2019s spaces<br></strong>Hug all your employees every day, and get really close to them when talking. If they have told you they don\u2019t want to hug their boss at work, hug them anyway. If you\u2019re standing up talking to them and they take a step backward to get some personal space, take a step forward.</p> <p><strong>19. Delegate autonomy, but don\u2019t really mean it<br></strong>For example: \u201cI want you to make the decision. I don\u2019t want to be involved. You\u2019re experienced and you are driving this project.\u201d [Later:] \u201cYou made the wrong decision. Here\u2019s what I really wanted you to do. Now go and change everything.\u201d</p> <p><strong>20. Play favourites with team members, and make it obvious<br></strong>For example: give Christmas gifts to your favourite employees.

Criticise people in front of their coworkers<br></strong>Don\u2019t pull them aside and give feedback. Public humiliation means everyone gets to learn. When applicable, use reply-all to unleash your fury on a team member.</p> <p><strong>22. Send subtle messages to your employees that this is not a good fit for them<br></strong>For example: leave job posting announcements on desks of employees with notes saying, \u201cYou should look into this.\u201d</p> <p><strong>23. Don\u2019t learn anything about your employees\u2019 leadership and working styles<br></strong>Why would you assume that people have diversity of perspectives and ways of working. You\u2019re the boss. Make sure people adapt to working with you, not vice versa.</p> <p><strong>24. Become defensive at the slightest constructive feedback<br></strong>Ask for feedback in meetings and then bully and belittle everyone who opens their mouth. Then when people don\u2019t contribute to meetings, act passive aggressive about it saying something like: \u201cI guess no one has anything to add and we\u2019ll just have to go with my plan.\u201d Solicit feedback on said plan in emails and other meetings until someone finally says something rash and then give them a written warning for insubordination.</p> <p><strong>25. Multi-task while interacting with others<br></strong>For example, you can get a lot more done if you don\u2019t pay attention to people during meetings. As an executive director it\u2019s totally fine to browse your smart phone during every staff meeting, type on your phone during staff presentations/discussions of issues, and answer personal phone calls.</p> <p><strong>26. Take credit for your employee\u2019s ideas and work<br></strong>Ask others for ideas on a project, then pitch those ideas as your own, then make others carry out the grunt work of their project idea while getting all the credit for having \u201cthought\u201d of it.</p> <p><strong>27. Be completely insensitive regarding pay differential<br></strong>Tell staff about your raise and bonus when they are receiving little or none.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/apr/29/eleven-rules-to-live-by-if-you-want-to-make-it-to-the-top-at-the-un\">Eleven rules to live by if you want to make it to the top at the UN</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>28.

After employees hand in reports to you, hide them and accuse others of trying to steal company secrets. Forbid the entire office from speaking to certain employees because you \u201cdon\u2019t want them to be distracted\u201d. And, very importantly: don\u2019t tell the employee that no one is allowed to speak with them and wait for them to go crazy from the paranoia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1207c94933493b45369257c48228abead9bb094a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1207c94933493b45369257c48228abead9bb094a/0_0_2240_1344/1000.jpg\" alt=\"26.

Fox <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/12/theresa-may-declines-to-endorse-liam-fox-attack-on-fat-and-lazy-uk-firms\">was told off for saying British firms were too \u201cfat and lazy\u201d</a> to be any good at exporting.</p> <p>So it was really only a matter of time for Boris. In an interview in New York, he told Sky News that Britain would trigger article 50 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/22/boris-johnson-uk-aiming-start-eu-brexit-talks-early-2017\">begin the formal two-year process of leaving the EU \u201cby the early part of next year\u201d</a>. </p> <p>No 10 declined to back him, saying pointedly that the government\u2019s position \u201chas not changed\u201d: in other words, article 50 won\u2019t be triggered before the end of 2016, and beyond that we\u2019re saying nothing. </p> <p>The incident prompted the satirical website the Daily Mash to report <a href=\"http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/politics/politics-headlines/theresa-may-appoints-minister-for-contradicting-brexit-ministers-20160923114288\">that May had now appointed a minister \u201cspecifically charged with denying all statements by the ministers in charge of Brexit\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Johnson also said Brexit, which he reckoned could take less than two years, would allow Britain \u201cto benefit from fantastic opportunities for greater free trade with our friends in the EU\u201d (he did not say how) and repeated his view that Britain could have its cake and eat it: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They\u2019d have us believe there\u2019s some automatic trade-off between what they call access to the single market and free movement. Complete baloney ... Nothing to do with each other. </p> </blockquote> <p>That prompted another slap-down \u2013 though not from May.

  "<p>China is the world\u2019s deadliest country for outdoor air pollution, according to analysis by the World Health Organisation (WHO).</p> <p>The UN agency has previously warned that tiny particulates from cars, power plants and other sources <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/25/air-pollution-kills-7m-people-a-year\">are killing 3 million people worldwide each year</a>.</p> <p>For the first time the WHO has broken down that figure to a country-by-country level. It reveals that of the worst three nations, more than 1 million people died from dirty air in China in 2012, at least 600,000 in India and more than 140,000 in Russia.<br></p> <p>At 25th out of 184 countries with data, the UK ranks worse than France, with 16,355 deaths in 2012 versus 10,954, but not as poorly as Germany at 26,160, which has more industry and 16 million more people. Australia had 94 deaths and 38,043 died in the US that year from particulate pollution.<br></p> <p>Maria Neria, director of the WHO\u2019s public health and the environment department, told the Guardian: \u201cCountries are confronted with the reality of better data. Now we have the figures of how many citizens are dying from air pollution. What we are learning is, this is very bad. Now there are no excuses for not taking action.\u201d</p> <p>Gavin Shaddick, who led the international team that put together the data, said: \u201cGlobally, air pollution presents a major risk to public health and a substantial number of lives could be saved if levels of air pollution were reduced.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1AoFGZhUCkh2lmJ2IDunnxTV-TQvmWSlfYQxbMJ-OJQA\" data-alt=\"Deaths attributable to ambient air pollution\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1AoFGZhUCkh2lmJ2IDunnxTV-TQvmWSlfYQxbMJ-OJQA\">Deaths attributable to ambient air pollution</a> </figure>  <p>Sixteen scientists from eight international institutions worked with WHO on the analysis, which gathered data from 3,000 locations, using pollution monitors on the ground, modelling and satellite readings. </p> <p>They looked at exposure to tiny particulates 2.5 microns in size, known as PM2.5s, which penetrate the lungs and are the air pollutant most strongly associated with an increased risk of death. \u201cThe real driver of ill health is ultra-fine particles, 2.5s \u2013 they have the ability to permeate the membrane of the lungs and enter our blood system,\u201d said Shaddick, who is based at the University of Bath. \u201cIncreasingly there is an understanding that there are not just respiratory diseases but cardiovascular ones associated with PM2.5s.\u201d</p> <p>In the UK more than 90% of the population lives in areas with levels of PM2.5s above the WHO\u2019s air-quality limits of 10 micrograms per cubic metre for the annual mean. The government is in the high court on 18 and 19 October facing a legal challenge by environmental law group ClientEarth, which says ministers\u2019 clean-up plans for another pollutant \u2013 nitrogen dioxide \u2013 are inadequate.</p> <p>Globally, 92% of the population breathes air that breaches WHO limits but the world map of deaths caused by PM2.5s changes when looked at per capita. When ranked by the number of deaths for every 100,000 people, Ukraine jumps to the top of the list at 120. </p> <p>It is followed by eastern European and former Soviet states, and Russia itself, probably due to a legacy of heavy industry in the region.

  "<p>Something has gone wrong in Britain, and the EU referendum result showed us \u2013 or at least, those of us who weren\u2019t already aware \u2013 what it is. The campaign and its aftermath exposed a society that has split along lines of class, region, age and culture, with fewer binding threads than at any point in recent history.</p> <p>On the day, huge swaths of the country voted by class and geography. This was hardly surprising, considering how tensions between the classes have been exploited mercilessly by politicians. Social and economic inequalities, particularly between the south-east and the rest of the country, and between major cities and outlying towns, <a href=\"https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/infographic-income-inequality-uk\">have grown</a>, and that growth been tolerated, for decades \u2013 to a point where it now threatens social and political stability.</p> <p>Looking at the coverage of the Brexit result, we were led to believe that the population of Britain can be easily sliced into tribes. The tribes to which the writers of newspaper articles and the producers of television news belong do not have to be named \u2013 they are, simply, \u201cpeople\u201d. Anyone who falls outside the urban, middle-class tribe is a \u201ccommunity\u201d \u2013 usually identified (however erroneously) by race or religion. In the absence of anything other than token representation, people who appear to fall into these groups have to be \u201cunderstood\u201d, rather than making their own case on their own terms.</p> <p>The late Richard Hoggart observed the widely held belief that a \u201cbloodless revolution\u201d had taken place in Britain following the second world war, based on the founding of the welfare state and the slow re-emergence of a consumer economy. But while we have been anticipating the classless society for decades, Hoggart pointed out that what he termed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/13/class-richard-hoggart-social-media\">the \u201ccoffin\u201d of class</a> remains empty. Now, the coffin has been shoved under the carpet. Anyone can see its outline if they look close enough, yet it stays there because no one knows what to do with it.</p> <p>British politicians have in recent years tended to treat both the idea of a distinct working class and the very words \u201cworking class\u201d as rhetorical poison, and have made strenuous efforts to avoid using them. Instead, they use such phrases as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/10/working-class-hard-working-families-labour-social-change\">hard-working families</a>\u201d, or \u201cordinary voters\u201d, for fear of alienating both middle-class voters and \u201caspirational\u201d working-class voters. More recently, however, they have found a different way to mention class: by prefixing \u201cworking class\u201d with the word \u201cwhite\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/10/working-class-hard-working-families-labour-social-change\">The working classes don't want to be 'hard-working families' | Selina Todd</a> </p> </aside>  <p>People who are perceived to be part of this group, once created and labelled, can be called upon to express an opinion \u2013 for, of course, there is only one opinion \u2013 whenever a reporter or an MP in a marginal seat needs to appear as though they are in touch with a world outside the metropolis. In these circumstances the phrase \u201cwhite working class\u201d comes to mean \u201cpeople who sort of look like us but who don\u2019t seem to be like us, and we can\u2019t work out why\u201d.</p> <p>The idea that, in a group as heterogeneous as the British working class, it is only the white members who have been \u201cabandoned\u201d has proved magnetic to both columnists and politicians. It seems to date back to the electoral surge of the British National party at local elections in the early- to mid-2000s, and at the European parliamentary elections in 2009, in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jun/08/labour-conservatives-condemn-bnp-europe\">it won two seats</a>. When the BNP looked to be on the verge of a breakthrough, public figures in the mainstream of political and media life asked why \u201cthe white working class\u201d \u2013 a loosely defined yet apparently clod-like mass \u2013 was supporting this regressive movement en masse.</p> <p>The assumption is that working-class people, when they feel marginalised, vote for fascists. But to be fearful and resentful is a choice; it does not go away with an increased pay packet. There are legions of well-housed, well-paid people \u2013 working class as well as middle class, and by no means always white \u2013 who consider themselves superior to others based on their skin colour, and countless more badly housed, badly off people who are no more driven to fascism than to veganism.</p> <p>The Labour party has, in its clumsy way, tacitly endorsed the idea of the \u201cwhite working class\u201d as a single electoral bloc in its attempts to address its unpopularity among some working-class voters. Under Ed Miliband\u2019s leadership, two key figures, the Labour peer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/jan/16/maurice-glasman-peer-labour\">Maurice Glasman</a> and MP Jon Cruddas, developed a formula of \u201cconservative socialism\u201d to appeal to working-class voters based on \u201cfamily, faith and flag\u201d. Glasman waded in and out of arguments for limiting \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/19/blue-labour-immigration\">and even stopping</a> \u2013 immigration to Britain.</p> <p>In the run-up to the 2015 general election, Ed Miliband hired Arnie Graf, an American community organiser, as an adviser. Once the election was over, Graf wrote an article for <a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2015/08/labours-failure-had-little-to-do-with-organisers-in-the-field/\">the Labour List website</a> telling how Labour\u2019s central staff had found it impossible to find a worker on the minimum wage to speak to Miliband for a press call, because none of them knew any.

If you are born rich, in a rich area, the likelihood is that you will find a way \u2013 or will have ways come to you \u2013 to stay wealthy and privileged throughout your life, and your children will do the same. Advantage is hoarded by the privileged sticking close to those who are similarly privileged. There is a subtle collusion shared by both left and right to maintain the solidity of this structure, while continuing to deny it.</p> <p>Research on economic inequality and its social ramifications has shown that those near the top of the earnings scale consistently underestimate how well-off they are in comparison to others. In 2009, the TUC created a \u201c<a href=\"http://touchstoneblog.org.uk/features/middlebritain/\">Middlebritainometer</a>\u201d, allowing wage-earners to input their income and find out where theirs lay in relation to the average. It showed that richer people believed themselves to be far closer to the average than they really were. Those earning \u00a335,000 a year, which in 2009 put them in the top 20% of UK earners, placed themselves an average of <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/economic-issues/touchstone-pamphlets/everyone-thinks-they-live-middle-britain\">26 percentage points lower</a> than their actual position.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It might be argued that a primary aspect of working-class experience is loss</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is how privilege becomes truly concentrated \u2013 through the systematic denial of the way economic, social and cultural capital works, by the very people who are hogging it. Such blanket denial serves to convince members of the middle class that, generation after generation, they have to tighten their grip on the advantages they have, because they are always at risk of losing them.</p> <p>When I was growing up, in the 1980s and 90s in Solihull, no one ever used the term \u201cworking class\u201d. Instead it was \u201cpeople like us\u201d, or \u201cthe likes of us\u201d, by which I took to mean a discrete group bound by occupation and geography who could expect certain things out of life but not others. Casual violence \u2013 symbolic, domestic and public \u2013 was endemic. Casual racism was part of daily conversation. Casual cynicism pervaded: a consequence of casual exploitation and casual displacement, which fed into people\u2019s souls and manifested in them treating everything like one great frigging joke, because that was how they felt they had been treated their entire lives.

It might be argued that a primary aspect of working-class experience, a feeling that most defines a certain way of being in the world, is loss. Loss is everywhere: the loss of optimism as experience victory-laps hope; the loss of loved ones to war, workplace accidents or ill health; the loss of a sense of home, going back generations, as families move repeatedly in search of relief from poverty; and the loss of a sense of place in a changing environment, such as when local businesses, which were one major employers, close down.</p> <p>From the 60s, when docks and mines began to close and Harold Wilson\u2019s Labour government anticipated the coming death of heavy industry by heralding \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/sep/19/harold-wilson-white-heat-technology-speech\">the white heat of the technological revolution</a>\u201d, Britain began to move from a production model of what it meant to be working class \u2013 the class that makes things \u2013 to a consumption model \u2013 the class that buys things.</p> <p>In theory, this ought to have made the experience of being working class a lot more like the experience of being middle class, in the sense that anyone who had enough money could express their worldview partly through what they bought, and would be freed from some of the more stifling aspects of social interdependence by home and car ownership. Instead, their position, their status, was diminished in three ways.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/03/high-status-high-income-britains-new-working-class\">High status, high income: this is Britain\u2019s new working class | Lynsey Hanley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First, through the dismantling of trade union power, which established and then protected rights and benefits for people who were out of work. Second, through negative propaganda, which sought to isolate the badly off from an upwardly mobile, consumerist working class. Third, through populist policy-making: for example, the right to buy, which divided local authority tenants into the \u201caspirational\u201d and the \u201cnon-aspirational\u201d, depending on whether or not they bought their council house.</p> <p>In the mid-70s, a sociologist named Paul Willis investigated the ways in which a group of schoolboys in the industrial West Midlands town of Wolverhampton subverted all attempts by teachers to get them to accept that they could play a part in a world outside the one they knew. Willis concluded that boys and girls respond in much the same ways to the imposition of values and practices that seem ridiculous to them and merely divert them from ways of life they know to be \u201creal\u201d, settled and achievable.</p> <p>\u201cThe lads\u201d, as Willis called them, worked hard to gain victories on their own terms: they were obsessed with \u201chaving a laff\u201d, which meant getting one over on the teacher, developing a parallel language of in-jokes and shared mumbles, while their work gave no indication of their actual capabilities.</p> <p>I knew those lads. You know, the funny thing is I never sat in the front row at school. I was always at the back: in the same row as the lads, but never with them. I thought they were throwing their lives away. They knew they were throwing their lives away, and yet they refused to acknowledge that that was what they were doing. The cost of one of them saying, \u201cCome on lads, we can have a laff outside of school, we\u2019re here to learn so we don\u2019t have to do jobs we hate later on,\u201d would have been too much for any one of them to stand. In any case, Willis argued, working-class males are trusted so little within the wider social structure, that even if \u201cthe lads\u201d had changed their minds and decided to work hard, there was no guarantee that it would have got them better jobs.</p> <p>Willis wasn\u2019t exactly saying that resistance, in the form of mild yet persistent insubordination, was futile \u2013 more that it was the boys\u2019 own habits of playing up, as much as the unfairness of \u201cthe system\u201d, that led them to become trapped in low-paid and unfulfilling jobs. He concluded: \u201cThere is an element of self-damnation in the taking on of subordinate roles in western capitalism \u2026 however, this damnation is experienced, paradoxically, as true learning, affirmation, appropriation, and as a form of resistance.\u201d Solidarity made sense to the lads because they understood that they were all headed for the same destiny and would need mates when they got there. In this way a survival strategy becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p><strong>It needs to be acknowledged that \u201chelplessness\u201d</strong> or \u201cdependency\u201d \u2013 as defined by politicians seeking to blame individuals for structural failings \u2013 is an adaptive stance rather than an innate fact of character. You can express your power, maintain the illusion of autonomy, preserve your dignity, by refusing to comply with what is asked of you by society. To feel that you lack power is to believe that none of your actions has any consequence \u2013 which means, perversely, that you give yourself the licence to do what you like, on the assumption that it doesn\u2019t matter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a08cbc60878c6d4c7be6865284e752210a9f75a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a08cbc60878c6d4c7be6865284e752210a9f75a1/0_0_3000_2012/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Cafe in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales \u2013 an area that voted for Brexit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Communities that voted to leave the EU \u2013 such as Merthyr Tydfil in Wales, pictured \u2013 were accused of ignorance, racism and even self-sabotage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That is what it means to be \u201crough\u201d: to draw what strength you can from your place on the margins, to let it all go to pieces. To be \u201crespectable\u201d is to define yourself against that feeling: it is to believe, and to enact, the idea that you have power as an individual, as a household or as a community, in spite of your relative powerlessness in society. In the context of the referendum, \u201crespectability\u201d expressed itself in a sense that Britain \u2013 once proud, autonomous, dominant \u2013 had been taken away by Brussels, and that it was time to \u201ctake it back\u201d. People had a chance to cast a vote that, for once, had equal weight wherever it was placed. That voting to leave might have huge, destabilising consequences \u2013 precisely because of the fact that every individual vote counted \u2013 was beside the point. It was a stab at dignity.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>There is this idea that I keep coming back to: </strong>one of stalled mobility, the long-term psychological and social effect of the limitations placed on working-class people.<strong> </strong>This has nothing whatsoever to do with stunted intellect. It is in the interests of institutionally powerful people to tell you that you\u2019re thick.</p> <p>Social boundaries make us, and in turn we remake, or reproduce, them. Back and forth it goes, between what we are told (albeit rarely explicitly) we are entitled to in terms of education, social standing, pay and political power, and what we tell others through our cultural choices. These boundaries are remade and reinforced through the places we find ourselves living and the places we tell ourselves we cannot go.</p> <p>In my experience, growing up and being educated in a working-class environment, it went without saying that some things were \u201cfor us\u201d and others were not. My grandparents read the Sun and my parents read the Mirror, while the Daily Mail seemed unattainably posh. I didn\u2019t see a broadsheet until after I left school.</p> <p>Class tropes \u2013 expressed through which newspaper you read as much as the level of education you were expected to attain \u2013 appeared so solid and immutable as to be simple \u201ccommon sense\u201d.

But the meaning attached to such respectability has changed. In the 80s, it was regarded as shorthand for the politically favoured affluent wing of the working class. A split that was already present was deliberately driven open, and to a great extent it worked.<strong> </strong>Organised labour no longer had a chance once you had to pick sides: unambitious council tenant or aspirational owner-occupier, sponging welfare dependant or dynamic entrepreneur.</p> <p>Respectability was recast, through policy and media, not just as a way for individuals and communities to hold depredation at bay, but as a moral crusade. Come the mid-90s, Labour\u2019s ideological spine was of a piece with the individualism of the 80s. But it sought to dress up the blunt Conservative language of \u201cYou\u2019re on your own, mate\u201d with a sophisticated, positive-thinking lexicon based on the persistent meme of \u201clivin\u2019 the dream\u201d. To feel discomfort about constant change \u2013 an emergent feature of globalisation \u2013 was to be inherently rightwing; yet equally, to believe in the strength of collective public institutions \u2013 such as unions, publicly funded health and education systems \u2013 was unhelpfully Bolshevik.</p> <p>For two generations now, the state has presented ever more forcefully the idea that working-class individuals need to change in order to qualify as full citizens. In the words of the sociologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/dec/01/schools.uk2\">Val Gillies</a>, the education strategy of recent governments can be summed up thus: \u201cFor the sake of their children\u2019s future, and for the stability and security of society as a whole, working-class parents must be taught how to raise middle-class subjects.\u201d</p> <p>This process starts early, in accordance with notions of \u201cearly intervention\u201d being imperative for children from poor families if they are not to fail at school. The government offers <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/help-with-childcare-costs/free-childcare-and-education-for-2-to-4-year-olds\">15 free hours of nursery care</a> universally to three-and four-year-olds. Two-year-olds also qualify if their parents are eligible for certain state benefits. While this latter allowance has been heralded as a way for low-income parents to return to paid work more easily, the subtext is that working-class children need to be removed from the malign influence of their working-class parents and educated into middle-class norms as early as possible.</p> <p>By comparison, middle-class parents and their children\u2019s teachers are from the same class, and therefore speak the same language. Whether the symbols of social class are encoded in clothes or hand gestures, or are made explicit through abstractions and vocabulary, they show to each other that they have similar sets of assumptions and the same broad understanding of the world. They will have the same broad set of desires for the child, and will understand implicitly what is required of the child in order for it to progress successfully and reproduce the state of \u201cbeing middle class\u201d.</p> <p>In the education system, as in the workplace, what is at stake for members of each class is represented by the conflict between individual advancement and solidarity with others. The irony is that the middle-class focus on doing well as individuals helps to consolidate the success of the group as a whole, while the relative working-class emphasis on solidarity can serve to increase tension and frustration between individuals.</p> <p>This is the paradox of trying to achieve social mobility through education, which is nothing more than a finely tuned replica of the larger social system it serves. Education is presented as a system in which anyone who works hard enough can achieve their potential,<strong> </strong>as is illustrated by the many cliches used in newspaper-speak and political rhetoric: as a \u201cbright but poor child\u201d on a \u201ctough estate\u201d, you \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and \u201cget on your bike\u201d to places of greater opportunity without waiting to be \u201clifted out of poverty\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"38a1185ec5ad4bdb58001f4f68bfb99d9d61bfe1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38a1185ec5ad4bdb58001f4f68bfb99d9d61bfe1/0_0_5184_3445/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Terraced homes in Oldham, Greater Manchester.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The state has long presented the idea that working-class people need to change in order to qualify as full citizens\u2019 \u2026 pictured, terraced homes in Oldham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The late Chris Woodhead, a former chief inspector of schools, believed that middle-class children do better at school because they have \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/may/11/education-policy-class-bias\">better genes</a>\u201d, and felt that any attempt to raise the attainment of working-class children is unlikely to bear much fruit, owing to the simple fact that their teachers will inevitably be working with damaged, dunderheaded goods. <strong> </strong></p> <p>The ability of average-but-privileged people to regard themselves as \u201cbetter\u201d than others may go some way towards explaining why unprivileged students disproportionately avoid elite universities, even when they have the grades to apply for them \u2013<strong> </strong>a tendency that reinforces social disadvantage. The point is that education can break down the defences of class discrimination, but it can also reinforce them.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>The revolution, it turned out, never happened.</strong> It was stymied by the mechanisms of a class-bound education system, class-segregated housing, a media and cultural landscape that has persistently reinforced class prejudice, and a bizarre historic tendency for members of the British electorate to vote against their own interests.</p> <p>British society is not so much a pyramid as a diamond, with the lives of those at the top and the bottom resembling each other\u2019s in ways not obvious to the wide band in the middle. The contrast, of course, between the conditions at the top and those at stuck the bottom is that the former set you up for a smooth path through life and the latter for an extraordinarily difficult one.</p> <p>But there is a concentration of power at both ends of the diamond: the only difference is the milieu in which that power can be used. In the middle, power is diffused by dint of sheer numbers, and yet it is in the middle that power is aggregated and gets used most effectively. Because of its size it is the middle class, and not the \u201c1%\u201d, that sets the rules. This much larger group has the combined wealth, the qualifications, the social and cultural capital and, perhaps above all, the electoral influence to dictate much of our government policy, from tax to education.</p> <p>It is when people do not care about conforming to the middle-class version of \u201crespectability\u201d, and simply want comfort and security for themselves and their families, that promoters of the creed of social mobility start to worry.</p> <p>Acceptance is available to the socially mobile, but only if they \u201cdo\u201d social mobility the right way. To those on the right who regard social mobility as a good thing in itself, there is almost no point in undertaking upward mobility if it does not involve taking out a wholesale subscription to mainstream values, which often, though not always, means the dominant middle-class set of values.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What does it mean for society when the powerlessness of one class turns into the power to hinder the progress of others?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is dangerous, not to mention naive, to think you can climb easily out of a world from which no one you know has managed to escape.

That\u2019s just what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Another shrugs: \u201cThere\u2019s no point in trying, because I am no good at anything.\u201d Others point out the injustice of being told not to put your postcode on your CV because it is \u201cthe wrong one\u201d.</p> <p>There are a number of reasons why you are more likely to hear a young person in, say, Blackpool or an estate outside Doncaster state that \u201cthere\u2019s no point in trying\u201d because they are \u201cno good at anything\u201d than someone in Bracknell or Tunbridge Wells. It is part of the baggage of coming from a place that is isolated \u2013 or has become isolated \u2013 and has too few decent jobs to go around. This is where a substandard quality of education, housing and transport collude to strike down individuals and areas that are already disadvantaged.</p> <p>In towns marked by the waste of assets, the waste of human potential, it is harder to imagine, against all immediate evidence, that it is possible to live anything other than a scrabbling, scrappy kind of life. People so often suppress anger about their circumstances that it forces itself out like steam at jarring points. It might be argued that this is precisely what happened on 23 June: not so much an incoherent howl of rage as a focused hiss of anger. If the rage of leave voters was expressed in the voting booth, the anger of remain voters boiled over after the result. Communities suffering economic hardship that had voted out of the EU were accused of ignorance, racism, isolationism, even self-sabotage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/07/angry-remain-voter-working-class-division-britain\">Angry remain voter?

So why not?</p> <p>My answers sound cynical, worldly and unworthy in the face of this surge of belief. Why not? Because Corbyn and McDonnell, burdened by their history, will never ever earn the trust of enough voters to make any plans happen. After George <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/17/budget-2015-osborne-austerity-labour-miliband-wavering-voters\">Osborne\u2019s lethally successful branding of Labour</a> as irresponsible, debt-ridden, magic-money-tree feckless borrowers, it will take heavy spadework of reassurance to win back trust. All McDonnell\u2019s plans are popular, but he offers nothing to allay the voters\u2019 fear that Labour doesn\u2019t do \u201ctough choices\u201d.</p> <p>At one conference meeting when a speaker said Labour must win some Tory votes, someone shouted out: \u201cWhy? We don\u2019t want Tories!\u201d So I find myself arguing dry psephology against passionate conviction. It\u2019s depressing, but here\u2019s the <a href=\"http://www.fabians.org.uk/under-corbyns-electoral-plan-prospects-for-victory-look-bleak/\">Fabian Society\u2019s analysis</a>: Labour needs 104 seats in England and Wales and 40% of the vote to win. In the marginals, four out every five of the extra votes must come from those who were Tory last time. Even if the young are energised and turnout soars to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/21/scottish-referendum-massive-voter-turnout-means-politics-changed-for-ever\">Scottish referendum heights</a>, it gets nowhere close. Even if every single Liberal Democrat and Green vote went Labour, that only gives 29 seats. Even if Ukip were crushed, its vote divides equally Labour and Tory. As Labour wins radical votes, it risks losing moderate votes to the Tories: 2% went that way last time. Read the research yourself and groan. It hurts.</p> <p>In one fraught conversation after another, I try all this on Corbyn believers but to no avail. No compromise, blocked ears, total denial of electoral facts, a post-truth conviction. You can hear this non-meeting of minds everywhere at this conference, a shutter of incomprehension dividing the two sides. \u201cBut we can convince them! People will listen!\u201d They do think Corbyn will be the next prime minister, because conviction moves mountains.

Hipsters know their customers, have strong business empathy, and are all about product design. Hackers are what they call \u201810xers\u2019 in Silicon Valley: talented individuals who can supercharge your business outcomes tenfold. Hustlers are the all rounders, the ones who can hold it and weave it all together. </p> <p>Yet pulling your \u2018three h\u2019s\u2019 together is only half the battle, with retention of high-value workers in an employee\u2019s marketplace equally as critical.</p> <p>A large-scale Gallup poll last year on employee engagement showed that the modern workforce has sophisticated emotional needs when it comes to job satisfaction. Key findings included that employees want a strengths-based culture, management that has the talent to motivate and the desire to build genuine relationships, and a workplace that is invested in its employees as people. </p> <p>The business landscape today is all about building brands that both employees and customers want to be associated with \u2013 not the other way around.</p> <h2><strong>Build from the customer up</strong></h2> <p>Success may have many parents, but Robert Wickham believes the key to unlocking your path to it lies in constructing a customer-centric organisation from day one. \u201cWhat are the personas you are going after, and how do you go about it?\u201d he asks. </p> <p>Wickham believes that the best way to define personas \u2013 your target markets \u2013 is to create a minimum viable transaction rather than a minimum viable product. Traditionally, a minimum viable product has meant the smallest and fastest test case that you can build to learn the most about your customers. For Wickham, it\u2019s about understanding the parameters for the transaction that will get potential customers over the line in the first place. Are you offering a service that people are actually willing to engage with before they even part with their money?</p> <p>While you\u2019re building up data with MVPs, customer segmentation, and market analysis, Wickham cautions that research is more just data. \u201cThere\u2019s confirmation bias in play, so it takes shoe leather as well. The best ideas are from masses of ideas, and then finding the right group to test them on,\u201d he says. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1da846f5eeed013e0e8d06c6f89221d1fb6718e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1da846f5eeed013e0e8d06c6f89221d1fb6718e/0_58_5197_3120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"understanding the parameters for the transaction that will get potential customers over the line in the first place.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Understanding the parameters for the transaction that will get potential customers over the line in the first place.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Tom Howey/Plume Creative/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ultimately, Wickham comes back to his belief that the execution is more important than the idea. \u201cThe great companies are generally the second mover in a market. They\u2019ve understood the concept, moved faster, and know the market better,\u201d he says. \u201cLook at Facebook and Apple \u2013 they just made existing things better.\u201d</p> <p>Companies like Salesforce know a lot about startups \u2013 just seventeen years ago they were one themselves. Now, they\u2019re the global leader in cloud-based CRM systems with clients ranging from family businesses to multinational giants.</p> <p><strong><em>Continue the conversation at <a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/309726426;137360681;j\" rel=\"nofollow\">salesforce.com/why</a></em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"impression tracker\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/jump/N4038.1810343THEGUARDIAN.COM.AU/B10261552.137360681;sz=1x1;ord=[timestamp]?&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"impression tracker\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img SRC=&quot;&quot; https: ad.doubleclick.net ddm ad N4038.1810343THEGUARDIAN.COM.AU B10261552.137360681;sz=&quot;1x1;ord=[timestamp];dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=?&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&quot; BORDER=&quot;0&quot; WIDTH=&quot;1&quot; HEIGHT=&quot;1&quot; ALT=&quot;&quot; Advertisement&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

But as I discovered in Nova Scotia, Canadians don\u2019t always follow the standard script.</p> <p>Canada has so much in common with Australia, and yet spending time there with Syrian families and their sponsors felt like stepping through a looking glass.</p> <p>This is a country where politicians tried to outbid one another during the last federal election with pledges to resettle Syrian refugees.</p> <p>It\u2019s a country in which no political party has an anti-immigration platform.</p> <p>And it\u2019s a country where the government, after fulfilling its promise to welcome 25,000 Syrians, was forced to extend the program after protests from would-be sponsors who\u2019d already raised hundreds of thousands of dollars and signed leases for homes.</p> <p>More than 30,000 Syrians have arrived since November (excluding Quebec, which has its own settlement program), and almost half of those are being privately sponsored to some extent.</p> <p>While government-assisted refugees are usually settled in cities and large towns, families who are privately sponsored can end up anywhere. In more than 300 communities across the country, locals have banded together to provide housing, English classes, driving lessons, a crash course in Canadian customs (pot luck dinners, poutine) and, most important of all, friendship.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"107da95f9ccd86338a20ded50b1b2bd60a643ce0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/107da95f9ccd86338a20ded50b1b2bd60a643ce0/0_0_3840_2560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shelburne local Bill Murphy took Wadah Hendawi to meet local fishermen \u2013 making contacts like this in the community may lead to job opportunities.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shelburne local Bill Murphy took Wadah Hendawi to meet local fishermen \u2013 making contacts like this in the community may lead to job opportunities.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amos Roberts/SBS Dateline</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The trigger for this outpouring of compassion was a tragedy that touched people around the world last September \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/31/alan-kurdi-death-canada-refugee-policy-syria-boy-beach-turkey-photo\">the drowning of three year-old Alan Kurdi</a>, washed up on a Turkish beach.</p> <p>But unlike Australians, Canadians who were moved to do something actually could.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>When that picture became public, the phones were ringing off the hook,<em>\u201d </em>Naomi Alboim tells me. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t keep up with the phone calls and emails of people who wanted to help.\u201d</p> <p> Alboim is the co-founder of Lifeline Syria in Toronto, which recruits and trains sponsors, and she\u2019s involved in sponsoring two families herself.

  "<p>The Department for International Development (DfID) \u201cshould have done more\u201d to give developing countries a voice in the global battle against tax avoidance and evasion, according to a UK aid watchdog.</p> <p>A new review, published by the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (Icai) on Tuesday, criticises the government department for following a \u201ctop-down\u201d approach to including developing countries in international policy discussions on the issue.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/21/ecuador-foreign-minister-guillaume-long-steps-up-campaign-for-un-tax-body\">Ecuador's foreign minister steps up campaign for UN tax body</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Icai, which scrutinises the effectiveness and value for money of UK aid for taxpayers, awards scores on a traffic light system, from green for good practice, to red for poor achievement.

A study last year by the UN Conference on Trade and Development estimated that multinationals shift up to <a href=\"http://www.taxjustice.net/2015/03/26/unctad-multinational-tax-avoidance-costs-developing-countries-100-billion/\">$300bn (\u00a3231bn) away from developing countries</a> annually.</p> <p>Richard Gledhill, the lead commissioner for the review for Icai, said that while DfID and the UK government were committed to driving progress on international tax policy to address global challenges and reduce poverty, they could do more. </p> <p>Gledhill said: \u201cOur sense is \u2026 that DfID has adopted too much of a top-down approach driven by the OECD agenda. We think DfID should have done more to look at the priorities of developing countries and to feed these issues into the international tax agenda earlier on, so that developing countries have more input into the process.\u201d</p> <p>On HMRC\u2019s \u00a31.2m spending on training tax experts, Gledhill said: \u201cNot all of it needed to be spent \u2013 and certainly not all needed to be spent in the first year.\u201d</p> <p>Gledhill said that while DfID was awarded an amber-red rating, the report identified some good practice. For instance, the department was awarded a green\u2013amber score for effectiveness, in recognition of good cross-government collaboration and its partnership with HMRC was \u201ca potentially good model for collaborating on capacity building\u201d.</p> <p>However, the review said some stakeholders had expressed doubts that such technical expertise on highly specialised international tax issues would have much impact, given the problems with national tax systems. DfID has not assessed areas of potential tension between UK tax policies and the needs of developing countries, it said. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Priti Patel should work with fellow ministers to put poorer countries' needs at heart of plans to tackle tax dodging</p> <footer> <cite>Nick Bryer, Oxfam</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a set of recommendations, Icai said DfID should promote coherence between the UK\u2019s domestic and development policies on international tax and adopt a more strategic approach to cross-government working around international tax.</p> <p>Gledhill said that, while international tax reform is a small part of DfID\u2019s work, the issue of tax evasion, avoidance and corruption has moved up the political agenda since the financial crisis.</p> <p>In recent years, the G20 and the OECD, with support from the UK, have led reforms to the international tax system to tackle the problem. They have promoted new standards in three key areas: exchange of information, disclosure of beneficial ownership to reduce secrecy and to fight money laundering; and also measures to limit the ability of multinationals to structure their affairs to avoid tax.</p> <p>Nick Bryer, Oxfam\u2019s head of inequality, said: \u201cThe fight against tax dodging is global but this report shows that the UK government is not doing enough to ensure developing countries get a seat at the table when international policy decisions are made.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/apr/11/system-privilege-benefits-global-tax-body-oecd\">'A system of privilege and benefits': is a global tax body needed?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cPriti Patel should work with fellow ministers to put poorer countries\u2019 needs at the heart of plans to tackle tax dodging, which robs poor countries of at least $170bn a year that could fund schools and hospitals.\u201d</p> <p>Charlie Matthews, head of advocacy at ActionAid, said: \u201cInstead of standing by as the UK pushes tax reforms designed to meet the needs of rich countries, DfID needs to listen to poorer countries and ensure efforts to reform the global tax system are informed by their needs. </p> <p>\u201cThis report should kick-start a cross-government approach to tackling global poverty and tax avoidance \u2026 In order to help developing countries stand on their own two feet, the UK needs to crack down on tax havens, fix unfair tax treaties and end the \u2018race to the bottom\u2019 on corporate taxes.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for DfID said: \u201cInternational tax evasion is a menace that can hurt the world\u2019s poorest and hold back developing economies. The UK\u2019s aid strategy focuses not just on alleviating poverty, but also on helping developing countries build robust institutions and tax systems so they can stand on their own two feet.</p> <p>\u201cAs Icai rightly recognises, DfID has helped developing countries benefit from the new international tax standards and this has been underpinned by effective cross-government collaboration. The UK has a strong record of supporting and mentoring developing countries in this field and will continue to do so.\u201d </p>",
