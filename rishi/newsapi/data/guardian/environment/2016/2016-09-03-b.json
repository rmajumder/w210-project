  "<p>Deep in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/may/12/borrowdale-cumbria\" title=\"\">Borrowdale</a> valley, where England is observed in its finest garments, there is ferment in the fields and on the hillsides. The gnarled farming communities who toil with their sheep on these lakeland slopes have prevailed in the face of Vikings, Normans and rampaging Scots for thousands of years and have learned to harness tempests. Now they believe they are in a mortal struggle with what they regard as a more implacable enemy: the <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Trust</a>.</p> <p>The trust, guardian of England\u2019s natural treasures, is one of the biggest landlords in this part of the Lake District. Of the dozen or so farms scattered in these parts, only three are not owned by the NT. That number is now down to two, following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/teenage-farmer-national-trust-lake-district-land-george-purcell-thorneythwaite\" title=\"\">the trust\u2019s \u00a3950,000 purchase of the land around the historic Thorneythwaite farm</a>.</p> <p>Yet it is the trust\u2019s decision not to buy the adjoining farmhouse and outbuildings that has caused anger and distress in the valley. The buildings were sold separately to an unknown buyer and will, most likely, become another one of the holiday cottages which make up 60% of the homes here. Thus one of the most beautiful stretches of hill-farming land in England could soon be sacrificed to the National Trust\u2019s lofty vision of \u201cmanaging the wider landscape\u201d.</p> <p>It seems that the Lake District has been turned into a scarred landscape where the competing forces of land management, development and conservation are joining battle.</p> <p>After it was announced last year that 59 hectares of land, including the remote Stickle Tarn and a chunk of the Coniston Water shoreline, were <a href=\"http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/aboutus/news/news-pages/sale-of-lake-district-national-park-property2\" title=\"\">to be sold</a> off, there was uproar locally and at Westminster. In the House of Lords, <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201415/ldhansrd/text/150305-0001.htm#st_50\" title=\"\">the Earl of Clancarty pleaded with the government</a> to stop the sale of \u201csome of the most beautiful land in Britain\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cStickle Tarn, Coniston Water, the River Derwent: are we really selling off public spaces, some of the most beautiful land in Britain, to fund the building of visitor centres?\u201d</p> <p>A debate about the very essence and nature of the Lake District National Park is also raging and the battle for Thorneythwaite farm encapsulates it. The farmers are seeking to preserve a way of life which has sustained them and their families for centuries. Others, though, feel that large parts of the Lake District have been shorn of their natural beauty by the persistent adherence to sheep farming and that there is an urgent need for the area\u2019s proper ecosystem to be restored.</p> <p>The trust stands accused of a strategy of rewilding the uplands of Borrowdale valley by stealth. It was accused of deploying \u201cmafia\u201d tactics in its purchase of the farmland by Melvyn Bragg, a native of Cumbria. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/30/melvyn-bragg-accuses-national-trust-of-bullying-in-farm-row\" title=\"\">a letter to the <em>Times</em></a> last week he wrote: \u201cHad a billionaire bullied his way into this disgraceful purchase there would have been a deserved outcry. If the increasingly arrogant National Trust is there to protect anything of our past surely this is a prime example. The National Trust is about to destroy what centuries of working men and women have created. It used a shameful manoeuvre to achieve its aim. Who can check this bullying charity?\u201d</p> <p>The trust has said it has no plans for rewilding the site at the moment and that it would continue to be farmed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6510966c60c1d1793f5b443461bf48e209a87b65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6510966c60c1d1793f5b443461bf48e209a87b65/0_309_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A flock of Herdwick sheep on a road\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Local sheep flocks like these Herdwicks could face decline as farm buildings become holiday cottages.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Peter Edmondson, who works the adjoining Seathwaite farm, had raised what he had thought was enough money to buy Thorneythwaite, only to be outbid by the trust, whose offer was \u00a3200,000 above the guide price. The trust responded by claiming that it did not have the cash to buy both land and buildings and had thus offered the significantly higher price for the land for fear that the auctioneer might parcel land and buildings together to secure a higher overall price.</p> <p>Decades of working these hills have given Edmondson the figure of a spry, lightweight boxer in his prime and on Friday night his attitude was pugilistic when discussing the trust\u2019s conduct. Six generations of his family have farmed this land and he said that the fight to ensure that the traditions of hill farming and sheep farming at Thorneythwaite endure was not over yet.</p> <p>\u201cI had worked with the bank to raise the finance to purchase Thorneythwaite, but when we arrived at the auction we knew something was afoot.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever might have been \u201cafoot\u201d will soon form part of a wide-ranging complaint to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/charity-commission\" title=\"\">Charity Commission</a> about the behaviour of the trust during the bid process.</p> <p>Edmondson said: \u201cThis body used \u00a3200,000 of public money to pay well over the market value for this land. And of course it threatens the sheep farming and hill farming tradition in the region that I would have preserved. If they were serious about maintaining the farming tradition they would have purchased the farm buildings too. I simply don\u2019t believe that this massive, state-funded institution couldn\u2019t have come up with the extra cash. Farmers in this valley would have been delighted if they had bought the whole package and signalled their commitment to hill-farming in this area.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve written to Dame Helen Ghosh, director general of the trust, offering a deal to allow me and others to farm the land properly and to take over the management of the 413 <a href=\"http://www.herdwick-sheep.com/\" title=\"\">Herdwick sheep</a> that belong to the farm. However, she hasn\u2019t deigned to write back personally. Instead, I\u2019ve had three different letters from three different trust employees, including a \u2018correspondence coordinator\u2019 effectively giving me less than two weeks to agree to an unsustainable, one-year tenancy skewed in favour of the trust.\u201d</p> <p>Edmondson intends to write to his local MP, Labour\u2019s <a href=\"http://suehayman.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Sue Hayman</a>, and also to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/tim-farron\" title=\"\">Tim Farron</a>, the Liberal Democrat leader whose constituency also takes in much of the Lake District. He is also exploring the possibility of a crowdfunding venture to raise the extra capital in the event that the Charity Commission blocks the trust\u2019s purchase.</p> <p>In the midst of all of this lies Thorneythwaite farm itself. As dusk began to cast a shadow down the valley, you could see why the handsome, cream-coloured farmhouse and its handful of stone outhouses would fetch a pretty price. From here you can see the valley stretching before you; its green floor honeycombed with quadrants bounded by impressive and immaculate dry-stone dykes.</p> <p>The hills above that the National Trust, perhaps, and others, are seeking to rewild stand gaunt in the diminishing light like the shoulders of a giant rugby pack. Perhaps they might look better with trees and ferns but there is also beauty in their austerity and in the way of life that the community below has preserved.</p> <p>In the end it may be that a screech of owls helps to decide the fate of Thorneythwaite farm. Any plans to convert the outbuildings into cottages may be undone if it comes to be known that they are also home to barn owls, a protected species under the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/69\" title=\"\">Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981</a>. Perhaps the new owner ought to find out quickly if his new purchase also comes with a feathered family of tenants whose home is guaranteed by the state.</p>",

  "<p>In a few days the car parks of Epping Forest will once again bristle with warnings about the criminal consequences of fungi foraging. A similar campaign appeared in the New Forest last week, in this case a first for the national park. Remove a single mushroom from these parks and you now face prosecution. The mushroom-picking season is upon us, but this year the autumnal ritual is being accompanied by unusually high levels of anxiety.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/24/plagues-and-pests-beset-our-trees\">Plagues and pests beset our trees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Until this month the <a href=\"http://www.newforestnpa.gov.uk/news/article/855/new_forest_fungi_-_a_feast_for_your_eyes\">New Forest National Park Authority</a> permitted individuals to gather up to 1.5kg of mushrooms for their own use. Commercial collection was banned outright. But now it has decided to follow up the example of Epping Forest, which banned all gathering of fungi several years ago.</p> <p>Just how much damage will be inflicted by those who flout the bylaws remains to be seen. In recent years our forests have been assailed by gangs of pickers who in a few hours can strip the land of hundreds of kilograms of oyster, chanterelle, field, cep and other mushrooms just to satisfy the nation\u2019s growing urge to forage for food.</p> <p>\u201cWe had a quiet year in 2015 because we had a relatively poor crop of fungi, a consequence of the weather at the time,\u201d said Jeremy Dagley, head of conservation for Epping Forest. \u201cOn the other hand, this year we could get a bumper crop. Who knows what kind of foraging \u2013 and damage \u2013 we will experience then?\u201d</p> <p>Twenty years ago, no commercial fungi foraging was carried out in Britain. By 2013 it had risen to such a scale that there were 20 successful prosecutions for illegal fungi-picking in Epping Forest alone, with one person being caught with 20 sacks of mushrooms. Those found guilty were fined sums of around \u00a3200.</p> <p>But many foragers insist that their handiwork does no harm. Carried out in a responsible manner, it causes no damage. It is the equivalent of the blackberry gathering that many families enjoy at this time of year, they argue.</p> <p>But this is rejected by fungi expert Professor Lynne Boddy, of Cardiff University. \u201cPeople say picking fungi is just like picking blackberries off a bush. But it is not,\u201d she said. \u201cPlants like the blackberry bush evolved to produce fruit that contain their seeds, which birds and animals eat and transmit through their droppings. These berries exist to spread seeds.\u201d</p> <p>By contrast, most fungi transmit their spores in the wind. If they are gathered in plastic bags, the spores can no longer spread, reducing the genetic diversity of populations of fungi in a woodland area. \u201cCertainly fungi-gathering is not like fruit-picking and it is false to claim so,\u201d Boddy added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1236e50fff0befbde638f091367d78f9d178b7d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1236e50fff0befbde638f091367d78f9d178b7d4/156_178_1589_953/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Epping Forest keeper with some of the hauls of fungi seized from foragers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Epping Forest keeper with some of the hauls of fungi seized from foragers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In fact, fungi are incredibly important to the planet, Boddy argued. \u201cEarth\u2019s ecosystems would not work without fungi. They decompose wood and plant tissue; break down dead stuff and recycle nutrients; and grow into plant roots, carrying water and nutrients into them. Without them most plants would not survive. So anything that encourages people to go out and look at fungi is good, as far as I am concerned.\u201d</p> <p>The problem was that foragers were now gathering up fungi on such a vast scale that they could inflict severe damage, Boddy said. They often ripped up other plants and trampled down the undergrowth, thus destroying important habitats for insects and other species. In addition, in many cases fungi gatherers had no knowledge of what they were digging up.</p> <p>\u201cThey can be completely indiscriminate,\u201d said Dagley. \u201cThey rip up everything and then, later on, discard what they don\u2019t want. But that often means destroying quite fragile rare but inedible fungi for no good reason at all. At the same time, these fungi are often very beautiful to look at and are a real attraction for the visitors to the forest at this time of year. That is one reason why we have introduced our ban.\u201d</p> <p>This point was backed by Boddy. \u201cThese foragers are like bottom-trawling dredgers that rip up the seabed in search of shellfish. They do incredible damage. I think the concerns of the New Forest and other areas of special scientific interest are quite justifiable.\u201d</p> <p>Oliver Crossthwaite-Eyre, chairman of the New Forest National Park Authority, said: \u201cLeaving fungi unpicked means they continue to contribute to the forest\u2019s fragile ecosystem. This is an important and decisive move because the New Forest is a stronghold for many rare and endangered species of fungi.\u201d</p> <p>But the danger to the environment is not the only problem raised by the increased popularity of fungi foraging. In addition to the record amount of wild mushrooms that were gathered in 2014, there was also a noticeable number of poisoning cases reported by Public Health England. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/take-care-when-picking-mushrooms-poisons-experts-warn\">A total of 84 cases of wild-mushroom poisoning</a> were reported just a month into the foraging season, it was revealed in early October that year. A similar figure could be experienced this year.</p> <p>One of the deadliest fungi is the innocent-looking death cap mushroom. An ounce of this fungus can kill. In 2013 a Somerset woman suffered multiple organ failure and died after eating soup to which she had added death cap mushrooms she had found growing in her garden and assumed were edible.</p> <p>Other fungi have less toxic effects but can nevertheless cause illness. \u201cSome fungi look awfully like normal mushrooms but are actually poisonous,\u201d said Dagley. \u201cThere is one called yellowstainer, which look the normal mushroom with brown gills that you buy in a supermarket. However, it can really upset your stomach.</p> <p>\u201cThen there is chicken-of-the-wood mushroom that grows on trees. Guidebooks sometimes say this is edible, but people respond in different ways to it and you can get an extremely nasty stomach upset from eating it \u2013 even though it is said to be edible. You really have to know what you are doing.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>One of the islands that makes up Papua New Guinea is called New Ireland. But it seems that a much colder island far to the north might also wish to be called New Ireland \u2013 the island formerly known as Great Britain.</p> <p>In the wake of the European commission\u2019s ruling that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\" title=\"\">Ireland must reclaim \u20ac13bn plus interest in taxes</a> from Apple, there is a good deal of excitement at the prospect of a post-Brexit Britain replacing its smaller neighbour in the affections of tax-shy global corporations. As the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> put it in an editorial: \u201cIf Ireland and the EU do not want a huge, wealth-creating firm doing business in their territory, Apple will be very welcome in the UK.\u201d Welcome, that is, to use the UK as it has previously used Ireland \u2013 as a compliant state that will look the other way while vast profits pass through, untaxed.</p> <p>It is, on the surface, an appealing prospect. You only have to walk around Dublin or Cork to see that Ireland\u2019s tax regime has been a honeypot for all the hottest digital corporations \u2013 not just the long-established ones like Apple, Microsoft and Intel but the entire new wave of internet behemoths: Google, Facebook, Twitter and so on. And the same is broadly true in other areas such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Little Ireland has a stock of US direct investment much larger than France and Germany combined. Ireland is the number one location worldwide for investment by US chemical and pharmaceutical companies and number two for IT companies. And no one thinks those corporations are attracted by the scenery.</p> <p>For the more excitable elements among the Brexiters, the EU\u2019s ruling on Apple\u2019s tax bill thus opens up a delirious prospect. The Brussels bureaucrats are moving against Ireland\u2019s vigorously pro-business taxation policies, but Britain, when it throws off the shackles of the EU, will be free to swoop in and grab the golden eggs from the Irish nest. Apple and Pfizer, Facebook and Google, driven by EU persecution from the emerald isle, will seek asylum in the New Ireland next door, where the writ of the Eurocrats does not run and the government knows how to treat a corporation with the respect it deserves. Could there be any more dramatic illustration of both the evils of the EU and the thrilling possibilities of Brexit?</p> <p>There are, however, two small questions about this strategy. Is it possible? And is it desirable? The answers might perhaps curb the enthusiasm of the true believers.</p> <p>There is, for a start, the small matter of whether, even after the EU tax ruling, Apple wants to leave Ireland for the UK or anywhere else. The answer could hardly be clearer \u2013 it doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>In an interview with Ireland\u2019s national broadcaster RTE, chief executive Tim Cook was full of indignation at the very idea that Apple might have benefited from illegal state aid in the form of a sweetheart tax deal. \u201cWhen you are accused of doing something that\u2019s so foreign to your values, it brings out an outrage in you, that\u2019s how we feel,\u201d he said. He made clear that Apple will appeal against the \u20ac13bn ruling and that it expected the Irish government to do the same. Those listening out for signs of a dismay that might be exploited by post-Brexit Britain will have been encouraged \u2013 up to a point.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"852c75573920644ac34890975c3e497c86169681\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/852c75573920644ac34890975c3e497c86169681/1394_0_2133_2667/800.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple, has said that the company will keep investing in Ireland.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><br>Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple, has said that the company will keep investing in Ireland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And the point at which the encouragement stopped was when Cook discussed Apple\u2019s intentions. What will Apple do in benighted EU-ridden Ireland? Keep investing. He reaffirmed without qualification that Apple was going ahead with a major expansion of its campus in Cork: \u201cWe\u2019re very committed to Ireland, have been for 37 years. We have a long-term romance together.\u201d</p> <p>So why on earth would Apple remain in Ireland instead of taking refuge in the brave new post-Brexit world of low-tax Britain? Partly because tax, even for greedy corporations, isn\u2019t everything. And partly because Apple is smart enough to know that the kind of outrageous dodge that resulted in a tax rate in 2014 for its Irish-based subsidiary of 0.005% is not sustainable \u2013 in Ireland, Britain or any other democratic society.</p> <p>Though market fundamentalists find it hard to believe, even global corporations need social relationships. Will they exploit every possible loophole to maximise their profits? Yes \u2013 ruthlessly and without conscience. But is the ability to dodge tax the sole criterion they apply to their decisions to invest? No. As Cook acknowledged: \u201cWe went into Ireland in 1980. We didn\u2019t go there to seek advantages on taxes \u2013 we had only 60 employees and very little revenue.\u201d</p> <p>This reassurance explains why public and political opinion in Ireland has been more ambivalent about the Apple ruling than the establishment consensus would suggest. The big right-of-centre parties, Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il, have backed Apple to the hilt and tried to rally the public by warning that accepting the unpaid taxes would drive multinational investors away. But most people seem to understand that it\u2019s not so simple. The choice between colluding in morally obnoxious tax avoidance on the one hand and facing economic chaos on the other does not ring true.</p> <p>The Brexiters\u2019 fantasy of stealing Ireland\u2019s corporate investors relies on a deeply patronising attitude to Ireland. Underlying it is the notion that no foreign company would possibly invest in Ireland for any other reason than its lax attitude to taxation. But there are a lot of other reasons \u2013 a highly skilled and productive workforce, cultural vitality, political stability and (oddly enough) membership of the European Union with full access to the world\u2019s biggest single market. The obsession of giant corporations with avoiding tax does not blind them to their need for the social, political and cultural resources on which they draw.</p> <p>This is not just a matter of theory. A crucial point easily lost in the noise of the EU\u2019s Apple ruling is that the regime under which it could avoid so much tax has already changed. The notorious \u201cdouble Irish\u201d strategy used by Apple and other corporations to make themselves stateless for taxation purposes is being dismantled. Market fundamentalists would tell us that corporations will respond to this tightening of the tax regime by fleeing Ireland. Actually, they\u2019ve responded by paying more tax: Ireland took in \u20ac6.9bn in corporation tax last year compared with \u20ac4.6bn in 2014 when the abolition of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/ireland-abolish-double-irish-tax-scheme-apple\" title=\"\">\u201cdouble Irish\u201d</a> was announced.</p> <p>And why was the Irish corporate tax regime made tougher? Not because of the EU but because of an organisation the Brexiters seem not to have heard of: the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). It is the OECD, not the EU, that has driven attempts to clean up the worst excesses of corporate tax avoidance. (One way of seeing the severity of the Apple ruling is as an attempt by the EU to regain the initiative on an issue of such global consequence.)</p> <p>The UK is a member of the OECD and has signed up to these anti-tax avoidance strategies. Unless Britain wants to go completely rogue and leave the OECD as well as the EU, the fantasy of luring companies such as Apple with the virtual impunity from taxation they used to enjoy in Ireland could not be fulfilled.</p> <p>So much for the possibility of becoming the New Ireland \u2013 what about the desirability? Would it be good for Britain if it were to try to emulate Ireland\u2019s strategy of relying on foreign investment and attracting it by becoming, in effect, a tax haven for the largest corporations?</p> <p>The key point about Ireland\u2019s Faustian pact with global corporations is that it was a strategy of desperation. The country sold its soul in the 1960s because it had a stagnant agricultural economy. Indigenous industrial development was slow and weak, Ireland was an economic vassal of the UK and mass emigration was bleeding the country dry. Giving global corporations massive tax breaks wasn\u2019t an ideological principle \u2013 it was a last resort when pretty much everything else had failed.</p> <p>This matters in the British context because it explains why very low corporation taxes could operate in Ireland without creating social conflict. The corporate devil gave the Irish Faust a pretty good price for his soul: a way of moving from backwardness to modernity. But Britain has a radically different economic, social and political history. Transplanting a policy that worked for very specific reasons in Ireland into post-Brexit Britain would show scant regard for the nature of either country.</p> <p>Ireland has had to live with the consequences of its particular choice. One of them is what US economist Paul Krugman recently called <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/752841032870551552\" title=\"\">\u201cleprechaun economics\u201d</a>. Krugman coined the phrase in response to the news that the Irish economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/12/irish-economic-growth-revised-figures-foreign-investment-aircraft\" title=\"\">grew by an incredible 26.3%</a> in 2015. Literally incredible \u2013 the figures are massively inflated by the fiscal juggling of the giant corporations. Irish GDP is meaningless. There is a vast gulf between the real economy and the kind of hyped-up faux-economy you get when you turn your state into a conduit for torrents of funny money. And that hype is not harmless \u2013 the Celtic Tiger bubble was one of its more catastrophic products. It is not accidental that Ireland has the most unequal distribution of market income (before tax and welfare) in the developed world. In effect, there are two Irish economies: the foreign corporate economy that is highly skilled, ultra-globalised and very favourably treated by the state; and a weaker indigenous economy that exists in its shadow. One of the consequences of this extreme inequality of market income is that the state has to do an enormous amount of heavy lifting through the income tax and welfare systems to keep these divisions in check.

And for those things they need big government funded by high taxes \u2013 on somebody&#xa0;else.</p> <p>It is pure delusion to think that the smartest corporations will be drawn to a Britain not only outside the single European market but no longer raising enough tax to invest in its society, services and infrastructure. Ireland is discovering that the game of beggar-my-neighbour tax policies is pretty much up. Inside or outside the EU, Britain will have to join Ireland and the rest of Europe in telling the corporations that, if they want to operate in civilised societies, they have to help pay for them.</p> <p><em>Fintan O\u2019Toole is a columnist with the Irish Times</em></p> <h2>FIAT <br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ec5ae999d94cf80ca7cc8440c0bfa94af7f303fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec5ae999d94cf80ca7cc8440c0bfa94af7f303fd/181_0_4499_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fiat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In 2015 the European commission ruled that the Italian carmaker\u2019s financing company had paid taxes on profits that had been underestimated.

Revered German children\u2019s author Cornelia Funke is best known for her <em>Inkheart</em> (<em>Tintenherz</em>) fantasy trilogy, made into an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsV2Z_il_L4\" title=\"\">English language film in 2008</a>, but her other novels, including <em>The Thief Lord</em>, are also popular. French writer Daniel Pennac, celebrated across the channel, is better appreciated in Britain since his 1984 novel, <em>Eye of the Wolf</em>, was translated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/oct/03/buildingachildrenslibrary.booksforchildrenandteenagers6\" title=\"\">Sarah Ardizzone (n\u00e9e Adams) in 2002</a>, winning her the British Marsh Award for Children\u2019s Literature in Translation.</p> <p>But it can take a while for the British market to catch on. Last week, worldwide fans of German writer Michael Ende\u2019s <em>The Neverending Story</em> marked the story\u2019s 37th birthday, but it wasn\u2019t translated into English until 1983, when it became the basis of a well-loved <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3DcWtkKeIY\" title=\"\">English-language film</a>. <em>The Letter for the King</em>, by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/19/tonke-dragt-interview-i-was-born-a-fairytale-teller-letter-for-the-king\" title=\"\">Dutch author Tonke Dragt</a>, had to wait still longer to reach English readers. It was written more than 50 years ago and has had great success all over Europe, but was only translated into English in 2014.</p> <p>\u201cThe key is getting samples of text translated and then seen and recommended by trusted critics,\u201d said Langley. \u201c[But] you don\u2019t get many British editors who can read well in other languages because of the global dominance of English. In other countries, editors are more likely to read English books.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeFni9dOv7c\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UeFni9dOv7c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The Neverending Story trailer</figcaption> </figure>   <p>For Langley, fostering working relationships with translators is the key to success. \u201cThis is quite a specialist and important part of this kind of publishing, and having the BookTrust grant will be crucial. We are playing a very long game, but this is the first step. If we can get the publishers to read the samples, that is a great thing. Just having them on their desks will make it easier for them because they are now so busy and have so much to read,\u201d she said.</p> <p>While British parents are often happy to accept foreign classics of children\u2019s literature, such as Erich K\u00e4stner\u2019s <em>Emil and the Detectives</em> or Jean de Brunhoff\u2019s <em>Babar the Elephant</em>, they are perhaps unaware that other greats works are out there. The international dominance of JK Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter series could be behind this attitude, although savage cuts in staffing at publishing houses are also to blame. Editors rarely have the resources for a foreign fishing trip.</p> <p>And good foreign books do not have to be classics of the future. An entertaining read also has its place. Norwegian crime writer Jo Nesb\u00f8\u2019s debut children\u2019s book, <em>Doctor Proctor\u2019s Fart Powder</em>, has been a hit. Among those yet to emerge in the English market are the acclaimed works of the late Portuguese poet and novelist Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen, and Swedish author Einar Norelius\u2019s <em>Petter och hans Fyra Getter</em> (<em>Peter and his Four Goats</em>).</p>",
  "<p>For too long, global corporations have been able to use elaborate avoidance mechanisms to get out of paying their fair share of corporate tax. So last week\u2019s ruling from the European commission that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/02/irish-government-appeal-against-apple-13bn-tax-bill-european-commission\" title=\"\">Irish government</a> must recoup \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) in back taxes from Apple should be unreservedly welcomed.</p> <p>Apple, which the European commission revealed paid an effective corporation tax rate of just 0.005% on its European profits in 2014, is far from the only culprit. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/24/amazons-uk-business-paid-119m-tax-last-year\" title=\"\">Amazon paid just \u00a311.9m in tax</a> in the UK by routing its \u00a35.3bn of British sales through its Luxembourg subsidiary. Google similarly paid <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35381130\" title=\"\">just \u00a320.4m tax</a> despite UK sales of \u00a33.8bn in 2013.</p> <p>At the root of the problem is the out-of-date international tax system, developed almost a century ago. Over time, it has become increasingly exploited by multinationals to shift profits to tax havens: in 2012, US multinationals shifted more than <a href=\"http://www.taxjustice.net/scalebeps/\" title=\"\">a quarter of their profits</a> to avoid tax. In the meantime, the share of government revenue from corporation tax has fallen in countries such as the US and the UK.</p> <p>These arrangements may be strictly legal, but they fail basic tests of economic and social justice. The bigger a company, the more aggressive it can be in lobbying tax authorities. In Apple\u2019s case, it struck a deal with the Irish government that allowed it to allocate its European profits to a shell company not registered for tax in any country. This is not only unfair to smaller companies that have to pay tax; it is bad for economic growth, allowing corporate giants to entrench their position, impeding innovation and competition.</p> <p>Tax avoidance breaks a fundamental social contract: companies that draw on public investment in skills and infrastructure to make vast profits should put something back. Why should Amazon make barely any contribution to Treasury coffers while its vans use UK roads and it employs workers whose education was paid for by the British taxpayer? Even worse, these tech giants extract profit without paying tax in some of the world\u2019s poorest countries.</p> <p>The answer ultimately lies in wholesale reform of international tax rules, so that multinationals are obliged to pay tax based on some measure of economic activity in each country, whether sales, employment or assets. But while there have been some fledgling steps in the right direction by the OECD, the body responsible for international tax rules, we remain a long way from such a comprehensive reform. International tax reform remains subject to lobbying by powerful corporate interests, meaning it is proceeding at a glacial pace.</p> <p>The EU has played a more activist role: it was at the forefront of important rule changes that cracked down on global tax avoidance in the late 1990s and the European parliament has consistently pushed for greater transparency. The commission has developed proposals for reforms that would see companies pay tax relative to the level of economic activity in each EU country.</p> <p>Its proposals illustrate how international co-operation can increase a country\u2019s tax sovereignty. By developing international agreement around the principle, companies pay tax on the basis of their economic activity, taxed in a way and at a rate to be determined by national governments; this system avoids countries getting trapped in a race to the bottom on corporation tax. It takes power away from corporations and puts it back in the hands of the nation state.</p> <p>The great irony is that just as the EU is starting to make inroads on this issue, Britain has voted to leave, based on old-fashioned arguments about national sovereignty that make little sense in the modern world. Global challenges such as tax avoidance, climate change and microbial resistance are borderless and cannot be addressed by nations acting alone. In light of this, perhaps it is unsurprising that some of the most vocal proponents of Britain leaving the European Union have argued that the Irish approach of low corporation tax and sweetheart deals could provide <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3766848/Furious-MPs-urge-Theresa-advantage-EU-s-Mugabe-like-Apple-tax-ruling-attracting-tech-giants-Britain-Brexit.html\" title=\"\">a model for the UK economy post-Brexit</a>.</p> <p>Despite George Osborne\u2019s noises about a new \u201cmarch of the makers\u201d, the Irish approach is a direction in which we have been quietly heading for some time. His time at the Treasury was marked by steady cuts to corporation tax \u2013 at great expense \u2013 at the same time as the government cut investment allowances and subsidies for R&amp;D. The government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/31/observer-view-on-corporate-tax-google\" title=\"\">done precious little</a> to pursue tax avoidance domestically and has been a significant block to international tax reform at the OECD and EU. Theresa May and Philip Hammond have done little to signal that they will deviate from this approach.</p> <p>But it is a blind alley for Britain. As Fintan O\u2019Toole argues elsewhere in this newspaper, the Irish approach was a strategy of last resort for a tiny economy in dire straits. It could not work for Britain. No significant economy has achieved growth by slashing corporation tax: countries that have enjoyed the greatest economic success have done so by creating the conditions in which high-growth businesses can flourish, driving innovation and creating jobs. And the world is changing as we move towards greater tax transparency and companies are more aware than ever of the reputational damage of avoiding tax.</p> <p>Moreover, is this really the future we want for British business in a Brexit world? One that is based on attracting corporate giants with accounting fiddles designed to help them cheat not just our near neighbours, but developing countries, out of their fair share of tax. Not to mention cheating Britons and the state by deliberately reducing the amount they pay to the state, money that will be lost to our roads, schools, hospitals. As O\u2019Toole makes clear, in an age of inequality and financial uncertainty, this approach is not tenable. We are witnessing a rise in populist anger precisely because \u201celites\u201d are seen to be playing by different rules. Fairness is at the heart of a stable society. It is not at the heart of Apple\u2019s tax deal in Ireland.</p>",
  "<p>Theresa May will tell the leaders of the world\u2019s most powerful economies that the United Kingdom wants to strengthen its economic ties with countries beyond the European Union, as she lays out her vision of a post-Brexit Britain at her first big international summit as prime minister.</p> <p>Attending the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/03/theresa-may-nuclear-row-xi-jinping-china-uk-relations-g20-summit\"> G20 meeting in Hangzhou, China, </a>May will address the opening session saying that, as the UK heads out of the EU, it remains \u201copen for business\u201d and is seeking to build new and stronger trade relations with countries across the globe.</p> <p>But diplomats past and present warned that she faces a huge test as a novice on the world stage, and will have to perform a delicate balancing act as she seeks to sell the UK to global leaders, while avoiding giving the impression that Britain is about to become a marginal player on the European stage.</p> <p>In a sign of her determination to show that the UK is embarking on a new phase in its diplomatic and economic relations, May will hold four bilateral meetings with the leaders of the US, China, Russia and India, but none with EU leaders.</p> <p>British officials have denied that she is cold-shouldering the Europeans, and stressed that since becoming prime minister she has already met the leaders of France and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jul/20/germany-uk-brexit-theresa-may-angela-merkel-politics-live\">Germany</a> to address the challenges of Brexit. The G20, they said, is her chance to convince other world leaders that the UK is a \u201cdependable\u201d partner which will \u201ccontinue to play a bold confident and outward-looking role as it leaves the EU\u201d.</p> <p>Speaking on BBC1\u2019s <em>The Andrew Marr Show</em> on Sunday morning, recorded before she left for the G20, May said the economic figures were not as bad as some had predicted after the EU referendum vote. \u201cWhat is important for us now is that we maintain that policy of ensuring economic stability and a strong economy for the future. Part of that is going to be, as we come out of the European Union, ensuring we\u2019ve got trade deals around the world. I want the United Kingdom to be a global leader in free trade.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things I\u2019ll be doing at the G20 is emphasising the role that we will be playing in the world, but also in a number of the discussions I\u2019ll be having, with President Obama, for example, prime minister Modi, prime minister Turnbull \u2026 \u201d</p> <p>A bilateral meeting with President Xi Jinping of China, after the official summit proceedings close on Monday, will arguably be May\u2019s sternest test. Her decision, shortly after entering Downing Street, to delay a go-ahead for the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Somerset, on which China has committed to spend billions of pounds, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/03/hinkley-point-c-theresa-may-china-g20-summit\">has severely strained relations with Bejing</a>.</p> <p>The former UK foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind told the <em>Observer</em> that the G20\u2019s Chinese hosts would be \u201csurprised and puzzled\u201d by the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU, but would probably be more attentive to May as a result. \u201cAlthough they will think that we are slightly barking for wanting to leave the EU, they will in some way see us as more interesting and needing more of their attention. We will be the second biggest economy in Europe, a permanent member of the UN security council, and a strong military power with the willingness to use that power.\u201d</p> <p>However, Rifkind said the Hinkley Point issue would hover over the summit. \u201cWhatever the wider and longer-term issues, Hinkley is the immediate test. The Chinese president and UK prime minister will be sizing each other up. Hinkley Point is directly relevant to China\u2019s global economic ambitions.</p> <p>\u201cIf we drop Hinkley Point, and even if we stress that this is for economic reasons alone, the Chinese will see it as a major defeat for their ambitions. We will be seen as joining with the US and Australia in rejecting China as a partner, and that will not be helpful for relations. This may be the right decision for the UK to take, but there will be a price to pay.\u201d</p> <p>May told Marr: \u201cI\u2019m looking at the Hinkley decision, but it\u2019s about how I actually approach these things. I look at the evidence, I take the advice, I listen to that. That\u2019s what I\u2019m still doing. I\u2019ve said there\u2019ll be a decision in September.\u201d</p> <p>Lord Wood of Anfield, a former senior adviser to Gordon Brown, said May would be thrown in at the deep end of international diplomacy at a crucial moment in the UK\u2019s history. There was a risk of being seen as a bit player in Europe.</p> <p>\u201cTheresa May has a tricky combination of challenges this week. In the wake of Brexit, she has to show that Britain\u2019s relationship with Germany, France and Italy is not suffering,\u201d Wood said. \u201cShe has to show that European \u2018caucusing\u2019 prior to and during the G20 is still alive and well. Any hint of Franco-German-Italian cosiness that excludes her risks suggesting we are on the way to becoming a second-tier G20 country. She will also need to consider the appropriate mixture of robustness and conciliation to adopt in her dealings with Vladimir Putin.\u201d</p> <p>On her meeting with Barack Obama, Wood added: \u201cShe will have to show that Britain still matters to an outgoing president who has been increasingly speaking his mind, and whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/22/barack-obama-brexit-uk-back-of-queue-for-trade-talks\">advice on Brexit</a> was conspicuously rejected by the British electorate.\u201d</p> <p>Before boarding her plane for China, May insisted that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/16/theresa-may-writes-letter-reassurance-chinese-president-xi-jinping-hinkley-point-c\">UK-China relations have a bright future</a>. \u201cThis is a golden era for UK-China relations, and one of the things I\u2019ll be doing at the G20 is obviously talking to President Xi about how we can develop the strategic partnership that we have between the UK and China. But I\u2019ll also be talking to other world leaders about how we can develop free trade around the globe and how Britain wants to seize those opportunities.\u201d</p> <p>Global security and the fight against terrorism will also be high on the prime minister\u2019s agenda.</p> <p>Margaret Thatcher\u2019s former foreign policy adviser Lord Powell of Bayswater said he expected May to approach the G20 in a much more cautious manner than his former boss, who would have piled in with her demands and views. May would be more concerned with \u201csignals\u201d than substance.</p> <p>\u201cIn one day to be seeing Obama, Putin, and Xi Jinping is quite a scorecard.

George Osborne, the then chancellor, talked of the UK being China\u2019s \u201cbest partner in the west\u201d and of a golden era of British-Chinese relations. Now, with Britain heading out of the EU and doubts over whether Theresa May will go ahead with the Hinkley Point C nuclear power project, into which China has agreed to pump billions of pounds, relations are tense. China has already made clear that it would regard abandonment of the project as a snub. After the summit, May will have a bilateral meeting with Xi at which she will make clear that the decision will be for the British government alone. Xi will view the eventual decision by the prime minister later this month as a test of how dependable the UK is and of its wider willingness to be a partner in China\u2019s developing global economic ambitions.</p> <h2>Vladimir Putin <br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"576f71e84656cb7e8f0a16a615e1359044999b81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/576f71e84656cb7e8f0a16a615e1359044999b81/0_79_3216_1930/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vladimir Putin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vladimir Putin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>May will have a bilateral meeting with Putin on Sunday at which difficult security issues, including Russia\u2019s role in Syria and actions in Ukraine will be raised. The Russian president is almost certainly the only G20 leader who will have welcomed and seen overall benefits for his country from Britain\u2019s intended departure from the EU. Russia sees it as a sign that the bloc on his doorstep is no longer such a cohesive force and threat to his interests. Putin will also see potential for closer economic ties with the UK and may be looking for indications that the EU\u2019s resolve behind sanctions against Russia will now weaken. But May will not want to risk angering the US or her EU counterparts, with whom she must negotiate Brexit, by cuddling up too much to Moscow.</p> <h2>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7293fdbb35d02a48b85cb44ee5b10f991049b971\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7293fdbb35d02a48b85cb44ee5b10f991049b971/0_113_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Francois Hollande.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With Hollande facing presidential elections next year, he is sending a tough message to the British prime minister about future relations with Europe. France is adamant that the UK cannot expect special favours from the European Union - in terms of an exit deal - that undermines the founding principles of the EU. Hollande fears that this would merely encourage backing for anti-EU campaigner Marine Le Pen and the Front National, who will say that the French would also be better off out of the EU. France\u2019s Socialist president\u2019s message will be that there is a stiff price to pay for Brexit. Concerns over immigration and the future role of UK border guards in Calais may also be discussed.</p> <h2>RELATIONSHIPS TO WORK ON<br></h2> <h2>Angela Merkel<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"74c1a4ae0a67673acda9194db8df6d5718bcec67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74c1a4ae0a67673acda9194db8df6d5718bcec67/419_436_1243_746/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Merkel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angela Merkel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Theresa May has already been to Berlin for a meeting with Merkel since becoming prime minister and relations between Europe\u2019s two most powerful women were reasonably warm. No bilateral has been planned for the G20, however, signalling the UK\u2019s wider ambitions post-Brexit. As the EU\u2019s power broker, the German chancellor, who like Hollande is facing elections next year, has a balance to strike between remaining close to the UK while preserving the EU intact. Germany fears that the UK will try to bolster its economy post-Brexit by trying to lure in foreign investment through low corporate and other taxes. Berlin wants to make clear that if this is the route it chooses then its access to the EU single market, particularly for the sale of financial services, which represent more than 10% of the UK economy, will not be possible.</p> <h2>King Salman<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1f70c56948aa91e11a1947a5e6e4af87e22da61e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f70c56948aa91e11a1947a5e6e4af87e22da61e/1080_279_545_327/500.jpg\" alt=\"King Salman.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">King Salman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Saudi Arabia has spent \u00a33bn on arms from the UK since the start of 2015, with critics voicing concerns that weapons may have been used against civilian targets in Yemen.

India is an obvious choice for trade talks, with its huge developing markets. Modi will have his own concerns, however, about UK plans to tighten border controls and curb immigration, and will want reassurance that there will be continued access for skilled workers and students from his country into the UK.</p> <h2>SPECIAL FRIENDS<br></h2> <h2>Barack Obama<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f846dc0e871d981a8b2106593908855a47d8d61d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f846dc0e871d981a8b2106593908855a47d8d61d/796_509_2492_1495/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>May has a bilateral meeting with Obama early on Sunday. The American president will want to sound out the new British prime minister about Brexit and what it means for the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d. The US always valued the UK as a route through which to convey its views to Europe, and is fearful of Brexit. It is also concerned that with the UK outside, EU support for sanctions against Russia over Ukraine will weaken. Obama said before the Brexit vote that the UK would go \u201cto the back of the queue\u201d in trade talks if it left the bloc. With the impending likely collapse of the US-EU Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, however, could there be more of an opportunity now for the UK to jump to the front of the list of countries seeking bespoke deals with Washington?</p> <h2>Justin Trudeau <br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1c288ea9f22c3e16cf2dd3e6bf65df82f57af864\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c288ea9f22c3e16cf2dd3e6bf65df82f57af864/536_615_1808_1085/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Trudeau.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Justin Trudeau.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There has been much talk of the UK, after Brexit, striking a trade deal with the EU similar to the one Canada is finalising with Brussels after years of intensive and difficult negotiation. The Canadian prime minister and May will no doubt exchange notes on how possible and desirable a similar arrangement will be for the UK, and how they could work together on the shape of future world trade. One problem is that Canada\u2019s deal does not cover financial services, which contributed \u00a3126.9bn in gross value added to the UK economy in 2014. So the Canada model is no panacea. It has also taken almost a decade to strike and has yet to come into force.</p> <h2>Malcolm Turnbull</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"92e06972457c8f1f07f5fcc71bb6146ef35748f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92e06972457c8f1f07f5fcc71bb6146ef35748f8/819_294_1957_1174/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malcolm Turnbull.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malcolm Turnbull.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Australia has already called for a free trade deal with Britain following its exit from the EU \u2013 a move that May described as \u201cvery encouraging\u201d.

The Australian prime minister said he urgently wanted to open up trading between the two countries as soon as possible, and the G20 meeting will be a good opportunity to reaffirm their joint interests. While trade with Australia will not replace access to the single market, it will be a sign of the British willingness to look far and wide as it seeks new trade arrangements across the globe.</p>",
  "<p>Jonathan Ford pulls up a chair at the Football Association of Wales headquarters in Cardiff and, with a smile, says that all talk of France has been banned. For Wales, it is about looking to the future rather than basking in the past, yet nobody wants to leave behind the memories of Euro 2016, including the chief executive. \u201cA week after the homecoming I took the family on a driving holiday \u2013 through France,\u201d says Ford, laughing.</p> <p>Ford has plenty to be happy about. The national association has never been in a better state of health on and off the pitch. Optimism abounds on the back of those wonderful results in the summer, the FAW\u2019s turnover has more than doubled and there is something special about the relationship between the Wales supporters and the national team, as well as the bond among the players. From a football perspective, it feels as though the nation has come together.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/02/wales-chris-gunter-world-cup-2018-qualifying-moldova\">Wales\u2019 Chris Gunter: We will give everything to replicate Euro 2016 run</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe factors that define the Welsh identity are driven by two key things, one of them is culture and the other is sport. That is a fundamental thing that we\u2019re able to tap into,\u201d Ford says. \u201cIt was brought to life in France by people like Gareth Bale \u2013 we didn\u2019t tell Gareth to say: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/10/gareth-bale-wales-pride-england-slovakia-euro-2016-real-madrid\" title=\"\">\u2018We have more passion, we play with more pride than England,\u2019</a> but it tapped beautifully into what we\u2019re all about, from the dragon to <em>Gorau Chwarae Cyd Chwarae</em> [Team Play is the Best Play] on the badge. That was also a major shift within the player group mentality, to get them to galvanise people.</p> <p>\u201cThose players would run through walls for Wales. When they were leaving each other after France there were tears because they\u2019d been with each other for 46 days. You see the players arriving back into camp the other day and they were reporting too early because they can\u2019t wait to get with their mates.\u201d</p> <p>For Ford, it was vital that the man who has harnessed that spirit and camaraderie to such positive effect remained at the helm to oversee the World Cup qualifying campaign, which begins against Moldova in Cardiff . Chris Coleman has rebuilt his managerial reputation with Wales and the FAW <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/02/hull-city-approach-chris-coleman-rejected-welsh-fa\" title=\"\">had no intention of granting Hull City permission to speak to the 46-year\u2011old</a> when the Premier League club approached them last month.</p> <p>\u201cChris\u2019s profile was fantastic before France and it was raised even more so after, so understandably people did come knocking,\u201d Ford says. \u201cWhen the call came [from Hull], I spoke with the president and with others, and at that time we were left with the only option available to us.</p> <p>\u201cIt would have caused us an awful lot of problems to lose the national team manager four weeks before the team\u2019s first match and that was something that we weren\u2019t prepared to entertain, so we expected the contract to be honoured and denied them the opportunity to engage, because saying: \u2018Yes, you can talk\u2019, means \u2018Yes, you can go.\u2019 And we weren\u2019t prepared to do that. Chris could still break a contract, but there are consequences to that.</p> <p>\u201cHull have started OK. But they\u2019ve got a lot of problems. They were struggling with the squad that they had \u2013 they\u2019ve brought a few players in now. My prediction would still be that they\u2019re odds-on favourites to be in the relegation zone \u2013 we\u2019ll see on that. But I think Chris could do better than Hull.\u201d</p> <p>As for Ford\u2019s own career, he is entitled to feel a sense of satisfaction when he reflects on how far the FAW have come since his appointment in December 2009. He was 39 at the time and joining an organisation that needed to be dragged into the 21st century. \u201cCredit to the FAW council, they knew that they needed someone who was going to shake the cage and modernise the association,\u201d says Ford, who had spent the best part of a decade working for Coca-Cola and came from a marketing background.</p> <p>\u201cThe strategic plan I inherited, which was the first the FAW had written, wasn\u2019t even written by my predecessor, or by the people within the organisation. He got his predecessor to write it. It was rubbish and it was collecting dust. And they did it because they were forced to do it by the Welsh government and Sport Wales. We fundamentally changed all that. Look at the organisation now \u2013 we\u2019re a much younger, dynamic, culturally different organisation to what we were previously.\u201d</p> <p>Ford acknowledges that it has not been an easy journey. \u201cThere are times, like when you have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/nov/27/gary-speed-death-shay-given\" title=\"\">a tragedy like Gary Speed</a> or, on a very different note, when you come away from Serbia with a scoreline like we did [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/11/wales-serbia-world-cup-qualifier-report\" title=\"\">Wales lost 6-1 in 2012</a>], when you think: \u2018Oh my God, am I going to make it?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Step by step, though, everything has come together in what Ford describes as a purple patch for Welsh football. Reaching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/06/portugal-wales-euro-2016-match-report\" title=\"\">the semi-finals of Euro 2016 </a>surpassed all expectations and also vindicated Ford\u2019s decision to push the FAW council to invest every penny of the \u00a36.4m tournament participation fee before a ball had been kicked, to create an environment that gave the players the best chance of making things succeed in France.</p> <p>No stone will be left unturned in this campaign, yet Ford is not getting carried away and viewing qualification for the World Cup, from a group that includes Serbia, Austria and the Republic of Ireland, as straightforward. \u201cIn my mind we do need a good start. But we do need to be careful,\u201d he says. \u201cExpectations need to be managed in and around the camp. Just one Euro success, which was fantastic, cannot be taken as \u2018we should expect\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Although Wales will play the first three qualification home matches at the Cardiff City Stadium, the venue for the Austria and Republic of Ireland fixtures has yet to be confirmed and raises the question of whether the FAW are considering taking those games to the much larger Principality Stadium, where they have not played since 2011.</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t made the decision yet,\u201d Ford says. \u201cWhat we will do is play a match where we think we can get the points. I suppose the question comes: \u2018What happens if you don\u2019t need the points at the end?\u2019 If we have already sailed through and qualified, which would be a dream come true, you\u2019d probably want to milk that last game against the Republic of Ireland and go there [to the Principality Stadium].</p> <p>\u201cYou could also turn it around the other way, so that if we\u2019ve got no chance of qualifying and the Republic of Ireland have, then you would take it to the Principality Stadium, which is not necessarily the right thing to do other than on a monetary basis. If we\u2019re both in contention, we\u2019ll take it to the stadium where we\u2019ve got most chance of winning and, atmospherically, that will probably be the Cardiff City Stadium.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever happens over the course of the next 12 months or so, Ford is determined that Wales keep pushing on. \u201cThere\u2019s no sitting back and resting on our laurels, saying France was fantastic,\u201d he says. \u201cWe cannot assume that because we were successful we\u2019ll be successful again \u2013 Chris and I are absolutely aligned on that. It\u2019s all about what more we can do to take it to the next level.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Dai Young is delighted to have been sent to Coventry. As the Wasps director of rugby reflects on a new season in which his team is regarded as a major contender, before Sunday\u2019s match against Exeter, the team that pipped them to second place in the Premiership table last season <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/premiership-play-off-exeter-chiefs-wasps-match-report-rugby-union\">and then knocked them out of the play-offs</a>, the state of the club when he arrived in 2011 seems a distant nightmare.</p> <p>Young joined from Cardiff Blues, where he had spent eight years, guiding the region to a European Cup semi\u2011final and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/may/23/cardiff-toulon-amlin-challenge-cup\">European Challenge Cup final two years later in 2010 when they defeated Toulon</a>. As the recession hit Welsh rugby, so spending was cut but he joined a Premiership club that was even more hard up, struggling to pay bills and wages, and found himself locked in a relegation scrap.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/03/northampton-saints-bath-rugby-union-premiership-match-report\">Bath and George Ford\u2019s boot too much for Northampton\u2019s damp comeback</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt is a much more pleasant environment here now,\u201d says the former Wales and Lions captain. \u201cEverything is far more positive on and off the field. That brings different pressures but I would much rather be in the situation I am in now than a few seasons ago when you wondered whether you would get paid or have a job the following week.</p> <p>\u201cThe first couple of years at Wasps were tough. We were fighting relegation as well after a load of retirements and injuries and had to play guys from the under-20s. We should have gone down (in 2012 when they finished one point above relegated Newcastle). That would have been it for the club because we did not have a buyer on the horizon and did not have any assets, no ground or training facilities. I believe keeping us up was my best achievement as a coach. Newcastle went down but they were a better team than us. We found a way of staying up and it was remarkable.\u201d</p> <p>Wasps then played at Adams Park, the home of Wycombe Wanderers. The only income they generated from the ground was on match days, and then nowhere near enough as they built up a debt in millions with no means to repay it. In 2014 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/dec/19/wasps-ricoh-arena-rugby-london-irish-27000-crowd\">they moved to Coventry</a>, quickly taking full control of the Ricoh Arena and gaining an asset that has allowed them to sign leading players from abroad: George Smith and Charles Piutau last season, Willie Le Roux and Kurtley Beale in this one, although their debuts will be delayed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/03/saracens-worcester-premiership-rugby-union-match-report\">Schalk Burger scores on Saracens debut in Twickenham win over Worcester</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhere we are now is completely different from a few years ago but we can only spend the same as everyone else. It does not matter how much money you have; you can only go to the level of the salary cap. We lost Charles Piutau and signed Willie Le Roux, which is where you want to be. What I want as a coach is two quality players in each position and the prospect of putting combinations together is mouthwatering when you consider the players we will have to choose from behind, with the likes of Le Roux, Beale, Danny Cipriani, Kyle Eastmond, Elliot Daly, Christian Wade, Frank Halai and Jimmy Gopperth in the squad.</p> <p>\u201cWe are a long way off getting things all together but players will be putting pressure on each other and I will be able to rotate the squad so that nobody plays too many games. It will be after Christmas when we see everyone firing and, while we have signed players of top quality from overseas, having a strong English contingent is important to me: I was delighted to recruit Kyle, even though he was not a planned signing. We had a few injury problems and, when he became available, we jumped in quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Exeter will present a high opening hurdle. The two sides met five times last season and Wasps\u2019 sole victory was at the Ricoh in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/09/wasps-exeter-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report\">European Champions Cup quarter-final</a>, and that was through a last-minute try. The Chiefs largely thwarted Wasps\u2019 threat in broken play by keeping it tight and using penalties to force driving lineouts in attacking territory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/03/harlequins-bristol-rugby-union-premiership-match-report\">Nick Evans\u2019 cool head sees Harlequins sneak past Bristol at Twickenham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe over-exceeded last year without a doubt,\u201d said Young. \u201cNo pundits tipped us to be anywhere near the play-offs and my focus remains on ensuring that season after season we are in the top six. We have not achieved that much in the last 10 years. We have to be like Leicester, Saracens and Northampton, always there and playing consistently at European rugby\u2019s top table. Of course we want to push for the top four and to win things, but if you offered me winning something this season and then being out of the top six for the next four or being in the top six for the next five, I would take the latter.</p> <p>\u201cWe learned a lot from the two semi-final defeats, to Exeter and Saracens in the Champions Cup.

They thought they would be kidnapped,\u201d says Eugenio Cusumano, of Leiden University in the Netherlands, who is doing research on migrant rescues. \u201cThey did shoot at the decks; they could have killed people.\u201d</p> <p>The Libyan navy said that it intercepted the boat when checking for illegal petrol smuggling, and insists that any bullet strikes (MSF say 13 hit the bridge and wheelhouse) were accidental. The charity condemned the attack, saying: \u201cThis was a serious and worrying attack, with shooting towards our boat which could have put our staff in acute physical danger.\u201d</p> <p>It is not the first time Libya\u2019s navy has threatened rescue boats. In April, warning shots were fired prior to the boarding of a vessel from the German charity Sea Watch. \u201cThey fired shots in the air and entered our ship. They claimed to be looking for illegal fishing,\u201d says Sea Watch\u2019s Ruben Neugebauer.</p> <p>Rescue ships from nine aid groups operating off Libya are already at full stretch. A deal cut in the spring between the EU and Turkey has blocked the route to Europe used by 900,000 migrants last year. As a result, smuggling gangs have switched gear, channelling Middle Eastern migrants through Libya to join the growing number of Africans making the same journey. \u201cThe Turkey deal was done in March, it takes some time to change routes, but this is changing right now,\u201d says Neugebauer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don't want to pick people out of the water while a naval vessel is there with all guns blazing</p> <footer> <cite>Peter Sweetnam, MOAS</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is apprehension among the rescue crews about the coming armed intervention by combined EU navies, authorised last week by Brussels. Some fear they will be caught in the crossfire. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to pick people out of the water while a naval vessel is there with all guns blazing,\u201d says Peter Sweetnam, chief executive of Malta-based <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jul/16/couple-launch-mediterranean-migrant-search-project\" title=\"\">Migrant Offshore Aid Station</a>.</p> <p>Speaking from the deck of his rescue ship, Phoenix, Sweetnam says charity boats are already working flat out, with smugglers sending people to sea in wooden hulks, inflatable rafts and anything that floats. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 414 survivors on board at the moment, and we helped rescue more than 1,000 in the past two days. After the MSF attack, we improved our communications; it\u2019s a reminder of the element we are working in,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The growth of the flotilla of rescue ships from charities across Europe has seen tens of thousands saved from drowning, but the August attack has put a question mark over how long unprotected vessels can continue operating. \u201cIf the security situation deteriorates further, I don\u2019t think the small NGOs can continue,\u201d says Cusumano. \u201cAs for the bigger boats, these boats are chartered. They belong to a ship owner; I can imagine the ship owners pulling out.\u201d</p> <p>For the crews of the rescue ships, the fear of kidnap sits alongside anxiety that Italy, recipient of 100,000 migrants so far this year, may refuse to take the people they rescue, since few other EU states are willing to take their share of new arrivals. North African states are equally unwilling to help, leaving the rescuers wondering if they will one day run out of ports willing to take saved migrants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3225be420fd6e395284f2759b8079a2f06d4d866\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3225be420fd6e395284f2759b8079a2f06d4d866/0_82_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charity worker and migrant child\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Italian Red Cross worker helps a migrant child after the MOAS charity rescued 304 people in one operation last month</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yara Nardi / Italian Red Cross/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is unease among charities about asking for protection from the growing number of foreign warships. NGOs fear their independence would be compromised by seeking naval protection, and that protection would require them to operate farther from the coast, leaving many migrant boats to founder.</p> <p>Yet there is no sign of an end to the human exodus. Libya\u2019s UN-backed government, unelected and lacking popular support, has no security force of its own or the means to police the militias, for whom migrant smuggling is big business. Operation Sophia estimates the income to the militias from this migration at more than \u00a3200m a year, strengthening their hand.</p> <p>There are bright spots, with foreign crews highlighting the help from Libya\u2019s coastguard, a separate service from the navy, in joint rescues, and Brussels has announced it will begin training its units. The bigger problem highlighted by charity crews, many having worked off Libya for two years, is the lack of a political solution to the crisis, with European states unwilling to open their doors to legal mass migration.</p> <p>\u201cThis could all be solved if the EU could give migrants procedures,\u201d says Neugebauer. \u201cThis is a political problem, it\u2019s absolutely man-made.

  "<p>Apart from crags and pockets of ancient woodland, the British uplands are manmade. Three thousand years before Christ, neolithic farmers felled the trees and gave us a landscape stripped to grassland by grazing sheep we take as \u201cnatural\u201d today. Two thousand years after Christ, new forces are moulding the British uplands. They will bring back at least a part of what stone age men destroyed.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to believe in an unequal country, where wealth and land are so unevenly distributed, but the ecology of the hills depends on popular approval. When public opinion moves, the hills move with it. However solid their drystone walls are, they will not be strong enough to hold back political change, climate change and changes in fashion, which affect the countryside as surely as they affect clothes and music.</p> <p>The sale of <a href=\"https://www.fwi.co.uk/news/national-trust-farm-purchase-a-disaster-for-herdwick-sheep-farming.htm\" title=\"\">Thorneythwaite</a>, a sheep farm near the head of Borrowdale, encapsulates the coming revolution. If you don\u2019t know Borrowdale, you should. To my mind, it is the most beautiful valley in England. Thorneythwaite is high up the river Derwent, almost at the end of the metalled road, and overlooks the route to Scafell Pike. The National Trust bought it last week with an astonishingly high bid of \u00a3950,000, \u00a3200,000 above the guide price and \u00a3450,000 above what farmers could match</p> <p>Local opinion was scandalised. The great Cumbrian Melvyn Bragg <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-37219512\" title=\"\">said</a> that had a billionaire bullied his way to \u201cthis disgraceful purchase\u201d, as the trust had done there, would have been \u201ca deserved outcry\u201d. James Rebanks, the Lakeland author of the wonderful <em>The Shepherd\u2019s Life</em>, said the trust should be protecting hill farmers, not gazumping them.</p> <p>I spent my childhood holidays on a Cumbrian sheep farm and would once have defended Bragg and Rebanks with all my heart. But although I feel like a traitor, I can see good reasons for saying not just that their opponents will win, but that they should win.</p> <p>The inability of farmers to meet the guide price for Thorneythwaite will only grow. Of all the consequences of Brexit, the cutting of agricultural subsidies is the easiest to predict. Farmers who voted leave \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.fwi.co.uk/news/exclusive-survey-reveals-farmers-back-eu-exit.htm\" title=\"\">58%</a> according to one survey \u2013 astonished friends of mine who campaigned for remain in rural Britain. What turnip truck had these yokels fallen off? When the promise to maintain common agricultural policy subsidies runs out in 2020, parliament will not continue to pump public money to farmers. Free-market conservatives do not believe in state subsidies. As for centre-left politicians, can you imagine them putting farmers before the NHS?</p> <p>Before the vote to leave the EU, farm subsidies were almost beyond political debate. Now we are heading for the exit, they will be open to negotiation. British farmers <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk\" title=\"\">receive up to 60%</a> of their income from EU subsidies. Hill farmers are the most dependent of all. If they are to continue to take public money, they will have to do what the public wants and raising sheep will not be enough.</p> <p>The most telling point about the trust\u2019s intervention is that it did not buy the Thorneythwaite farmhouse. Rather, it wanted to transform the hills sheep have stripped of all except a few pockets of woodland. The trust will replace the monoculture with \u201chealthy soil, natural water management and thriving natural habitats\u201d. Following a succession of floods, the trust will also \u201cexplore\u201d whether tree planning can \u201cslow the flow of the upper river Derwent\u201d and help prevent flooding downstream in Keswick and Cockermouth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90229be1d9973d72ac7507e89753602fd3e887bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90229be1d9973d72ac7507e89753602fd3e887bd/0_168_3289_1974/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The aftermath of flooding in Keswick in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The aftermath of flooding in Keswick in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A writer in the <em>Spectator</em>, who accused the trust of wanting to turn the Lake District into <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/08/national-trust-mission-disney-fy-britain/\" title=\"\">Disneyland,</a> could not have been more wrong. Keswick and Cockermouth have been flooded repeatedly. Flood defences are unable to spare them as global warming intensifies. The same is true for Scottish, Lancashire and Yorkshire towns downstream of the Highlands and Pennines. A part of the answer is to expel sheep and plant trees that might hold up the water on their old grazing lands. You don\u2019t need to cloak the landscape, just to forest about <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-35777927\" title=\"\">20%</a> of the hills to slow run off and create natural dams in mountain streams. It\u2019s not that sheep farming cannot coexist with flood management, but it will have to be restricted. The monoculture of the uplands must change, in other words, and the public, whose representatives will soon have exclusive power to decide agricultural policy and whose taxes will keep the farmer in business, will want it to change.</p> <p>Before the Romantic movement, most saw the Highlands as wastelands. Our love for them is a result of the romantic reaction against the Industrial Revolution, which in turn produced its own revolution in sensibility. Another revolution is upon us.

  "<p>Indigenous peoples in Peru are demanding to be consulted about a proposed electricity transmission line that would run for approximately 586 kms through the Amazon. The stated aim of the line is to connect Iquitos in Peru\u2019s northeast, often described as the world\u2019s largest city or town without road or rail access, to the national grid.</p> <p>Doing so would mean crossing the territories of numerous indigenous peoples, including the Achuars, Kandozis, Kichwas, Kukamas-Kukamirias and Urarinas. Representative organisations are expressing serious concern about the project\u2019s potential impacts and say they have not been consulted about it despite the government\u2019s obligation to do so under Peruvian and international law. </p> <p>The proposed line would also run through the Abanico del Rio Pastaza, a huge wetlands complex stretching across the border into Ecuador. In 2002 3.8 million hectares of the Abanico were declared a Wetland of International Importance, or Ramsar Site, under the Ramsar Convention, making it the largest Ramsar Site in Latin America and the eighth largest worldwide out of a total of 2,241.</p> <p>According to ORPIO, an Iquitos-based federation representing 15 indigenous peoples, the potential impacts of the line include the destruction of 874,000 tonnes of trees, the release of 424,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, massive biodiversity and game loss, conflict, the resettlement of indigenous communities, and encouraging the entrance of colonists, illegal loggers, gold-miners and coca farmers.</p> <p>ORPIO is taking legal action against the Energy Ministry (MINEM) and government agency ProInversion in an attempt to suspend construction of the line, filing a lawsuit in Iquitos arguing they have not been consulted about it.</p> <p>\u201cWe urge that our request for prior consultation, according to the International Labour Organization\u2019s Convention 169 and other current national and international legislation, is respected, given that the Moyobamba-\u00ccquitos Transmission Line will directly affect our rights,\u201d ORPIO wrote to MINEM in August.</p> <p>CORPI, a federation representing nine indigenous peoples, is also demanding that the right to prior consultation, as the process is termed in Peruvian law, is respected. </p> <p>\u201c[The proposed transmission line] directly affects [indigenous peoples\u2019] collective rights and will impact their access to their subsistence resources and therefore threatens their physical existence, cultural identity, quality of life and spiritual links with the land they have occupied ancestrally,\u201d read a CORPI statement released in February.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4155322fefdb084eb3170c651422912837eb99e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4155322fefdb084eb3170c651422912837eb99e0/0_0_2091_2570/814.jpg\" alt=\"A Kichwa woman from the River Tigre, Peru, demanding in 2015 to be consulted about oil operations.

Indigenous people are now requesting to be consulted about the proposed Moyobamba-Iquitos electricity line.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Hill</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, MINEM argues that a loophole in a 2012 Peruvian law makes it exempt from doing prior consultation on this occasion. The law states that the \u201cconstruction and maintenance of public service infrastructure\u201d doesn\u2019t require prior consultation if \u201cit is intended to benefit\u201d and is done \u201cin coordination\u201d with indigenous peoples - and since the proposed transmission line is a \u201cpublic service\u201d and \u201cwould benefit indigenous populations in the project\u2019s area of influence\u201d, MINEM claims no consultation is necessary.</p> <p>That argument has been dismissed by Peru\u2019s state ombudsman, the Defensoria del Pueblo, which recommended, on 20 May, that MINEM carry out prior consultation. It claims that the legal loophole isn\u2019t applicable in this case because, among other reasons, the proposed line will <em>not</em> directly benefit the indigenous peoples living in the region. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the population of Iquitos that will be the beneficiary of this project, while the indigenous territories will just be an area through which the transmission line will pass,\u201d the Defensoria\u2019s Daniel Sanchez wrote to MINEM.</p> <p>MINEM\u2019s response to Sanchez, in August, was that indigenous organizations could have appealed its initial decision to forgo prior consultation, made in October 2015, but didn\u2019t do so. It also argued that its interpretation of the 2012 law is in line with that of the Culture Ministry (MINCU), the ministry responsible for indigenous peoples which - conveniently - issued its own interpretation of the loophole in the 2012 law just seven days after Sanchez wrote to MINEM in May.</p> <p>To the Guardian Sanchez described MINEM\u2019s interpretation of the law as \u201cloose and wrong\u201d, \u201cperverting\u201d the right to prior consultation and making the process meaningless. </p> <p>\u201cPrior consultation emerged as a way of promoting indigenous peoples\u2019 participation in projects affecting them [but] I think that a certain sector within MINEM still sees it as an obstacle,\u201d Sanchez says. \u201cSo they\u2019re opposed to its implementation. This is counter-productive because it has been shown that what indigenous peoples want is to be taken into account, to influence and above all to participate in decision-making. Of the 17 extractive projects - hydrocarbons, mining and infrastructure - that have been subject to prior consultation to date, not one of them has been opposed by indigenous representatives.\u201d</p> <p>The opinion that indigenous peoples have the right to prior consultation about the proposed line is shared by lawyer Henry Carhuatocto from NGO IDLADS, which is supporting ORPIO in making its demands heard by the government and media. Carhuatocto calls MINEM\u2019s argument \u201cfrankly lamentable\u201d and agrees the line will not directly benefit indigenous peoples but will instead mean clearing almost 600 kms of forest and indirectly facilitate \u201cinvaders and colonists.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFirst, we need to make it clear that any legislative or administrative measure affecting the lives of indigenous peoples must be subject to prior consultation,\u201d Carhuatocto told the Guardian. \u201cSecond, prior consultation is not an obstacle to economic development, but a space to comply with human rights agreements and an opportunity for the state to take more of an interest in indigenous peoples, to be able to discuss the impacts of the project with them, to reach agreements in good faith, and for them to give their consent. This is an opportunity for the state to do things right by indigenous peoples and we hope that in this instance it doesn\u2019t fail to take it.\u201d</p> <p>Juan Carlos Ruiz Molleda, from NGO Instituto de Defensa Legal (IDL) which is part of the legal team supporting ORPIO\u2019s lawsuit, makes another argument: that the 2012 law, irrespective of how it is interpreted, is \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d \u201cIf you listen to government functionaries, especially those in MINEM, ProInversion and even MINCU, you always hear the same argument: \u201cBut that\u2019s what it says in the regulation, that\u2019s what it says in the law.\u201d What\u2019s forgotten, however, is that a law can be unconstitutional and therefore invalid,\u201d Ruiz Molleda wrote in a recent article.</p> <p>The Environment Ministry (MINAM) has expressed grave concern about the proposed line and, in a report sent to MINEM in February, recommended considering an alternative route that would have less impact on the Abanico del Pastaza. It also stated that the peat bogs in the region, together with those south of the River Maranon, sequester approximately 50% of Peru\u2019s entire carbon reserves, which it called \u201cextremely relevant\u201d \u201cgiven Peru\u2019s commitments to reduce carbon emissions in order to combat climate change.\u201d</p> <p>In addition, MINAM\u2019s report argued that Peru\u2019s 1993 Constitution states that treaties form part of national law, meaning that the Ramsar Convention is legally binding on Peru. As a contracting party to the Ramsar Convention, which entered into force in the country in 1992, Peru committed to \u201cdesiring to stem the progressive encroachment on and loss of wetlands now and in the future\u201d, and to \u201cpromote the conservation\u201d and \u201cas far as possible the wise use\u201d of wetlands.</p> <p>\u201cThe Abanico del Pastaza is one of the best conserved areas in the Peruvian Amazon, home to almost intact animal populations and plants of enormous relevance for the functioning and integrity of eco-systems and for the economy of the indigenous peoples and riberenos living there,\u201d MINAM\u2019s report stated.</p> <p>The company planning to build the line is Lineas de Transmision Peruanas, owned by Spain-based Isolux Cors\u00e1n. In May MINEM decided against approving an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the project because it failed to adequately address numerous environmental issues, among other reasons, but that decision was appealed by the company and then effectively annulled by Vice-Minister of Energy Raul Perez-Reyes Espejo.</p> <p>\u201cThe Vice-Minister has opened up the possibility that the EIA could be approved,\u201d ORPIO, IDLADS and CORPI announced on 16 August. </p> <p>The justification for the line, according to the EIA, is that it will be a more efficient and less costly way of providing electricity to Iquitos, allowing residents to enjoy a service similar to other cities in Peru already connected to the national grid. </p> <p>\u201cCurrently, Iquitos\u2019s entire electricity supply comes from its thermal power plant which has a total output of 48.4 MW,\u201d the EIA states. \u201cThe oil is transported there by river which means that the supply is subject to high risk because of the difficulties in navigation, weather conditions and environmental implications.\u201d</p> <p>When Isolux Cors\u00e1n won the contract in 2014 the then Vice-Minister of Energy, Edwin Quintanilla Acosta, claimed the proposed line would save 38 million gallons of oil a year and \u201cdinamize\u201d the economies of various Amazon regions.</p> <p>\u201cThe Amazon, 130 years after electricity was first used in Peru, will have clean energy to power its economic take-off,\u201d MINEM reported Quintanilla saying. \u201c\u201cThat enables us to see the future of the country with great optimism.\u201d\u201d</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Serra Vega, an engineer specialising in energy and the environment who has conducted environmental and economic analyses of the proposed line, argues it would be an \u201cenvironmental disaster.\u201d He claims 8.5 million tonnes of biomass from mostly primary forest could be destroyed, 4.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide could be released, 1000s of colonists could \u201cinvade\u201d, and the territories of eight indigenous peoples would be directly impacted.</p> <p>Serra Vega claims it would be an \u201ceconomic disaster\u201d too, estimating it will raise electricity prices and could cost Peruvians over a billion dollars. He says that consumers in Iquitos pay less than in Lima for electricity and another company, Genrent, is already building a new thermal power plant in Iquitos that will have 70 MW capacity - when the city\u2019s current maximum demand is 56MW. </p> <p>\u201cThis line isn\u2019t necessary and will cause a prejudice to Peruvian electricity consumers superior to 600 million dollars during the 30 years of its concession,\u201d Serra Vega told the Guardian. </p> <p>The EIA states the line will cost approximately US$500 million and take three years to build, with the preliminary stages employing roughly 800-900 people maximum. The project\u2019s \u201carea of direct influence\u201d is estimated at 100 metres along the entire line. </p> <p>Isolux Cors\u00e1n\u2019s website states that it acts with \u201cscrupulous respect towards the principles included in the Declaration of Human Rights\u201d and minimises \u201cthe environmental impact our activities might occasion.\u201d The company is also a signatory to the UN Global Compact, which means it has committed to, among other things, \u201csupport and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights\u201d and \u201cundertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>MINEM and Isolux Cors\u00e1n did not respond to questions.</p>",
  "<p>Three years ago, Apple boss Tim Cook was emphatic. Appearing before <a href=\"http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/subcommittees/investigations/hearings/offshore-profit-shifting-and-the-us-tax-code_-part-2\">a US senate committee</a>, the man who runs the world\u2019s largest company told the politicians straight: Apple had no intention of repatriating billions of dollars of profits from its international operations until the US Treasury slashed corporate taxation.</p> <p>\u201cI have no current plan to bring them back at the current tax rate,\u201d Cook said.</p> <p>It was a response \u2013 one of many \u2013 that rankled with the committee\u2019s chair, Carl Levin. Leaning forward, the tough septuagenarian senator from Michigan glared at Cook over the top of his glasses: \u201cIt is not your intent to bring them home unless we reduce our tax rates? Is that correct?\u201d</p> <p>Cook repeated: \u201cI have no current plan to do so at the current tax rates.\u201d</p> <p>It was a charged exchange that laid bare the impasse between corporate America and Washington. At that time, Apple had amassed about $100bn in cash \u2013 income from its foreign operations \u2013 all of which was being carefully held outside America, beyond the reach of the US tax authorities.</p> <p>Since then, every three months, Apple has given Wall Street an update on the size of this cash pile, and each time the figure has grown by several billion. At last count, six weeks ago, the figure stood at $215bn (\u00a3162bn).</p> <p>If Apple were to bring that money back to the US, however, it would be taxed at about 40%, one of the highest tax rates in the world. \u201cApple serves its shareholders by keeping these funds overseas,\u201d the Californian technology firm told the senators.</p> <p>By using a long-standing loophole in the tax code, Apple, in common with many other multinationals, can continually defer US taxes on these offshore earnings for as long as they are kept outside America.</p> <p>This is a quirk of US law that has had a dramatic, and increasingly unsustainable, impact on the corporate world. It has meant that many of the richest firms in the US are amassing huge, untaxed offshore cash piles. In recent, years that trend has been accelerated by America\u2019s booming leading tech firms and their worldwide success.</p> <p>According to ratings agency Moody\u2019s, US companies, excluding banks, had an estimated $1.2 trillion in cash overseas at the end of last year. Just over half of that sum \u2013 $630bn \u2013 is estimated to be held by Apple and other tech companies, among them Silicon Valley firms Microsoft ($96bn), Cisco ($57bn), Google ($43bn) and Oracle ($45bn).</p> <p>Barack Obama promised he would get corporate America to bring profits home, as have both the Republican and Democrat candidates vying to succeed him. Quite how to do so, however, has divided Washington for decades.</p> <p>And if the result has been intransigence, few have complained very loudly. The impasse has suited corporate America well, allowing its biggest international businesses to enjoy years of ultra-low tax bills.</p> <p>Last week, however, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\">dramatic intervention of Europe\u2019s competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager </a>appeared to steal the reform initiative from Washington.</p> <p>In a decision that for many years tax experts would have thought unthinkable, she ruled that a significant slice of Apple\u2019s offshore wealth had been illegally won. The iPhone maker, Vestager found, had been benefiting from a sweetheart tax deal agreed behind closed doors with Ireland a quarter of a century ago. That deal had resulted in Apple avoiding \u20ac13bn in taxes over 10 years, she said: those back taxes, plus interest, would have to be repaid.</p> <p>Cook was furious. He insisted that the income had already been taxed in Europe. \u201cThe commission is now calling to retroactively change those rules,\u201d he protested last Tuesday. Two days later he was still raging \u2014 calling Vestager\u2019s decision \u201cinvalid\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/political-crap-tim-cook-apple-tax-ruling\">crap</a>\u201d \u2014 but he also had a surprise announcement. During an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/apple-boss-tim-cook-repatriate-billions-to-us-treasury-next-year\">interview on Irish radio,</a> he started talking about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/apple-boss-tim-cook-repatriate-billions-to-us-treasury-next-year\">repatriating cash held overseas </a>and paying US tax. \u201cRight now, I would forecast that we repatriate next year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe [have] provisioned several billion for the US for payment [of tax bills] as soon as we repatriate.\u201d</p> <p>There has been no further elaboration, but it is a marked change in tone from Cook, who now needs all the support he can muster from allies on Capitol Hill. Hints that Apple might be more willing to pay tax in America might be just the kind of message US politicians wanted to hear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a0fc93f0c5b0cb05a2bd00d6410781ae8444c12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a0fc93f0c5b0cb05a2bd00d6410781ae8444c12/0_61_3884_2331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margrethe Vestager\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margrethe Vestager: demanding \u20ac13bn in back taxes from Apple in Ireland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Thys/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Apple boss certainly has friends in high places. Recent months have seen him host fundraising events for both Democratic presidential candidate Hilary Clinton and Republican house speaker Paul Ryan.</p> <p>For all that, however, few US politicians have come out fighting hard to defend Apple\u2019s Irish tax arrangements. There have some generalised warnings from US Treasury secretary Jack Lew that the commission\u2019s move could have a \u201cchilling effect on US-EU cross-border investment\u201d and that Washington would have to \u201cconsider potential responses\u201d.</p> <p>But as global leaders gather in Hangzhou, China, on Sunday for the latest G20 summit, there are little signs of Apple\u2019s \u20ac13bn back-taxes penalty causing a full-blown crisis.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, dissatisfaction over corporate America and its untaxed offshore cash is growing. Politicians may not yet have figured out what they intend to do about this issue, but the last 18 months have provided a few stark reminders that there is a lot at stake.</p> <p>Last November, many in Washington were surprised to see Pfizer, one of America\u2019s largest drug makers, unveiling plans for a record-breaking $160bn deal \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/06/pfizer-allergan-tax-inversion-deal-merger\">so-called \u201ctax inversion\u201d</a> transaction which would see it merge with a smaller, foreign rival and shift its headquarters outside the US.</p> <p>The Pfizer bid was just the latest, and largest, in a wave of such inversion deals. Such transactions are designed to allow multinationals greater freedom to use their swollen cash reserves without triggering US tax bills.</p> <p>In the end, however, the Obama administration moved quickly enough to introduce tougher rules to discourage inversion deals, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/05/pfizer-allergan-merger-tax-avoidance-rules\">thwarting Pfizer\u2019s plans</a>. But it was yet another wake-up call: corporate America\u2019s untaxed offshore cash pile was a problem that needed fixing.</p> <p>Most tax reform experts concede Apple\u2019s Irish tax arrangements are hard to defend as fair. Pascal Saint-Amans, head of tax at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), who last year secured unprecedented agreement on reforms to tackle tax avoidance, is among the critics.</p> <p>\u201cThe Apple case is a great illustration of the most aggressive tax planning that is out there\u2026 [It produced] massive profits that ended up going taxed nowhere. It is precisely because of these types of schemes that the G20 asked us to start looking at major tax reforms [three years ago].\u201d</p> <p>It is the OECD\u2019s work on tax reform that prompted Ireland to finally close loopholes that allowed Apple and other multinationals to use \u201cnon-tax-resident\u201d Irish companies to receive billions of dollars in income that then went untaxed. As a result, Apple unwound its use of such arrangements last year.</p> <p>It now remains to be seen whether Vestager demonstrates an appetite for going after further large sums from cash-rich US corporations that have used aggressive tax structures in Europe. She already has two suspected sweetheart deals in her sights \u2014 separate tax rulings granted by Luxembourg to McDonald\u2019s and Amazon. And she has not ruled out adding more.</p> <p>Whatever the outcome, however, Washington and Wall Street have woken up to the possibility that if America is unwilling to tax the ballooning offshore cash mountains of its leading companies, others are now emboldened to do so.</p>",

The secretary breaks ranks, citing the comedies as his \u201cgreatest inspiration\u201d, explaining that they offer more than the opportunity to laugh: \u201cThe great strength of the comedies is that they recognise the fallibility of mankind and yet they are eternally optimistic.\u201d</p> <p>Striking an optimistic note, Kerry, 72, highlights Jacques\u2019 speech from As You Like It which begins, \u201cAll the world\u2019s a stage, / And all the men and women merely players,\u201d and runs through the seven ages of man. </p> <p>\u201cAs I travel and talk to foreign ministers, prime ministers, presidents, and people from all walks of life all across this planet,\u201d he writes, \u201cI don\u2019t sense an unravelling of the global fabric.

There is a lot of substance beneath the announcements that come out.</p> <p>Geall added: \u201cI do think it is part of Obama\u2019s legacy and it\u2019s surprising that it hasn\u2019t been talked about all that much in that context actually. He managed to help get something really constructive going after the failure of [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/18/copenhagen-deal\">the 2009 climate summit</a> in] Copenhagen.\u201d </p> <p>Geall said China\u2019s leaders, who have vowed to cut coal consumption and draw 20% of the country\u2019s energy from non-fossil fuels by 2030, also deserved praise for their commitment to cleaning up. \u201cNot only is it the one area where there is productive US-China cooperation, but it is the one area where China is actively behaving like a superpower and they are actually taking on the responsibility of having that immense weight in the emissions talks. They really have shown some leadership and that has been reflected through the UN climate process.\u201d</p> <p>Beijing\u2019s resolve was the result of a growing awareness of the dangers of pollution and climate change and how \u201cthere is a national interest in China in the low carbon transition and in being the leading suppliers of the clean technologies that we will need in a carbon-constrained world\u201d. </p> <p>Jake Schmidt of the US-based Natural Resources Defense Council said: \u201cOnly a few short years ago, countries were trying to drag the US and China into the global climate agreements and now these two countries are among the first to join the new legal regime. That is an important shift in the dynamic.\u201d</p> <p>Nick Mabey of the UK-based environmental thinktank, E3G, said: \u201cUS and Chinese ratification sends a strong signal to investors and businesses that they can continue investing on the assumption that the Paris climate deal will be delivered.\u201d</p> <p>Bob Ward of the London School of Economics said the move would encourage other countries to move quickly and added: \u201cImportantly, it should also make it more difficult for Donald Trump to renege on the Paris agreement if he becomes president of the US.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/01/obama-climate-change-hawaii-nevada\">Obama makes climate change personal with call for action in home state Hawaii</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The announcement came on day one of what is likely to be Obama\u2019s last visit to Asia as president.

When these two thresholds are met the agreement will enter into force.</p> <p>Once the conditions of the third step are met, entry into force will occur 30 days after the dual thresholds are achieved. Upon entry into force, the Agreement will become binding international law and countries that have formally joined will be subject to its provisions. Countries that have joined the agreement can only pull out after a period of three years from the day it enters into force. After three years, a country that has joined the agreement can choose to withdraw one year after submitting official notification of its intention.

Senior military and intelligence figures have warned ministers that plans to give China a big stake in Britain\u2019s nuclear power industry <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4587446.ece\">poses a threat to national security</a>.</p> <p>May\u2019s chief of staff, Nick Timothy, wrote a piece saying MI5 believed that the intelligence services of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2015/10/nick-timothy-the-government-is-selling-our-national-security-to-china.html\">China continued to work against UK interests at home and abroad.</a></p> <p>Critics say countries such as the US would never allow the Chinese to work inside its national infrastructure where it could insert computer glitches that could turn the lights off. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/aug/02/oil.money\">America scuppered a Chinese company from buying one of its oil companies, Unocal, on strategic grounds</a> in 2005.</p> <p>The Hinkley deal is not self-standing, either. Beijing has only agreed to provide 30% funding on condition that it will be able to build its own Chinese-designed reactor at Bradwell in Essex.</p> <p><strong>Cost</strong></p> <p>While spy stories may be headline grabbing, there are other more mundane reasons why Hinkley may never go ahead: cost \u2013 and most notably the fact that UK energy consumers would ultimately pay the eye-watering bill.</p> <p>Osborne offered EDF and CGN a guaranteed price for its electricity of \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour \u2013 more than twice the current cost of wholesale power \u2013 for a period of 35 years. </p> <p>Critics point out that EDF\u2019s track record of delays and cost overruns at building a new reactor at Flamanville in Normandy is dismal, as is the experience of its reactor designer, Areva, with a new construction at Olkiluoto in Finland.</p> <p><strong>Unnecessary power</strong></p> <p> The biggest cloud over Hinkley, which has grown and grown over the years since the Somerset project was first muted, surrounds whether this kind of inflexible, on-all-the-time nuclear power is really needed now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b07376ff187da66ad380ed97af028c6366a99360\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b07376ff187da66ad380ed97af028c6366a99360/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An aerial view of the Hinkley Point site, with views of Hinkley A and Hinkley B nuclear power plants.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An aerial view of the Hinkley Point site, with views of Hinkley A and Hinkley B nuclear power plants.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EDF Energy/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The rise of renewables such as wind and solar are threatening the whole argument for nuclear, which also has ongoing issues such as how to dispose of radioactive waste and whether they are a vulnerable terrorist target to contend with.</p> <p>Wind farms and solar arrays are fast coming down in price and while they may produce intermittent power, they are relatively quick and easy to construct. The idea that Britain could rely on these new low-carbon technologies was considered ridiculous even three years ago but less so now.</p> <p>They can be relatively easily backed up by gas-fired power stations while a research race for large scale and efficient batteries could eventually allow green power to run 24 hours a day in areas where renewables were located.</p> <p>A new realisation that Britain could reduce demand for power by a variety of energy saving measures has also raised questions about the need for a new generation of massive plants such as Hinkley. </p> <h2>The case in favour</h2> <p><strong>Credibility</strong><br></p> <p>Against all this is the sheer credibility of the UK as a home for foreign investment, especially post-Brexit. Telling the French and Chinese to keep their money could have serious consequences, as Beijing is clearly indicating.</p> <p><strong>Alternatives difficult</strong></p> <p>While many Conservative MPs have reservations about Hinkley there is little enthusiasm for a massive drive on wind and solar, whose subsidy levels have been hugely cut back since Ed Davey ran the show for the coalition government.</p> <p>Britain has carbon emission targets to meet and so any alternative strategy for keeping the lights on such as allowing coal-fired power stations to keep on polluting would mean a U-turn on climate change.</p> <p>The stakes are high whichever route is taken. May will be trying to dodge these thorny questions over the next couple of days.</p>",
  "<p>The decision by China and the US, the world\u2019s two biggest greenhouse gas emitters, to ratify the landmark Paris accord on climate change heralds a new era of global cooperation on limiting emissions.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/09/durban-climate-change-connie-hedegaard\">Only a few years ago</a>, such a commitment looked like a pipe dream. Today, with the two most powerful nations on board, the United Nations can celebrate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris\">a victory on this world-changing issue</a> that has been more than 20 years in the making.</p> <p>President Obama\u2019s commitment is particularly significant in its timing. The presidential contender <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/12/donald-trump-climate-change-science-sierra-club\">Donald Trump has vowed to unpick the Paris accord if elected</a>, but if it were to come into force before he came into office, that would become difficult if not impossible under US law and political conventions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/sep/03/g20-summit-obama-to-make-climate-change-announcement-as-may-heads-to-china-live\">G20 summit: US and China ratify Paris agreement in major step for climate change fight - live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But vital though the joint declaration is, it is not yet enough to bring the Paris agreement into force, nor halt the impacts of human activities on the climate. Making this work in practice will take much more.</p> <p>First is the task of getting more nations to ratify. The US and China make up about 39% of global emissions. Under the foundation treaty, <a href=\"http://newsroom.unfccc.int/\">the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change</a>, at least 55 countries must ratify for the agreement to enter force, and countries accounting for at least 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions must be represented.</p> <p>With China, the US and a host of smaller countries <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9444.php\">signed up</a>, the biggest emitter left outstanding is the EU, which negotiated the agreement as a bloc. The EU is unlikely to be able to ratify the accord any time soon, because of the mechanics of getting legal surety from its 28 member states.</p> <p>There is a way around this. Nicholas Stern, chairman of the Grantham Institute on Climate Change and author of the landmark 2006 report on the economics of climate change, called on EU member states and the UK to ratify the agreement individually, through their national parliaments, to speed up the process. EU members are legally parties to the accord at a national as well as a bloc level, so if enough major countries \u2013 including the UK and Germany \u2013 were to enact the necessary processes then the accord could pass the final hurdle.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/03/breakthrough-us-china-agree-ratify-paris-climate-change-deal\">Breakthrough as US and China agree to ratify Paris climate change deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis is a tremendous opportunity,\u201d Stern told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for the credibility of the process [of gaining global agreement on climate action through the UN] to get the treaty ratified this year. EU countries can and should ratify as soon as possible. It\u2019s not sensible to hold back, when they could make a big difference.\u201d</p> <p>The second, and more important, problem is that the agreement itself \u2013 the first that is both legally binding and likely to cover all countries \u2013 is just the beginning. The document, reached at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations\">a historic conference last December</a> after 20 years of tortuous stop-start talks, commits countries to holding global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, which scientists regard as the limit of safety, beyond which climate change is likely to have catastrophic and irreversible effects.</p> <p>It does not specify what actions countries must take. Nearly all signatories set out targets on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-200-nations-sign-finish-fossil-fuel-era\">cutting their future greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2020</a>, when current commitments expire. But the cuts in carbon dioxide implied by those targets will not be enough to hold to the 2C threshold, let alone limit the world to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-key-points\">the 1.5C of warming included as an \u201caspiration\u201d and required to save the globe\u2019s most low-lying areas</a>. </p> <p>In addition, though the framework is legally binding, the commitments on emissions are not. National governments will be relied upon to flesh out their targets themselves, through policies that could be controversial and perhaps expensive in the short term, such as pursuing renewable energy and leaving fossil fuels unexploited. That process has barely begun for many.</p> <p>Green campaigners called on national governments to act urgently both to fulfil the legal pledges of the Paris accord, and the moral promises made to their people to halt dangerous climate change.</p> <p>Li Shuo, senior policy advisor for east Asia at <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/\">Greenpeace</a>, said: \u201cPolitical ambition must keep up with rising sea levels faced by vulnerable communities. Touting the Paris \u2018triumph\u2019 while handing out money to the fossil fuel industry is simply not compatible with the Paris agreement. Governments must <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/keep-it-in-the-ground\">keep coal, oil and gas in the ground</a>, and urgently focus on a just transition to renewables. The G20 meeting must be the moment when leaders lay out a timetable for eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, a practice which the Paris agreement has made all the more hypocritical.\u201d</p> <p>Mike Childs, head of policy at <a href=\"http://www.foei.org/\">Friends of the Earth</a>, added: \u201cCountries need to commit to even deeper cuts than they promised in Paris and they need to enact policies to turn warm words into meaningful action.\u201d</p> <p>Early ratification would give governments the spur needed to formulate new policies on limiting carbon, and give businesses a clear signal that they should invest in reducing their impact on the climate, said Nick Mabey, chief executive of the E3G thinktank. \u201c[The US and China announcement] sends a strong signal to investors and businesses that they can continue investing on the assumption that the Paris [commitments] will be delivered,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cAt a time of increasing geopolitical turbulence this sends a welcome signal that cooperation to tackling climate change is resilient to worsening relations among the world\u2019s superpowers.\u201d</p> <p>Jake Schmidt, director at the US-based Natural Resources Defense Council, added that other governments must take note. \u201cThe US and China are sending a powerful signal to other countries that the time for action is now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shows to countries and investors that the world\u2019s two largest economies and biggest polluters are preparing to help lead the shift to a low-carbon economy. Only a few short years ago, countries were trying to drag the US and China into the global climate agreements, and now these two are among the first to join the new legal regime. That is an important shift, which reflects the reality that countries now realise acting on climate change is in their own self-interest and failing to act is no longer a smart choice.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/25/eu-out-vote-puts-uk-commitment-to-paris-climate-agreement-in-doubt\">The UK\u2019s position</a>, as the government negotiates exit from the EU, is of particular concern, as UK support over the course of more than two decades of UN climate negotiations has been a key influence. </p> <p>Childs told the Guardian that the prime minister should not delay, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s up to Theresa May to make sure that the UK ratifies the agreement too, and quickly. Otherwise the UK will go from being leader to laggard on climate change.\u201d</p>",

Some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/23/americans-without-health-insurance-drops\">20 million more people</a> now have insurance thanks to the ACA; people under the age of 26, who often skip insurance, can be covered by their parents\u2019 plans; and people with existing conditions cannot be discriminated against. But the ACA relies on competition between insurers to provide affordable coverage, and that is dwindling.</p> <p>Under the ACA, health insurance marketplaces, also called health exchanges, were set up to facilitate the purchase of health insurance in each state. Customers are free to choose from a set of standardized healthcare plans from participating insurers, and those policies are eligible for federal subsidies.</p> <p>But insurers have been fleeing the exchanges, arguing that they are loss makers and the types of people attracted to them make the risks too great for the insurers  to provide affordable (and profitable) policies.</p> <p>David Howard, an associate professor at Emory University\u2019s department of health policy and management, said the ACA included provisions to keep the marketplaces stable, but some of those were watered down in the push to get the deal through Congress, and in other cases the provisions have not been enacted in the way people expected. \u201cSo that means the exchanges are potentially on the cusp of falling apart,\u201d Howard said. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/the-perils-of-turning-26-when-us-millennials-lose-their-parents-healthcare-cover\">The perils of turning 26: when US millennials lose their parents' healthcare</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The marketplaces are unstable in part because they are new, and all the parties involved \u2013 from insurers to those who need insurance \u2013 are trying to figure out where they fit into the equation.

In April, UnitedHealthcare <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/20/united-health-insurance-obamacare-exit-pr-problem\">left most of the 34 state marketplaces it participated in</a>.

She is travelling to China on Saturday. </p> <p>The \u00a318bn project was due to be approved for construction by French company EDF, with a \u00a36bn investment from China, before May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-to-go-ahead-after-edf-board-approves-project\">placed the project under review</a> in July.</p> <p>A UK official downplayed the importance of Hinkley Point as an issue at the G20 summit, insisting that the bilateral meeting with Xi was about a much broader set of topics.</p> <p>\u201cThey will talk about a range of issues,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe have set out the government\u2019s approach to Hinkley, which is that we are currently considering all the component parts. We have said we will make a decision this month. That remains the plan. I do not expect one in the next few days. I don\u2019t think our Chinese or French partners are expecting one in the next few days.\u201d</p> <p>Chinese officials have given a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/china-warns-uk-relations-historical-juncture-hinkley-point-liu-xiaoming\">series of veiled warnings</a> in recent weeks that Britain halting their investment in UK nuclear would be seen as a snub and a sign that a golden era of relations between the two countries had lost some of its sheen.</p> <p>Hinkley Point was raised last week when Lucy Neville-Rolfe, the energy minister, made a low-profile trip to China connected with her second brief of intellectual property. However, UK government sources insisted that Lady Neville-Rolfe would have only reiterated the official position on Hinkley that Britain is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/hinkley-point-c-why-has-government-delayed-final-approval\">considering all the component parts</a> of the project.</p> <p>There has been speculation that May could be happy to allow China to proceed with its Hinkley investment, but does not want Beijing to be involved in building a plant at Bradwell, Essex, or helping develop one at Sizewell, Suffolk. This suggestion is not understood to have gone down well in Beijing, which could abandon plans for the entire nuclear sector if the UK demands to decouple Hinkley from the other two projects, in which China would have a more active involvement.</p> <p>On Friday night, the Financial Times reported that a senior figure at EDF has said the Treasury or another investor may have to step in <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0b80e672-70ea-11e6-a0c9-1365ce54b926.html#axzz4J7PthMxN\">to save the deal</a>, although the company denied that this was the official position.</p> <p>It is understood that executives from EDF met Greg Clark, the business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, on Thursday to press the case for Hinkley to be built. </p> <p>Barry Gardiner, the shadow energy secretary, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think [May\u2019s] going to allow the Chinese to do Sizewell and Bradwell. I think she would be happy to have them involved in the financing of Hinkley, but I think informal soundings with the Chinese have come back and said: \u2018Don\u2019t even think about offering us that. Do you think we are interested in this for the return on a poxy \u00a36bn? We are a Chinese state company and what we\u2019re really interested in is being able to build 2.5 nuclear reactors in the most stringent regulatory regime in the world\u2019.<br></p> <p>\u201cThey are so angry about this and apoplectic about what she is proposing. I think we will see a very clear slapdown from president Xi and an end of the golden era that was supposed to start last year.\u201d</p> <p>Gardiner said May had a tricky decision to make over Hinkley, given that it was a bad value deal, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/09/china-uk-investment-key-questions-following-hinkley-point-c-delay\">trade with China is crucial</a> as Britain negotiates its departure from the EU.</p> <p>\u201cThe point is that we should be investing in our own future infrastructure. We have an opportunity to do it at the lowest possible cost. I believe that if she does ditch the Chinese deal, at least have the common sense for the Treasury to put in the money ourselves if she believes that project needs to be delivered,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The prevarication over Hinkley threatens to undermine May\u2019s message at the summit that the UK intends to be \u201copen for business ... [and] will continue to be a strong and dependable partner [after the Brexit vote]\u201d.</p> <p>Other topics to be discussed at the summit include global growth, counter-terrorism and international free trade.<br></p> <p>May is expected to stress that militants must be prevented from gaining a foothold in sub-Saharan Africa, away from territory in Syria, Iraq and Libya.</p> <p>The prime minister, who turned down an invitation for her husband, Philip, to attend the summit, is expecting to take the opportunity to have face-to-face encounters with other world leaders in bilateral meetings and \u201cbrush bys\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>The World Health Organisation ranks bacon, ham and sausages alongside smoking as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/26/bacon-ham-sausages-processed-meats-cancer-risk-smoking-says-who\">a cause of cancer</a>, placing processed meats in the same carcinogenic category as asbestos, alcohol and arsenic. The World Cancer Research Fund advises eating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/26/processed-and-red-meat-what-are-the-cancer-risks\">cured meats as little as possible</a> \u2013 ideally not at all. And there\u2019s persuasive evidence that, <a href=\"http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets\">compared to a solely plant-based diet, eating meat shortens life</a> and makes people sicker and fatter.</p> <p>Against this background, the NHS allows fast food chains in its hospitals. Patient <a href=\"http://www.pat.nhs.uk/patients-and-visitors/Catering/Menu%20-%20North%20Manchester.pdf\">menus</a> offer a wide selection of meats every day. And creamed potatoes, beef casserole and sweet chilli pork and rice are recommended \u201chealthier choices\u201d. Patients can tuck into disease-promoting animal flesh, but do not enjoy unrestricted hedonism. Meat eaters who enjoy a relaxing cigarette after dinner are prevented from doing so, apparently in their own and others\u2019 best interests, thanks to a blanket ban on smoking.</p> <p>But how can the NHS sensibly ban cigarettes as a known health hazard while simultaneously promoting meat? To endorse one known danger while completely banning a similar one makes no sense. Either it\u2019s OK to allow free choice or it\u2019s OK to prevent \u201cunhealthy behaviours\u201d, but you can\u2019t have it both ways. If you ban smoking you have to ban meat, which causes considerably more damage to animals, the environment and individuals than smoking. If you don\u2019t ban meat, then you can\u2019t ban smoking. Which is it to be? George Orwell coined the idea of doublethink in his dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four<strong> </strong> to highlight the troubling phenomenon where we simultaneously accept mutually contradictory beliefs as true, blissfully unaware there\u2019s any conflict.</p> <p>In doublethink we fail to notice even the most stunning inconsistencies. Most people like to think of themselves as animal lovers \u2013 in the UK for example about half of all households keep pets \u2013 yet it\u2019s estimated that only 2%\u201310% of the UK population is vegetarian (will eat dairy and eggs) and less than 1% is vegan (will not eat or use any animal matter). So it seems that at least 50 million British animal lovers are happy to eat them, which is surely more than a little weird.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/aug/18/governments-response-obesity-diabetes-nhs\">The government's response to obesity and diabetes is insulting</a> </p> </aside>  <p> We\u2019ve all seen people putting money in animal charity collection boxes with one hand, while eating a beef burger with the other. But even staring absurdity in the face, most of us don\u2019t notice a problem. We only see it once we\u2019re ready to. Until then we flick it away: \u201cpets are different\u201d, \u201cpigs are meant to be eaten\u201d, \u201cwe have to have our iron\u201d, \u201call farmed animals are treated well\u201d, \u201cyou can slaughter animals humanely\u201d, and so on. </p> <p>We are plagued by doublethink because we habitually separate the world into unrelated packets. Smoking is a health issue. Meat is normal. Alcohol is bad. Not allowing tobacco products to be displayed is health promotion. Allowing body parts of slaughtered animals on public view in supermarkets is wholesome. Illogical beliefs appear compatible if their true connections are disguised. Smoking is tightly wrapped in a packet labelled \u201cVery bad for your health\u201d, whereas eating meat is in a quite different packet called \u201ca balanced diet\u201d or \u201cyou need your protein\u201d. So long as we see the world in disconnected chunks, we can avoid serious thought, and preserve the status quo. We need more opportunity to think deeply for ourselves.

According to author Shelina Janmohamed, they are proud of their faith, enthusiastic consumers, dynamic, engaged, creative and demanding. And the change they will bring about won\u2019t depend on the benevolence of others: instead, the Muslim pound, like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/mar/27/pink-pound-gay-tourism-1999-archive\">pink pound</a> before it, will force soft cultural change by means of hard economics.</p> <p>To demonstrate all that, the cover image was crucial. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about Muslims in particular, but actually people of religion in general, the images you get are really quite depressing,\u201d she says over coffee and baklava in her garden in the outer suburbs of London. \u201cBut I think this really captures it. It\u2019s bold, it\u2019s vibrant, the woman\u2019s got so much attitude. They are exactly the kind of people I\u2019m writing about.\u201d</p> <p>Janmohamed recalls going into a bookshop some years ago. \u201cThey had this display of books about Muslims, and it was all misery memoirs of women in veils with cast-down eyes who\u2019d been kidnapped and sold, and people riding on camels in faraway deserts,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cBut young Muslims are crying out for a voice to say this is not what we\u2019re like, we do ordinary things like everyone else, and we have interesting things to say \u2013 particularly when the conversation is about Muslims.\u201d There are precious few mainstream publications about the experience of being a young Muslim, beyond politics and theology, she says.</p> <p>Generation M are the Muslim millennials, the global generation born in the past 30 years, but with a twist. Unlike their Christian counterparts in the US and western Europe, most of whom are turning their backs on organised religion, Generation M has \u201cone over-riding characteristic, which is that they believe that being faithful and living a modern life go hand in hand, and there is absolutely no contradiction between the two,\u201d says Janmohamed.</p> <p>In the book, she writes: \u201cTheir faith affects everything, and they want the world to know it. This is what sets them apart from their non-Muslim peers. It\u2019s the single factor that will shape them and a world that they are determined should cater to their needs \u2026 They are a tech-savvy, self-empowered, youthful group who believe that their identity encompasses both faith and modernity.\u201d</p> <p>The demographics depict an extraordinary trajectory. In 2010, there were 1.6 billion Muslims in the world, a figure forecast to grow by 73% in the next four decades \u2013 more than double the general rate of growth. By 2050, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/23/why-muslims-are-the-worlds-fastest-growing-religious-group/\">according to the Pew Research Center</a>, there will be 2.8 billion Muslims globally, more than a quarter of the world\u2019s population.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14d0afcd270694f32fcb0aecc6e0dfa907fd48c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14d0afcd270694f32fcb0aecc6e0dfa907fd48c8/277_449_4053_2432/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Working in Bahrain \u2018opened my eyes to the global experience of being Muslim,\u2019 says Janmohamed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Working in Bahrain \u2018opened my eyes to the global experience of being Muslim,\u2019 says Janmohamed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of the <a href=\"http://next11.se/next-11-emerging-markets/\">11 countries expected to join the world\u2019s largest economies this century</a>, six have overwhelmingly Muslim populations and two have big Muslim minorities. <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/21/by-2050-india-to-have-worlds-largest-populations-of-hindus-and-muslims/\">By 2050, India will have the largest Muslim population in the world</a>, at an estimated 311 million, although they will still be a minority among the country\u2019s vast numbers. Muslim minorities in Britain, Europe and North America are young, affluent and growing. One-third of all Muslims are under the age of 15, and two-thirds under 30.</p> <p>The Muslim middle class is expected to triple to 900 million by 2030, driving consumption as well as social and political change. Their spending power is enormous: the <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/Khidr/thomson-reuters-state-of-global-islamic-economy-201516-report-53540682\">most recent State of the Global Islamic Economy Report</a> forecasts the halal food and lifestyle industry to be worth $2.6tn by the end of this decade, and Islamic finance is on a similar trajectory. Muslim travel could be worth $233bn. In 2014, Muslim fashion was estimated to be worth $230bn, and $54bn was spent on Muslim cosmetics.</p> <p>\u201cThrough their sheer numbers, their growing middle-class stature, the shift of economic and political power towards the Middle East and Asia, home to most of the world\u2019s Muslims, through the Muslim minorities that act as influential and well-connected leaders, by the inspirational force of their faith and their refusal to accept the status quo, Generation M are determined to make change. And what a change it\u2019s going to be,\u201d writes Janmohamed.</p> <p>She charts the beginnings of this change. The demand for halal (permitted) products has been the impetus for growth in a range of businesses, such as food, fashion, cosmetics and travel. Among dozens of entrepreneurs cited in the book are the Radwan family, who started an organic halal farm in Oxfordshire; the producers of non-alcoholic beer \u2013 a sector that grew 80% in the five years to 2012, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/08/economist-explains-3\">according to the Economist</a>; Shazia Saleem, who launched <a href=\"http://www.ieatfoods.com/\">ieat</a>, a range of halal ready-meals including shepherd\u2019s pie and lasagne, which are now sold at Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco; and \u201ca whole new Muslim fashion industry\u201d, incorporating online retailers, video bloggers, catwalk shows and haute couture.</p> <p>But Generation M, according to the book, wants to go beyond halal to <em>tayyab</em>, which roughly translates as \u201cethical and wholesome\u201d. They want the entire supply chain of production and consumption to have integrity. \u201cResources must be properly respected, workers in primary industries must not be exploited. Sustainability and renewability are part of the Islamic idea of \u2018stewardship of the Earth\u2019, which Generation M eco-Muslims \u2026 are championing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a43c0ccbd73444b46109717649cf96476960080\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a43c0ccbd73444b46109717649cf96476960080/28_104_3433_2060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lutfi Radwan with his family on his organic halal farm near Oxford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lutfi Radwan with his family on his organic halal farm near Oxford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Frost/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to Janmohamed, this Muslim millennial generation has been shaped by two monumental factors. One is the events of the past 15 years, since 9/11, and the global response to Islamic extremism and terrorism; the other is the internet, described in the book as \u201cthe glue that binds [Generation M] together and creates the critical mass that turns them into a globally influential force\u201d.</p> <p>The internet has also, she tells me, \u201cgiven space for [traditionally] marginalised voices within the community \u2013 younger Muslims and women \u2013 to express their views\u201d.</p> <p>Among those views are frustration and resentment at being defined by their hijabs or being told they are oppressed by their faith. Janmohamed quotes Azra, 20: \u201cI\u2019m a young Muslim woman. I am not oppressed by my hijab, I\u2019m liberated by it. If you don\u2019t understand that, that\u2019s completely fine, you don\u2019t need to \u2026 The emotion you\u2019re seeing in my eyes is not a plea to \u2018help me\u2019 but one for you to take your self-righteous bullshit and shove it up your arse.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/31/why-we-wear-the-burkini-five-women-on-dressing-modestly-at-the-beach\">Why we wear the burkini: five women on dressing modestly at the beach</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rather than being downtrodden and subjugated, Muslim women are experiencing increasing empowerment in education, employment, public life, marriage and childbearing, says Janmohamed. \u201cIf we were to pick a face that captures the global pace of change, it would most likely be a Muslim woman \u2013 she is part of the largest population, in nations where change is happening fastest, and in the segment where change is most potent. In short, Muslim women are where it\u2019s happening.\u201d</p> <p>Although beyond the cusp of Generation M at 42, Janmohamed in many ways embodies the young Muslim woman she describes.</p> <p>She was born in London to immigrant parents who arrived in the UK with a suitcase and \u00a375 in cash, and she went to a school at which there were few non-white faces. \u201cReligion was important in our family \u2013 I remember my parents praying and fasting, going to the mosque was extremely regular; the Muslim community they were part of was the foundation of the family\u2019s social life. But at school, I spent my time hiding my hennaed hands, not telling people I was eating curry at home, being very shy about being Muslim.\u201d</p> <p>Only when she went to Oxford did she start to wear a headscarf. \u201cI found university a liberating experience. I got to explore who I was, and part of that was my Muslim identity, which had been very suppressed at school.\u201d</p> <p>After university, she joined a graduate trainee scheme in marketing, and later spent a year working in Bahrain, which \u201copened my eyes to the global experience of being Muslim\u201d. She returned to the UK shortly before 9/11, and following the London bombings in July 2005, began writing a blog \u201ctalking about what it\u2019s like to be British and Muslim and a woman. It felt like that conversation, about someone who straddles different heritages and feels comfortable in all of them, just wasn\u2019t being heard.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3621ac425ff9a27ee32d7e1d0b0a6560159e8fb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3621ac425ff9a27ee32d7e1d0b0a6560159e8fb4/915_1039_6300_3779/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A catwalk show at the Saverah expo in London this year \u2013 a fashion, lifestyle and networking event billed as Muslim women\u2019s \u2018ultimate day out\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A catwalk show at the Saverah expo in London this year \u2013 a fashion, lifestyle and networking event billed as Muslim women\u2019s \u2018ultimate day out\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The blog led to a book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Love-Headscarf-Muslim-Woman-Seeks/dp/1845135490\">Love in a Headscarf</a>, published in 2009, about her 10-year quest for love via the route of a traditional arranged marriage. Janmohamed was headhunted to help launch <a href=\"http://www.ogilvynoor.com/\">Ogilvy Noor</a>, a division of advertising and marketing agency <a href=\"https://ogilvy.co.uk/\">Ogilvy &amp; Mather</a>, which advises brands on engaging with Muslim consumers.</p> <p>Ogilvy hired her when she was eight months pregnant with her first child, and Generation M was largely written during her second pregnancy and since the birth of her younger daughter 18 months ago. In the book\u2019s dedication, Janmohamed writes: \u201cTo my girls. Because you can do anything. Take it from Mummy.\u201d</p> <p>Generation M, she says, has high aspirations. \u201cThey want to be astronauts, you\u2019ve got <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/ibtihaj-muhammad-fencing-olympics-2016-bronze\">fencers at the Olympics</a> and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/zahra-lari-figure-skating-olympics_us_5706817ae4b0b90ac27169e7\">ice skaters going to the Winter Olympics</a>, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/royal-brunei-airlines-first-all-female-flight-deck-crew-lands-plane-in-saudi-arabia-where-women-are-a6931726.html\">female air crew for Brunei airways</a> \u2013 these are young people who are really battling the fact that they have aspirations that should be unfettered versus a reality that is trying to confine them to a particular box.\u201d</p> <p>But, she acknowledges, not all young Muslims are Generation M. Inclusion does not depend on disposable income or level of education, but sharing the characteristics of faith and modernity. \u201cTheir counterparts might be called the Traditionalists \u2026 more socially conservative, believing in maintaining harmony, more deference to authority and, as their name suggests, trying to hold firmly on to what they see as the good elements of family, community and tradition,\u201d she writes.</p> <p>And a few young Muslims, of course, become radicalised, hijacking Islam for violent extremism and hatred, the polar opposite of Generation M.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/may/14/international-modest-fashion-week-coverup\">Stylish cover-up: inside International Modest fashion week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I ask her who the book is aimed at. One of her goals was to offer a platform for Generation M, she replies, \u201cfor people to have their voices heard\u201d. \u201cSo there\u2019s a recognition of their own identity, a consolidation of who they are, how they talk to one another.\u201d</p> <p>Then, she adds: \u201cThere\u2019s a conversation for the wider Muslim community to have, to understand some of the dynamics that are happening within it, some of the challenges young Muslims are facing and how they can be resolved.\u201d</p> <p>But the book is also \u2013 and perhaps mainly \u2013 for a wider audience. \u201cPeople who work in business, politics, culture, development. The UK [Muslim] population is just shy of 3 million, the European population is 50 million and growing, there\u2019s a worldwide population of 1.6bn.

  "<p>Elon Musk\u2019s solar company has its sights set on replacing 5m rooftops in the US with traditional roofing materials integrated with solar cell technology.<br></p> <p>SolarCity\u2019s plans, announced last month, to develop traditional <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/19/elon-musk-tesla-solar-panel-roofs-solarcity\">roofs made entirely from solar panels</a> are part of a goal to make sustainable homes more aesthetically appealing, convenient, and ultimately affordable to the average homeowner. It\u2019s betting that people who need to replace their roofs will be attracted to the company\u2019s solar cell option because it won\u2019t require additional work or dramatically alter the look of the home.</p> <p>In an August conference call with investors, company chairman Elon Musk said people are forced to postpone solar adoption when they know a roof replacement is imminent and that \u201cthere is a huge market segment that is currently inaccessible to SolarCity.\u201d He added that the company\u2019s solar cell roofing \u201clooks way better\u201d and \u201clasts far longer than a normal roof\u201d.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"57b2c62590d360aa449ff994b561b477d87b32ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57b2c62590d360aa449ff994b561b477d87b32ab/0_0_4148_2761/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elon Musk, chairman of SolarCity\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elon Musk, chairman of SolarCity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rashid Umar Abbasi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By integrating a SolarCity roof with Tesla battery packs, it believes those homes could operate on solar power 24-hours a day. The lingering question, however, is whether mainstream homeowners will be able to afford that initial investment.<br></p> <p>A SolarCity representative was tightlipped on costs, saying they could not share details about the product at this time. </p> <p>Some industry players doubt the product can be affordable to most homeowners. Previous versions of photovoltaic roofs \u2013 also called \u201csolar shingles\u201d \u2013 have cost <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.seac.cc/fileadmin/seac/user/doc/SEAC-SUPSI_report_2015_-_BIPV_product_overview_for_solar_facades_and_roofs_1_.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">up to a third more than traditional solar panels</a>, were less efficient, and were far more pricey to install.</p> <p>\u201cWhat [the company is] talking about is a paradigm shift, not just a small leap,\u201d says Scott Franklin, owner of Lumos Solar, which specialises in solar panel architecture and design. \u201cSolarCity is known for being a low-cost, fast installer. Now they\u2019re talking about developing an entirely new product and becoming roofers? In terms of cost, they\u2019re going from selling solar leases to telling somebody they have to replace an entire roof. That\u2019s a dramatic cost difference.\u201d<br></p> <p>In 2009, US multinational Dow Chemical began developing solar shingles. Yet at a price of more than $20,000 per roof, the technology <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/dow-chemical-sheds-solar-shingle-business\" rel=\"nofollow\">was not commercially viable</a> and Dow discontinued the product in June 2016. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be the battle \u2013 the cost factor,\u201d says Bill Ellard, an economist for the American Solar Energy Society. \u201cBut if SolarCity works with some of the major homebuilders and they can invent their own systems, I think there\u2019s a play there.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But even if it succeeds in creating an affordable product, can SolarCity match the success of other eco-home innovations?<br></p> <p>Smart home devices such as Google\u2019s Nest thermostat are more affordable, and going down in cost each year. Thermostats and energy monitoring systems have taken off in recent years in part because they allow homeowners to cut energy use without changing their behaviour.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"57cb9d397b43071d7bb0068fe14fa9840669c19e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57cb9d397b43071d7bb0068fe14fa9840669c19e/0_0_2610_2170/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google\u2019s Nest thermostat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"831\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Google\u2019s Nest thermostat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Frey/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHomeowners don\u2019t want to think about efficiency; they want it just taken care of,\u201d says John Quale, a sustainable home design professor at the University of New Mexico. \u201cWe are not great about closing curtains or opening windows when we should. That\u2019s why technologies that do things for us are so appealing.\u201d<br></p> <p>Brian Abramson, cofounder of sustainable homebuilder Method Homes in Seattle, Washington, says smart home technology is becoming more mainstream, lower cost, and accessible. \u201cWe probably do Nest thermostats and basic lighting control on 80% of our houses; a couple of years ago there weren\u2019t any smart thermostats, and lighting control was only in 20% of our homes.\u201d<br></p> <p>Success in the residential solar market, by contrast, is heavily dependent on friendly government policies, a model that has proved challenging when tax incentives threaten to expire, or when monopoly utility companies are allowed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/13/solar-panel-energy-power-company-nevada\">change</a> the way they reimburse solar panel owners for energy put into the grid. <br></p> <p>By entering the home roofing market, SolarCity is also tacitly acknowledging that aesthetic concerns also hinder solar panel adoption. <br></p> <p>\u201cAesthetics are a big deal,\u201d says Franklin. \u201cThe first wave of solar adoption was driven by economics or environmental concerns. Now people are already past the \u2018I think it\u2019s a good idea\u2019 phase. They want to do it, but it has to look good and add to the value of a home rather than just be a bolted on addition.\u201d<br></p> <p>The company\u2019s announcement that it will unveil its solar cell roof \u201cin the coming months\u201d followed news that Tesla <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/01/elon-musk-sells-solar-power-company-solarcity-to-tesla-motors\">will acquire SolarCity as part of a master plan</a> to integrate the solar panel company with Telsa battery products. That marriage between power production and storage could be the difference <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/A-Note-to-Elon-Musk-And-The-Brothers-Rive-on-The-Integrated-Solar-Roof\" rel=\"nofollow\">between failures of the past</a> and what Musk hopes to achieve, Quale says.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf you look at the aspirations of Tesla and SolarCity, they have huge potential. Elon Musk is really talking about getting to the masses, and those companies could very well be an important driver in reducing costs,\u201d he says.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe conventional glass panel arrays have come down substantially in cost in the last five years and there\u2019s no reason to think these roofing materials couldn\u2019t fall into that as well.\u201d<br></p>",

This week, the New Yorker, a magazine so notorious for accuracy that it corrected itself about <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/09/who-is-melania-trump\">the kind of beverage Donald Trump drank</a> at a private dinner 14 years ago, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/05/laird-hamilton-and-gabrielle-reeces-weight-training-routine\">interviewed Danny Cipriani</a>. The piece was a fascinating read about a radical underwater workout in Malibu, but it referred at first to the Wasps fly-half as something called a \u201cfly back\u201d. Two countries separated by a common language, and etc.</p> <p>Cognisant of such transatlantic riptides, NBC will echo its approach to Premier League football and carry British match commentary. In the American English of the press release, \u201cAlastair Eykyn, Lawrence Dallaglio and Ugo Monye will call the match featuring Saracens and Worcester, while Nick Mullins, Dallaglio and Austin Healey will have the call for Wasps v Exeter on Sunday.\u201d</p> <p>Corbisiero, who has watched the football coverage closely, in particular the analysis provided by Rebecca Lowe\u2019s two Robbies, Earle and Mustoe, could be the ideal translator. First, he knows what it takes to win the Premiership in front of 82,000 fans at Twickenham: he did so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/may/31/northampton-saints-beat-saracens-premiership-final-match-report\">with Northampton in 2014</a>.

He has 20 England caps and played a starring role on the victorious 2013 Lions tour to Australia, but earlier in 2016 he announced the start of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/05/alex-corbisiero-rugby-union-england-lions\">a year off</a>, taken to recover from injuries to knee, back and shoulder.</p> <p>In May, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/05/alex-corbisiero-rugby-union-england-lions\">an interview shot through with typically engaging honesty</a>, he told the Guardian\u2019s Donald McRae he was \u201cphysically and mentally spent after 10 years of full-time rugby\u201d. Asked in September if he planned to return to action, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s up in the air. If I was coming back when I thought I was coming back, I would probably not have taken a role like this, because I\u2019d be training by now to be playing by November or January.</p> <p>\u201cI feel very fit and healthy and in good shape, I feel very capable of coming back to the game, but at the same time I have an eye on what\u2019s after the game, [and] at the same time there\u2019s an opportunity to maybe play out in the States.\u201d</p> <p>That opportunity would be in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/29/pro-rugby-denver-stampede-ohio-aviators\">PRO Rugby</a>, a five-team league currently operating out of Ohio and the west but aiming to expand to the east.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing more than an informal conversation,\u201d he said, \u201cso I wouldn\u2019t want to say I might or I might not, but it\u2019s definitely something I\u2019m going to look into. I still have the competitive itch to play, but at the same time 30-plus games\u201d \u2013 the length of an English season \u2013 \u201cisn\u2019t always the most appealing.\u201d <br></p> <p>PRO Rugby has found itself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/02/pro12-north-america-us-pro-rugby-league\">in something of a tug of love</a>, between those who want American pro rugby to grow domestically and those who would import teams to play in overseas leagues. The Premiership has stolen a march on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/23/pro-12-north-american-teams-expanded-league\">Pro12</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rugbyworld.com/news/boudjellal-chases-the-american-dream-68460\">Toulon</a> and Super Rugby by bagging TV coverage and staging <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/13/london-irish-saracens-premiership-united-states\">a regular-season game</a> in Harrison, New Jersey last March. Saracens won it, beating Corbisiero\u2019s old team London Irish in an entertaining match.</p> <p>Two as yet unconfirmed teams will return to the Red Bull Arena in 2017. In 2016, in the press box, some cynical hacks wondered if Irish and Sarries had been told to throw the ball about, to put on a show to sell the product. Corbisiero said Americans could come to love the Premiership\u2019s many styles.<br></p> <p>\u201cPerhaps the one area we may hit some speed bumps will be the winter months,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere it becomes a bit more of a tactical game, a bit of chess, and sometimes you need a bit of an appreciation of the techniques and the tactics of the game. I\u2019d hope to convey that to the audience.</p> <p>\u201cBut at the beginning of the season, the weather will be nice, the pitches will be firm and I think there will be an emphasis on playing rugby.\u201d </p> <p>Picking out the Saracens, England and Lions fly-half <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/owen-farrell\">Owen Farrell</a> as one man for US fans to watch closely, he added: \u201cIf you look at the way the England team has been playing, Eddie Jones has been trying to move them far away from that traditional set-piece-orientated kicking game. And I think that\u2019s trickling down \u2013 guys are going back to their clubs and saying that\u2019s how they want to play if they\u2019re going to get into this successful England side.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8a0c0f5eb4859abc3752e2af229dacb83d02491\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8a0c0f5eb4859abc3752e2af229dacb83d02491/0_0_3700_2220/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Corbisiero Lions try\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Corbisiero scores a try against Australia during the third Lions Test in Sydney in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/02/pro12-north-america-us-pro-rugby-league\">Pro12 North American plan could jeopardise US PRO Rugby league</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And so the show begins. Corbisiero did not cite figures to back his optimism about audiences \u2013 in fairness, he wasn\u2019t asked to \u2013 but a recent <a href=\"http://www.smg-insight.com/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2014/02/SMGIYG-Global-Fan-Base-of-Rugby-Union-Report-110213.pdf\">report by SMG Insight</a> identified what it called 4.2 million fans of rugby in the US and 16 million supporters. Not all of those are expats.</p> <p>\u201cBeing a US citizen,\u201d Corbisiero said, \u201cI played for the USA under-19s; I have friends who have played in the pro league over here who have really enjoyed it. There\u2019s an ever-growing participation at high-school level, collegiate and now post-collegiate, when you can\u2019t play football really anymore. Rugby is a sport you can play socially for a long time \u2026 I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to have an audience.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe the US will learn to love rugby. Maybe it already does. Maybe the New Yorker \u2013 which changed \u201cfly back\u201d to \u201cfullback\u201d, correct as a rugby position although Cipriani doesn\u2019t actually play there \u2013 meant what it said in the first place.

Maybe Corbisiero will soon be preaching to the converted.

  "<p>The world is edging toward a major conservation target for protected land and oceans, but there are concerns over how safeguarded areas are managed and whether they are effectively protecting endangered species, according to a new report.</p> <p>Nearly 15% of the Earth\u2019s land, covering around 20m sq km, is contained in national parks or other protected areas. This figure has flatlined over the past year, largely because of improved data collection, but is close to an <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/rationale/target-11/\">internationally agreed goal</a> to protect 17% of the land surface by 2020.</p> <p>There has been a faster rate of progress in ocean conservation, albeit of a low base.

  "<p>As the Festival of Dangerous Ideas kicked off at the Sydney Opera House on Saturday morning, the mood in the Utzon Room was decidedly bleak.

The nation\u2019s attitudes are set fast: stuck at cruel.

In another departure from the usual refugee policy talkfest, the audience was invited to put the panel\u2019s ideas to the test in facilitated workgroups, come up with potential solutions of their own, and present the ideas they had come up with themselves to the larger assembly. </p> <p>It was in this environment that new ideas began to emerge.

Another, eschewing the media entirely, flagged more direct proposals such as pressuring politicians to visit offshore centres themselves and speak face-to-face with the people they\u2019re detaining, or using virtual reality to give regular people an idea of what life on Nauru and Manus is like. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/27/cruelty-to-asylum-seekers-dressed-up-as-compassion-is-the-scandal-that-bedevils-australia\">Cruelty to asylum seekers dressed up as compassion is the scandal that bedevils Australia | Antony Loewenstein</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Representatives of Maurice Blackburn floated soliciting corporate sponsors to take on refugee work placements to give refugees a chance to live and work in the community, and Australians the opportunity to meet them first-hand. A fourth group came up with rebranding Australia Day as \u201cOpen Door Day\u201d and normalising the practice of experiencing a suburb you don\u2019t normally frequent, as a way of easing people\u2019s insecurities around multiculturalism.</p> <p>But the most well-received idea came at the end, and addressed the concerns Marr raised at the opening: commissioning research to actually understand how to change people\u2019s minds on a political issue. There was a common acknowledgement that unless the refugee movement stopped talking to itself about itself and reached people outside its own bubble, its capacity to bring about lasting change was limited.</p> <p>That, perhaps, was the most valuable thing to come out of the forum. The act of inviting people to actively contribute to the movement, rather than sit back and support the cause on social media, did more to excite attendees than the prospect of sitting through another speech from a refugee expert. If experiments such as these get similar receptions, David Marr may have less to despair about than he supposes.</p>",

The range, mimetic ability, expressive effect of raven-talk is so impressive. But once they\u2019d accepted a ravens\u2019 share of my sandwiches and seen that all was gone, my discourse failed to detain them.
