  "<p>So now we know for sure, thanks to the permanent secretary at the Department for Education, who really ought to order in some document folders pronto. Jonathan Slater slipped up outside No 10, accidentally revealing a briefing note, and thereby confirming that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/06/grammar-school-ban-could-end-government-memo-reveals\" title=\"\">Theresa May\u2019s government does indeed intend to open new selective schools</a> \u2013 although this is only to be pursued \u201conce we have worked with existing grammars to show how they can be expanded and reformed\u201d.</p> <p>At one level, this is building on David Cameron\u2019s ambiguous stance on selection. Last October the then education secretary Nicky Morgan gave the go-ahead for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/oct/15/conservatives-green-light-first-selective-state-school-50-years\" title=\"\">new grammar \u201cannexe\u201d in Kent a full 10 miles from the main school</a>. May\u2019s strategy, with its further pledge to open new grammars, and possibly seeking to overturn the 1998 law banning them in order to do so, is even more radical, and will face correspondingly greater resistance. \u201cI simply can\u2019t see any way of persuading the Lords to vote for selection on any other basis,\u201d the note concludes.</p> <p>Condemnation came swiftly from Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the National Union of Teachers; but opposition to an expansion of grammar schools has united leading figures in education and on the political left and right, including the influential thinktanks Policy Exchange and Bright Blue, and the outgoing Ofsted chief, Michael Wilshaw.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A child\u2019s development score at just 22 months can serve as an accurate predictor of educational attainment at 26 years</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet a vital dimension is missing from the debate already raging within and beyond Westminster. The government is proposing a fresh crop of grammar schools as a way of boosting so-called social mobility, but May and her advisers seem to have forgotten that the government already has a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61964/opening-doors-breaking-barriers.pdf\" title=\"\">social mobility strategy, produced in 2011</a>, and it doesn\u2019t make a single mention of grammar schools. In fact, though it identifies four \u201ccritical points for social mobility\u201d, age 11 is not one of them.</p> <p>The evidence on grammars is by now crystal clear. The educational advantage received by those selected for these schools is more than outweighed by the drag effect of the remaining secondary modern pupils, who perform disproportionately badly. Only 3% of grammar school pupils receive free school meals, and even these will gain only a marginal uplift in GCSE grades. As the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Jeremy Warner says, grammars offer \u201csegregated education for the middle class\u201d. They are elitist institutions that entrench, rather than disrupt or disperse, privilege.</p> <p>But the evidence is equally clear on what does improve educational outcomes: high-quality support in the early years. According to Michael Pavey, director of <a href=\"https://laboursurestart.com/\" title=\"\">Labour Friends of Sure Start</a>, \u201cNeuroscience shows that a child\u2019s brain is approximately 25% formed at birth, and that by the age of three it is 80% formed. It is during this crucial time that gaps open up between children from different backgrounds.\u201d</p> <p>A child\u2019s development score at just 22 months can serve as an accurate predictor of educational attainment at 26 years. Forget the 11-plus: children from poorer homes are already playing catch-up by the time they start nursery.</p> <p>The government should understand this very well. Independent reports commissioned by the coalition government from Frank Field (2010), Dame Clare Tickell (2011) and Graham Allen (2011) all emphasised the overwhelming importance of the early years. And as the government\u2019s own social mobility strategy declared: \u201cChildren\u2019s life chances are most heavily influenced by their development in the first five years of life. By the time children start school there are already wide variations in ability between children from different backgrounds.\u201d So how does testing 10- and 11-year-olds help?</p> <p>There\u2019s been talk of introducing a small number of targeted grammar schools. But if the government is looking to test interventions, it should concentrate on the early years, targeting maternal health, school readiness, home environment and parenting skills.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/23/childcare-free-nursery-education\">Early years focus is right but it needs proper investment | Observer editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maybe this sounds familiar: yes, Sure Start children\u2019s centres, those much-valued community-based institutions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jan/28/sure-start-centres-closed-labour\" title=\"\">whose budgets have been halved during Theresa May\u2019s time in government</a>, forcing over 800 of them to close.</p> <p>An independent evaluation of Sure Start in 2012 noted that \u201cchildren\u2019s centres have been found to be immensely popular with parents, and have been successful in reaching the parents who are likely to be the most disadvantaged. Beneficial effects for parents persist at least two years after their last contact with Sure Start.\u201d</p> <p>Three years later, the independent charity 4Children found that 90% of parents reported that their children\u2019s centre had a positive impact on their child and 83% believed it had a positive impact on themselves; 80% said life would be harder for their family without their children\u2019s centre.</p> <p>The government will never improve the educational of lower-income families through the societal guillotine of the 11-plus. Grammar schools belong to the postwar world, when most young people tended to leave school at 15 and only 4% attended university. Not only do most people in education know that, so now does a substantial chunk of the Tory party.</p> <p>Equally, although Labour\u2019s pledges \u2013 to support and bolster a comprehensive system and restore the education maintenance allowance and student grants \u2013 are welcome, they still address only the symptom rather than the cause. To truly start to shift profound inequalities, we need to revolutionise support for the early years. In one respect, at least, secondary education is, well \u2026 secondary.</p>",

  "<p>So it can happen. The impossible can become not only possible but a done deed. As investors in Sports Direct gather for Wednesday\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.sportsdirectplc.com/investor-relations/2016-agm-information.aspx\" title=\"\">annual general meeting</a> at that now-infamous Shirebrook base, it\u2019s worth recalling how far discussion of this company and of major business has progressed. Almost exactly a year ago, the Telegraph published an interview with one of the retailer\u2019s biggest shareholders which attacked its critics as having a <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/11851239/Sports-Direct-shareholder-accuses-retailers-critics-of-fundamental-misunderstanding-of-capitalism.html\" title=\"\">\u201cfundamental illiteracy of capitalism\u201d</a>. The investor went on: \u201cUnions and capitalism are not a natural fit but it is important to remember that Sports Direct has not broken any laws.\u201d</p> <p>By that time, both Labour and the trade union Unite had been protesting at what it claimed were 20,000 staff on zero-hours contacts, and a few fund managers had got a bit antsy at the way the company was run. But one year later, it is almost impossible to imagine such sentiments being published. One big reason for that is contained in the chronology at the back of Tuesday\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.sportsdirectplc.com/~/media/Files/S/Sports-Direct/documents/sports-direct-international-plc-working-practices-report-6-sep-2016.pdf\" title=\"\">report into Sports Direct\u2019s working practices</a>. The first 30 years of the company are dispensed with in just five lines. Then comes the line for September 2015: \u201cSeries of articles about SD\u2019s working practices are published in the Guardian.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\" title=\"\">December 2015</a>: \u201cFurther articles about SD\u2019s working practices are published in the Guardian.\u201d The timeline makes more mention of this newspaper than it does of Mike Ashley, the company\u2019s de facto boss.</p> <p>Those 2015 articles gave the lie to that fund manager\u2019s comments. Along with the investigations that followed, they showed that laws had indeed been broken at Sports Direct \u2013 as it now admits. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\" title=\"\">Staff had been paid less than minimum wage</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/21/gig-economy-workers-sports-direct\" title=\"\">Female workers had been invited to perform sexual favours</a> in return for contracts. The articles showed that meaningful labour representation \u2013 through trade unions and other institutions \u2013 can fit very well with capitalism, by preventing such abuses. And they showed that concerns about working practices and corporate governance are not the product of some failure to understand capitalism \u2013 far from it. At the time that Telegraph article was published, shares in Sports Direct were changing hands at \u00a38 a go. Nestled in the FTSE 100, it was the discount retailer to watch. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/sep/06/sports-direct-review-brexit-builders-stock-markets-live\" title=\"\">Now shares trade for around \u00a33.50</a> and the firm has slid into the FTSE 250 midcap index.

What all these cases affirm is a truth that the anonymous fund manager and his cohort have spent decades denying. Businesses need a social licence to operate.

But as with any executive, Mr Ashley doesn\u2019t get unilaterally to define his social licence. The report makes important admissions and proposes guaranteeing hours to some staff. But it was drafted by a solicitors\u2019 firm that Sports Direct has previously retained. Investors should support the motion calling for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/06/ashley-sports-direct-tame-report-employees\" title=\"\">a full independent review</a> \u2013 which looks at the excessive reliance on agency work. They should vote out Mr Hellawell, who is plainly out of his depth. And they should remember there\u2019s more at stake for Sports Direct than a few highly paid, highly docile executives. A lot more.</p>",
  "<p>The home secretary, Amber Rudd, is to be questioned about the future of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse after the outgoing chair said its scale and aspirations were impossible to manage in its current form.</p> <p>Dame Lowell Goddard sent a 10-page critique of the setup of the inquiry to the home affairs select committee, calling for a complete review and remodelling to focus it \u201cmore towards current events and thus focusing major attention on the present and future protection of children\u201d.</p> <p>However, Goddard has declined a request to appear before the committee on Wednesday to discuss her resignation.

Rudd promptly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/11/child-abuse-inquiry-prof-alexis-jay-to-take-over-from-lowell-goddard\">replaced her with Prof Alexis Jay</a>, a distinguished social worker and inquiry member. The home secretary wrote to the committee saying that she could not delay the appointment because it was essential to maintain the confidence of the alleged victims and survivors of abuse.</p> <p>Jay quickly rejected the call for a complete overhaul and said she wanted to reassure victims and survivors that the inquiry panel would not be seeking any revision of its terms of reference or introduce any new restrictions on its scope.</p> <p>\u201cTo ensure that the inquiry can meet the challenges it faces, I have already initiated a wide-ranging internal review of the inquiry\u2019s ways of working and we are currently looking at different approaches to evaluating the information we receive,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She said they were committed to ensuring the inquiry could be concluded within a reasonable time and with a \u201cconstant eye\u201d on the cost to the public purse.</p> <p>Goddard said in her memo published on Tuesday that the overall size and complexity of the inquiry\u2019s terms of reference \u2013 which stretch back more than 60 years and span institutions including the church, councils, schools and Westminster \u2013 posed an unprecedented organisational challenge for a public inquiry. <br></p> <p>\u201cThat means that, in reality, the terms of reference in their totality cannot be met,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWith the benefit of hindsight \u2013 or more realistically \u2013 the benefit of experience, it is clear there is an inherent problem in the sheer scale and size of the inquiry (which its budget does not match) and therefore in its manageability. </p> <p>\u201cIts boundless compass, including as it does, every state and non-state institution, as well as relevant institutional contexts, coupled with the absence of any built-in time parameters, does not fit comfortably or practically within the single inquiry model in which it currently resides. Nor is delivery on the limitless extent of all of the aspirations in its terms of reference possible in any cohesive or comprehensive manner.\u201d<br></p> <p>The inquiry has a budget of \u00a317.9m for 2015-16 and was initially expected to run for five years, but there have been suggestions it could take a decade to complete at a cost of up to \u00a3100m.</p> <p>Goddard said the smaller-scale Australian royal commission into institutional child sexual abuse was given twice the amount of funding. More could be learned from that inquiry, she said, in particular its ability to delegate its hearing responsibilities and its conduct of private sessions to ensure victims and survivors were heard.</p> <p>She recommended the re-establishment of a separate truth project, modelled on the Australian commission, which could fulfil the pledge to hear survivors\u2019 cases, with their information being fed into the main inquiry and individual stories being published anonymously.</p> <p>This aspect of the inquiry needed to be seriously rethought and, while support was in place for survivors who wanted to share their experiences confidentially, \u201cthe experience is not a therapeutic exercise\u201d and could not provide long-term support, she said.</p> <p>\u201cI have recommended in my report to the home secretary that my departure provides a timely opportunity to undertake a complete review of the inquiry in its present form, with a view to remodelling it and recalibrating its emphasis more towards current events and thus focusing major attention on the present and future protection of children,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>Goddard, 67, stepped down in August, hours after it was reported that she had spent three months of her first year in the job either on holiday or overseas, primarily in New Zealand. She had been appointed, with an annual pay and benefits package worth \u00a3500,000, after May\u2019s two earlier choices for the post also resigned prematurely.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"502c7592d0dcc21d03ff1e852c672bb8f1dad72e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/502c7592d0dcc21d03ff1e852c672bb8f1dad72e/0_730_2840_2837/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexis Jay.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexis Jay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Hunter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In her memo, Goddard responded to the reports, saying that in the 16 months she spent as chair \u201cthere has never been a time when the inquiry and its objectives did not dominate my life\u201d. She added: \u201cI made a firm commitment to undertake it and was determined to see it through to its conclusion. I am disappointed that this has not been possible. </p> <p>\u201cIt was never easy operating in an environment in which I had no familiar networks and there were times when it seemed a very lonely mission. However, I am pleased I was able to set it on its way. Ultimately, however, I had to face a situation which I could not solve and which would continue unless challenged. I resigned to make that challenge occur.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokeswoman said the inquiry had a vital role to play in exposing the failure of major organisations to prevent systemic child abuse.</p> <p>\u201cOur commitment to this inquiry is undiminished. We owe it to victims and survivors to confront the appalling reality of how children were let down by the very people who were charged to protect them and to learn from the mistakes of the past,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She said Jay had \u201ca strong track record in uncovering the truth and it is essential that she is able to get on with the important job of delivering justice to those that deserve it\u201d.</p> <h2>Charities and survivors respond to Goddard\u2019s memo</h2> <p>While the new chair of the inquiry sought to reassure victims that its scope would not be limited, others suggested that concerns raised in Goddard\u2019s memo should not be ignored.</p> <p>Gabrielle Shaw, chief executive of the <a href=\"http://napac.org.uk/\">National Association for People Abused in Childhood</a> (Napac), said that while she did not believe the inquiry was \u201cdoomed to failure\u201d, Goddard\u2019s comments should be taken onboard.</p> <p>\u201cWe still very much support this inquiry, but that doesn\u2019t mean we have an idealistic view of it,\u201d she said. \u201cCould it be run better? Could it be improved? Yes. Let\u2019s learn from her comments and expertise rather than casting her as a failure.\u201d<br></p> <p></p> <p>Shaw added: \u201cI don\u2019t know if [Goddard] is right, but I very much think she is right to raise the question [...] I don\u2019t think there needs to be a total overhaul, but I think her points should be taken onboard and if there are improvements that can be made, let\u2019s make them.\u201d <br></p> <p>Others have been less nuanced. The former director of public prosecutions Lord Macdonald, who previously called chairing the inquiry \u201cnot so much a poisoned chalice as a lethal injection\u201d, has argued that the inquiry is in danger of \u201ctaking years to confirm what we already know\u201d. <br></p> <p>Its scope had \u201cbecome an investigation into 60 years of everything everywhere\u201d and was now \u201cthe enemy of a useful outcome\u201d, he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to learn from the past without obsessing over it to the exclusion of making a better future. So its terms of reference should be urgently rewritten to focus on policy and legal reforms that will best protect children in the future.\u201d</p> <p>However, the founder of Napac, Pete Saunders, who sits on the the inquiry\u2019s survivors panel, said the scale of the inquiry matched the scale of abuse \u2013 both historic and current. \u201c[Goddard] is not wrong, it\u2019s a huge undertaking \u2013 but the inquiry is not too big. To say that is to deny the scale of the problem. If to do it properly needs more resources and time, then that is what must happen.\u201d</p> <p>Setting clear parameters so that victims are clear about the role of the inquiry would help, said Shaw. \u201cSome victims and survivors may have thought that this is their chance to have their own case heard and resolved, but the inquiry was set up to look at what went wrong more generally in the institutional setting and how this could be avoided in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Goddard\u2019s suggestion that a separate truth project, modelled on the Australian commission, could be set up to hear survivors stories and provide support was worth considering, she said. \u201cWe need to make sure people are well looked after before, during and after,\u201d she said. \u201cWe already know from our helpline that when survivors do reach out the services they can turn to are woefully inadequate.\u201d</p> <p>But Goddard\u2019s call for the inquiry to be remodelled to focus it \u201cmore towards current events and thus focusing major attention on the present and future protection of children\u201d was criticised by some survivors of child abuse.</p> <p>Andrew Lavery, spokesman for the survivors group <a href=\"http://www.whiteflowersalba.org.uk/\">White Flowers Alba</a>, who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/may/25/fort-augustus-abbey-school-abuse-allegations\">spoken about being abused</a> at a Catholic boarding school in the Highlands of Scotland, said the comments were \u201cdemeaning\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHow can you look at the future if you do not look at what happened in the past?\u201d he said. \u201c[Goddard] was paid a lot of money, she buggered off and we\u2019ve been let down.\u201d</p> <p>Lavery said he was unconvinced by Jay\u2019s attempt to calm the waters by announcing an internal review. \u201cWe desperately want this inquiry to succeed, but at the moment it\u2019s like we\u2019re on a plane, but we don\u2019t know where it is going.\u201d </p> <p><strong>Alexandra Topping</strong></p>",

  "<p>The Metropolitan police have said they will pause plans to introduce spit hoods after a torrent of criticism from human rights groups.</p> <p>The Guardian understands that the Met failed to tell the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, about the controversial scheme that was due to start within weeks. </p> <p>A spokesperson for the mayor\u2019s office for policing and crime \u2013 which supposedly oversees the Met \u2013 said: \u201cThe mayor has not been consulted about this decision, and we will be looking into the details of the scheme before the pilot starts.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday the Guardian reported that the spit hoods, which the Met calls spit guards, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/06/met-police-to-start-using-spit-hoods-on-suspects-within-weeks\" draggable=\"true\">would be introduced by Britain\u2019s biggest force</a> in October.</p> <p>The Met says the restraint devices are necessary to protect officers from prisoners who try to spit at or bite them, exposing them to the risk of serious infection.<br></p> <p>The Met was planning to start using them in 32 police station detention areas across <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a> in a pilot scheme. On Tuesday, the Met announced a pause to the plans while it consulted further.</p> <p>It said it had taken the decision in February to pilot the spit hoods, and claimed to have held consultations.</p> <p>But in a statement the Met said: \u201cHowever, with a new administration coming into City Hall since then, the MPS [Metropolitan police service] has listened to concerns and will consult further before starting any pilot.\u201d</p> <p>The mesh hoods have proved controversial, and there have been claims that they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/aug/29/uk-police-forces-under-pressure-to-stop-using-spit-hoods\">breach suspects\u2019 rights</a> and could even be dangerous.<br></p> <p>Spitting at officers exposes them to risks of contracting hepatitis and such \u201cattacks\u201d by suspects have led to police taking powerful antiviral drugs as a precaution.</p> <p>The Met in its statement laid out its view of the background to the pilot, which could have gone on to clear the way for officers on the street to be issued with spit hoods.<br></p> <p>The Met said: \u201cA pilot within the controlled environment of custody suites had been arranged for October. This was agreed by the MPS policy forum in February, which is made up of officers and staff from across the organisation.</p> <p>\u201cA consultation process regarding their use has taken place and involved community advisers from Newham\u2019s independent advisory group, in addition to local magistrates and judicial staff.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the London mayor\u2019s office for policing and crime said: \u201cAny attack on officers carrying out their duties is completely unacceptable, and the use of protective equipment is sometimes necessary. The decision on whether to use intrusive tactics is a highly emotive one and should be informed by public engagement. We will be discussing the details with the Met and will consult closely with them, and see what further consultation may be appropriate, ahead of any pilot.\u201d</p> <p> The Met had previously opposed the use of the restraint devices, and some police chiefs have privately expressed concerns that they are reminiscent of hoods used at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.</p> <p>The Met\u2019s plan to introduce them was condemned by the human rights group Amnesty International, the civil rights group Liberty and the campaign group Inquest, which helps those who claim to have suffered at police hands.</p> <p>In response to the Met police\u2019s suspension of the planned pilot, Amnesty International UK\u2019s arms programme director, Oliver Sprague, said: \u201cWe\u2019re relieved that the Met police has decided to put the brakes on what was a very controversial decision.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s urgently needed now is detailed national guidance on how these restraints can be used, the exact models which are used by all forces and assurances that this barbaric equipment will only be used when absolutely necessary.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/police\">Police</a> Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, has called for the use of the hoods to protect police. The Met says the deployment of the hoods will be classed as a use of force by an officer.</p> <p>Before the Met announced that it was not going ahead with the pilot, Martha Spurrier, the director of Liberty, said: \u201cA spit hood is a primitive, cruel and degrading tool that inspires fear and anguish. We have seen many cases where the police use them unnecessarily and without justification, including on children and disabled people.</p> <p>\u201cPolice have the power to use force against citizens when they have to \u2013 using handcuffs, arm restraints, leg restraints, pepper spray, batons. The suggestion that officers need to be able to cover people\u2019s faces and heads is as far-fetched as it is frightening. Spit hoods belong in horror stories, not on the streets of a civilised society.\u201d</p>",

He welcomed Rudd to her role and asked about terrorism suspects who had fled Britain while on police bail to join Islamic State. Vaz made no mention of the newspaper reports.</p> <p>Vaz could face an investigation by the commissioner for standards over the newspaper claims. It was alleged that he met male eastern European sex workers at a flat he owns in north London. According to the paper, Vaz asked one of the men in a text message sent before the encounter to bring poppers.</p> <p>Vaz had argued in parliament that poppers should not be included in a list of substances banned by the 2016 Psychoactive Substances Act.

  "<p>Europe has met a landmark goal of slashing its energy consumption six years ahead of time, cutting greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-efficiency\">switching off about 400 power stations</a>.</p> <p>In 2014, the EU\u2019s 28 member countries consumed 72m tonnes of oil equivalent less than had been projected for 2020, according to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/news/eu-final-energy-consumption-below-2020-targets\">a report</a> by the EU\u2019s science arm, the Joint Research Centre (JRC).

Energy efficiency works \u2013 and it\u2019s time the government committed to at least match the ambition of energy saving actions taken by the rest of Europe.\u201d</p> <p>Several EU directives maligned by Eurosceptics and industry groups played a key role in reaching the non-binding efficiency target of reducing final energy use 20% by 2020 compared with projected use that year, according to the report. These included laws on energy efficiency, eco-design, buildings performance and fuel economy.</p> <p>By contrast, the fast-growing service sector, which was left untouched by EU directives, recorded a 16.5% spike in energy use.</p> <p>Adrian Joyce, the secretary general of EuroAce, the building efficiency group, said: \u201cThe building sector made a massive contribution to this achievement, particularly residential buildings, which politicians see as the toughest part to reach.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople might find it incredible that we reached our final energy use target ahead of the deadline but it is a demonstration of what good EU policy can achieve.\u201d</p> <p>The EU has set a 27% efficiency goal for 2030, and could potentially increase it next month when the commission brings forward a raft of efficiency measures. </p> <p>The focus will be on updating buildings and efficiency directives, with an outside chance that the eco-design plan could also be published.</p> <p>That blueprint, with its widely trailed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/28/eu-inefficient-toasters-ban-delayed-avoid-pro-brexit-press-attack\">short-circuiting of wasteful toasters</a>, was delayed by fears that tabloids would campaign over the issue during the EU referendum.</p> <p>Eurosceptics and environmentalists may at least be united in pointing to the JRC report\u2019s cautioning that financial crisis played a part in several countries\u2019 reductions in energy use. \u201cIt has contributed to get energy consumption back on track towards the EU energy and environmental targets for 2020,\u201d the study said.</p> <p>Pieter de Pous, policy director at the European Environment Bureau, said: \u201cWe need a real decoupling of energy use from economic growth or the moment the economy picks up, we will be back to square one.\u201d</p> <p>While the EU met its final energy use target in 2014, it was 1.5% shy of its primary energy goal, which could yet be affected by any squandering of energy in the next five years.</p> <p> \u201cWithout the economic crisis we would not be here,\u201d said Monica Frassoni, the president of the European Alliance to Save Energy. \u201cWe need more measures and stringent targets.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Many state schools with solar panels are set to be hit with a tax hike, according to government plans, but private schools, free schools and academies will not be affected due to their charitable status. </p> <p>Campaigners say the move will end the installation of solar energy for most schools.</p> <p>The government proposes to <a href=\"http://www.solar-trade.org.uk/business-rates-self-owned-rooftop/\">end an exemption for small solar panel installations</a> (less than 50 kilowatts) and charge business rates on them from April 2017. The charity <a href=\"http://1010uk.org/\">10:10</a> has calculated this will cost schools more than \u00a3820 a year for the average 10kW installation and, combined with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/17/uk-solar-panel-subsidies-slashed-paris-climate-change\">recent cuts to the subsidy</a> paid for rooftop solar energy, make future projects risky or uneconomic.</p> <p>As recently as September 2015, schools could expect to pay back the costs of installation in five to eight years, but the new regime would mean payback times of at least 12 years and perhaps never, 10:10 says.</p> <p>The changes to subsidies, which are estimated to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/25/solar-subsidy-cuts-lead-to-loss-of-12000-jobs\">cost 12,000 jobs nationwide</a>, have already forced 10:10 to close its Solar Schools programme, which had installed more than 2,000 panels on 80 schools since 2011, working with more than 30,000 pupils.</p> <p>\u201cThis new tax hike is just nonsensical,\u201d said Cecily Spelling, at 10:10. \u201cIt\u2019s punishing those that have already installed solar and discouraging more in the future. It\u2019s about so much more than just generating energy - it brings communities together and gets people excited about the positive things they can do to tackle climate change. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also a brilliant resource for science, technology and maths education. It\u2019s so sad that only a very few, select schools will be able to experience this kind of solar-powered magic in the future.

Not only will we struggle to break even on our investment, but by the exemption of schools with charitable status you are creating a two tier system which penalises local authority schools. I urge [ministers] to rethink this rash decision.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.freewatt.co.uk/case-studies\">Winchester College is among the private schools which recently installed solar energy</a>, adding 500 panels to its rooftops.</p> <p>Samantha Williams, headteacher of Middleton primary school in Leeds, said: \u201cInstalling solar on our roof has been a great thing for the school, the pupils and the community. The changes to the feed-in tariff were bad enough but the new business rates being thrown into the mix too will stop schools in their tracks and punish those around the country who have already done the right thing and installed.\u201d</p> <p>The proposed change in business rates will also affect many solar installations on commercial buildings larger than the 50kW exemption, hiking up charges by six to eight times, <a href=\"http://www.solar-trade.org.uk/business-rates-self-owned-rooftop/\">according to the Solar Trade Association</a> (STA). The STA says there are already 23,000 non-domestic rooftop installations that would be affected and is calling on the government to make all self-owned rooftop solar panels exempt from business rates.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cSolar deployment is a UK success story with almost 11GW of capacity now installed, and the government is committed to providing secure, clean and affordable energy now and in the future.\u201d</p> <p>He said: \u201cBusiness rates are based on valuations from the independent Valuation Office Agency.

  "<p>Babies born by caesarean section are more likely to be obese as adults, according to a study that suggests the way we are born could have a lasting impact on health.<br></p> <p>Birth by caesarean was linked to a 15% higher risk of obesity in children compared with vaginal birth.</p> <p>The scientists involved believe that babies born by caesarean miss out on exposure to bacteria in the birth canal that colonise the baby\u2019s gut and may ultimately change the body\u2019s metabolic rate - and even how hungry we feel.</p> <p>Audrey Gaskins, an epidemiologist at Harvard University and co-author of the new study, said: \u201cChildren born via C-section harbour less diverse gut bacteria and these patterns of less diversity have been linked to increased capacity for energy harvest by the gut microbiota. You can think of it as a slower metabolism.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/may/23/health-birth-obesity-caesarean-nhs\">Previous studies</a> have found the same link, but were less able to rule out other factors, such as the mother\u2019s weight or health. </p> <p>The latest research, which included 22,068 children born to 15,271 women, suggests that the link is not simply explained by overweight women or those with pregnancy complications such as high blood pressure being more likely to deliver by caesarean. </p> <p>The link remained after maternal weight was taken into account, and was more striking when siblings who had different types of births were compared.</p> <p>Within families, children born by caesarean were 64% more likely to be obese than their siblings born by vaginal delivery. \u201cWith siblings, they have the same mother and home environment so the genetics, the feeding environment, are all controlled for,\u201d said Dr Gaskins.</p> <p>The average difference in weight endured into early adulthood and added on average 0.3 points to a person\u2019s body mass index (BMI) .</p> <p>There is growing evidence that the internal ecosystem of bacteria that colonises our gut can have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/25/gut-reaction-surprising-power-of-microbes\">profound implications for health</a>, influencing our metabolism, diabetes risk and even our mental health.</p> <p>The latest study stopped short of proving that caesarean delivery causes the higher obesity risk, however. The study did not measure gut bacteria in the participants to prove it was different, and other factors may have contributed to the link. </p> <p>For instance, babies born via caesarean are less likely to be breastfed, which also influences gut bacteria and protects against obesity.</p> <p>The participants in the study, published on Tuesday in the journal <a href=\"http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2548440\">JAMA Pediatrics</a>, were followed up with questionnaires over 20 years. Those born via caesarean were on average 0.3 BMI points heavier.</p> <p>Simon Cork, a biomedical scientist at Imperial College London, said that there may be a link between caesarean and obesity, but that at present it is \u201cneither fully proven nor understood\u201d. \u201cMost often caesarean births are as a result of medical necessity, rather than elective,\u201d he added, \u201cand as such, this risk would outweigh any concerns mothers should have regarding the possibility of future weight issues.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Daghni Rajasingham, spokeswoman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: \u201cCurrently in England, the rate of caesarean section is 26.2%; this figure has been rising slowly over the last decade and could be explained by various factors which make childbirth more difficult, including a rise in older mothers and more obese mothers. We must remember that in some cases an emergency caesarean section is carried out to save the life of the mother or baby\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>For me, it\u2019s marshmallows. The moment I catch the scent of powdered sugar I remember lying with my head in my grandmother\u2019s lap as a child. For Benjamin Loyaut\u00e9, it\u2019s apple-flavoured sticks from Rouen that exert the Proustian pull, transporting him back to his Normandy childhood and squabbles with his twin sister over the sugary treats.</p> <p>Sweets may be universal, but the nostalgia they hold is intense and intimate, which is why \u2013 says Loyaut\u00e9 \u2013 they are the perfect vehicle for his long-term project to highlight the \u201cimmaterial heritage\u201d of Syria. With a man-bun and a curator\u2019s love of critical theory, the Brussels based artist and designer makes an unexpected confectioner. Yet when we meet in the foyer of his London hotel, on the table in front of us are little packets of pink candies created to his exacting specifications. </p> <p>At first glance they could be the cheap sweets sold by Syrian street vendors, except that each is shaped to resemble an \u201ceye idol\u201d \u2013 those ancient Syrian figurines whose use and meaning archaeologists are still debating. Loyaut\u00e9 describes his sweets as \u201ctransmitter objects\u201d \u2013 everyday things with \u201ca real value and symbolic value linked to emotion, history, heritage\u201d. In other words, as it says on one of his text paintings: \u201ccandy keeps the past alive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne woman said she never ate these candies because they are sold on dusty trolleys \u2013 they are not for rich people,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt was only when they started disappearing from the streets thanks to the war, that she realised: \u2018I miss them\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t wait any longer and break off our chat to open the simple plastic packet and pop one in my mouth. The soft texture yields an intense burst of sugar and rose. For an artwork, they are pretty delicious. And at this month\u2019s London Design Biennale, visitors will get their own chance to scoff. Loyaut\u00e9\u2019s exhibit includes \u201ca practical sculpture\u201d, otherwise known as a vending machine. For \u00a35, it will dispense a packet of the sweets and design buffs will be invited \u201cto do their bit\u201d. </p> <p>The money put into the machine will directly transfer to the <a href=\"https://mosaicinitiative.org.uk/\">Mosaic initiative</a>, a small London-based charity which distributes aid, both within Syria and to educational projects for Syrian refugees elsewhere. If Loyaut\u00e9 has his way, it will be only the first step in a Willy Wonka-ish ambition to bring people together through sweets. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e809deb7ef1ed237681207524d786bc603c1bfa0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e809deb7ef1ed237681207524d786bc603c1bfa0/0_0_8389_6711/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Astounding Eyes of Syria installation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Candy keeps the past alive ...

I am a dreamer, but if I sell 100,000 in two years that\u2019s something tangible,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These Louloupti sweets are an ambassador for a way of living ... in Syria people want to share</p> <footer> <cite>Benjamin Loyaut\u00e9</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the heart of the London exhibition is his film, The Astounding Eyes of Syria, shot in the Bequaa Valley refugee camp, which lies in the \u201cred zone\u201d of Lebanon\u2019s border with Syria. Loyaut\u00e9 travelled to the camp last winter with Syrian and Lebanese friends, rather than an NGO, so he could quietly meet families. The result is a heartbreaking 20 minutes of Syrians talking about the sweets they miss. Focusing on this tiny, delicious detail of their former lives highlights how much the war has swept away: a living culture, close-knit communities, simple pleasures.</p> <p>Loyaut\u00e9 says the families \u2013 some of whom he remains close to \u2013 enjoyed the chance to discuss happy memories. \u201cThere are always westerners who want to film the dust and the horror. They were thankful to shine a smile inside the horror, because that does exist,\u201d he insists. \u201cWe can destroy buildings and kill humans, but we can\u2019t erase the living heritage; the memory of things, the culture, the civilisation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bd3bd024d90681148a9f14a9f743db094ed5149b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd3bd024d90681148a9f14a9f743db094ed5149b/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Astounding Eyes of Syria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A smile inside the horror\u2019 \u2026 a still from The Astounding Eyes of Syria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Benjamin Loyaut\u00e9 Studio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One father, Hanadi Abbas, talks of the penny sweets he used to buy to give to guests or relatives. Today a bag costs \u00a310 to \u00a320. A woman shows the camera a plastic box of baking moulds she saved during her flight to the camp. Bringing out a biscuit cutter, she remembers baking her husband heart-shaped biscuits. \u201cHe asked, \u2018Why so many tiny hearts?\u2019 I said, \u2018Because I love you.\u2019\u201d A mother of three, Hani Koubaisi remembers how, on feast days, she would invite neighbours to her house for homemade pastries. If she had fallen out with one of them, it was a chance \u201cto make peace\u201d. Now, she says sadly, \u201cIt\u2019s all been lost and we will never get it back.\u201d</p> <p>Interspersed with their stories are fictional scenes: a sweet seller in an empty shop; one of the traditional ice-cream makers Damascus is famous for, making rhythmical music as he pounds the dessert. They bring the sights and sounds of Syria to life. For Loyaut\u00e9, sweets also represent the generosity of Syrians, a theme he returns to repeatedly. \u201cLouloupti is an ambassador for a way of living in Syria \u2013 sharing sweets in the street. In Syria people want to share.\u201d Even in the camp, he says, he noticed this reflex. When he went to a small shop to buy sweets to take to the families he was visiting, the shopkeeper \u201chad nothing and was very poor \u2026 but he didn\u2019t want to take my money.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da741e53889ad255da6f182ba2662d41f3de89e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da741e53889ad255da6f182ba2662d41f3de89e4/0_0_3264_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Candy colours ... a Syrian sweet shop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Candy colours ... a Syrian sweet shop</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lens Young Dimashqi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s not hard to see how passionate Loyaut\u00e9 is about Syria.

And it is a figure that has been rising steadily since 2003, happily overtaking economic downturns. F1, it seems, is the sport that just keeps paying out.</p> <p>It certainly did for CVC. In 2014, the company had made $8.2bn since its initial investment of $2bn in 2006. The sale will likely make it the most profitable deal in the investment house\u2019s history.</p> <p>At the head of this remarkable bucking of global financial doom and gloom has, of course, been Bernie Ecclestone, the chief executive of the group that holds the sport\u2019s commercial rights. It has been his expansion into new markets that has put the hammer down on F1\u2019s profits. Around half of the revenue is from the fees circuits pay to host races. The sport\u2019s massive global appeal \u2013 450 million viewers \u2013 has made it hugely popular with countries that want to put themselves on the map and promote a positive image \u2013 often in the face of noticeably poor public perception.

Why, Helen? All I ever did was love you. Was that so very wrong?\u201d What a performance. Let\u2019s hope the jury can see through it \u2013 or are Archers fans. If they have been listening to the Radio 4 drama over the past year, they will be well aware why Helen stabbed Rob one night at Blossom Hill cottage, leaving him close to death in a pool of his own blood on the kitchen floor. Ever since they got married last summer, Rob has been systematically abusing Helen psychologically, physically and sexually.

Or, \u2018When you were interviewed for your new job, did you go in with a stick?\u2019\u201d says Mackie. That\u2019s the sort of information Tregorran should have been furnished with, mainly by a solicitor, but she could have picked up snippets of information about him in Ambridge, where she is staying with her mother.</p> <p>\u201cIf Anna could have established early on that he was a liar about the degree of his incapacity, then that puts into doubt everything he says after that. This stick business was a complete gift for the defence, and she didn\u2019t appear to notice.\u201d</p> <p>To be fair, says Mackie, it doesn\u2019t sound as if the cross-examination has finished (the trial lasts all week). There is an art to it \u2013 imagine cross-examination as if it\u2019s a box. \u201cOne question builds one wall, the next builds another wall and, finally, you\u2019ve got the person boxed in and there\u2019s no way out.\u201d She didn\u2019t do any preparatory cross-examination, says Mackie, but just went straight in and told him he was a bully. \u201cShe didn\u2019t really put any facts to him.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One of the awful things that happens to women who are victims of abuse is they blame themselves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Tregorran has experience prosecuting abusive men, so \u201cshe knows what he\u2019s like, she knows the type of man he is, she has professional and possibly personal experience of men of that character, but she doesn\u2019t appear to have worked out the way of dealing with that kind of person. She let him rant on, when one of the main skills of the cross-examiner is to control a witness, so they don\u2019t have the opportunity to rant on.\u201d</p> <p>Helen hasn\u2019t been the most cooperative client and hasn\u2019t given her barrister a great deal to go on. This isn\u2019t unusual in a case of abuse, says Mackie. \u201cOne of the awful things that happens to women who are victims of abuse is they blame themselves, and Rob and people like him play into that. Helen will be feeling very ashamed \u2013 of having been raped, of having being struck, of having been frightened. Those things are terribly difficult for anyone to admit to, particularly somebody who has had their confidence reduced. Rob has systematically dismantled her as an independent woman and she is finding it difficult to disclose everything she has to. Probably because she doesn\u2019t believe it as well.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/03/archers-helen-titchener-trial-courtroom-artist-julia-quenzler-sketches\">Renowned courtroom artist draws Helen Titchener\u2019s trial for the Archers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But her barrister should have, at an early stage, had a psychological assessment done for Helen. \u201cThere are psychologists who are very experienced in what we used to call battered women\u2019s syndrome. Anna should have got some ammunition for herself so that then she could explain things.\u201d In the prosecution\u2019s opening statement, there was already mention of how Helen didn\u2019t call an ambulance for her husband, and she will almost certainly be cross-examined \u201con the basis she was completely callous and intended him to die. A psychologist\u2019s report could explain that was the normal reaction of a woman whose child had been threatened and her primary aim was to protect the child. But Anna hasn\u2019t got the information.\u201d</p> <p>How will the jury react over the course of the week? It\u2019s impossible to say, says Mackie. \u201cThere is a theory that juries are harder on women, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right,\u201d she says. \u201cIf Helen comes over as sympathetic and truthful \u2026 I don\u2019t think juries get things wrong very often.\u201d But a huge amount depends on her barrister\u2019s performance. \u201cIf she carries on as she is, I\u2019m frightened for Helen,\u201d says Mackie. Most barristers would do a far better job, and it has been irritating to listen to it as a lawyer, but one of the most cathartic things, she says, \u201cis shouting at the radio\u201d. <strong>ES</strong></p> <h2>The counsellor: \u2018I wish they hadn\u2019t made Helen stab Rob\u2019</h2> <p>Like everyone else I have been shouting at the radio. I think [the writers] have handled it very well, but I wish they hadn\u2019t made Helen stab Rob, because incidences of female victims being violent are very rare. I have worked with thousands of women and there have only been a couple of times when one has hit back or thrown something. The plot started off extremely slowly, and coercive control does not start suddenly \u2013 it is a slow, drip effect, so subtle you can\u2019t put your finger on what is happening. It\u2019s only with hindsight you see what has been building.<br></p> <p>Rob charmed the people around Helen, and isolated her \u2013 making it seem that everything was down to Helen\u2019s hormones and state of mind. There is often a wily manipulativeness at play \u2013 you see it with the way perpetrators interact with social services. They come across as perfect, concerned fathers and draw people in. Many women who come to our groups will say it is the only place they have been where \u201cpeople have believed me, or didn\u2019t think I was insane\u201d.</p> <p>Helen began to believe Rob herself, which I absolutely see with survivors. The women talk about how they felt they were going mad, even after the abuser had gone. Many of the women who come to my group have escaped abuse years ago, but are still recovering because coercive control causes so much damage. Survivors have to rebuild the trust in themselves, and in their own minds. Self-blame and self-doubt is one of the hardest things to overcome. And a lack of trust in others can also take time to rebuild.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/05/the-archers-storyline-have-you-been-affected-by-domestic-violence\">The Archers storyline: Have you been affected by domestic violence?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I often see cases where the children are either in the care of the abuser \u2013 as with Helen\u2019s son Henry \u2013 or the abuser is allowed unsupervised contact. The victim often has to jump through hoops to prove she is protecting the children, while everyone seems to forget they are only at risk because the perpetrator is abusive. And the perpetrator can use the child contact time to ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s mummy doing?\u201d, \u201cWho\u2019s mummy seeing?\u201d</p> <p>Rob stopped Helen from driving, which I have also seen. Some women are stopped from working, or going to college. Others aren\u2019t allowed to go to a doctor\u2019s appointment alone. I used to do crisis work with women at high risk and sometimes it would be hard to speak to a victim because the abuser would always answer the phone, monitor their calls and check their texts.</p> <p>The storyline where Helen cooks Rob tuna, which he doesn\u2019t like, chimes with the women I have seen. Some women would get into trouble for making tea incorrectly \u2013 the way the abuser liked it made would change every time they made it. The pettiness is a way of showing how he has complete control.</p> <p>One thing that frightened me was when Helen told Rob she wanted to leave. That is the most dangerous time for women, and when they are most likely to get killed. If I was working with a woman before she had left, I would make it clear that would not be safe or advisable thing to do. Women should wait until an abuser is out and, if possible, leave an emergency bag with someone safe.</p> <p><strong>AT</strong> (as told to Homa Khaleeli)</p> <p><em>Anat Toffell is a group facilitator for Solace Women\u2019s Aid, an independent charity working across London to provide life-saving support to more than 11,000 women and child survivors of domestic and sexual violence a year.</em></p> <h2>The prison expert: \u2018Helen will know that she is in a minority of women prisoners facing a long sentence\u2019</h2> <p>The Archers\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/03/the-week-in-radio-archers-helen-titchener-trial\">Helen Titchener</a> should soon learn her fate. If the jury find her guilty of attempting to kill her husband, she will return to prison, and it is likely she would serve at least six years. Whatever happens, in one sense, she will have been lucky. The obvious site for her incarceration, HM Prison Eastwood Park, midway between Gloucester and Bristol, is in easy travelling distance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/03/ambridge-a-bit-too-eastenders\">Ambridge</a>. Most women sent to jail finish up many miles from friends and family. And Eastwood Park, where she will have been since her arrest, has a mother and baby unit, one of the six women\u2019s jails in England to cater for women giving birth. (There are no women\u2019s prisons in Wales.)<br></p> <p>Eastwood Park is high security, cellular accommodation, surrounded by high, razor-wire-topped fences. It holds up to 360 prisoners, on remand and convicted, some serving long sentences. Each room in its mother and baby unit is self-contained and left unlocked at night. There is a TV lounge with comfortable sofas, a nursery and a sand pit with tiny chairs and tables.</p> <p>Helen will probably know by now that she is in a minority of women in prison of women prisoners in facing a long sentence \u2013 around half serve less than three months. Around half, too, of female prisoners are serving time for theft. Less than 20% have committed violent offences.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97756ac306ec178feeb94abea98654be7b58de11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97756ac306ec178feeb94abea98654be7b58de11/0_52_5126_3076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women in jail tend to look after each other better than their male counterparts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women in prison tend to look after each other better than their male counterparts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Aitchison/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As well as the shock of incarceration, Helen will have faced an enormous culture change. Some 52% of women in prison reported having used heroin, crack or cocaine in the weeks before they entered custody (not much of that in Ambridge, I\u2019d imagine).</p> <p>She will have found sympathy; women in jail tend to look after each other better than their male counterparts. And she is literate, so will have been in demand as a letter writer and form filler. Many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/24/reduce-number-women-prison\">women in prison</a> are poorly educated. Foreign nationals, many not speaking English, account for some 12% of the female prison population, and represent 81 different nationalities. Again, a long way from life in Ambridge.</p> <p>Confinement apart, she may have chosen to keep herself busy. The prison offers a wide variety of educational and vocational courses, including cookery and salon services, along with drug and alcohol awareness. If she wanted to keep fit, she could have attended the gym or joined the \u201cearly morning walking club\u201d \u2013 a first for prisons, as far as I know, although the rambling will certainly not have extended beyond the forbidding fences.</p> <p>Although women make up for around 5% of the prison population, they account for more than a quarter of all incidents of self-harm in jails. In the past year, 12 women prisoners have apparently taken their own lives in jails in England. If convicted, Helen will be allowed to keep her child with her until he is 18 months old \u2013 although they may be separated sooner, if it is thought the prison environment is damaging the child psychologically.</p> <p>If she is lucky, family members other than her abusive husband will then take care of her children while Helen carries on with her jail term. Of the two babies born in English prisons each week, many are taken into care, or placed in foster homes. Imagine the effect of that on the still-incarcerated mums. <strong>EA</strong></p>",

Yes, that all happened, but other film-makers were the bathwater thrown out with the baby when this kind of mid-budget film-making began to lose out to the tentpole mentality. A good number of the great movies of the 70s were autumnal, mature works by older directors at the end of long careers. These would include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/27/invasion-of-the-bodysnatchers-1956\">Don Siegel</a>, who had started out doing montage work for Warners in the 1940s, and had worked steadily and memorably for two decades already.

America, and Hollywood as well, went through the greatest sustained period of intense, 360-degree national self-scrutiny in their history. Just as every institution in the polity was examined for flaws and weak spots, so were genres in Hollywood, because they too were American institutions badly in need of a dose of revisionism.

He doesn\u2019t mention one important fact about the burkini ban, possibly because it\u2019s so obvious. Women who wear the burkini, the burqa or the niqab are wearing what they want to wear and not harming anybody.</p> <p>These are the most important facts about the whole matter. It\u2019s not relevant to the ban that Islamic clothes remind one of Islamic societies and that some of those societies are profoundly illiberal. It doesn\u2019t matter that covering up is or isn\u2019t required by the Qur\u2019an.</p> <p>The people banning the clothes aren\u2019t living in those societies. What they are doing is stopping women from wearing what they choose to wear. They are, in fact, acting like the small-minded theocrats who force Iranian women in Iran to wear headscarves.

That sounds good \u2013 but what does it mean? A culture of total diversity \u2013 in extremis a mixture of all cultures on earth \u2013 would not be a culture at all. By definition any human culture has beliefs and practices particular to itself. In Britain, we expect visitors to drive on the left, for example.</p> <p>Multiculturalism is a concept dreamed up by the French in an honourable attempt to cope with an influx of Algerian Muslims after the Algerian war. But at root it is a contradiction in terms. What is possible is a dominant culture that is tolerant of other cultures within it. That is what we should be aiming for.</p> <p>So if we \u2013 or the French \u2013 are comfortably dominant in our own national cultures we should be able to cope with burkinis on the beach \u2013 up to a point.

It is well to remember that all a Google search can do is acquire large quantities of information quickly.</p> <p>The ease with which this can be done may inculcate lazy habits, and may make the user careless about the reliability of the information acquired. If so, that is his or her fault, or, for younger users, perhaps the fault of the way they were taught to use the internet.</p> <p>In the recent past, students used \u201cpaste and scissors\u201d material from books. Generally such activities were of little use. Google usually generates much more information in a shorter time.</p> <p>Most people acquire information because they want to know something. Google cannot hurt if the searcher has acquired intellectual skills by grappling with the acquired materials: drawing \u201ccreative connections\u201d, as Poole calls it.</p> <p>The worst that Google can do is cause a certain amount of confusion until people are taught how to use it well and taught how not to be overwhelmed by what it throws up.<br><strong>Greg McCarry</strong><br>Sydney, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 When reflecting on the possible negative impact of constant internet access on our memory, what Steven Poole didn\u2019t touch upon were the aspects of impatience and ever-shorter attention spans.</p> <p>Some of my friends are seriously stressed out because, every once in a while, they have to wait for more than three seconds before they can book their restaurant table online.</p> <p>Unlike myself (I tend to quietly shake my head and smile patiently in these situations), my friends are all in their 30s, so you would think they would remember life without internet access or a mobile device.

  "<h2>The dangers in Trump\u2019s \u2018rigged election\u2019 claims</h2> <p>Election lawyers, donors and a former member of Congress have warned that Donald Trump\u2019s claims that if he loses in November it will be due to a \u201crigged\u201d election <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/06/donald-trump-rigged-election-voter-fraud-intimidation\">could lead to voter intimidation</a>. \u201cTrump\u2019s rhetoric is troubling and casts a shadow over the legitimacy of the elections,\u201d said election lawyer Ken Gross. On the campaign trail yesterday, the Republican nominee said citizenship will be a \u201cget out and come back in\u201d process for the undocumented \u2013 but he was \u201cnot ruling out anything\u201d for those who stay. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/06/trumps-in-ohio-blurs-the-ins-and-outs-of-his-immigration-stance\">We are going to make that decision into the future</a>,\u201d he said.

  "<p>This September marks the 150th anniversary of HG Wells\u2019s birth. It\u2019s just over 70 years since his death. Which means that the man they called the \u201cman who invented tomorrow\u201d is fading ever further into yesterday. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a026a1de884b4fa74074900ca3b33d91084e96d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a026a1de884b4fa74074900ca3b33d91084e96d0/0_0_2805_2153/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A first world war tank.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"768\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A first world war tank.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Library of Congress/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But that\u2019s not to say that many of his ideas aren\u2019t still current or relevant. Or indeed that his inventions aren\u2019t still of huge importance in our world. This is the creative force, after all, whom Winston Churchill credited with the invention of tanks (Wells dreamed up the idea in 1903, calling them The Land Ironclads). Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/aug/12/politics.history\">Leo Szilard</a>, one of the fathers of the atomic bomb, says it was HG Wells who first made him think that it might be possible to provoke a nuclear chain reaction. You can <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Szilard\">read about Szilard on Wikipedia </a>\u2013 and you can do so while enjoying the knowledge that Wells also wrote about something he called \u201cthe World Brain\u201d and predicted a: \u201cpermanent world encyclopaedia, freely available in every country of the globe\u201d. OK, Wells\u2019s global encyclopaedia is transported by plane and stored on microfilm \u2013 but that\u2019s still pretty good augury. So too were Wells\u2019s descriptions of such variously handy things as cycle lanes, cellphone networks, automatic doors, telescopic rifle sites, planes and parachutes, hot taps, indoor toilets, dishwashers, and 24-hour news. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a499e902a970a8bdb2b427f16f235ec02135ae55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a499e902a970a8bdb2b427f16f235ec02135ae55/0_0_5284_3745/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rod Taylor in the 1960 film of The Time Machine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"709\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rod Taylor in the 1960 film of The Time Machine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore Collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But of even more lasting importance and relevance than the Great Imaginator\u2019s real-world inventions are his books. Today he\u2019s probably best known for his early scientific romances like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jun/26/classics.hgwells\">The War of the Worlds</a> and The Time Machine, but he also wrote serious real-world political fiction like Ann Veronica, delightful comedies like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/16/hg-wells-history-of-mr-polly-100-best-novels\">The History of Mr Polly</a>, top quality literary fiction like Tono-Bungay, pioneering (and hilariously satirical) modernism like Boon, groundbreaking histories like A Short History of the World and even the book that became <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/294544/the-rights-of-man/\">the foundation of the Universal Declaration Of Human Rights</a>. </p> <p>Wells was, in sum, a genius. It\u2019s going to be a great pleasure to pay some of the tribute he\u2019s due here on the Reading Group.

  "<p>Social workers are in demand. There is an increasing number of jobs, with vacancies rising still faster. Employers are competing for talent with ingenious incentives while increasingly turning to agency staff to plug the gaps.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>This picture contrasts with other public service professions, most of which are still being stripped back by austerity-driven cuts. </p> <p>However, there may yet be problems for social work to face \u2013 a sustainable solution to the lack of young people being attracted into social work training is still a way off.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing that really worries me is that no one is giving any sensible thought to workforce planning,\u201d says Ruth Allen, chief executive of the British Association of Social Workers (BASW). \u201cThis is a big workforce and it\u2019s growing. I just don\u2019t think there is the thinking that we need in Whitehall or in the university sector.\u201d</p> <p>Growing statutory workload is driving social work\u2019s expansion. The number of children in care in England is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/education-committee/news-parliament-2015/children-social-work-reform-report-published-16-17/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the highest for 30 years</a>, with a 40% rise between 2010 and 2015 in those subject to a child protection plan. Meanwhile, adult social work is having to meet the new requirements of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2015/apr/28/-care-act-2014-quick-guide\">Care Act.</a></p> <p>In 2015, there were 44,700 social worker jobs in statutory services, divided almost two to one between children\u2019s and adult services, compared with 41,400 two years previously. </p> <p>At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.nmds-sc-online.org.uk/content/view.aspx?id=Adult%20Social%20Care%20Workforce%20Reports%20-%20Social%20Work%20Education\" rel=\"nofollow\">fewer students have been entering training</a> \u2013 only 4,600 enrolled on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2013/oct/16/social-work-courses-seeking-to-master-professional-training\">social work courses</a> (two-thirds of them on undergraduate courses) in England in 2013-14, compared to 5,800 in 2010-11. There will inevitably have been a sharp fall in numbers completing courses this year.</p> <p>It is of little comfort to employers that the drop in course enrolments has been broadly in line with trends across higher education, consequent upon steep increases in tuition fees in 2012.</p> <p>Despite the publicity they have generated, the emergence of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2015/oct/13/careers-care-training-route\">fast-track training courses</a> like Step Up to Social Work, Frontline and Think Ahead also provide meagre reassurance when the bigger picture is so worrying.</p> <p>On the ground, new holes opening up in social work teams are remaining unfilled. According to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.nmds-sc-online.org.uk/Get.aspx?id=957463\" rel=\"nofollow\">analysis by Skills for Care</a> (pdf), the skills agency for adult social care, vacancy rates in the sector shot up by four percentage points in 2014 to 12% last year. Annual turnover, on a three-year rising trend, registered a one-point increase to 13%.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/503071/SFR07_2016_Main_Text.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">According to the Department for Education</a> (pdf), turnover in children\u2019s social work was 16% last year and there was an \u201cunexpected\u201d rise of more than a quarter in vacancy rates, taking them to 17% \u2013 but this England-wide figure disguises sharp regional variations, ranging from 7% in Yorkshire and Humber to 29% in outer London.</p> <p>Good news, then, for agencies that supply temporary staff: in adult care, an average 7% of jobs were filled through agencies last year, compared with 3% in 2013, while in children\u2019s services the proportion rose by one percentage point to an average 16%, almost 5,000 posts, and as high as 30% in outer London.</p> <p>Employers are responding with a range of initiatives to attract and retain permanent staff, including so-called \u201cgolden hello\u201d payments for signing up and \u201cgolden handcuffs\u201d for staying \u2013 as much as \u00a315,000 for those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/mar/15/social-work-recruitment-councils-bidding-war\">remaining in post for three years</a> in one case.</p> <p>Not for the first time, some councils are resorting to recruitment overseas. Wokingham, in Berkshire, had a 26% vacancy rate for children\u2019s social workers earlier this year. It <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.communitycare.co.uk/2016/05/13/council-cheaper-recruit-social-workers-australia-pay-agency-fees/\" rel=\"nofollow\">found five recruits in Western Australia</a>, an area targeted because it is said to have a similar legal and educational framework to England\u2019s.</p> <p>But for Allen, these expedients are no real solution. She argues that as well as proper workforce planning, answers lie in making social work a more attractive job.</p> <p>It\u2019s no coincidence, Allen suspects, that the number of social workers choosing to be self-employed \u2013 whether through agencies or as independent practitioners \u2013 is growing. More than 4,000 BASW members, almost one in four, are registered as independents. Having control and being able to walk away from impossible caseloads or oppressive office environments is an attractive prospect.</p> <p>Last year\u2019s Guardian Jobs survey of social workers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/08/social-workers-survey-not-child-snatchers-love-jobs-leave-sector\">Social Lives</a>, pointed to rising frustration at working conditions such as hotdesking, with 67% saying they had been affected by stress or depression and more than 80% voicing concern for their wellbeing.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the looming issue of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog/2016/feb/17/social-work-bursary-students\">future of the social work bursary</a> could have a critical impact on the profession\u2019s capacity to refresh its ranks and meet the growing demands it faces.</p> <p>Ministers are expected to launch a delayed consultation on bursaries shortly, following the scrapping of provision for other professions like nursing. At present, 4,000 bursaries are available annually for postgraduate social work students, and undergraduates in their second and third years, costing \u00a370m in total.</p> <p>In a recent letter to Jeremy Hunt, Allen warned that the uncertainty \u201cdoes nothing to reassure social work students or academics that they are valued by government\u201d. She fears that abolishing the payments would deal a further, devastating blow to numbers entering the profession and to the diversity of its workforce.</p> <p>Allen adds that while there are examples of council employers responding to the message, many are not. </p> <p>\u201cThis is a specialist care profession, by far the biggest registered profession they [councils] employ,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have to realise they need to provide an environment in which people feel valued, feel they have a career pathway and want to stay.\u201d</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/social-care/\">Join the Social Care Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

  "<p> \u201cLeaving the refugees unprotected means you leave your country and society unprotected, and we have to do something,\u201d says Efi Latsoudi, a Lesbos resident who\u2019s seen her hometown engulfed by the worst humanitarian crisis of our time. </p> <p>Originally from Athens, the 48-year-old human rights activist moved to the Greek island in 2001, and for the past four years has been one of the founders and administrators of an open, self-organised refugee camp, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pikpalesvos/about/?entry_point=page_nav_about_item&amp;tab=page_info\">Pikpa</a>. The camp has been run, through all the tumult of the last few years, entirely on the efforts of volunteers and donations. </p> <p>Pikpa, on the south-east corner of the island, grew out of a solidarity network of local NGOs and volunteers, and started sheltering refugees in 2012. Though the Greeks have been hit by their own economic crisis for eight years, many such as Latsoudi have re-focused their worries on alleviating the urgent needs of refugees. </p> <p>Latsoudi\u2019s response to the refugee crisis was partly political. \u201cWe had refugees starting to arrive on the island in August 2012. I thought that if we don\u2019t do something for these people, we are giving an advantage to the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/21/neo-fascist-greek-party-election-golden-dawn-third-place\"> fascist party to raise their power</a>,\u201d Latsoudi says. She felt the neo-fascist party, Golden Dawn, would use the refugee crisis to instil fear and discrimination among Greeks. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe know people get afraid but we have to work on this. This is the important thing, we can\u2019t say this fear does not exist \u2013 of course society, and the volunteers and the refugees were affected by this crisis. But we wanted to create an open, self-organised camp that the local society will participate in, and the refugees will not be detained, but will be recognised in a human way.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ba898dfa8d7fcaa3dbbe3b6874b62bc15d90ae4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ba898dfa8d7fcaa3dbbe3b6874b62bc15d90ae4/0_92_4252_2552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"life jackets on beach and dingy in sea\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Migrants arriving on Lesbos after crossing the Aegean from Turkey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angelos Tzortzinis/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the number of refugees on the island increased, Latsoudi and other volunteers occupied an old children\u2019s summer camp near Mytilene airport.

Because it\u2019s not an organised trip to Europe, there\u2019s always a situation of crisis that can change any minute.\u201d</p> <p>For Latsoudi, the unity of Greek people and refugees is vital, especially on an island which has a very personal history of migration. Approximately 60% of the 90,000 or so residents in Lesbos are descended from Greek Orthodox Christians expelled from Turkey in the 1920s. \u201cCitizens from Greece are doing this even though they are facing an economic crisis \u2013 they are affected by all the uncertainty that it brings to them. But we believe the solidarity of people can be part of the solution. And this is a great thing,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The Pikpa camp offers shelter, activities, food, and medical support for the most vulnerable refugees, and the families of those who have died at sea. What makes this camp different, Latsoudi says, is humane treatment and an \u201cidea of community\u201d. </p> <p>She has taken on a monumental task: at the peak of the crisis, this time last year, Pikpa was hosting 600 refugees a day, despite a capacity of just 150, and distributing more than 2,000 meals each day. Lesbos has welcomed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/country.php?id=83\">93,600 refugees by sea this year alone</a> \u2013 equal to the island\u2019s own population. Though Latsoudi believes the government response has been poor, the reaction of Greek people has been positive. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d40579b8465f31d7f1f4694a873ce430c4e6569c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d40579b8465f31d7f1f4694a873ce430c4e6569c/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Winners of UNHCR\u0092s Nansen Award 2016, Konstantinos Mitragas and Efi Latsoudi on the beach with life jackets in background\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Efi Latsoudi and her fellow award-winner, sea captain Konstantinos Mitragas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gordon Welters/UNHCR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Latsoudi seems to have taken the last few years in her stride. After studying international law at university, she worked in Athens at detention centres for minors. Though nothing could prepare her for the plight of the Syrians, Afghans, Iraqis and other hundreds of desperate people who have passed through Pikpa\u2019s doors, her dedication is unquestionable. <br></p> <p>Latsoudi, along with Konstantinos Mitragas, a sea captain and the <a href=\"http://www.hrt.org.gr/\">Hellenic Rescue Team\u2019s</a> secretary general, have both just been announced as recipients of <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/uk/nansen-refugee-award.html\">UNHCR\u2019s Nansen refugee award</a>, a prize running for 61 years, acknowledging the work of humanitarians across the world in helping displaced people.

She feels the volunteers are also victims: \u201cVolunteers are traumatised. It\u2019s really dangerous for the people involved. I believe that\u2019s why that we have to change these policies about refugees, because we [the volunteers] are also traumatised several times by what has happened. But we cannot leave them [refugees] alone.\u201d</p> <p>In the future, Latsoudi hopes the government policy towards refugees will change and there will be a safe passage for those coming across the Mediterranean. This could be a long time coming; in the meantime, what keeps her motivated are the \u201csmall things\u201d \u2013 \u201cthe way that people are laughing and having a good time, and finding ways to overcome difficulties\u201d, she says. \u201cThe human heart is surviving, and that\u2019s very powerful.\u201d </p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

  "<p>I was a human rights advocate for several years before becoming a lawyer. When I fell in love with human rights work, it wasn\u2019t because of international law \u2013 it was because of on-the-ground civil society collaborations and fact-finding investigations early in my career. Working abroad, I became sensitised to the importance of listening to and managing expectations when speaking with victims of human rights violations. I gave back as much as I could by bringing my knowledge of international law and human rights practice to the table and helping colleagues grow as advocates. As a result, I fostered strong relationships with a vibrant community of human rights workers from all over the world.</p> <p> After several years of moving between multiple continents to finish law school and get practical experience, I decided to settle and landed a legal researcher job at an NGO. I wasn\u2019t excited about doing desk research day in and day out, but the NGO\u2019s mission seemed important and interesting. Unfortunately, nothing could prepare me for the ignorance I was about to experience.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m ashamed that there are human rights lawyers who think their law degrees alone qualify them to speak for victims</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At this NGO, my colleagues were lawyers who wanted to speak for victims without understanding how to first listen and speak <em>to</em> victims.  This was exacerbated both by their collective lack of experience working in situations rife with human rights violations and by the NGO\u2019s institutional disinterest \u2013 even disdain \u2013 of people who focused on abuses outside its thematic and regional focus. </p> <p>All of this contributed to the office\u2019s low levels of sophistication in understanding human rights. For example, upon learning that a foundation had programmes to rescue scholars (not genocide victims), a colleague ridiculed the concept, equating the persecution of academics to people getting their dissertations rejected. Additionally, they didn\u2019t seem to understand that it could characterise the start of a genocide; that scholars can also be genocide victims. </p> <p>On a more personal level, I had shared with colleagues that my parents were persecuted out of a war-torn country. Yet I was shocked by senior colleagues\u2019 lack of basic sympathy to the plight of my ethnic group. Where\u2019s the compassion? The NGO doesn\u2019t focus on that part of the world, which means it considers those victims less worthy of its time. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jun/28/secret-aid-worker-high-level-really-means-a-club-of-old-white-men\">Secret aid worker: 'High-level' really means a club of old white men</a> </p> </aside>  <p> I quickly realised that my boss, a strong supporter of the death penalty and military intervention, is a human rights advocate only when it suits \u2013 and only regarding certain rights, sometimes on a whim. Under my boss\u2019 direction, developing strategies to maximise practical impacts on the ground took a second seat to developing novel strategies just to say \u201cwe did it first\u201d. The amount of time wasted as a result is staggering. </p> <p>How important are the victims for whom the NGO purports to speak? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sure, however, that even the organisation\u2019s most meaningful work is at least partly driven by the self-promotional desires of a vanity NGO and its leadership.</p> <p> I\u2019m embarrassed to have been part of this NGO to the point where my family still doesn\u2019t know its name.

  "<p>As Lincoln\u2019s MP, I have been struck by the underperformance of boys in education compared with girls. It is an issue often raised with me when visiting schools, colleges, universities, businesses and training providers across my constituency. I also see it with my own eyes. There are too many young men hanging around when they should be in work, on an apprenticeship or at university or college. This issue crosses all social classes, geographical areas and ethnic groups, it is not just a working-class issue.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/31/education-gender-gap-girls-schools-university\">The education gender gap is bad for girls as well as boys | Melissa Benn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But there is hardly anything being done to tackle it. It was almost as though the problem had not permeated the Westminster or Whitehall \u201cbubble\u201d, even though it is clearly an equalities and fairness issue. Why has there been such little action on the issue? If the genders were reversed, I am almost certain this would not be the case. Indeed for well over 25 years, taxpayers\u2019 money has welcomely and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/apr/10/more-students-accepted-onto-stem-courses-hefce-report\" title=\"\">successfully been spent</a> on encouraging female applications for science, technology, engineering and mathematics courses in higher education. Yet, there is no or little reciprocal focus on men becoming doctors (<a href=\"http://www.gponline.com/exclusive-gmc-data-reveal-large-female-gp-majority-among-trainees-age-groups-50/article/1372966\" title=\"\">two in every three new GPs are female</a>) or lawyers (<a href=\"http://www.stylist.co.uk/people/uk-justice-system-lack-of-women-judges\" title=\"\">over three in five trainees are female</a>).</p> <p>It is due to the lack of focus on this issue from successive governments of all colours, from policymakers and from the education sector, that I am leading a parliamentary debate today on the educational underperformance of boys and the gender education gap.</p> <p>This gap in attainment is stark, starts young and is not new. At Key Stage 2 (in old money, 11 years old) the gap is six percentage points. For GCSEs, the gap for five A*-C grades, including English and Maths, is <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/revised-gcse-and-equivalent-results-in-england-2014-to-2015\" title=\"\">nine percentage points</a> in England and more than seven in the other three home nations. Its impact is also stark. Annually <a href=\"http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN06113/SN06113.pdf\" title=\"\">30,000</a> fewer boys than girls are becoming apprentices, <a href=\"https://www.ucas.com/sites/default/files/app_level_report_2015-dr2_015_01.pdf\" title=\"\">60,000</a> fewer go to university every year (460,000 fewer over the past decade) and more <a href=\"http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN06705\" title=\"\">young men</a> are not in education employment or training (NEETs). Fewer men are entering nearly all of the professions and between the ages of 22 and 29, <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/annualsurveyofhoursandearnings/2015provisionalresults\" title=\"\">young men earn less per hour on average than women</a>, in both full-time and part-time roles.</p> <p>So what to do?</p> <p>We need to make sure schools and colleges are boy-friendly through inspiring them, helping them to see what they can achieve and also being positive about masculinity. It is OK for boys to like cars, building sites and generally getting dirty. Boys want to be young men, and young men want to be grown men \u2013 we should celebrate and nurture this, not try to make boys something they are not by discouraging these worthy pursuits. More male teachers would certainly help. The fact that <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/533618/SFR21_2016_MainText.pdf\" title=\"\">only 15% of teachers</a> in primary schools are male and 38% at secondaries is a grave concern.</p> <p>We should introduce three-, five- and seven-year apprenticeships that are both the equivalent to degrees and vocational for those who are not as academically minded. These of course should be available to girls as well. We need to think differently. It works in Germany and elsewhere around the world, so why not here? Life-long learning is valued and works in Germany and in the US. In this global race we in the UK are not even in the top set.</p> <p>Many organisations have looked into the reasons for this, from <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/resources/online-library/lost-boys\" title=\"\">Save the Children</a>, <a href=\"http://www.suttontrust.com/researcharchive/missing-talent/\" title=\"\">the Sutton Trust</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.hepi.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Boys-to-Men.pdf\" title=\"\">the Higher Education Policy Institute</a> to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/state-of-the-nation-2015\" title=\"\">the Social Mobility Commission</a>. Some conclude that boys are slower developers than girls, while some argue that boys and their male role models, if they have them, hold less positive attitudes towards the value of education.</p> <p>Finally, we need government and the education sector as a whole to step up to the plate. We need to set up an implementation taskforce to find solutions and then put them into practice.</p> <p>Successive governments have given much focus, policy and leadership on matters such as the lack of women on boards and the gender pay gap. There\u2019s no argument from me on that at all, but there is now an unarguable case for the same focus on this matter. If not, there needs to be an explanation. We need equality for all.</p> <p>This gender education gap affects boys, their families, communities, businesses and the UK as a whole. I have concerns around social cohesion, social mobility and the impact on the economy. We should all strive to ensure every young person in our great country will have the opportunity to gain the skills we need to help us all compete as a nation. This is very much a \u201cone nation\u201d issue and it is now time for action.</p>",
  "<p>Tougher regulations on the use of antibiotics on farm animals are needed as a matter of urgency as part of Brexit negotiations, campaigners and politicians have urged, after fresh revelations of superbugs found in UK supermarket meat products.</p> <p><em>E coli</em> germs resistant to all of the currently used antibiotics have been found in UK supermarket meat, with<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/antibiotic-resistant-e-coli-uk-supermarket-chicken-samples-contain\"> a quarter of chickens found to contain the deadly superbugs</a>, in research from Cambridge University.</p> <p>The discovery <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2015/jun/18/superbugs-la-mrsa-pigs-antibiotics-video\">has been strongly linked</a> to the overuse of antibiotic medicines among farm animals, including chickens and pigs. </p> <p>Overuse of antibiotics among farm animals fosters the development of resistant germs, which can then infect people and cause serious illness. The Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2015/jun/18/superbugs-la-mrsa-pigs-antibiotics-video\">has previously revealed</a> strong evidence of another \u201csuperbug\u201d resistant to antibiotics - MRSA - found in nearly one in 10 samples of UK supermarket pork.</p> <p>Current curbs on antibiotic use on UK livestock are among the regulations under discussion as the government prepares for Brexit. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/14/post-brexit-farming-subsidies-must-protect-nature-84-groups-say\">Campaigners fear</a> that these rules will be watered down under pressure from trading partners, with potentially catastrophic results for UK consumers.</p> <p>Peter Melchett, policy director of the Soil Association, told the Guardian: \u201cWe want the government to ban all routine use of antibiotics on groups of entirely healthy animals, to phase out the use of critically important antibiotics [on animals] and ensure that last-resort antibiotics are only used to treat individual farm animals, and only if no other antibiotics are found to be working. We want to see this enacted whether we are in the EU or out of it.\u201d</p> <p>Philip Lymbery, chief executive of Compassion in World Farming, said: \u201cThis new research makes it clear that the UK government must take urgent steps to save our antibiotics and avert a post-antibiotic era. The government must put in place policies to ban the routine preventative use of antibiotics in groups of entirely healthy animals.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/antibiotic-resistant-e-coli-uk-supermarket-chicken-samples-contain\">One in four supermarket chicken samples contain antibiotic-resistant E coli</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He also called for the use of certain critical antibiotics, regarded as the last line of defence against devastating human illnesses, to be kept from routine use in animals in order to retain their efficacy.</p> <p>\u201cIf we continue to sacrifice animal welfare in the name of cheap meat, future generations will pay the price for a long time to come,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Important trading partners such as the US and China have much lower animal welfare standards, and more lax controls on the use of antibiotics on their farms, than the UK and the EU. UK trade negotiators are likely to be under pressure to accept lower standards as a result, and more than 80 civil society organisations have called for the government to resist such attempts.</p> <p><em>E coli</em> can kill or cause serious illness, and the potency of the antibiotics used to counter it is being eroded, which scientists have linked to the over-use of antibiotics in treating farm animals. The discovery of food products on general sale in the UK harbouring resistant bugs has raised concern that current regulations on the use of antibiotics are insufficient to protect consumers.</p> <p>Under current rules, little oversight is kept of the use of antibiotics on individual farms. The UK\u2019s Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs keeps track of the volume of such drugs used overall in farming each year, but without keeping records of individual use and the reasons for it, leaving this to vets.</p> <p>Vets can find themselves under pressure, from farmers anxious to ensure they can continue to sell their livestock, and because they make money from prescriptions as well as advice.</p> <p>Even the current regulations - regarded as too weak by campaigners - are now under threat, as the government prepares for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/apr/12/would-vote-brexit-help-reduce-red-tape-vat-moss-smes\">\u201cbonfire of red tape\u201d on farming, that was called for by Brexiteers.</a></p> <p>Antibiotics have been at the forefront of the war against disease since the middle of the last century, but scientific developments have failed to keep up with the progress of the bugs. When antibiotics are used, most of the germs they target are killed, but a few can remain that evolve to develop and propagate resistance.</p> <p>When antibiotic medicines are over-used, for instance in healthy people or farmyard animals not at risk of disease, a higher proportion of the bugs develop this resistance, leading to larger populations of lethal superbugs.</p> <p>The discovery of germs resistant to <em>E coli</em> in many supermarket foods follows on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/18/mrsa-superbug-in-supermarket-pork-raises-alarm-farming-risks\">revelations by the Guardian that MRSA-resistant bacteria was present in about a tenth of UK supermarket pork products</a>. MRSA is another antibiotic-resistant \u201csuperbug\u201d that can be fatal to vulnerable people, such as the very old and young, and can cause severe illness even in healthy people.</p> <p>The government could help to reward farmers with high animal welfare standards by blocking cheap foreign imports from countries with lower standards under future post-Brexit trade deals, added Tracy Worcester, director of Farms Not Factories, a pressure group. </p> <p>She said: \u201cLivestock from high animal welfare farms very rarely need to be given antibiotics. Farmers and the government could agree the farm gate price that reflects production costs. Cheap foreign imports could be blocked and all public services could procure meat produced with high animal welfare labels.\u201d</p> <p>She called on people to write to supermarkets to urge them to crack down on antibiotic use among their suppliers, and to take to social media on the issue.</p> <p>Molly Scott Cato, an MEP for the Green arty, said the party was strongly in favour of curbing routine antibiotic use in farming and monitoring the use of powerful drugs as a last resort. She said: \u201cWe need to ensure that human and animal health is put before the interests and profits of industrial-scale farming. The emerging EU legislation on the use of antibiotics in farming is setting a global standard for the sensible use of these drugs that are so essential for human health. It is vital that the UK adopt the highest standards that emerge from this legislative process.\u201d</p> <p>She added that farming subsidies to be paid for by UK taxpayers, after Brexit, must also only be handed out on the basis of strong health and environmental standards. \u201cWe need to ensure any new subsidies for agriculture should prioritise a transition away from intensive farming and towards an environmentally and ecologically sustainable agricultural industry,\u201d she said.</p>",

It won\u2019t solve climate change, but it would reduce overfishing that has depleted a third of the world\u2019s fisheries, put the brakes on drilling and seabed mining, and galvanize action to stem the pollution that flows from the land into the sea. It\u2019s also a tangible target to rally around, although some would like to go further.</p> <p>EO Wilson, the renowned conservationist, said that we should aim for \u201cthe whole shooting match\u201d and attempt to protect almost all marine species by putting half of the world\u2019s oceans off limits. This would be done by banning fishing on the \u201chigh seas\u201d \u2013 the wide expanse of ungoverned ocean beyond the exclusive economic zones that end 200 miles from a nation\u2019s coastline. Wilson <a href=\"http://books.wwnorton.com/books/half-earth/\">has advocated</a> a \u201chalf for them, half for us\u201d approach for land-based conservation too.</p> <p>The Alabaman waves aside any suggestion this would prove practically impossible. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound like a pollyanna but my response is \u2018no big problem,\u2019\u201d Wilson said. </p> <p>\u201cThere are <a href=\"http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/27845/20160831/stop-fishing-high-seas-lives-depend.htm\">studies</a> showing that if we were to prohibit all fishing in the open sea, then lo and behold the productivity of the territorial waters rises. There would be a dramatic increase in the fisheries and profits of individual countries. Do it now, do it as soon as you can. Put aside half of the world.\u201d</p> <p>Given that one in five fish that end up on the plate are caught illegally under current protections, Wilson\u2019s optimism for a sweeping increase in no-take areas seems misplaced. But the UN is finally edging towards addressing the question of the high seas \u2013 a festering omission from the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/depts/los/\">Law of the Sea</a> treaty signed three decades ago that clarified nations\u2019 rights along their coastlines but did little, critics contend, to conserve the oceans.</p> <p>In August, Unesco <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/world_heritage_in_the_high_seas_an_idea_whose_time_has_come/#.V80ZWpMrLBK\">put forward</a> the idea of protecting certain prized jewels of the high sea.

Kurita\u2019s original 176 designs, which launched in February 1999 for Japanese mobile phones, were weirdly specific, including no fewer than five phases of the moon, three timepieces (watch, clock, sand-timer) and two states of umbrella (open, closed).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a81335f26924843ef04d1ef96dc09e5450f4733f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a81335f26924843ef04d1ef96dc09e5450f4733f/326_0_438_548/400.jpg\" alt=\"Shigetaka Kurita, the inventor of emojis\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shigetaka Kurita, the inventor of emojis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unmoderated by any panel, Kurita\u2019s choices reflected his priorities and predilections, producing a singular suite of icons that, against the odds, proved universally handy. Today, there are now more than 1,800 emojis, which are estimated to be used by more than 90% of the world\u2019s online population. As Satoe Haile, an emoji designer at Google, puts it, these pictograms \u201ccommunicate beyond language\u201d, transcending tongues and borders.</p> <p>For some, these \u201cbrainless little icons\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/may/27/emoji-language-dragging-us-back-to-the-dark-ages-yellow-smiley-face\">as Guardian art critic Jonathan Jones described them last year</a>) represent not an adjunct but a regression for our species. Their precursor, hieroglyphics, Jones argues, never produced an Iliad or an Odyssey because, put simply, the written word is infinitely more adaptable. But, for most, emojis offer not a substitute for the written word, but a complement, lending brevity or wit, irony or joy, to a text message. </p> <p>The people who use emojis are certainly proving detractors wrong, at least in terms of the form\u2019s adaptability. For example, denied a pictorial penis, millions have come to rely on the aubergine emoji \u2013 purple, engorged, topped with a pubic shock of green leaves. This abusage is now so widespread that, in 2015, Instagram banned search results for photographs tagged with an aubergine emoji, fearing it could be used as a signifier of nudity. The double meaning was formalised last month when an American woman launched a vibrator made in the eggplant\u2019s image. (Be thankful, perhaps, that the hive mind settled on the vegetable as a genital stand-in, rather than the umbrella, in either state.) </p> <p>The emoji\u2019s success has attracted scrutiny. Just as English has adapted to remove signifiers of sex in professions \u2013 hoping to make obsolete words such as \u201cactress\u201d and \u201cmale nurse\u201d, terms coined at a time when certain occupations were dominated by one gender \u2013 so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/10/female-emojis-google-equality\">the custodians of emojis are having to adapt</a> to compensate for Silicon Valley\u2019s bias. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/may/27/emoji-language-dragging-us-back-to-the-dark-ages-yellow-smiley-face\">Emoji is dragging us back to the dark ages \u2013 and all we can do is smile</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2015 <a href=\"http://unicode.org/emoji/\">Unicode</a>, the California-based consortium that standardises the use of these pictographs across the internet, added modifiers to enable us to alter the skin tone of our emoji (according to the Fitzpatrick Scale for humans, no less). A forthcoming update will add scores of gender-swap icons for existing professions, including a third, androgynous option. In this way, emojis present a rare opportunity. Many words smuggle quiet atrocities at an etymological level. Women who cannot have children are known as \u201cbarren\u201d. Disabled children are known as \u201cinvalids\u201d. Pictorial writing systems are no different. The Japanese <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/18/japanese-tourists-cat-lucky-eyebrows-hachi\">kanji</a> for \u201cnoisy\u201d, for example, consists of three kanji for \u201cwomen\u201d squished together. The kanji for \u201cwife\u201d is comprised of the symbols for \u201chouse\u201d and \u201cinside\u201d. </p> <p>When sexism is entangled with language at such an elemental level, reforging words takes a great deal of time and education. Emojis work differently. Unicode assigns an object a numerical text code, to which companies add a relevant image according to their whim or aesthetic. \u201cU+1F63B\u201d, for example, is the code for \u201cSMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES\u201d. Apple interprets this as a yellow cat with its mouth agape. Android translates the arcane script into a black cat with its mouth closed. Fixing problematic imagery, therefore, is as easy as redrawing the image associated with the code. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"28d8b90637a4335daecc05b9d5c3a5839f34f786\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28d8b90637a4335daecc05b9d5c3a5839f34f786/453_0_1663_2079/800.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Davis.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Google\u2019s Mark Davis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mark Davis, who is 63 and works at Google, helped originate Unicode in the late 80s while working at Apple in Japan, where he was trying to find a way to encode kanji so they would display correctly across computers and operating systems. His elegant solution of assigning images to immovable codes proved popular. Today, every operating system, laptop, smartphone and even the internet itself is based on Unicode. For its first decade, the Unicode Consortium, which is made up of unpaid volunteers, many of whom work at Apple, Google and other tech giants, dealt principally with characters unique to specific written languages, current, classical and historical.

Additions cannot be bought, but are rather considered by an impartial panel, which votes on their inclusion based on a variety of factors including distinctiveness (is there really a need for \u201cstew\u201d when we already have \u201csoup\u201d?), whether it feels a meaningful gap in the vocabulary and the emoji\u2019s expected levels of usage (a microphone versus a gramophone, for example).</p> <p>While less than one percent of the 7,500 characters added to the latest version this summer are emoji, some argue that too much effort is being directed at the script. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/29/instagram-ban-eggplant-emoji-sexters-fruity-alternatives\">Instagram ban on emoji has sexters searching for fruity alternatives</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For Everson, this focus has distracted effort and resources away from minority and historical writing systems, such as medieval Cornish. However, Mark Davis, president and co-founder of the Unicode Consortium, denies this is the case. \u201cEmoji is still only a small part of what we do,\u201d he says, pointing out that the attention emojis have brought has helped the consortium to further its goals for support of languages by allowing people to \u201cAdopt a Character\u201d for between $100 and $5,000 to raise money. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s certainly an impression that new emojis get approved faster than writing system proposals or additional characters for historical scripts,\u201d says John Hudson, another prominent typographer within Unicode. For Hudson, this is partly due to the fact that the questions that arise from emoji use are relatively straightforward (\u201cIs the dumpling emoji just for East Asian dumplings, or can it be used for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi\">perogies</a>?\u201d) while historical languages require experts, who often disagree on finer points. </p> <p>A greater issue, according to Hudson, and one that will deepen as the script continues to grow in popularity, is the use of Unicode to handle emojis in the first place. \u201cIt was the wrong technical solution,\u201d he says. \u201cThe set of little pictures that people might want to send between mobile devices is boundless; therefore, it needs a technology that is endlessly extensible, which Unicode is not.\u201d In other words, if emoji continues to evolve at its current rate, Hudson believes that will need much more flexible technology, capable of sending images between devices in a more efficient and flexible way. Davis, understandably perhaps, disagrees \u2013 although he won\u2019t be drawn on the question of emoji\u2019s future. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to say,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t have a U+1F52E.\u201d That\u2019s emoji code for a crystal ball.</p>",

Carter-Long says this only adds to the problem: \u201cIf you relegate Paralympics to a cable channel, people don\u2019t get the opportunity to see it.\u201d</p> <p>Cable agrees, suggesting that there\u2019s something of a self-fulfilling prophecy for disabled athletes. If the broader culture tolerates them not being given the same exposure, support or resources as non-disabled counterparts, this sends a signal that they are not equal. \u201cThere is a lot of ableism,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Cable concludes that it\u2019s important not to assume the status quo for US Paralympians will persist. She says that gradually, if adaptive sports are better resourced and championed locally and in schools to produce the pipeline Sharp wants to see, then the funding \u2013 and the medals \u2013 may follow.</p> <p>Some of this is already happening, according to former Paralympic silver medalist <a href=\"http://disability.illinois.edu/athletics/coaches/adam-bleakney#http://disability.illinois.edu/athletics/coaches/adam-bleakney\">Adam Bleakney</a>, who now coaches some of the US\u2019s most successful, high-profile track Paralympians, including four-time medal winner <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://tatyanamcfadden.com/about-tatyana/#http://tatyanamcfadden.com/about-tatyana/\">Tatyana McFadden</a>. He says much has changed for the better since he experienced a spinal cord injury at 19 that led to him taking up sports. More states \u201cmandating\u201d inclusion of disabled students in mainstream sports is one example. \u201cThat\u2019s where you will see significant developments at a grassroots level in a sustainable way.\u201d</p> <p>In the shorter term, Cable believes that the bid for LA in 2024, which she says is already treating Paralympics on an equal footing with the Olympics in its pitch, could be the catalyst the US needs to up its game for future Paralympic teams. \u201cIf we get the honour of holding the games it will be one of those game-changers.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Dear Friends,</p> <p>I wish to address this short statement to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/geert-wilders\">Mr Geert Wilders</a>, his acolytes, indeed to all those like him \u2013 the populists, demagogues and political fantasists. </p> <p>To them, I must be a sort of nightmare. I am the global voice on human rights, universal rights; elected by all governments, and now critic of almost all governments. I defend and promote the human rights of each individual, everywhere: the rights of migrants, asylum seekers and immigrants; the rights of the LGBTi community; the rights of women and children in all countries; minorities; indigenous persons; people with disabilities, and any and all who are discriminated against, disadvantaged, persecuted or tortured \u2013 whether by governments, political movements or by terrorists.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/video/2016/sep/06/atmosphere-thick-with-hate-un-human-rights-chief-rips-into-trump-and-wilders-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xzq4\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2695090\"            data-video-name=\"'Atmosphere thick with hate':\u00a0UN human rights chief rips into Trump and Wilders \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ce5e10e4b0c2a396c06f1a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/06/160906Zeid_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/06/160906Zeid.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/06/160906Zeid_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/video/2016/sep/06/atmosphere-thick-with-hate-un-human-rights-chief-rips-into-trump-and-wilders-video\">\u2018Atmosphere thick with hate\u2019: UN human rights chief rips into Trump and Wilders \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>I am a Muslim, who is, confusingly to racists, also white-skinned; whose mother is European and father, Arab. And I am angry, too. Because of Mr Wilder\u2019s lies and half-truths, manipulations and peddling of fear. You see, twenty years ago I served in the UN peacekeeping force during the Balkan wars \u2013 wars so cruel, so devastating, which flowed from this same factory of deceit, bigotry and ethnic nationalism.</p> <p>Geert Wilders released his grotesque eleven-point manifesto only days ago, and a month ago he spoke along similar lines in Cleveland, in the United States. I will not repeat what he has said, but there are many who will, and his party is expected to do well in the elections in March.</p> <p>And yet what Mr Wilders shares in common with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Mr Trump</a>, Mr Orban, Mr Zeman, Mr Hofer, Mr Fico, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen\">Madame Le Pen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage\">Mr Farage</a>, he also shares with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\">Da\u2019esh</a>.<br><br>All seek in varying degrees to recover a past, halcyon and so pure in form, where sunlit fields are settled by peoples united by ethnicity or religion \u2013 living peacefully in isolation, pilots of their fate, free of crime, foreign influence and war. A past that most certainly, in reality, did not exist anywhere, ever. Europe\u2019s past, as we all know, was for centuries anything but that. </p> <p>The proposition of recovering a supposedly perfect past is fiction; its merchants are cheats. Clever cheats.</p> <p>Populists use half-truths and oversimplification - the two scalpels of the arch propagandist, and here the internet and social media are a perfect rail for them, by reducing thought into the smallest packages: sound-bites; tweets. Paint half a picture in the mind of an anxious individual, exposed as they may be to economic hardship and through the media to the horrors of terrorism. Prop this picture up by some half-truth here and there and allow the natural prejudice of people to fill in the rest. Add drama, emphasising it\u2019s all the fault of a clear-cut group, so the speakers lobbing this verbal artillery, and their followers, can feel somehow blameless.</p> <p>The formula is therefore simple: make people, already nervous, feel terrible, and then emphasize it\u2019s all because of a group, lying within, foreign and menacing. Then make your target audience feel good by offering up what is a fantasy to them, but a horrendous injustice to others. Inflame and quench, repeat many times over, until anxiety has been hardened into hatred.</p> <p>Make no mistake, I certainly do not equate the actions of nationalist demagogues with those of Da\u2019esh, which are monstrous, sickening; Da\u2019esh must be brought to justice. But in its mode of communication, its use of half-truths and oversimplification, the propaganda of Da\u2019esh uses tactics similar to those of the populists. And both sides of this equation benefit from each other \u2013 indeed would not expand in influence without each others\u2019 actions.</p> <p>The humiliating racial and religious prejudice fanned by the likes of Mr Wilders has become in some countries municipal or even national policy. We hear of accelerating discrimination in workplaces. Children are being shamed and shunned for their ethnic and religious origins \u2013 whatever their passports, they are told they are not \u201creally\u201d European, not \u201creally\u201d French, or British, or Hungarian. Entire communities are being smeared with suspicion of collusion with terrorists.</p> <p>History has perhaps taught Mr Wilders and his ilk how effectively xenophobia and bigotry can be weaponised. Communities will barricade themselves into fearful, hostile camps, with populists like them, and the extremists, as the commandants. The atmosphere will become thick with hate; at this point it can descend rapidly into colossal violence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/demagogues-and-cheats-un-human-rights-chief-condemns-trump-and-wilders\">'Demagogues and cheats': UN rights chief condemns Trump and Wilders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We must pull back from this trajectory. My friends, are we doing enough to counter this cross-border bonding of demagogues? A decade ago, Geert Wilder\u2019s manifesto and Cleveland speech would have created a world-wide furore. Now? Now, they are met with little more than a shrug, and, outside the Netherlands, his words and pernicious plans were barely noticed. Are we going to continue to stand by and watch this banalisation of bigotry, until it reaches its logical conclusion? <br><br>Ultimately, it is the law that will safeguard our societies \u2013 human rights law, binding law which is the distillation of human experience, of generations of human suffering, the screams of the victims of past crimes and hate. We must guard this law passionately, and be guided by it.</p> <p>Do not, my friends, be led by the deceiver. It is only by pursuing the entire truth, and acting wisely, that humanity can ever survive. So draw the line and speak.

  "<p>Leading British universities are considering opening campuses in Europe in order to keep crucial research funding and partnerships, amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jul/11/referendum-academic-research-universities-eu-students-brexit\">uncertainty</a> over the consequences of the UK leaving the EU. The idea, which is already proving controversial among university heads, comes as universities wrestle with how to reassure students and academics across the world that they will not close their doors to Europe.</p> <p>Universities are playing their cards close to their chests, and it is not yet clear where they intend to set up overseas operations. Senior figures say that although these campuses would probably take students, the main motivation would be research money.</p> <p>Cardiff University is re-examining its strategy after the EU referendum result, and its vice-chancellor, Colin Riordan, says a new campus will be one of the items up for discussion. \u201cI know there are universities who are thinking about setting up campuses in Europe,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve considered it before because of visa restrictions and so on, but the critical thing is thinking it through. The world is littered with universities setting up new campuses and getting their fingers burned. If you are going down that route you have to be clear about the risks are and how you mitigate them.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/02/academics-brexit-research-peat-fears-eu-funds\">Academics feel blight of Brexit \u2013 from cancer research to peat projects</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The stakes are certainly high. Cardiff is a member of the Russell Group of research-intensive universities, which together received more than \u00a3500m in EU research grants in 2014-15. The Treasury has guaranteed research awards from the EU\u2019s Horizon 2020 programme, an \u20ac80bn (\u00a369bn) pot for science and innovation, but vice-chancellors remain anxious about funding. They are also worried about whether scientists will be able to move freely across borders.</p> <p>Prof Steve Smith, vice-chancellor of Exeter University, also in the Russell Group, says: \u201cWe are thinking: \u2018Do we need a presence in another European country?\u2019 Right now this is talk over the coffee cups. We\u2019ve never been in favour of campuses elsewhere, and there are legal issues that might put us off. But we want to support our research base.</p> <p>\u201cIn a way the core point is not the money. What really matters in modern science is the collaboration. We would be damaging ourselves if we weren\u2019t making it as easy as possible to work with those we collaborate with most.\u201d</p> <p>Opening a university branch abroad is expensive. Nottingham University\u2019s award-winning campus in Ningbo, China, is one success story. But there have been high-profile failures. University College London announced last year that it would be closing its campus in Adelaide, Australia, and in 2013 the University of East London closed its campus in Cyprus after six months because of low student numbers.</p> <p>Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, says universities should not rush into something they might regret. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what Brexit means yet. And if you were proposing a campus to get tens of millions of research funding you\u2019d need a very serious presence. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d sign that off as a governor, especially when there are examples of campuses going wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Nancy Rothwell, vice-chancellor of Manchester University, agrees: \u201cI don\u2019t see the logic of having a European campus. I don\u2019t see the value. Who would pay the running costs? Within the university I\u2019ve spent a lot of time trying to reassure staff and students who were upset and feeling unwelcome that, for the foreseeable future, nothing has changed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5d82f2e45b0483fe2bddf8dac2ac233c62977fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5d82f2e45b0483fe2bddf8dac2ac233c62977fb/0_177_5320_3192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"students dancing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">De Monfort University students dance with refugees during a visit to Berlin.e</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Jungeblodt/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shocked by a referendum result they weren\u2019t expecting, many university chiefs say now is a time for taking stock and quiet lobbying behind the scenes. But Prof Dominic Shellard, vice-chancellor of De Montfort University, Leicester, vehemently disagrees. Last week he was in Berlin, the fifth stop on a campaigning tour of Europe designed to persuade prospective students, parents and overseas media that his university is not giving up on the European dream.</p> <p>\u201cAt every venue on this tour there has been a sharp intake of breath when I start speaking openly about Brexit,\u201d Shellard says. \u201cThey can\u2019t believe I\u2019m addressing it. All the diplomats are very interested in what we are doing as no one else has gone out yet because there is so much uncertainty and they don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d He tells them that most 18- to 24-year-olds voted to stay in and that \u201cin my university there is a feeling of some desolation. People are worried about the UK becoming very insular. And they are horrified about the episodes of hate crime.\u201d</p> <p>Shellard realised he needed to act after a meeting of staff and students on the morning of the referendum result. He expected 50 people \u2013 but 850 turned up. There was a lot of confusion. A Polish student was going home that weekend and asked for a letter from Shellard so he could get back into the UK.</p> <p>This confusion has been mirrored in Europe. In Warsaw, Shellard shared the stage with two Polish students from his university, and the local media asked them whether they had been asked to leave the UK. \u201cThe students were pretty taken aback,\u201d he says.</p> <p>According to the university, non-UK EU student applications are up 30% at De Montfort this year \u2013 from 2,260 in 2015\u201116 to 3,166 in 2016-17. Shellard thinks this is in part because he was on the ground talking to parents and students about their anxieties about what might await them in the UK after the leave vote, before they changed their minds about coming. But like all vice-chancellors he is worried about the future.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/03/brexit-vote-cost-uk-universities-tens-millions-student-fees-ucl\">Brexit vote 'could cost UK universities tens of millions in student fees'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>European students applying to study in the UK this academic year are still eligible for student loans, but there are no guarantees for students applying after 2016-17. Coventry University has pledged to counter this by keeping fees for non-UK EU students at the same level as home students for five years.</p> <p>Prof Ian Marshall, the university\u2019s deputy vice-chancellor, says: \u201cWe have over 1,000 EU students this year, so for us Brexit is a major thing. As soon as we talked to students after the referendum they were worried that fees would jump up. Given all the uncertainty, you want to put as much certainty into the situation as you can.\u201d</p> <p>Coventry\u2019s move has angered competing vice-chancellors. One, who asked not to be named, says: \u201cThey\u2019ve done it for political reasons, and I understand that, but it is foolish to commit to treating French or Spanish students one way and Chinese or Australian students another when we have left the EU.\u201d</p> <p>But most vice-chancellors admit that after Brexit, fees for EU students will have to rise in line with international student fees. Rothwell says: \u201cI just don\u2019t know yet whether European students will come with higher fees. Many are choosing us now even though higher education is free in their home country, so that may tell us something.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Hugh Brady, vice-chancellor of Bristol University, says: \u201cDuring the financial crisis there was a flight towards quality. So far the University of Bristol\u2019s EU student numbers are holding up, and I am reasonably confident that we will continue to attract high-quality European students [after Brexit] but that might not be the case across the sector.\u201d</p> <p>Universities insist this isn\u2019t just about the money. Prof David Green, vice-chancellor of Worcester University, says: \u201cWe have students from every European country except Liechtenstein at the moment and that matters a great deal. It creates a better atmosphere for all our students. They open UK students\u2019 eyes to opportunities in other countries.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 September 2016. An earlier version said non-UK EU student numbers at De Montfort University were up 30% this year, from 2,260 to 3,166. Those figures relate to applications, not admissions.</p>",
  "<p>University leavers are flooded with information about corporate graduate schemes to the point that many believe this is the only route open to them. In reality, these structured schemes only make up a small percentage of graduate job opportunities and they are certainly not the only route to success. </p> <p>Startups and small to medium businesses can offer graduates an amazing platform from which to begin their career. From fast career progression to great company culture, here are six reasons graduates should consider working at a small business.</p> <h2>Responsibility from the get-go</h2> <p>It\u2019s usually all hands on deck at a small company, meaning you\u2019ll get to take on a wide variety of responsibilities very quickly. After all, when there are only a few members of staff, there\u2019s no space for endless days of shadowing other people or simply doing admin tasks. This steep learning curve means you\u2019ll constantly be challenged to learn and develop your skills.</p> <p>Depending on the size of the company, you may even find that you don\u2019t have a direct line manager. While this might sound daunting, it allows you to take real ownership over your work and be in charge of far larger projects than you would be involved in on a traditional graduate scheme.</p> <p>Having this level of practical experience will stand you in good stead when it\u2019s time to move on to your next opportunity, too. Budgets at small companies do tend to be tighter, so your level of external training probably won\u2019t match what you would be offered on a graduate scheme. Then again, there really is nothing like learning on the job. </p> <h2>The opportunity to stand out </h2> <p>Some of the most well-known employers hire up to 1,000 graduates every year. With so many options to compete with, standing out as an exceptional employee can be nigh on impossible. Conversely, startups and small businesses are more likely to take on just one or two people at a time, meaning you\u2019ll really have a chance to prove your worth and impress your employer.</p> <h2>Fewer hierarchies</h2> <p>At startups in particular, teams are often so small that you\u2019ll find yourself working directly with the founders of the business. This opens up an amazing opportunity to learn more about the company as a whole and be surrounded by inspirational people.</p> <p>This lack of hierarchy also means you\u2019ll be able to get your creative juices flowing too. Got an amazing idea? You can take it straight to the founders and if they like it you\u2019ll get the chance to implement it. At a larger company it can be harder for a graduate to get their voice heard. </p> <h2>Creativity and innovation</h2> <p>Startups are really paving the way in some of the hottest industries right now \u2013 most notably technology. By bucking the graduate trend and joining a small company, you\u2019ll be at the forefront of this change. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/aug/18/five-things-to-remember-if-you-didnt-get-on-a-graduate-scheme\">Five things to remember if you didn't get on a graduate scheme</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, this does mean you\u2019ll have to sacrifice having the power of a big brand name on your CV, if or when the time comes to move on. However, the impressive list of skills and experience you\u2019ve amassed in your career so far should help you overcome that. And who knows, perhaps by the time you\u2019re ready to leave, the company could be a household name. </p> <h2>Company culture</h2> <p>From beer on tap to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/oct/15/office-staff-relax-pets-plants-meditation-business\">office dogs</a> and ping-pong tables, small businesses pride themselves on their unique company cultures. It\u2019ll certainly make the transition from university to working life a lot easier and be sure to get you jumping out of bed in the morning.</p> <p>But it\u2019s more than just cool offices \u2013 small companies take personality fit very seriously when recruiting, so you can guarantee you\u2019ll be surrounded by a team of like-minded individuals. This should make for a friendlier and more collaborative working environment, where people of a similar mindset come together to work hard and have fun. </p> <h2>Fast career progression</h2> <p>Inevitably, the starting salary for graduates at small businesses tends to be lower than at their corporate counterparts. However, what many people don\u2019t know is that the career progression is often much faster. Rather than being tied to a two-year graduate scheme that dictates your progression and salary, small businesses are often more meritocratic and allow you to progress at a rate that you deserve. </p> <p><em>Sarah Lewis is a marketing manager at startup intern and graduate recruitment agency <a href=\"https://instant-impact.com/?s2-ssl=yes\">Instant Impact</a></em></p> <p><strong>Looking for a job?

But even if Clegg has been right on austerity, why did he let the axe fall on the most vulnerable? In policy after policy, the bottom half bore the brunt as VAT rose, while the top had an income tax cut and kept their many benefits: tax reliefs, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/27/john-mcdonnell-osborne-capital-gains-tax-cut-gives-richest-population\" title=\"\">cuts to capital gains</a> and corporation tax.</p> <p>The rightwing thinktank, the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, showed how Osborne raised the lifetime tax-take from the bottom 20%, while tax for the top 20% fell.

Labour still does well in big cities such as London, Bristol, Leeds and Manchester, but flounders in the south and east of England. The party may also be losing its hold on its old industrial heartlands, and in Scotland it looks headed for extinction. Labour\u2019s poll ratings have been stuck in the same lowly place since before 2010.</p> <p>This is not fundamentally about the party\u2019s current internal strife. Labour is engulfed by the same crisis facing its sister parties in Europe. Political commentary tends to focus on politicians, and describe the world as if parties can be pulled here and there by the sheer will of powerful individuals. But Labour\u2019s problems are systemic, rooted in the deepest structures of the economy and society. The left\u2019s basic ideals of equality, solidarity and a protected public realm should be ageless. But everything on which it once built its strength has either disappeared, or is shrinking fast.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The idea that one single party or ideology can represent a majority of people is looking like a relic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The western left faces three grave challenges, which strike at the heart of its historic sense of what it is and who it speaks for. First, traditional work \u2013 and the left\u2019s sacred notion of \u201cthe worker\u201d \u2013 is fading, as people struggle through a new era of temporary jobs and rising self-employment, which may soon be succeeded by a drastic new age of automation. Second, there is a new wave of opposition to globalisation, led by forces on the right, which emphasise place and belonging, and a mistrust of outsiders. And all the time, politics rapidly fragments, which leaves the idea that one single party or ideology can represent a majority of people looking like a relic. The 20th century, in other words, really is over.<strong> </strong>Whether the left can return to meaningful power in the 21st is a question currently surrounded by a profound sense of doubt.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>On the morning of May 8 2005, </strong>Tony Blair stood on the steps of Downing Street, after an unprecedented third consecutive Labour election victory. On the face of it, this provided proof of Labour\u2019s newfound dominance, and another occasion for union jacks, talk of a new dawn, and the same blithe optimism that had carried Blair to power in 1997. But this time he took a much more hard-headed stance. Labour had just been been re-elected on 35.2% of the vote, with the support of only 22% of the electorate. The first-past-the-post system had worked its strange magic and taken the party back into government \u2013 but on the lowest figures for any government in the democratic age.<strong> </strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/sep/23/does-the-left-have-a-future-podcast\">Does the left have a future? \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That day, Blair seemed contrite. \u201cI\u2019ve listened and I\u2019ve learned, and I think I\u2019ve a very clear idea what the people now expect from the government in a third term,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I want to say to them very directly that I, we, the government, are going to focus relentlessly now on the priorities that people have set for us.\u201d He spoke of the idea that \u201clife is still a real struggle for many people\u201d, and devoted one section of his speech to rising public angst about immigration.</p> <p>Five months later, Blair made his 12th annual conference speech as party leader, and all traces of humility had vanished. His essential message reflected one of the key strands of his political theology: the mercurial magic of modern capitalism, and his mission to toughen up the country in response to the endless challenges of the free market. \u201cChange is marching on again,\u201d he announced, in that messianic tone that had begun to emerge in his speeches around the time of 9/11. \u201cThe pace of change can either overwhelm us, or make our lives better and our country stronger,\u201d he went on. \u201cWhat we can\u2019t do is pretend it is not happening. I hear people say we have to stop and debate globalisation. You might as well debate whether autumn should follow summer.\u201d</p> <p>His next passage was positively evangelistic. \u201cThe character of this changing world is indifferent to tradition. Unforgiving of frailty. No respecter of past reputations. It has no custom and practice. It is replete with opportunities, but they only go to those swift to adapt, slow to complain, open, willing and able to change.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/31/podemos-revolution-radical-academics-changed-european-politics\">The Podemos revolution: how a small group of radical academics changed European politics | Giles Tremlett</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I watched that speech on a huge screen in the conference exhibition area. And I recall thinking: \u201cMost people are not like that.\u201d The words rattled around my head: \u201cSwift to adapt, slow to complain, open, willing and able to change.\u201d And I wondered that if these were the qualities now demanded of millions of Britons, what would happen if they failed the test?</p> <p>Listening to Blair describe his vision of the future \u2013 in which one\u2019s duty was to get as educated as possible, before working like hell and frantically trying not to sink \u2013 I was struck by two things. First, the complete absence of any empathetic, human element (he mentioned the balance between life and work, but could only offer \u201caffordable, wraparound childcare between the hours of 8am-6pm for all who need it\u201d), and second, the sense that more than ever, I had no understanding of what values the modern Labour party stood for.</p> <p>If modern capitalism was now a byword for insecurity and inequality, Labour\u2019s response increasingly sounded like a Darwinian demand for people to accept that change, and do their best to ensure that they kept up. Worse still, those exacting demands were being made by a new clique of Labour politicians who were culturally distant from their supposed \u201ccore\u201d voters, and fatally unaware of their rising disaffection.</p> <p>In 2010, under Gordon Brown\u2019s butter-fingered leadership, Labour fell to a miserable 29% of the vote \u2013 its lowest share since 1983, when it came within a whisker of finishing third. Five years later, despite opinion polls suggesting a possible Labour win, Ed Miliband could only raise Labour\u2019s vote share by a single percentage point.</p> <p>If the party hoped to reassemble the electoral coalition that had just about held together through the second half of the 20th century, the world that gave rise to it had clearly gone. Trade union membership was at an all-time low, heavy industry had disappeared, and traditional class consciousness had waned.</p> <p>As those foundations crumbled, so did the party\u2019s old nostrums of nationalisation and redistribution. In their place, and in unbelievably favourable circumstances that veiled Labour\u2019s underlying weaknesses \u2013 a long economic boom, and a Conservative party incapable of coherence, let alone power \u2013 Blair and Brown had come up with a thin social democracy that stoked the risk-taking of the City and used the proceeds to spend huge amounts of money on public services. But the financial crisis had put an end to that model as well.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as deindustrialisation ripped through 20th-century economies, the instability and fragmentation embodied by the financial and service sectors was taken to its logical conclusion by new digital businesses. In turn, the latter have spawned what some now call \u201cplatform capitalism\u201d: a model whereby goods, services and labour can be rapidly exchanged between people, companies and multinational corporations \u2013 think of Uber, eBay, Airbnb or TaskRabbit, which link up freelance workers with people who need help with such tasks as cleaning, deliveries or moving home \u2013 with little need for any intermediate organisations. This has not only marginalised retailers and wholesalers. It calls into question the traditional role of trade unions, and further reduces the power of the state, which is now locked into a pattern where innovations take rapid flight and it cannot keep up.<strong> </strong></p> <p>In retrospect, the left\u2019s halcyon era was based on a straightforward project. When the archetypal factory gates swung open, out came thousands of men \u2013 and by and large, they were men \u2013 united by an unchanging daily experience, and ready to support a political force that would use the unions, the state, and the fabled \u201cmass party\u201d to create a new, much fairer world in their monolithic image.</p> <p>Now, an atomising, quicksilver economy bypasses those structures, and has fragmented people and places so thoroughly that assembling meaningful political coalitions has begun to appear almost impossible. These are the social and political conditions that define relatively prosperous places such as the commuter towns of Surrey, or Essex, the centres of the knowledge economy to be found around Cambridge, and the gleaming new town of Livingston in Scotland. And in a very different way, these new conditions can be experienced just as powerfully in the tracts of the UK that modernity seems to have left behind.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>In the spring of 2013,</strong> a couple of days after the death of Margaret Thatcher, the Guardian dispatched me to the post-industrial south Wales town of Merthyr Tydfil, to talk to people about the legacy of her time in power. I had been there many times before, and always beheld a place in which Labour\u2019s decline was not a matter of symbolism and metaphor, but something to be directly experienced.</p> <p>Essentially, it is a place defined by absences: of the coal and steel industries, and the huge Hoover factory that closed in 2009 \u2013 but more generally, of the ideas and institutions that once defined the Labour party and the wider Labour movement. Between 1900 and 1915, Merthyr was represented in the House of Commons by Keir Hardie, Labour\u2019s first leader and founding icon. In 1997, the party received an astonishing 77% of the vote in the town. But by 2010, that figure had crashed to 44%, as local politics belatedly reflected a lingering sense of dismay and loss that dated back to the defeat of the miners\u2019 strike in 1985.</p> <p>As I drove into town, I clocked an EE call centre, which pays its customer services operatives around \u00a316,000 a year. Outside the town\u2019s vast Tesco, I spoke to two retired men, who understood what had happened to Merthyr as a kind of offence to their basic values. In the past, one of them told me, \u201ca man wanted to be a working man: he didn\u2019t want to be in here, stacking shelves\u201d.<strong> </strong>When I asked him about the legacy of the miners\u2019 strike, what he said was full of pathos and tragedy. \u201cThirty years ago, whatever \u2026 it\u2019s still embedded in us down here, he said. \u201cWe still talk about it every day: what might have happened if it had gone the other way.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One in seven Britons is now self-employed. In the US, it is predicted, 50% of people will be partly freelance by 2020</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the town centre, I then met an 18-year-old who was finding it impossible to get a job. \u201cI\u2019ve applied and applied, and it\u2019s all been declined,\u201d she said. She wondered whether there was something wrong with her CV: the idea that there were perhaps larger forces to blame for her predicament did not enter the conversation. I wondered, did she know what a trade union was? \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t. What\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>One in seven Britons is now self-employed. In the US, Forbes magazine has predicted that by 2020, 50% of people will at least partly work on a freelance basis. In 2015, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development reported that since 1995, \u201cnon-standard\u201d jobs \u2013 which is to say, temporary, part-time or self-employed positions \u2013 accounted for the whole of net jobs growth in the UK since 1995.</p> <p>Such is the rise of the so-called \u201cgig economy\u201d. Economists and sociologists talk about \u201cthe precariat\u201d, a growing part of the population for whom work is not the basis of personal identity, but an on-off part of life from which they often need protection. Some of this, of course, is down to the venality and greed of businesses. But the central momentum behind it is rooted in technology, and what Marxists would call the \u201cmode of production\u201d. In a world in which businesses can survey their order books on an hourly basis and temporarily hire staff at the touch of a button, why would they base their arrangements on agreements that last for years?</p> <p>Merthyr is still said to be a Labour heartland. But like so many other places, it is brimming with a sense of a politics now hopelessly out of time: older people whose sense of a meaningful Labour identity is tangled up in an increasingly distant past, and younger residents who know nothing of any of this, and have little sense of the relevance of politics to their lives. In Merthyr, 56% of voters supported Brexit; at the Welsh assembly elections of 2016, Ukip won 20% of the local vote. In such places, the sense of Labour\u2019s fall is palpable<strong>.</strong></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Go to any traditional Labour area,</strong> and people will tell you that Labour was once \u201cthe party of the working man\u201d. Even now, from its name onwards, this reductive understanding of Labour, its people and its essential mission still runs deep, not least within the party itself. In place of \u201cthe working man\u201d, the New Labour years ushered in a politics pitched at \u201chard-working families\u201d, a term partly intended to reflect people\u2019s increasing antipathy towards people on benefits. Even when it was advocating enhancements to childcare and pre-school provision, Labour tended to do so in terms of getting new mothers back into paid employment as soon as possible.</p> <p>Today\u2019s Labour party has not shed these outmoded ideas about the nature of work. Both Owen Smith and Jeremy Corbyn have sketched utopian plans to somehow magic the world back to some unspecified time before 1980. Smith wants to revive the Ministry of Labour, done away with by Harold Wilson\u2019s Labour government in 1968. Corbyn\u2019s \u201c10-point plan to rebuild and transform Britain\u201d is all about \u201c<a href=\"http://www.jeremyforlabour.com/work\">full employment and an economy that works for all</a>\u201d, and promises to restore \u201csecurity to the workplace\u201d. These visions are either naive or dishonest, but they reflect delusions that run throughout Labour and the left.</p> <p>In a world in which work is changing radically, modern Conservatism applauds these shifts. For clued-up Tories, it is time to rebrand as \u201cthe workers\u2019 party\u201d \u2013 in which the worker is a totem of rugged individualism, not a symbol of solidarity. For proof, read Britannia Unchained, a breathless treatise about economics and the future of Britain co-authored by five Tory MPs who entered parliament in 2010: Kwasi Kwarteng, the new international development secretary Priti Patel, Dominic Raab, Chris Skidmore and Elizabeth Truss, who Theresa May appointed justice secretary in her first reshuffle. According to Britannia Unchained, the ideal modern worker is represented by the drivers who work for the London cab company Addison Lee. These people \u201cwork on a freelance basis. They can net \u00a3600 a week in take-home pay. But they have to work for it \u2013 up to 60 hours a week.\u201d In this vision \u2013 taken to its logical conclusion by Uber \u2013 the acceptance of insecurity becomes a matter of heroism, and a new political division arises between the grafters and those \u2013 as Britannia Unchained witheringly puts it \u2013 \u201cwho enjoy public subsidies\u201d. In other words, the \u201cskivers\u201d versus the \u201cstrivers\u201d.</p> <p>Blair tried to lead New Labour in this direction, but his attempts always jarred against his party\u2019s ingrained support for the traditional welfare state and its attachment to increasingly old-fashioned ideas of secure employment. But in the context of the modern labour market, lionising work for its own sake will never bolster support for a politics built on those values. Instead, it may push people to the right.</p> <p>People who work, after all, are no longer part of a monolithic mass: many increasingly think of themselves as lone agents, competing with others in much the same way that companies and corporations do. In the build-up to the 2015 election, I saw vivid proof of how fundamentally this erodes the left\u2019s old understanding of its bond with its supporters.</p> <p>In Plymouth, I watched a woman answer the door to a Labour canvasser with the words: \u201cI\u2019m a grafter \u2013 you ain\u2019t doing nothing for me.\u201d I spoke to a man in the north-eastern steeltown of Redcar who told me he would never vote Labour \u201cbecause I work\u201d. In the bellwether seat of Nuneaton, two women told me that Ed Miliband would probably win the election because \u201call the people on benefits\u201d were going to vote for him. As these people saw it, Labour was no longer the \u201cparty of work\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People on the left should be thinking about extending maternity and paternity leave and reviving adult education</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is a hell of a knot to untangle. But for the left, a solution might begin with the understanding of an epochal shift that pushed politics beyond the workplace and the economy into the sphere of private life \u2013 a transition first articulated by feminism, with the assertion that \u201cthe personal is political\u201d.</p> <p>Belatedly building this insight into left politics does not entail a move away from the kind of regulation and intervention that might make modern working lives much more bearable, nor from the idea that government might foster more rewarding and useful work, chiefly via investment and education.</p> <p>But beyond the old gospel of hard graft and the dignity of labour, any modern centre-left politics has to surely speak powerfully to elements of people\u2019s lives \u2013 as citizens, carers, friends and parents \u2013 which it has long underplayed, and for which the incessant demands of modern capitalism leave little room. People on the left should be thinking about extending maternity and paternity leave and allowing its reprise when children are older; reviving adult education (often for its own sake, not just in terms of \u201creskilling\u201d); assisting people in the creation of neighbourhood support networks that might belatedly answer the decline of the extended family; and, most obviously, enabling people to shorten their working week \u2013 think about a three-day weekend, and you begin to get a flavour of the left politics of the future.</p> <p>The deep changes wrought by our ageing society will anyway begin to increase the numbers of people beyond working age, and accelerate the shift away from paid work towards caring.<strong> </strong>But the most radical shift will be caused by automation<strong> </strong>and its effects on employment. If the Bank of England now reckons that as many as 15m British jobs are under threat from technology, and if a third of jobs in the retail sector are predicted to disappear by 2025, does the myopic, often macho rhetoric of work and the worker really articulate any meaningful vision?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"0068c92d7742e2b005cd14e8c3ec2b6c765a6eff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0068c92d7742e2b005cd14e8c3ec2b6c765a6eff/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Matt Chase\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Matt Chase</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Matt Chase</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>The left naturally embraced</strong> the mantra of the Occupy movement \u2013 the glaring division between the super rich and the rest of us embodied by the slogan \u201cWe are the 99%\u201d. Objectively, the idea of a division between a tiny, light-footed international elite and everybody else holds true. But in everyday life, this division finds little expression.</p> <p>Instead, the rising inequality fostered by globalisation and free-market economics manifests itself in a cultural gap that is tearing the left\u2019s traditional constituency in two. Once, social democracy \u2013 or, if you prefer, democratic socialism \u2013 was built on the support of both the progressive middle class and the parts of the working class who were represented by the unions. Now, a comfortable, culturally confident constituency seems to stare in bafflement at an increasingly resentful part of the traditionally Labour-supporting working class.</p> <p>The first group has an internationalised culture, a belief in what the modern vernacular calls diversity, and the confidence that comes with education and relative affluence. It can apparently cope with its version of job insecurity (think the freelance software developer, rather than the warehouse worker on a zero-hours contract). But on the other side are people who have a much more negative view of globalisation and modernity \u2013 and in particular, the large-scale movement of people. In the UK, they tend to live in the places that have largely voted Labour but supported leaving the EU, and whose loudest response to globalisation is to re-embrace precisely the \u201ccustom and practice\u201d, as Blair put it, that modern economies tend to squash: to emphasise place and belonging, and assert an essentially defensive national identity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Does anyone on the left want to write off the working-class voters who chose Brexit as a mass of bigots and racists?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From a sympathetic perspective, to put out a flag can be a gesture way beyond mere jingoism. It often stands as an assertion of esteem \u2013 and collective esteem, at that \u2013 in an insecure, unstable world that frequently seems to deny people any at all. Those who were once coalminers or steelworkers may now be temporarily-employed \u201coperatives\u201d waiting for word of that week\u2019s working hours.<strong> </strong>In a cultural sense, by contrast, national identity offers people at least some prospect of regaining a sense of who they are, and why that represents something important. Even when it comes to resentments around immigration, a nuanced, empathetic understanding should not be beyond anyone\u2019s grasp: people can be disorientated by rapid population change and anxious to assert a sense of place without such feelings turning hateful.</p> <p>There is also a much nastier side to all this \u2013 a surge in racism, which has happened all over Europe, and appears to have been given grim licence by the Brexit vote. Even so, does anyone on the left want to write off the 3.8m people who voted for Ukip in 2012 \u2013 or the even larger number of working-class voters who chose Brexit \u2013 as a mass of bigots and racists? Even in its most unpleasant manifestations, most prejudice has a wider context, and it is clear that these modern antipathies are most keenly felt in places that have either been left behind by modernity, or represent its most difficult elements: insecure job markets, scarce housing, overstretched public services.</p> <p>And this new mood is growing partly because of factors tangled up with the decline of the left: the demise of trade unions and the traditional workplace, which have left political vacuums now filled by another form of collective identity. A glaring example is the new politics of England and Englishness, which is as much bound up with class as it is with place, and has so far simmered away without finding a coherent expression.</p> <p>I have met enough people who have identified themselves as \u201cEnglish\u201d to know that it is usually not just a matter of national pride. It also tends to translate as a set of defiant cultural rejections, on the part of people who are not middle-class, not from London, and angry about the way that people who fit both those descriptions view the rest of the country. The UK census of 2011 was the first ever to include a question about national identity \u2013 and in England, 60% of people described themselves as English only. But the left, in Britain as much as in Europe, remains in denial about why people have taken refuge in such expressions of nationhood. This is something that applies to both so-called \u201cBlairites\u201d, and Corbyn and his supporters: one is so enraptured by globalisation that it thinks of vocal expressions of patriotism as a retrogressive block on progress; the other cleaves to a rose-tinted internationalism that regards such things as a facade for bigotry.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>In 2014, I spent three days</strong> in and around the Kent coast, following Ukip activists, and talking to people watching their manoeuvres. In the town of Broadstairs, a group of energetic leftwing activists \u2013 who would go on to found a thriving local branch of the pro-Corbyn group Momentum \u2013 had organised a day of campaigning against Ukip, focused on Nigel Farage\u2019s candidacy in the seat of South Thanet. I watched them debate with a man sitting on the town\u2019s seafront, who was determined to vote for Farage, and scornful of their attempts to dissuade him.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be voted in, and there\u2019s nothing you people can do about it,\u201d he said, gesturing to them with a kind of camp contempt.</p> <p>He then explained his main source of anger. His son, he said, had a speech disability, and could not find work in his chosen field of catering. \u201cNobody will give him a job. But a foreigner could come over here and speak not one word of English and they get a job.\u201d</p> <p>The truth of this was batted around for two or three minutes, before he came to his conclusion. \u201cI\u2019m brassed off,\u201d he said, and he then spoke pointedly about his own sense of insecurity. \u201cI\u2019m a working man. I\u2019ve paid all my taxes and everything. And if anything goes wrong with me or my family and I get thrown out of my house because I can\u2019t pay my mortgage, I\u2019ll get put in a bedsit.\u201d</p> <p>What, then, did he want? \u201cA better England,\u201d he said, and I could instantly sense that he had a basic set of grievances \u2013 about insecurity and unfairness \u2013 to which the political left would once have been able to confidently speak. Unfortunately, in the absence of any meaningful cultural bonds, the avowedly leftwing people to whom he was talking were residents of a completely different reality.</p> <p>Can things be any different? If left politics is not to shrink into a metropolitan shadow of itself and abandon hope of gaining national power, they have to. Indeed, if British politics is not to speed towards the kind of nasty populism taking root all over Europe and calling the shots in such countries as Poland and Hungary, this is a matter of urgency \u2013 not least because as automation takes hold, the disorientation on which the new rightwing politics feeds will only increase.</p> <p>Scotland is perhaps instructive. The Scottish National party\u2019s essential triumph has been to bond with millions of people via a modern, \u201ccivic\u201d kind of nationhood, and thereby recast a social democratic model of government in terms of identity and belonging<strong> </strong>\u2013 rather than standing on the other side of a cultural divide, as Labour now does in England. To some extent, this is a matter of clever branding, and the successive political feats pulled off by Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon: the lion\u2019s share of SNP MPs and MSPs are almost as metropolitan and media-savvy as the scions of New Labour were. But for the time being, it undoubtedly works.</p> <p>South of the border, by contrast, a key part of Labour\u2019s crisis is that it so clearly fails to speak to swaths of England \u2013 and Wales \u2013 and leaves these places open to political forces that want to sever their residual links to left politics for good. Circa 2006, it was the BNP. From around 2012 onwards, Ukip began to slowly push into Labour\u2019s old heartlands. Now, the millionaire Ukip donor Arron Banks is said to be mulling over a new party that might capitalise on the support for Brexit in working-class Labour areas and deliver them a new political identity. The stakes, then, are unbelievably high:<strong> </strong>if the left cannot speak for the people it once represented as a matter of instinct, much more malign forces will.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>If the left\u2019s predicament comes down</strong> to a single fault, it is this. It is very good at demanding change, but pretty hopeless at understanding it. Supposedly radical elements too often regard deep technological shifts as the work of greedy capitalists and rightwing politicians, and demand that they are rolled back. Meanwhile, the self-styled moderates tend to advocate large-scale surrender, instead of recognising that technological and economic changes can create new openings for left ideas. A growing estrangement from the left\u2019s traditional supporters makes these problems worse, and one side tends to cancel out the other. The result: as people experience dramatic change in their everyday lives, they form the impression that half of politics has precious little to say to them.</p> <p>In a political reality as complex as ours, there are inevitable problems for the political right as well. It is a long time since the Conservative party has spoken the visceral, populist language that was the hallmark of Margaret Thatcher. As with Blair in 2005, the Tories were recently elected to power with the support of less than a quarter of the electorate. Similarly, in Germany, Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats once vied with the Social Democrats for the support of a majority of the population, but they are now down to around 30%. But modern challenges for the centre-right will always be less difficult than they are for the left. The former, after all, seeks to safeguard and advance modern capitalism rather than substantially change it. Even in the absence of a broad social base, the right is sustained by big business and the conservative press, which give it huge political advantages.</p> <p>The left has responded to its crisis by looking endlessly inward \u2013 but occasionally, there are flashes of hope. There is a rising recognition, among both former followers of Blair and alumni of the traditional left, that Labour\u2019s old majoritarian dreams are probably finished \u2013 and that it should finally embrace proportional representation and build new alliances and coalitions. This change would probably trigger a split between the party\u2019s estranged left and right, and thereby bring Britain into line with the rest of Europe, where the left\u2019s crisis is highlighted by a tussle between traditional social democrats and new radicals.</p> <p>In Britain and plenty of other places, there is growing interest in the idea of a universal basic income, built on an understanding of accelerating economic changes, and their far-reaching consequences for the left\u2019s almost religious attachment to the glories of paid employment. It is early days for such a leap. But proposing that the state should meet some or all of people\u2019s basic living costs would be an implicit acknowledgement that work alone cannot possibly deliver the collective security that the left has always seen as its basic mission, and that space has to be created for the other elements of people\u2019s lives.</p> <p>Whether the left can come to terms with the new politics of national identity and belonging and thereby rein in its nastier aspects is a much more difficult question \u2013 but if it doesn\u2019t, its activists may very well gaze at their parties\u2019 old \u201ccore\u201d supporters across an impossible divide.</p> <p>Perhaps the most generous verdict is that here and across the world, the left \u2013 radicals and liberals alike \u2013 is stuck in an interregnum. You could compare it to the predicament of the 1980s, but it is even more reminiscent of the 1930s, when the aftershocks of an economic crash saw the left pushed aside by the politics of hatred and division.</p> <p>In 1931, the great Labour thinker RH Tawney wrote a short text titled The Choice Before the Labour Party, casting a cold eye over its predicament in terms that ring as true now as they must have done then. Labour, he wrote, \u201cdoes not achieve what it could, because it does not know what it wants. It frets out of office and fumbles in it, because it lacks the assurance either to wait or to strike. Being without clear convictions as to its own meaning and purpose, it is deprived of the dynamic which only convictions supply. If it neither acts with decision nor inspires others so to act, the principal reason is that it is itself undecided.\u201d</p> <p>No party can exist forever. Political traditions can decline, and then take on new forms; some simply become extinct. All that can be said with certainty is that if the left is to finally leave the 20th century, the process will have to start with the ideas and convictions that answer the challenges of a modernity it is only just starting to wake up to, let alone understand.</p> <p>\u2022 This is the first in a series of pieces by a range of contributors on new futures for the left.</p> <p><strong>Main illustration: Matt Chase</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>",

For reasons unknown (but maybe justified by our consumption of nearly one billion chickens per year in the UK), they\u2019re concentrating solely on chicken and egg dishes. They\u2019ll be off to the US, France and north Africa, but not before making the perfect roast chicken in the UK (brine it the night before) and making a rib-sticking chicken pudding. Hardly their most inspiring concept. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2><strong>One Of Us </strong><br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>This four-part, star-studded drama can\u2019t quite seem to decide whether it\u2019s a deep-delving psychological examination of a dreadful dilemma or a glorified game of Cluedo. In this penultimate episode, the families of the murdered honeymoon couple come under further pressure from the police regarding Lee\u2019s disappearance. Meanwhile, Peter is driven to utter despair and Claire makes an alarming discovery rewatching Adam and Grace\u2019s wedding video. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2><strong>All Together Now: The Great Orchestra Challenge </strong><br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>Access all arias: Katie Derham\u2019s quest to find the UK\u2019s best amateur orchestra continues, with the four remaining ensembles tasked with accompanying opera singers. Can the plucky part-timers master Puccini and Bizet?

Diane (\u201cCunk\u201d) Morgan, Lucy Punch and Anna Maxwell Martin are by turns chaotic, uber-competitive and Not Coping Very Well (\u201cI really want the children to be brought up like I was \u2013 by my mother\u201d) in this delicious one-off from the combined writing talents of Graham and Helen Linehan, Sharon Horgan and Holly Walsh. Fingers crossed for a series. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Wolf Creek <br>10pm, Fox</h2> <p>Rarely has the sun-baked grandeur of the Australian outback seemed so scary.

Trouble is, everyone Eve meets seems to be out to get her, even a local cop in the town of Kutyukutyu. She needs to toughen up \u2013 and fast.

  "<p>What can be done with used nappies? The UK throws away around 3bn disposable nappies a year, while in the US it\u2019s approximately 20bn. Each can take hundreds of years to degrade. But now companies are developing new ways of reusing dirty nappies.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Waste2Aromatics, a Dutch-led project from tech company Biorizon, is working with a consortium of companies to convert the virgin wood fibre from recycled nappies, supplied by UK nappy recycler <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.knowaste.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Knowaste</a>, and other <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.environdec.com/en/PCR/Detail/?Pcr=7900\" rel=\"nofollow\">absorbent hygiene products</a> (AHPs) into bio-aromatics \u2013 raw materials for the chemical industry.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThese products can be used in coatings, lubricants and performance plastics,\u201d says Biorizon project manager Murk van Rooijen. \u201cWe hope to produce small amounts of these products in the next 18 months.\u201d</p> <p>Plans are underway to commercialise the technology, starting with a pilot plant likely to be built in the Netherlands, which could be operational by 2019</p> <p>Bio-aromatics could potentially replace traditional aromatics made from fossil fuels, if production can be scaled up. \u201cWe haven\u2019t calculated the CO2 emission savings in detail yet, but expect to have these results in six months,\u201d says van Rooijen.</p> <p>Knowaste\u2019s UK managing director Paul Richardson says projects like Waste2Aromatics may represent the future of nappy recycling. Knowaste aims to recover around 18% of the UK\u2019s AHP waste, including <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2010-12/1169\" rel=\"nofollow\">disposable nappies</a>, by building five to seven specialist recycling facilities over the next five years. It\u2019s ambitious, given that nappy recycling is still <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/recycling-used-disposable-nappies-scotland-sustainable-solution\">nascent</a> in the UK.</p> <p>Currently Knowaste uses mostly commercial sources to collect AHP products, such as hospitals, nursing homes. The company is aiming to tap into the harder to access domestic stream, which Richardson estimates produces more than three times the amount of waste. While there are councils with dedicated nappy recycling schemes, these are few and far between.</p> <p>Knowaste was refused <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.knowaste.com/news-and-events/knowaste-will-appeal-hillingdon-council-decision-on-hayes-proposal\" rel=\"nofollow\">planning permission</a> in July for a \u00a315m nappy recycling plant in west London over potential odour problems. In 2013, Scottish nappy recycling trials involving Knowaste\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://resource.co/article/Latest/Knowaste_West_Bromwich_plant_close-3126\" rel=\"nofollow\">now-closed</a> West Bromwich plant were deemed a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.zerowastescotland.org.uk/content/nappy-days-could-be-way-recycling-trials-are-hit-parents\" rel=\"nofollow\">success</a>, but they have since ground to a halt with no plans to reinstate them. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Despite this, Richardson remains optimistic. He says his company has developed products such as pet litter, waste containers and insulation material from the recovered fibre and plastic fractions of AHP waste.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe cat litter market for the UK and Europe is around 500,000 tonnes a year, and we would produce about 10,000 tonnes from one facility,\u201d he says, adding that Knowaste has secured a wholesale deal for the cat litter, that would cover the output from two plants.<br></p> <p>Global nappy brands Pampers and Huggies are keen to be associated with similar end-of-life solutions. In Italy, Pampers manufacturer P&amp;G has established Fater, a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.fatergroup.com/uk/news/projects/recycling-project\" rel=\"nofollow\">joint venture</a> with AHP producer Angelini, to build a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.fatergroup.com/uk/news/social-responsibility/testing-first-machine-recycle-used-personal-hygiene-absorbent-products\" rel=\"nofollow\">pilot plant</a> capable of recycling 8,000 tonnes of disposable nappies each year, which are likely to come from kerbside collection schemes. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Pampers\u2019 spokesman Ioannis Hatzopoulos says the technology is still in pilot stage but the plastics generated by the facility could be turned into street benches, school desks and bottle tops. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Two of P&amp;G\u2019s US manufacturing sites are converting pre-consumer nappy and baby wipe scrap into upholstery filling. Hatzopoulos says the plan is to roll this out across other sites. \u201cWe use nappy scrap to produce baby wipe containers in a closed-loop recycling programme. Last year, we also started using nappy scrap to generate fuel cubes used in cement plants locally for heating.\u201d</p> <p>In New Zealand, Kimberly-Clark\u2019s Huggies partnership with <a href=\"https://envirocomp.co.nz\" rel=\"nofollow\">Envirocomp</a> has composted over <a href=\"http://3blmedia.com/News/Kimberly-Clark-ANZ-Launches-New-Five-Year-Sustainability-Strategy-and-Latest-Sustainability\" rel=\"nofollow\">19m</a> nappies since 2008 to make soil for landscaping. Customers register with Envirocomp, pre-purchase compostable nappy bags and are then able to deposit used nappies at drop off points. </p> <p>More than NZ$850,000 (\u00a3467,000) has been invested in the initiative. \u201cWe\u2019re working to create a more circular business model that allows us to recapture materials for reuse,\u201d says Kimberly-Clark\u2019s sustainability adviser, Ryan Kane.</p> <p>Kimberly-Clark is also repurposing leftover nappy scrap \u2013 its Huggies nappy mill in Sydney, Australia, is fitted with a specialist reclaim unit. Kane says any material that can\u2019t be reused is sold on to local producers for horticultural and consumer goods, or processed into fuel pellets for cement factories.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Startups like <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://dycle.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">DYCLE</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gdiapers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">gDiapers</a> are addressing nappy waste.

A pilot project ran in Berlin last year, involving a week\u2019s supply of nappies from 20 babies.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cOne tree could produce 50kg of fruit every year,\u201d says DYCLE founder, Ayumi Matsuzaka. \u201cWe want to keep the harvested fruit in the local communities.

  "<p>In 2017, several months after the United States swears in a new president, the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands will turn 50 years old. Some birthdays ought not to be celebrated, however. Through its occupation, Israel continues to colonize territory in the West Bank and further entrench its military rule, with no sign of it ending. American politicians may not want to face this reality, but the situation is dire, leading Jay Michaelson of The Forward to <a href=\"http://forward.com/opinion/348267/if-israels-occupation-is-permanent-why-isnt-it-the-same-as-apartheid/\">write</a>: \u201cAs a temporary policy, the occupation is unjust. As a permanent one, it is apartheid.\u201d</p> <p>Luckily, both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have good, workable solutions to this most intractable of problems. Just kidding. Although the entire world knows that a durable resolution to the conflict is imperative, not in the interests of justice but also in the pursuit of peace in the region, the American presidential candidates have about as much to offer peace in the Middle East as New Coke and Crystal Pepsi offered to the future of carbonated beverages.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Donald Trump doesn\u2019t seem to know where he stands, but he\u2019ll stand there vehemently. In January 2013, Trump recorded a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tm5Je73bYOY&amp;feature=youtu.be\">video</a> endorsing rightwing Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s run for prime minister, but by December 2015, Trump <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/0e098fa7e6ec4900b08efad80c15348a/ap-conversation-trump-calls-mideast-peace-toughest-deal\">told</a> the Associated Press that he would be \u201cneutral\u201d when negotiating a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, and he questioned \u201cwhether or not Israel\u2019s willing to sacrifice certain things\u201d to come to an agreement.</p> <p>But then, by March 2016, Trump was again changing positions. He <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2016/03/21/donald-trump-aipac-israel-hillary-clinton-sot-tsr.cnn\">said</a> that \u201cit\u2019s probably not possible\u201d to be neutral and by May, he <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3571403/Trump-insists-Israel-building-West-Bank-settlements-says-Netanyahu-moving-forward-Palestinians-fired-thousands-missiles-Jewish-state.html\">told</a> the Daily Mail that Israel should \u201ckeep moving forward\u201d with new settlement construction in the West Bank, thereby flouting five decades of stated (though completely ineffectual) US policy.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t stop there. Come June, Trump\u2019s co-adviser on Israeli affairs, David Friedman, told the Israeli newspaper <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.726779\">Haaretz</a> that Trump would probably support annexing parts of the West Bank and that a Palestinian state is not \u201can American imperative at all\u201d, with Friedman asserting that he\u2019s also unconcerned about a binational state because \u201cnobody really knows how many Palestinians live there\u201d.</p> <p>In fact, there are 2,898,927 Palestinians living in the West Bank, 1,850,559 in the Gaza Strip, 1,471,201 in Israel, and a total of 12,365,761 worldwide (end of <a href=\"http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Downloads/book2188.pdf\">2015</a> figures), according to the reputable Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics.</p> <p>Even the rabidly rightwing Breitbart News \u2013 now completely aligned with the Trump campaign \u2013 links to a source <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/tag/palestinian-bureau-of-statistics/\">citing</a> the Palestinian statistics bureau. So when Trump\u2019s adviser says nobody really knows, he must mean Trump doesn\u2019t know. Trump is nobody.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s Hillary Clinton, a politician who seems never to have met a war she won\u2019t vote for. Her bellicose <a href=\"http://time.com/4265947/hillary-clinton-aipac-speech-transcript/\">speech</a> in front of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) last March promised not a new solution to the conflict but rather a shield for Israel from global pressure and nonviolent opposition movements over Israel\u2019s actions and illegal settlement activity. The <a href=\"https://www.demconvention.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Democratic-Party-Platform-7.21.16-no-lines.pdf\">final</a> Democratic party platform isn\u2019t much better on the issue. It repeats language similar to Clinton\u2019s Aipac speech, declaring that Israelis \u201cdeserve security\u201d (and Palestinians don\u2019t?), while Palestinians \u201cshould be\u201d rather than \u201cmust be\u201d free to govern themselves. As a practiced diplomat, Clinton surely knows that such word choices matter.</p> <p>When Democratic party leaders were negotiating the 2016 platform, the Bernie Sanders wing of the party proposed an amendment calling for \u201can end to occupation and illegal settlements\u201d. This internationally recognized position was considered too \u201c<a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/06/29/inside-the-democratic-partys-showdown-over-israel-palestine/\">one-sided</a>\u201d for the party establishment, and the amendment was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/09/politics/democratic-platform-israel-palestine-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders/\">defeated</a> by a vote of 73-95, though the final draft twice mentions that Palestinians ought to be able to live in \u201cdignity\u201d. The Republican Party <a href=\"https://prod-static-ngop-pbl.s3.amazonaws.com/media/documents/DRAFT_12_FINAL%5b1%5d-ben_1468872234.pdf\">platform</a>, meanwhile, is zealously anti-Palestinian and basically off in its own world. It states that the party \u201crejects the false notion that Israel is an occupier\u201d, and describes the completely nonviolent Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement as one of several \u201calternative forms of warfare\u201d being waged upon Israel. So there\u2019s that.</p> <p>Party platform statements don\u2019t mean much in the end, and these reflect more how the Democrats are sticking to a tired status quo framed by the 1993 Oslo Accords and the Republicans are spinning hard to the right. Neither position offers anything that shows that they truly understand the reality of the situation.</p> <p>According to the New York Times, there are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/03/12/world/middleeast/netanyahu-west-bank-settlements-israel-election.html\">now</a> more than 350,000 settlers living in the West Bank and another 300,000 living in East Jerusalem, greater than double the number since the Oslo Accords were signed and still in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits an occupying power from transferring its citizens into territory it controls or displacing those who live there. Around 60% of West Bank land, dubbed Area C under Oslo, is under exclusive Israeli control. And the thriving business of settlement enterprises further dispossesses Palestinians, as Human Rights Watch recently <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/01/19/occupation-inc-how-settlement-businesses-contribute-israels-violations-palestinian\">documented</a>. Some Palestinians who have lost their own businesses or farms due to Israeli land confiscations, discriminatory regulations, or water deprivations are then left with no choice but to work for the very businesses that displaced them in the first place.</p> <p>Palestinian citizens of Israel struggle under a <a href=\"http://www.adalah.org/en/content/view/7771\">system</a> that accords them fewer rights and opportunities than their Jewish counterparts. And regardless of what one thinks of Hamas, the siege that Israel imposes (with Egyptian collusion) on Gaza affects all of its inhabitants and is unconscionable. According to the Israeli organization <a href=\"http://gisha.org/\">Gisha</a>, over 70% of Gaza\u2019s population relies on humanitarian aid, while 47% suffer from food insecurity. In the second quarter of 2016, unemployment was at 41.7%, and at a staggering 57.6% among young people.</p> <p>Nothing in the current situation excuses the abhorrent and immoral attacks on civilians, whether coming from Palestinians or Israelis, and any lasting solution must work to guarantee peace and security for everyone.</p> <p>But the precarious situation of today is a consequence and not a contradiction of the 1993 Oslo Accords, and it\u2019s high time we recognize that the Oslo Accords are as likely to bring peace to the Middle East as Donald Trump is to unite America. From its conception, Oslo never required Israel to recognize Palestinian rights to statehood and has instead enabled Israeli encroachment on the West Bank. Over 20 years ago, Edward Said predicted that the accords would establish the Palestinian Authority not as a sovereign government of the Palestinians but as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v15/n20/edward-said/the-morning-after\">Israel\u2019s enforcer</a>\u201d of the occupation. I was a student of Edward Said\u2019s then, and I clearly remember the loneliness from which he objected to the agreement along with his refusal to attend the White House signing ceremony out of principle. At the time, he was considered an obstructionist outlier. History has only proven him right.</p> <p>The next president of the United States must recognize the folly of current approaches and seek new solutions. Until now, the international consensus has been focused on a state-oriented resolution as a way to confer rights and stability to Palestinians and Israelis. But what if that equation were flipped, if the focus were instead on enshrining full equality for everyone before even considering the creation of two states? A new administration ought to concentrate on mechanisms (including withholding aid) geared to guaranteeing the human rights of all the people living between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan river, along with ways to preserve the communal rights of each of the communities.</p> <p>Whether the result of such an approach leads to one state or two states or 21 states on the land is immaterial. (In fact, slim majorities of both Palestinians and Israelis still <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/dae99c74e08a4c4082e8c2387ad656d8/poll-shows-most-israelis-palestinians-still-seek-peace\">support</a> a two-state solution.) What matters is that we finally wake from the 23-year-old slumber induced by Oslo, the numbing half-century of occupation, and the nearly 70 years of Palestinian dispossession, to see that the only durable resolution to this conflict will be one that protects Israelis and Palestinians equally, with liberty and justice for all. </p>",

China\u2019s G20 leadership has come to a close in Hangzhou after G20 leaders were treated to a spectacular show on the West Lake.</p> <p>The final G20 communiqu\u00e9 confirms the necessary consensus for G20\u2019s long-term vision and commits leaders to a blueprint for innovative growth, but falls decidedly short on substance.</p> <p>As Chinese President Xi Jinping closed the summit, state-run media outlet Peoples Daily Online announced to the twittersphere:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PDChina/status/772747591255752704\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/G20Live?src=hash\">#G20Live</a> The 11th <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/G20?src=hash\">#G20</a> summit has just concluded with great success: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/XiJinping?src=hash\">#XiJinping</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/tjHOu3gEdf\">pic.twitter.com/tjHOu3gEdf</a></p>&mdash; People&#39;s Daily,China (@PDChina) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PDChina/status/772747591255752704\">September 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>But was there really ever any other option?

It offered the platform for promoting the Beijing economic model, including the \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative and Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (AIIB) on the world stage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/04/the-guardian-view-on-the-g20-helping-china-find-its-new-place-in-the-world\">The Guardian view on the G20: helping China find its new place in the world | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Making the most of its status as a developing nation, China brought the dual themes of development and inclusiveness more firmly into focus. By extending official consultations well beyond the circle of G20 members, and inviting a record number of guests from the developing world, China secured its claim to being the most inclusive G20 host.</p> <p>The claim underscored China\u2019s proposal for a G20 action plan for implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/03/breakthrough-us-china-agree-ratify-paris-climate-change-deal\">US-Chinese joint ratification of the Paris agreement on climate change</a> just hours ahead of the summit delivered a striking headline and offered the promise of a new model for G20 shared leadership.</p> <p>In China\u2019s eyes, each of these is a marker of success. For domestic audiences, China\u2019s success was accentuated by intense state media coverage of key summit events. Xi\u2019s keynote speeches provided a focal point, while the high-tech lakeside gala performance of Swan Lake proved a highlight. Unsurprisingly, contesting themes found limited airtime or print space.</p> <p>Against this background, the leaders\u2019 summit itself proved to be little more than a side event.<br></p> <p>In part this reflected a distinct absence of information and communication. Inside the media centre, blank video screens gave little away. Press briefings were limited. Patchy internet and social media connections limited the potential for commentary and analysis, especially by foreign journalists.</p> <p>The silence on matters of G20 substance, including the details of the final communiqu\u00e9 \u2013 made available only after Xi\u2019s final press briefing \u2013 was deafening. When it did arrive, the nine-page, 7,000-word communiqu\u00e9 offered few insights.</p> <p>It was arranged around five themes: policy co-ordination; innovative economic growth; financial and economic governance; trade and investment; and development.</p> <p>The communiqu\u00e9 reflected the increasingly complex and technical language of G20 officials. Combined with its lack of concrete and measurable actions, the communiqu\u00e9 provides a clear signal that G20 leaders gained little collective ground during the summit.<br></p> <p>Recognising that economic growth has been too slow for too long and for too few, the communiqu\u00e9 does set out an agreed longer-term vision for the G20. This so-called \u201cHangzhou Consensus\u201d calls on the G20 to deliver more inclusive economic growth through co-ordinated macroeconomic policy, open trade and innovation. In short, it reaffirms the group\u2019s core mandate: to make globalisation work for the benefit of all.</p> <p>The consensus is followed by a raft of vague commitments for action. Ranging from innovation and the \u201cnew industrial revolution\u201d, to issues of business financing, international tax avoidance, anti-corruption measures, open trade and implementation of the sustainable development goals, the commitments fall short of expectations.</p> <p>Little real progress was made on key issues of climate change and energy. Other challenges that consumed the attention and energy of leaders on the sidelines, including co-ordinated responses to the Syrian crisis, refugees, terrorism and migration, remain unresolved.</p> <p>For Australia an underwhelming G20 outcome is not a bad outcome.<br></p> <p>Australia\u2019s low-key objectives to strengthen moves against international tax avoidance, to boost confidence in global trade and open markets, and to highlight innovation as a driver of economic growth were largely met.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/g20-chinese-newspaper-claims-western-media-hyped-up-obama-snub\">Chinese newspaper claims western media 'hyped up' Obama G20 snub</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sideline meetings with India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, and the United Kingdom\u2019s prime minister, Theresa May, point to positive bilateral prospects. On balance, the summit was probably worthwhile.</p> <p>It is hard not to feel underwhelmed by the 2016 G20 and the Hangzhou Consensus it has delivered. But diplomacy is at its core an incremental business. In today\u2019s complex and complicated world the opportunity for leaders to sit together at the G20 table is not to be underestimated.</p> <p>Ultimately, though, G20 success is a matter of perspective. For many, the Hangzhou G20 has fallen decidedly short on substance. For others, it continued the incremental business of global economic governance. For China, there is only one outcome: the G20 was a great success.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Code\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/64866/count.gif&quot; alt=&quot;The Conversation&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/caitlin-byrne-128420\">Caitlin Byrne</a> is Assistant Professor, International Relations, Bond University.</strong></p> <p><strong>This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/au\">The Conversation</a></strong><br></p>",
  "<p>A few weeks ago, I was representing the Guardian at a media industry news quiz. It was neck and neck, and then the question came: who is the captain of the Australian netball team? I gasped. My eyes widened. I blushed. Lauren, something \u2026 I said quietly, without confidence. My two teammates didn\u2019t know. The other team didn\u2019t know. The host opened it up to the audience of about 100 people. In a room full of journalists, not a single person knew.</p> <p>If this had been asked at any point in my primary school years, I would have known and shouted out: <a href=\"http://www.annesargeant.com.au/about-anne/\">Anne Sargeant! </a> She was my hero. Later Sargeant was replaced by <a href=\"http://www.lizellis.com.au/\">Liz Ellis</a>. As a kid I played netball and watched netball on TV. Sometimes, a group of girls from my netball team and their mums would go to an elite match as a group party. We played netball, it was our sport, of course we wanted to be fans of netball, too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/09/ellyse-perry-its-the-most-exciting-time-in-womens-cricket\">Ellyse Perry: 'It's the most exciting time in women's cricket' | Russell Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is why I have to apologise to my sports colleagues at the Guardian. Because \u2013 despite some years of going backwards \u2013 there has been some progress in netball. New sponsors, new TV rights and a massive potential audience mean netball is back in the spotlight, almost. I\u2019ve watched our sports editor and his team try their hardest to get netball on the homepage. I read the World Cup stories, played with the interactive features and \u2013 yes! \u2013 I have seen the captain of the Australian netball team, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/27/laura-geitz-says-new-scoring-zones-would-alter-whole-concept-of-netball\">Laura Geitz</a>, on the front of the Guardian\u2019s website.<br></p> <p>But here\u2019s the thing. You can\u2019t have a fanbase without fanfare. Investment in women\u2019s sport cannot be treated as a short-term offering or a one-off. It will take time to build a fanbase. It takes time for fans to learn the names of their teams, and their favourite players. Fans will only invest their energy en masse in a sport they can rely on. They need to be able to come back to it week after week. Being a fan is a hobby as much as being a player. It takes time to get good at it. News from the sport needs to bubble into conversations on the playground, in the office, at home or at the pub with mates.<br></p> <p>And that\u2019s why one news organisation or a singular sport can\u2019t do it alone.<br></p> <p>There is no lack of evidence that long-term investment will pay off, or that the public is willing to watch, enjoy and even rejoice in women\u2019s sports and players.<br></p> <p>In Australia, we\u2019re lucky to have a long list of inspirational female sports heroes, not least of whom is the extraordinary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/09/ellyse-perry-its-the-most-exciting-time-in-womens-cricket\">Ellyse Perry</a>, a star in the national team in both cricket and football. But I would argue that Perry has not yet received her due in sustained media attention, and that is no fault of her own but down to the subverted platform of the sports she plays \u201cas a woman\u201d.

But there is no doubt that the emerging star of Rio was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/03/simone-biles-gymnastics-america-rio-2016\">Simone Biles</a>, a 19-year-old whose talent almost defies logic.

How many little girls already doing gymnastics suddenly saw their weekly class less as a bit of fun and more as training for a career? </p> <p>And how many myths about what it means to be feminine were smashed by the dazzling display of Biles\u2019 body strength and control? How many girls who choose Biles as a hero are saved from the myth that a girl has to be a waif to be attractive?

Williams is that she is lucky to play a sport where women are granted exposure. Four times a year, every year, young girls (and boys) get to see women battling it out on the tennis court in the same competition as men. OK, sometimes they are asked to twirl or about their dating life rather than their game, but there they are, household names, playing and winning. And that is one of the reasons why Williams\u2019 impact has gone so far beyond the sport of tennis. Her effect on young black women cannot be overestimated.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>While she was playing at Wimbledon this year, two black men, Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, were shot by police in America. After Williams won that tournament, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/12/serena-williams-champion-black-female-power-black-lives-matter\">she raised her fist</a> in an act <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/30/black-power-salute-1968-olympics\">that was described as reminiscent of John Carlos\u2019s black power salute at the 1968 Olympics</a>.</p> <p>The conversations sparked by Williams and Biles are the best illustration of why supporting women\u2019s sport is so important. Heroes like them emerge when they are granted a platform by society. But grand slam tennis and the Olympic Games are giant platforms and they are too few and far between in Australia.</p> <p>The examples of these two remarkable women show that when the world is exposed to female champions, it is not just sports and sponsors who benefit, but all of society. The issue is too important to try short-term strategies. The sports and the players are there, an audience awaits. What is needed is the platform, and that can only exist with the media, sports and sponsors acting together.</p> <p><em>This article is based on a speech given to a seminar on gender equality in sport, held by M&amp;C Saatchi S&amp;E and the Guardian in Sydney </em></p>",

He\u2019s been in more than 30 films, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbdJLjm5utc\">including last year\u2019s Gutterd\u00e4mmerung</a>, in which he appeared alongside Grace Jones and his hero, Iggy Pop \u2013 ironically, the film was silent \u2013 and hosts a weekly radio show for KCRW in his hometown of Los Angeles. (Perhaps it\u2019s helpful to note, at this point, that Rollins \u2013 born Henry Garfield \u2013 was diagnosed with hyperactivity in fourth grade.)</p> <p>But what does Rollins still have to be angry about? By his own admission, he\u2019s a rich, white, heterosexual, educated American dude who has been spared what he calls the American beating. \u201cI live in a really nice neighbourhood [in the Hollywood Hills] with ridiculously famous neighbours,\u201d he says. \u201cI call the cops and they show up in about 40 seconds and they call me \u2018Mr Rollins\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a far cry from the days when the LAPD routinely harassed Black Flag and their fans, often shutting down shows. More seriously, Rollins has seen the extreme violence of America close up too: in 1991 he bore witness to the still-unsolved murder of his best friend Joe Cole, who was shot dead in an attempted robbery.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95d1adb711650cb0c8000e154abe851e5dd2468f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95d1adb711650cb0c8000e154abe851e5dd2468f/0_0_2300_1488/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Henry Rollins performs at Hammersmith Apollo in 2008\" width=\"1000\" height=\"647\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018America gets what America deserves\u2019: Henry Rollins.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Success has mostly insulated him from further trauma.

  "<p>The international community has not only failed to meet the education targets set out in the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/\">millennium development goals</a>, it is also highly unlikely to meet the 2030 deadline for education laid out in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/ng-interactive/2015/jan/19/sustainable-development-goals-changing-world-17-steps-interactive\">sustainable development agenda</a>, with the poorest countries the hardest hit, according to the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. </p> <p>Unesco\u2019s <a href=\"http://gem-report-2016.unesco.org/en/home/\">global education monitoring report</a> 2016 shows that just 64 countries of the 157 tracked by the report met MDG 2, which called for every child in the world to receive a full course of primary school education by 2015. Not a single low-income country met the target, which was achieved by a number of high-income countries before the MDGs were introduced. Niger, Rwanda and Central African Republic are among 11 countries not expected to achieve universal primary education until 2100.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/testing/2016/08/education2/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/testing/2016/08/education2/boot.js\" data-alt=\"mdg\"> </figure>  <p>The MDGs are distinct from the sustainable development goals introduced last September but both are global, time-bound attempts to address global poverty, hunger and inequality. The SDGs, which consist of 17 goals, have a target date of 2030.</p> <p>The SDG education objective is wider ranging than its predecessor, encompassing both primary and secondary school, and requiring students to complete their education. The world\u2019s poorest children are four times likelier to be out of school than the richest, but even wealthy countries are far from meeting the first target under SDG 4, which reads: \u201cBy 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes\u201d.</p> <p>Only 12 countries are currently on track to meet SDG 4; just two of those are in Europe. The US is not expected to meet the goal until 2040, while India \u2013 predicted to be the first country in south Asia to achieve it \u2013 will not get there until 2085, according to the report. No low-income country is on target to meet the goal by 2030. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/testing/2016/08/education2/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/testing/2016/08/education2/boot.js\" data-alt=\"sdg\"> </figure>  <p>Several factors account for those sobering statistics according to Aaron Benavot, director of the <a href=\"http://gem-report-2016.unesco.org/en/home/\">global education monitoring report</a>. Economic and social inequality, as well as conflict, are major obstacles to ensuring universal education, said Benavot, but the international community also has to get smarter about aligning funds with need. </p> <p>\u201cOur report looked at aid to education being received by 170 countries since 2003, and showed that it has been associated less with need, and more with trade interests,\u201d he said. \u201cMongolia has universal primary completion already, but receives 15 times the amount of aid to education per child than Chad, for instance, where only just over a quarter of children are completing primary education.\u201d</p> <p>By 2015, only 40% of the 157 countries tracked by the report had achieved universal primary education. The remainder were forecast to reach the goal over the next 85 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/archive-4-zip/giv-31075LOpLbY523dYD/\" data-alt=\"primary-long\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/archive-4-zip/giv-31075LOpLbY523dYD/\">primary-long</a> </figure>  <p>Forecasts for when countries will reach universal secondary education are still more daunting, with only 8% likely to do so by 2030.

But it is feasible that the new agenda will contribute to never before seen change.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2016/apr/25/where-is-the-riskiest-place-to-live-floods-storms\">Where is the riskiest place to live?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The report noted that meeting education targets could have positive effects on other development goals. Were universal secondary education achieved by 2030, for instance, it is predicted that there would be up to 20,000 fewer deaths over the next two decades, assuming the frequency of natural disasters remains unchanged. Should disaster frequency increase, the number of lives saved could rise as high as 50,000. This is because evidence suggests higher levels of education make people \u201cless vulnerable and more resilient to natural disasters\u201d. </p> <p>Meeting education targets could have a particularly dramatic effect on infant mortality. Achieving universal lower secondary education for women in sub-Saharan Africa by 2030 would prevent up to 3.5 million child deaths between 2050 and 2060, found the report. This is because women who are better educated take more preventative measures to protect their children, said Benavot. \u201cThey know what makes up a nutritious diet, and are also more likely to have basic skills that can find them a decent job, lifting them out of poverty and insecure work, and [enabling them to] better provide for their children.\u201d</p> <p></p>"
