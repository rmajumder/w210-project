  "<p> Rugby sevens seems to <em>fit </em>the Olympics. The sport has, to a greater or lesser degree, the physicality of judo, the skill of rhythmic gymnastics, the athleticism of the 400m dash, the aggression of sprint cycling, and the gut-busting endurance of rowing. It\u2019s fast and funky and fun. And it\u2019s ready to bust out all over.</p> <p> Sevens athletes range from amateur to semi-professional. They are among the fittest people at the Games. They mix sub-optimal endurance with high-octane effort. They need mental clarity under high fatigue. They train so hard they vomit. They run and run and run.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/12/rugby-is-our-religion-fiji-erupts-in-celebration-of-olympic-sevens-gold\">'Rugby is our religion': Fiji erupts in celebration of Olympic sevens gold</a> </p> </aside>  <p> You wonder why it\u2019s taken so long to be an Olympic sport. (And then you think, oh yes - the IOC.) Rugby, in one form or another, is played in 121 countries. There\u2019s a sevens world series contested by 19 countries in 10 cities. </p> <p> And did not Matthew McConaughey turn up to watch New Zealand play USA? And art met sport, and Twitter went bat-crazy. And the game went everywhere. For in America and by extension the world, star power has cachet. Star power is money. </p> <p> Look at Australia\u2019s best player, Charlotte Caslick, tearing about in her pig-tails, blowing hard around a mouthguard, all skinned knees and dirt and sweat. And that try-saving tackle against flying US winger Victoria Folayan \u2013 how about that? To the kids she\u2019s Tank Girl, she\u2019s girl power in green-and-gold. She\u2019s fit, cool and a winner. Kids want to be her.</p> <p> Fiji, too, were winners, capturing the country\u2019s only medal of any colour ever. If Fiji was going to win an Olympic medal, it was going to be in rugby sevens. And even Great Britain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/11/fiji-great-britain-rio-2016-rugby-sevens-final\">flogged in the final 43-7</a>, appreciated the story of it, and their place in it.</p> <p> The women\u2019s sevens team has arguably been Australia\u2019s greatest success at these Games. Unless the nation\u2019s expectations were too high, their swimmers under-achieved. Rowers and cyclists were tipped for big things. A fancied long jumper didn\u2019t make the final. Hockey was hopeless. </p> <p> Little wonder that ARU chief executive Bill Pulver waxes so lyrically about the women, describing them as \u201cwonderful, athletic, articulate, intelligent young Australians\u201d who are \u201cjust extraordinary role models for any young girl thinking about picking up a rugby ball\u201d. </p> <p> Sure, the CEO <em>would </em>say that. But you can forgive the man for being bullish. Outside of the Rugby World Cup, the game\u2019s been in the doldrums, somewhat, a clear third behind fellow professional football codes rugby league and Australian rules. And if the ARU can stake a flag in the ground on the back of sevens, well, they will.</p> <p> \u201cRio will have a game-changing effect on the entire landscape of women\u2019s sport,\u201d reckons Pulver. \u201cAs a young girl considering what sport to play, not only is there an established world series in sevens rugby, there is now the ultimate carrot of becoming an Olympian and having a chance to compete on sport\u2019s ultimate stage.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/09/olympics-rugby-sevens-australian-women-win-gold-against-new-zealand\">Olympics rugby sevens: Australian women win gold against New Zealand</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Whatever else you say about the maggoty old sports carnival infused with drugs, corruption and political malarkey, there is cachet in the Games. Tax-payer-funded cachet. And rugby sevens funding will be secure right up to Tokyo. Because: gold medal.</p> <p> It\u2019s the same for other countries. Since rugby was announced at the Olympics, super powers like the USA and China have increased funding and playing numbers. Governments and national Olympic committees have invested in the game. Rugby is being taught in schools for the first time. Rio is a game changer for the sport.</p> <p> World Rugby points to record participation growth since sevens was awarded an Olympic place seven years ago. Player numbers have doubled, according to WR, with 7.73 million players in 121 member unions worldwide. Women are the fastest-growing area, with 2 million players \u2013 up from 200,000 seven years go \u2013 representing 30% of that total.</p> <p> And if Australian rugby is smart, the women will be everywhere. Rugby needs to capitalise on their talent and effectively sell them as the face of the game. Caslick, Ellia Green, Sharni Williams, Emma Tonegato, Chloe Dalton, need to be launched. And money will follow. Endorsements. All sorts of stuff. Caslick has a deal with Nike. You\u2019ve got to think there\u2019s more coming.</p> <p> Few years ago when James O\u2019Connor was just busting out and running around for the Wallabies, this tousle-haired 20-year-old, equal parts Justin Bieber and Tim Horan, Inside Sport put him on the cover, the first rugby union player in four years. Six months later he was the face of Swisse, the vitamin mob, heir apparent to Ricky Ponting. Perhaps it was coincidence\u2026</p> <p> But you can bet the Australia-centric Australian Football League \u2013 which kicks off an eight-team women\u2019s competition next year \u2013 and the National Rugby League \u2013 which owns touch football \u2013 is watching. Caslick and a few of her team-mates came from touch footy. And they chose rugby sevens because, as Caslick says, they\u2019d \u201cdone everything there was in touch\u201d. </p> <p> Aussie rules, rugby league and touch footy, by dint of their limited global appeal, have a ceiling. And rugby sevens has the Olympic Games. </p> <p> If there\u2019s a criticism of rugby in Rio, and it\u2019s a valid one, is that the 15,000 capacity Deodoro Stadium never looked full, even for the gold medal matches. Pre-Games, organisers proclaimed that 70% of tickets had been sold. If that was true, some didn\u2019t turn up. There was good noise made by those who were there. But the matches didn\u2019t have that \u201cthick\u201d or \u201cclose\u201d atmosphere big games can. You could put it down to Brazilians going through their worst recession since 1901. But it wasn\u2019t a good look. </p> <p> There\u2019ll be a better look \u2013 and a better idea of where sevens rugby stands in the Australian sports-consumption market \u2013 when ARU hosts its Sydney Sevens in February 2017. Last time it was almost sold-out for two days, with nearly 80,000 party people dressing up and drinking down and watching footy in the hot Aussie sun.</p> <p> And then, of course, there\u2019s Tokyo, and the Games of the XXXII Olympiad in 2020. And they\u2019ll just about fill the 45,000-seat Tokyo Stadium every day. The Cherry Blossoms (XVs) beat South Africa in the last World Cup. Millions of Japanese watched their sevens team beat New Zealand in Rio. These are the two biggest things to ever happen in Japanese rugby. Eddie Jones\u2019s head was put on billboards 30m high. Japan is mad for it. </p> <p> And rugby sevens is coming.</p>",

  "<p>Authorities in the Canadian province of Alberta have vowed to ban spear hunting and are weighing whether to lay charges against an American hunter after a video surfaced showing him killing a black bear with a spear.<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V460NAao7wA&amp;oref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DV460NAao7wA&amp;has_verified=1\">video</a> \u2013 one of several hunting videos posted to the YouTube account of Josh Bowmar \u2013 shows Bowmar holding a long spear with a GoPro camera attached to it as a mature bear repeatedly approaches a bait bin set up to lure it to the site. </p> <p>After the bear nears for the third time, Bowmar, a college javelin champion and Ohio-based fitness trainer, launches the spear. He falls to his knees in excitement as he realises he struck the bear. \u201cHe\u2019s going down. I drilled him perfect. That was the longest throw I thought I could ever make,\u201d he tells the camera. \u201cI just did something I don\u2019t think anybody in the entire world has ever done and that was spear a bear on the ground on film. And I smoked him.\u201d </p> <p>His delight continues as he finds the spear, cast off by the bear as it ran into the woods, and examines the blood marks on it. \u201cOh yeah, I got mad penetration,\u201d he says. \u201cThese things are absolute lethal killing machines.\u201d </p> <p>The video was seen more than 200,000 times before its setting was changed to private on Monday. </p> <p>The Alberta environment ministry described the spear hunt seen in the video as \u201carchaic\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d.</p> <p>A ban on spear hunting will be introduced this fall as part of an update to the province\u2019s hunting regulations, a spokesperson for the ministry said in a statement. \u201cIn the meantime, we have asked Fish and Wildlife officers to investigate this incident to determine if charges are warranted under existing laws.\u201d</p> <p>The video credits Alberta-based outfitters John and Jenn Rivet for organising the hunt. They did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>In an email to the Guardian, Bowmar defended the use of a spear to hunt. \u201cFirst and foremost, spear hunting gives the animal the greatest chance of escape, considering our ethical killing range is within 10 yards.\u201d</p> <p>The spear used in the hunt is five inches wide, 16 inches long and razor-sharp, he said, much bigger than the typical arrow used in bow hunting, which is also legal in Alberta. \u201cStatistically speaking, one would argue a spear is more of an ethical, humane weapon to hunt with than a bow,\u201d Bowmar said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/20/bear-hunting-new-jersey-protest\">Going on a bear hunt: experiencing a pastime that has divided New Jersey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wayne Pacelle, chief executive of the Humane Society, said that Bowmar is a \u201csociopath\u201d and criticized him for baiting and killing the bear during spring, when female bears are nurturing cubs. </p> <p>\u201cWhat was also shocking was the breathless celebration of the hunter, acting as if he had really gotten somewhere in life and achieved something no one had done before,\u201d Pacelle said. </p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably right \u2013 very few people have ever engaged in depravity and evil quite like he did.\u201d </p> <p>Last year nearly 20% of big-game hunters in the province purchased archery hunting permits, according to government figures reported by Reuters.</p> <p>The video also showed Bowmar returning to the site to retrieve the bear the next morning. He found it some 60 yards away from where it was struck, its internal organs spilling out of a gaping wound on its side. </p> <p>\u201cThe bear I speared only ran 60 yards and died immediately, that\u2019s as humane and ethical as one could get in a hunting situation on big-game animals,\u201d said Bowmar, who noted that every part of the bear was used and its meat was eaten. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t care about the humane killing of this bear, why did I spend years preparing and practicing, becoming extremely proficient with a spear to make sure I could harvest this bear ethically?\u201d </p>",

  "<p>Twenty-four of Australia\u2019s rarest tortoises have been released outside their natural range because climate change has dried out their remaining habitat.</p> <p>The natural range of the critically endangered western swamp tortoise, <em>Pseudemydura umbrina,</em> has shrunk to two isolated wetlands in Perth\u2019s ever-growing outer suburbs, and a herpetological expert, Dr Gerald Kuchling, said reduced rainfall and a lowered groundwater table made those areas increasingly untenable.</p> <p>The juvenile tortoises \u2013 between three and four years old \u2013 were released at Meerup, 360km south of Perth, and into an established colony at Moore river national park, 130km north of Perth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85d19e929a204316c5b5133e76776fbea5402dbb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85d19e929a204316c5b5133e76776fbea5402dbb/0_0_480_640/375.jpg\" alt=\"A radio tracker attached to one of 12 western swamp tortoises released into the wild at Moore river, north of Perth\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A radio tracker attached to one of 12 western swamp tortoises released into the wild at Moore river, north of Perth, as part of a government program to help the species recover.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Parks and Wildlife WA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s the first time climate change has driven the assisted colonisation of a vertebrate species, after attempts in the US and Britain to translocate plants and butterflies, respectively.</p> <p>Western swamp tortoises were believed to be extinct until the species was rediscovered in the 1950s.

That\u2019s fairly normal among tortoises, Kuchling said, but there have been some setbacks.</p> <p>In the early 90s researchers lost a lot of juvenile tortoises to raven attacks and, in 2002, a bushfire swept through the Mogumber nature reserve, killing most of the newly established colony.</p> <p>The tortoises have been fitted with radio trackers and will be monitored by researchers from the University of Western Australia in a joint project with the Department of Parks and Wildlife.</p>",

But to hell with the plebs.</p> <p>To rub our noses in it properly, we pay them for the privilege: grouse moors are subsidised by us.

I\u2019m sure it had nothing to do with the fact that he owns a grouse moor.</p> <p>But through the efforts of wildlife campaigners (like Packham and the RSPB) and people whose homes have been flooded downstream, the grouse industry is now being called to account. Last week, the petition posted by the conservationist Mark Avery <a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/125003\">calling for an end to driven grouse shooting \u2013 where wild birds are sent towards the guns by \u201cbeaters\u201d \u2013 passed the 100,000-signature threshold</a>: the issue is now likely to be debated in parliament.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Through the efforts of wildlife campaigners like Chris Packham, the grouse industry is now being called to account</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The result is You Forgot the Birds, championed by the Daily Mail, which describes it as<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3094619/I-ll-sue-RSPB-libel-charity-s-incompetence-misleading-ads-says-former-cricketer-Sir-Ian-Botham.html\"> \u201ca grassroots campaign by farmers and conservationists\u201d</a>.

This is the situation we seek to contain using this \u201cless lethal\u201d option.</p> <p>The Taser is supposed to work on two levels, psychological and physical, but if a person has mental health issues the psychological impact of these deadly weapons might be limited. Consider too that there are much higher levels of mental health diagnosis in parts of the black and minority ethnic (BME) community. Statistics show us as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/13/black-people-three-times-more-likely-to-have-taser-used-against-them\" title=\"\">three times more likely</a> to be on the receiving end of a Taser.</p> <p>Eighteen months ago <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/30/frontline-police-tasers-terror-threat-federation-leader\" title=\"\">we heard calls</a> for every officer in England and Wales to be given the option of being armed with a Taser to meet the increased terror risk. But I am not convinced that the incidents we have seen in France and Belgium recently would have been&#xa0;stopped by officers carrying Tasers. I still believe our best hope is to stick with the core of what we do best here in the UK: policing by consent, with&#xa0;the support of the public and the communities we serve.</p> <p>That must mean all communities. The \u201cPeelian principal\u201d \u2013 named after the founder of modern policing, Sir Robert Peel \u2013 asserts that \u201cthe police are the public and the public are the police\u201d.

This is particularly evident in the area of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/feb/11/uk-police-forces-still-abusing-stop-and-search-powers\" title=\"\">stop and search</a>, which has already created a mindset of unfairness.

I&#xa0;have seen the dreadful consequences of knife crime in our communities. What I want is for the Taser to be used to&#xa0;reduce the number of tragic incidents, not increase them. Officers are trained to consider the most appropriate option&#xa0;in the circumstances but ultimately it remains the responsibility of officers and those who employ them to justify their use of force. These decisions are underpinned by legislation, but the law can only ever be a starting point. We must train officers to understand behaviour, to consider all&#xa0;the options, and, in critical situations, to be able to give the vital aftercare that&#xa0;is needed.</p> <p>As president of the National Black Police Association, I am clearly concerned about the disproportionate use and the impact that Taser use has on our communities. Increasing their use may seem an easy option, but we must always be aware of the concern Tasers are causing in communities already filled with mistrust and fear towards police. The reality is that we are dealing with fragile, vulnerable human beings, and there needs to be more thought before we reach a stage where more officers carry them. When things go wrong, we must be transparent.</p> <p>It is difficult at this stage to understand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/16/dalian-atkinson-taser-death-police-institutional-racism\" title=\"\">the incident in West Mercia involving Dalian Atkinson</a>, who died after a Taser was discharged, but it is vital that thorough investigation is carried out so his family and those closest to him are left in no doubt as to what happened.

The rise of social media, and people sharing every moment on Facebook and Twitter, means people\u2019s inhibitions towards public displays of emotion have increasingly disappeared \u2013 often to the detriment of relationships.</p> <p>\u201cThese days there is both an idealistic and social pressure for grand public proposals,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pressure of having an ideal relationship, which should be celebrated, is very prominent and it is putting pressure on people to put on these grand, idealistic proposals even when it isn\u2019t suited to their relationship and when it isn\u2019t something that has been discussed.\u201d</p> <p>Gurpreet warned against people blindly following the example of Qin and Cerullo with making their own proposals a public spectacle. \u201cIt a very risky path for couples to go down,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWho are we to judge what does or doesn\u2019t work for a couple and choosing that particular moment in the Olympics is fine if they had discussed it before,\u201d he said. \u201cBut really what is the grand proposal for?

  "<p>BHP Billiton, the world\u2019s biggest miner, has reported a record loss of $6.4bn (\u00a34.9bn) following a fatal dam disaster in Brazil, a slump in the price of commodities, and a bet on fracking in the US.</p> <p>Miners are struggling due to a sharp fall in commodity prices, sparked by concerns that a slowdown in the Chinese economy could leave a surplus of raw materials.</p> <p>Andrew Mackenzie, chief executive of the London-listed company, said the last 12 months have been challenging and that commodity prices are likely to remain volatile, even if long-term demand remained robust.</p> <p>The miner swung to the net loss in the year to the end of June after making a profit of $1.9bn a year earlier. It is the company\u2019s first annual loss and the first time it has not increase its dividend since Australia\u2019s BHP and the Anglo-Dutch company Billiton merged in 2001.</p> <p>The loss was driven by $7.7bn of writedowns and charges including $4.9bn for the reduced value of its US shale operations and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/09/brazil-dam-burst-bhp-boss-to-inspect-disaster-zone-with-dozens-still-missing\">$2.2bn for the collapse of the Samarco dam</a>, which killed 19 people, polluted a river valley and devastated communities in Brazil\u2019s Minas Gerais state in November.</p> <p>\u201cAll of us at BHP Billiton remain deeply saddened by the Samarco tragedy,\u201d Mackenzie said. \u201cThe company is fully committed to the framework agreement and its programs to remediate and compensate for the impacts of the Samarco dam failure. Good progress is being made on community resettlement, community health and environment restoration.\u201d</p> <p>BHP said the Samarco iron ore mine, owned jointly with Brazil\u2019s Vale, will not get approval to reopen this year after the dam\u2019s failure spilled billions of gallons of mining waste into a valley causing death and homelessness.<br></p> <p>The company was forced to write down the value of its shale assets because of the tumble in the price of crude oil to less than $50 a barrel. BHP diversified into the oil and gas business in 2012 with an investment in US shale assets. Mackenzie said the company will hold on to the assets because investors liked its range of businesses.</p> <p>\u201cThe last 12 months have been challenging for both BHP Billiton and the resources industry,\u201d Mackenzie, a Scot who took charge of the company in 2013, said.</p> <p>\u201cNevertheless, our results demonstrate the resilience of our portfolio and the diverse ways in which we can create value for shareholders despite low commodity prices.</p> <p>\u201cWhile commodity prices are expected to remain low and volatile in the short to medium term, we are confident in the long-term outlook for our commodities, particularly oil and copper.\u201d</p> <p>Mackenzie said the industry was starting to recover after the price of key commodities such as iron ore and coal hit 25-year lows in January.</p> <p>The BHP boss said there is \u201csome sense that prices have stopped falling as opposed to being in freefall\u201d and the company could start the year with \u201creal momentum\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cSteadily, the end of the supply creation on the back of the China boom is coming to an end, product by product, and that\u2019s putting more of a floor under price than perhaps perceptibly existed maybe a year ago.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the record loss, shares in BHP rose 1.7% to \u00a310.60 on the back of Mackenzie\u2019s confidence.</p> <p>Jordan Hiscott, chief trader at online trading platform Ayondo Markets, said: \u201cDespite the monumental loss the perception is that the worst is over in terms of impairment charges and write-downs. It\u2019s also pertinent that BHP still has a yield and pays a dividend, given the extreme low interest rate environment in which we currently find ourselves.\u201d<br></p> <p>The commodity rout forced BHP Billiton to scrap its policy of not cutting dividends <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/22/bhp-billiton-reports-half-year-loss-4bn\">by slashing the half-year payout in February</a>. It cut the annual dividend by 76% to 30 cents a share, in line with a new policy of linking payments to profits.</p> <p>Nicholas Hyett, analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cWith dividends now a function of profits, bottom line growth will be key to future shareholder returns. For now that is being supported by a ruthless cost cutting campaign, but there\u2019s only so far that can go.</p> <p>\u201cWith capital expenditure falling rapidly, the group seems to be pinning its hopes on a recovery in commodity prices to boost earnings in the medium term.\u201d</p>",
  "<p> US trucks will produce 10% less carbon dioxide and consume 10% less fuel within a decade under the last major plank of Barack Obama\u2019s climate policy.</p> <p>The second phase of a new benchmark for medium- and large-sized trucks will cut more than 1bn metric tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions and 2bn barrels of oil use, the Environment Protection Agency announced on Tuesday.</p> <p>In fact, US heavy duty vehicles should emit at least 16% less CO2 than their European counterparts under the new rule, according to an analysis by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) last month, which the Guardian has seen.</p> <p> Gina McCarthy, the EPA\u2019s administrator, told the Guardian: \u201cIt is very clear that we are going to be moving out well ahead of any other country in the development of these standards. We will be driving these technologies and as result we will benefit from them more than any other country.\u201d</p> <p>Although medium and heavy duty lorries only make up 4% of road traffic, they also suck up 22% of US oil transport demand, and that figure is rising fast.</p> <p>The emissions cut from honing their fuel economy would be \u201croughly equal to the greenhouse gases associated with the electricity and power use from all US residences for one year\u201d, McCarthy said. </p> <p>Under the new rule, heavy duty trucks made in 2027 will be 25% more carbon efficient than models built in 2018, saving drivers $170bn in fuel costs and creating a $230bn net benefit to society, the EPA said.</p> <p>The standard is <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-transportation/2016/08/waiting-on-truck-emissions-mandates-215873\">thought unlikely</a> to deliver the fuel savings of 54.5 miles a gallon promised by Obama in his first term. A boom in sales of trucks and sports-utility vehicles triggered by cheap gasoline prices may have pushed that out of reach.</p> <p>But it was still hailed as a \u201csignificant milestone\u201d for future generations by Anthony Foxx, the US transport secretary. </p> <p>The commercial vehicles rule will apply to semi-trucks, large pickup trucks, vans, buses and work trucks, and cut fuel costs by about $170bn, according to the EPA.

But it is important for car manufacturers that \u2013 as well as a framework and visibility \u2013 we are given the time to implement [the rule].\u201d</p> <p>McCarthy said that aspects of the proposal might be seen as \u201ctoo aggressive\u201d in some industry quarters, but that the EPA believed they \u201chit the absolute sweet spot,\u201d balancing cost-effective emissions and fuel-saving reductions. </p> <p> Heavy goods vehicles <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/vehicles/index_en.htm\">make up 6% of Europe\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions</a> \u2013 more than aviation or international shipping.</p> <p> Between 1990 and 2010 their emissions soared by 36%, and EU officials see little chance of a decline without policy action, which they have pledged to bring forward before the end of 2017.</p> <p>A limit of 95 grams of CO2 per kilometre has already been set for cars by 2021 and campaigners warn that if European trucks do not follow the American example, they will soon be overtaken in the clean vehicles race.<br></p> <p> \u201cThis is as much about environmental leadership as about innovation,\u201d said Stef Cornelis, the cleaner and safer trucks officer at the Transport and Environment campaign group.</p> <p> \u201cIf the EU wants to remain the world\u2019s leader in truck manufacturing, it should table a fuel efficiency standard for trucks in 2017 with a more ambitious 2025 target than the US one. Anything less will mean further stagnation for trucks made in Europe.\u201d</p> <p>Europe is currently the largest heavy duty vehicle market without efficiency standards. </p> <p>The ICCT forecasts that the EU bloc will fall behind the US in tractor-trailer efficiency in 2020.

  "<p>Simon Jenkins writes that \u201cTo question China\u2019s good intentions in financing the power station [at Hinkley Point] is silly.

The China General Nuclear Group (CGN), which is involved in financing Hinkley Point, expects to build a new nuclear station with its own reactor at Bradwell in return for its involvement at Hinkley. This was agreed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/21/hinkley-point-reactor-costs-rise-by-2bn-as-deal-confirmed\" title=\"\">by David Cameron and Xi Jinping last October</a>.</p> <p>The reactor it hopes to build is its small modular reactor Hualong One.</p> <p>CGN has just been indicted by the US authorities for exporting nuclear technology to China without authorisation (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/nuclear-espionage-charge-for-china-firm-with-one-third-stake-in-hinkley-point\" title=\"\">Nuclear espionage charge for China firm with one-third stake in UK\u2019s Hinkley Point</a>, theguardian.com, 11 August).

Israel and&#xa0;the US planted the Stuxnet bug in the nuclear reactor at Bushehr in Iran in 2010.</p> <p>Hualong One would not be allowed in the US. Neither France nor Germany would allow China to build it in their countries. Is the UK really so desperate for Chinese funds to build Hinkley Point that it will allow China a major stake in the provision of electricity in the UK in return?<br><strong>Norman Dombey</strong><br><em>Professor emeritus of theoretical physics, University of Sussex, and former specialist advisor to the Commons select committee on energy</em></p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins decries the potential deal with China over the Hinkley Point proposed nuclear power station. He argues that project is \u201creckless and absurdly expensive\u201d, and so it is. But there are other reasons for stopping this project, which many in China will appreciate. China is arguably the world leader in renewable energy, both in manufacturing for the world and in using itself. The intrinsic variability of most renewables (especially wind and solar) is no longer a misfit with the variability of human demand. Ever advancing telecommunications and electronic control systems allow the demand to be adjusted to fit the supply on a scale from household to national.</p> <p>Witness the sophisticated systems widely available for matching electrical loads and energy stores to solar power. Householders already use these; electrical grid operators are trialling methods for widespread integration of solar and wind power with load demand control, energy storage and price adjustment.</p> <p>The last thing such advances need is an untried gigawatt source of constant electricity generation that cannot be matched to demand, that is expensive, and whose waste is harmful and untreatable. There are many in China and France who share these views; ceasing Hinkley will be welcomed by them too.<br><strong>Dr John Twidell</strong><br><em>Horninghold, Leicestershire</em></p> <p>\u2022 I agree with Simon Jenkins that Hinkley is a dud, for many reasons that have been discussed in his article and elsewhere. However, I am saddened that he appears to dismiss wind, and implicitly all renewable energy sources, as not providing baseload electricity. At the same time that Hinkley has been generally given the red carpet, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/10/swansea-bay-tidal-lagoon-energy-project-hinkley-point-wales\" title=\"\">Swansea Bay tidal lagoon</a> and further similar projects have potential to produce 8% of our baseload electricity.</p> <p>The tidal lagoon project would last about three times as long as any nuclear power station \u2013 about 90 years.</p> <p>The cost of the Swansea lagoon is estimated to be \u00a31bn. So to achieve the full 8% of baseload electricity (more than Hinkley), perhaps about \u00a35bn would be needed to complete four or five similar projects in the UK \u2013 less than a third of the Hinkley costs. There is also no nuclear waste to manage for thousands of years. Tidal power flows into the lagoon for six hours, out for six hours and does this twice a day, giving reliable electricity for 24 hours a day.</p> <p>Swansea Bay tidal lagoon is the best alternative to Hinkley, so why is it not getting immediate government support and approval? Why is it not even being discussed?<br><strong>Steve Emsley</strong><br><em>Newcastle upon Tyne</em></p> <p>\u2022 To make a sound judgment on energy sources British citizens should be given the relevant facts.

  "<p>Three large vegetarian piranhas with human-like teeth have been discovered in Michigan, amid growing concern among wildlife officials over tropical and invasive fish infiltrating the Great Lakes region.</p> <p>Over the past month, two red-bellied pacu piranhas have been caught in Lake St Clair and one other in the Port Huron area in Michigan. They were probably illegally dumped by people who didn\u2019t want to keep them in their aquariums any longer. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.seriouslyfish.com/species/piaractus-brachypomus/\">tropical fish</a>, imported from South America for home aquariums, prefers not to tear apart carcasses like other piranhas. Instead, it has square, blunt teeth that look much like human dentures, which it uses to nibble upon nuts and seeds. </p> <p>The fish, which can measure more than 30in, are warm water creatures and are unlikely to survive in the colder environment of Michigan. But wildlife officials are grappling with a growing threat of an invasion of the Great Lakes by introduced fish species.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6a799d28b15e9eab240657b5e94e8bc81559aa19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a799d28b15e9eab240657b5e94e8bc81559aa19/0_30_450_270/450.jpg\" alt=\"The teeth on the piaractus brachypomus.\" width=\"450\" height=\"270\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The teeth on the piaractus brachypomus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JJ Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> \u201cPets released from confined, artificial environments are poorly equipped to fend off predators and may be unable to successfully forage for food or find shelter,\u201d said Nick Popoff, a manager at the Michigan department of natural resources. </p> <p> \u201cThose that do succeed in the wild can spread exotic diseases to native animals. In the worst-case scenario, released animals can thrive and reproduce, upsetting natural ecosystems to the degree that these former pets become invasive species.\u201d</p> <p> Asian carp are considered the primary <a href=\"https://www.nwf.org/Wildlife/Threats-to-Wildlife/Invasive-Species/Asian-Carp.aspx\">invasive species threat</a> to the Great Lakes, which are a series of five large lakes that together make up the largest freshwater system in the world. Increasingly desperate measures are being taken to keep these newcomers out of the lakes \u2013 including the building of a \u201cfish wall\u201d.</p> <p> Authorities have constructed a 7.5ft wall near Fort Wayne, Indiana, in a bid to halt the onward advance of the Asian carp. The 2-mile-long earth berm, which replaced a temporary chain-link fence, is designed to stop the carp from swimming through Indiana\u2019s rivers into the Great Lakes ecosystem.</p> <p> The wall divides a <a href=\"http://www.lrwp.org/page/eagle-marsh\">marshland area</a> and cuts off one of the most vulnerable approach points to the Great Lakes. The US Army Corp of Engineers is currently working on a more sophisticated \u201clock and dam\u201d system that would allow water to pass through but keep invasive species from swimming through.</p> <p> \u201cMy dream is that one day we can tear down this berm,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2016/0512/America-is-building-a-wall-to-keep-out-Asian-carp-video\">said</a> Betsy Yankowiak, director at Little River Wetlands Project, which co-owns the marsh.</p> <p> Asian carp were imported to the US in the 1970s to filter pond water in fish farms in Arkansas. Flooding allowed them to escape and spread northward. The species has no natural predators in the US and can gobble up 20% of its bodyweight in plankton each day. Some Asian carp grow to more than 100lbs and now represent the vast majority of biomass in the Illinois and Mississippi rivers.</p> <p>Careless release of pets and unwitting introduction via international travel has brought a number of harmful species to the US. It\u2019s feared that climate change will help expand the range of some invasive species, which can then out-compete native animals and disrupt ecosystems.</p> <p> Florida is often viewed as the frontline for invasive species in the US, with animals such as Burmese pythons, feral hogs and lion fish altering the ecology of the region. </p> <p> The state is now also home to the world\u2019s largest rodent, according to biologist Elizabeth Congdon. There are around 50 capybaras loose in northern Florida, Congdon, of Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, told a recent conference in Missouri.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/28/capybara-captured-toronto-canada-bonnie-clyde\">Capybara captured: rodent's brief taste of freedom comes to an end</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Capybaras are semiaquatic mammals from South America that look like enormous guinea pigs. Congdon said \u201cseveral sightings suggest they have been breeding\u201d, raising the possibility that they could have a destructive impact upon the environment like nutria, another type of invasive rodent that has caused riverbanks to collapse due to its digging.</p> <p>Congdon told the Guardian that the animals needed to be studied further but she was confident that they could be contained.</p> <p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t a problem yet as they are confined to a forest area but they will try to eat corn or sugar cane if they get near agricultural land,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they give us the opportunity to study the processes of an invasion and stop it.</p> <p>\u201cThey are very territorial and will spread if the group grows and then splits. The easiest thing to do would be to control the number of females, because they can have nine young in each litter.\u201d</p> <p>Congdon said capybaras are enjoyed as food in Venezuela and used to make leather products in Argentina. The animals are protected in Brazil but can be an occasional nuisance, as evidenced during the Rio Olympics where they <a href=\"https://weather.com/science/nature/news/capybara-invasion-rio-olympics-golf\">ran amok on the golf course last week</a>. </p>",
  "<p>Most would agree that timing is vital to the comedians in Edinburgh this summer.

The 2014 fringe was full of plays about what it would mean if Scotland voted to leave the UK, while the 2015 listings were filled with reflections on the consequences of the remain vote.</p> <p>But, when the scripts for this year were being written, the laptop screen in front of a playwright was a cloudy crystal ball. As the official fringe programme went to press in the spring, the EU referendum was still weeks away, it was not yet certain that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton would be the US presidential nominees, and it was commonly held that Jeremy Corbyn was unlikely to still be leading the Labour party by the summer.</p> <p>So a political writer needed to be either extremely brave or prophetic. The stand-up comics, well used to the necessity of topicality, have been able to adjust.

There seem to be more cancelled productions than usual this year, including Party Time, an advertised drama about a politician suffering meltdown in a TV interview. And, although no-shows can be due to logistical or economic reasons, it was tempting to wonder, walking round the city this week, if the lengths of gaffer tape obscuring now empty time-slots outside venues covered up time-expired dramas such as Cameron Remains, Angela Eagle Takes Off!, Governor Scott Walker for President and A Night With John Whittingdale.</p> <p>One gamble with history that has paid off is the return of one of last year\u2019s hits, David Benson\u2019s portrayal of the cabinet\u2019s only surviving Old Etonian in Tom Crawshaw\u2019s play <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/boris-world-king\">Boris: World King</a> (Pleasance Dome). There must have been a moment on 30 June, after BoJo\u2019s withdrawal from the leadership race, when Benson and Crawshaw feared they were sending a white (haired) elephant to Edinburgh. But the politician\u2019s unexpected resurrection at the Foreign Office means Boris has instead more or less achieved the show\u2019s subtitle.</p> <p> Benson, under a blond dish-mop wig, has verbally and physically perfected his portrayal of the politician\u2019s ruthlessly calculated spontaneity, and a daring tonal shift in the script \u2013 a furious moral interlude in which the audience is warned that Johnson may not be as harmless as his rumpled buffoonery suggests \u2013 has even more force when aimed at the holder of one of the great offices of state.</p> <p>Another presentation that has benefited from a change in context is <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/mrs-roosevelt-flies-to-london\">Mrs Roosevelt Flies to London</a> (Assembly Hall). Written and performed by Alison Skilbeck, this monologue about the former first lady\u2019s morale-raising trip to the UK in 1942 has had a previous life, and was always a moving and bravura performance. But with the advance on the White House of Hillary Clinton, who has admitted to having imaginary conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt about women in politics, the show has gained an extra resonance.

They divert attention away from much needed analysis of how US domestic and foreign policies in the past four decades have been in great part responsible for the violence these shows decry.</p> <p>So far, documentaries about Blanco, aka the Cocaine Godmother, conform to this standard; routinely using racial and gender stereotypes, and littering unchecked facts that reproduce the mythology surrounding her life. They play out like this: she committed her first murder when she was 11 years old, she owned jewelry that once belonged to Eva Per\u00f3n, she was fond of cocaine-fueled orgies with both men and women, and she was inherently ruthless. This last trait has been heralded as her trademark; controversial investigative journalist Gerald Posner took it to the extreme by saying that Blanco \u201c<a href=\"http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/gerald-posner-back-in-the-limelight-in-biography-channels-griselda-blanco-doc-6525218\">did not have DNA for sympathy</a>\u201d.</p> <p>By overly focusing on dubious personal anecdotes with little or no corroboration, the vital details of the story get lost. Audiences are presented with a de-historicized and titillating version of events that seduces viewers and appeases their ethical anxieties by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic\">placing responsibility in the hands of racialized others</a>.</p> <p>This approach is even more worrying because of the implications that it has in the context of the ongoing \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, and the current political climate. Shows like Narcos have helped promote the idea that the presence of cocaine in the streets of Miami and the violence related to it constitutes an invasion perpetrated by foreign \u2013 and evil \u2013 agents. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65a0ed896870c2dbd4a8998427db13e33956d9b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65a0ed896870c2dbd4a8998427db13e33956d9b0/23_88_1168_701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wagner Moura as Pablo Escobar in Narcos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wagner Moura as Pablo Escobar in Narcos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With subtitles and a purported adherence to historical rigor, Narcos lured audiences eager for a sense of cultural weight. But instead of promoting understanding and cultural nuance, these shows change facts to suit their North American audiences and focus on making them feel good about themselves. The cinematography and the music are cool; they think they\u2019re learning about foreign cultures; the women are sexy; and they get to be both the victims and the heroes of the story. </p> <p>In the current political climate, this is particularly pernicious. The notion that the complicated challenges that the US is facing have been brought to the homeland by dangerous and irrational others is being skillfully mobilized by politicians.</p> <p>The stories of Escobar and Blanco present an opportunity. Like Pablo Escobar, Griselda Blanco\u2019s story has much to say about issues relevant to the US today, such as the unintended consequences of foreign policy for national security, the dramatic effects of racial and income inequality in the rise of violence and crime, and lessons about how the inability \u2013 or unwillingness \u2013 of the system to deal with addiction as a disease rather a crime has led to the overpopulation of prisons, while consumption rates continue to soar.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/17/narcos-netflix-colombian-accents\">Narcos is a hit for Netflix but iffy accents grate on Colombian ears</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If thoughtfully addressed, Blanco\u2019s story could also provide great insight about how the criminalization and persecution of specific substances and communities, fueled by racism and xenophobia, tends to engender worse evils that the ones it seeks to eradicate.</p> <p>This approach is not just a pipe-dream. An accomplished Latina actor will not only play Blanco\u2019s role but also will be the executive director of the film. Female characters tend to conform to one of two tropes associated with Latino women in popular culture and mass media: the innocent victim in need of salvation by a male protagonist, or the seductive and violent temptress, the narco femme-fatale. This is further ironic because many of these stories claim to denounce the machismo of Latino drug lords while remaining unaware of, or unbothered by, their own structural sexism. </p> <p>Hopefully, under Lopez\u2019s leadership the film will avoid this and other common pitfalls of narco-storytelling, providing relief from another vicious circle: that of a society that one the hand declares a war on those who supply a product for which it is the main market, and on the other hand turns this violence into profitable and easily digestible cultural commodities that \u2013 like cocaine \u2013 are eagerly consumed with little or no regard for the ethical quandaries embedded in the political economy of its production.</p> <p><em>Juliana Mart\u00ednez is an assistant professor of world languages and cultures at American University, Washington DC</em></p>",

According to the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/12/health/gay-lesbian-teenagers-violence.html\">New York Times</a>, a question on gender identity \u201cmight be ready for a pilot test in 2017\u201d for eventual inclusion on the YRBS.</p> <p>The CDC\u2019s report wasn\u2019t designed to look at what might be causing the high risks for LGB teens. Emily Greytak, the director of research with the <a href=\"http://www.glsen.org/\">Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network</a> (GLSEN), said that a feeling of trauma or discrimination could lead to high risk behaviors. But she also said that a \u201csmall percentage of the students that you go to school with can make your life hell even if you have a majority who are neutral or don\u2019t care or are supportive\u201d.</p> <p>For Mia Healy, a recent high school graduate from New Jersey, many of her classmates were supportive when she came out as a lesbian, but others called her an \u201cattention whore\u201d for her sexuality or told her that \u201cgay people are equivalent to shit\u201d in response to her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC3BiJLqSRk\">art project</a> exploring gender.</p> <p>David W Bond, the vice-president of programs for the Trevor Project, said victimization was one of the risk factors for suicide. When it came to dating violence, he said it could go unreported by teens who are afraid to be outed.</p> <p>Greytak also theorized that there was a harsh backlash to efforts like marriage equality or recent anti-discrimination bills, creating a negative environment for students. Since the CDC\u2019s data was collected throughout 2015, it didn\u2019t take into account recent events \u2013 such as North Carolina\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/25/north-carolina-lgbt-rights-transgender-discrimination-law-violates-us-constitution\">bathroom law</a> or the backlash to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/08/states-sue-federal-government-transgender-bathroom-policy\">Barack Obama\u2019s order</a> for trans students be allowed to use the bathroom of their choosing. \u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting to see the 2017 [study] after all of the anti-trans legislation, which is just kicking back up more homophobia in the school systems and legitimizing discrimination against gender nonconforming and transgender students,\u201d said Geoffrey Winder, the co-executive director of the <a href=\"https://gsanetwork.org/\">Genders &amp; Sexualities Alliance (GSA) Network</a> (formerly the Gay-Straight Alliance Network).</p> <p>The CDC made recommendations in its report for public health action, including bolstering existing anti-bullying and harassment policies, safe spaces for students and educating staff on forging inclusive environments. </p> <p>The GSA Network receives funding from the CDC\u2019s division of adolescent and school health. One of its programs in conjunction with the CDC, called <a href=\"http://outforsafeschools.org/\">Out For Safe Schools</a>, distributes badges to educators to show that they\u2019re <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/apr/10/what-not-say-lgbt-pupils-if-they-come-out-teachers\">supportive of LGB students</a>. The sight of the badges at a San Diego high school brought Christopher White, the director of safe and supportive school project at the GSA network, to tears. \u201cA student saw a teacher wearing one and she thought, \u2018Oh cool, she\u2019s part of the club. She\u2019s someone I can talk to,\u2019\u201d he recalled.</p> <p>The organization also supports students in forming their own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/15/mississippi-schoolsefforts-gay-straight-alliance-membership\">GSA clubs</a>. Winder started his own GSA back in the beginning of the movement in 1998. Deese said his last two years of high school were improved by starting a GSA, as it helped non-LGBT students to become more understanding.</p> <p>For the past six years, Deese has been volunteering with the Trevor Project and is now part of the organization\u2019s Washington DC ambassador\u2019s council. He found the organization when he was searching for gay resources online and said it saved his life. The organization has a 24/7 crisis hotline, as well as texting and chatting services and a social networking site for LGBT teens, which can sometimes be the only supportive resource for teens living in more hostile environments.</p> <p>In addition to their own programs, these organizations had recommendations for additional reforms to improve school climate, centered around inclusivity and changes in bullying policies. Winder warned in particular against bullying policies which could make a student feel like their sexuality is at fault.</p> <p>Greytak had four key recommendations for schools: anti-bullying and anti-discrimination policies that are actively implemented and well-known; supportive and trained educators; clubs and organizations; and inclusive curriculums that are \u201creflective of the world\u201d. \u201cLGB youth need to see themselves reflected in the curriculum and non-LGB youth really need to see other people reflected in the curriculum as well to break down prejudice and barriers,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Bond said schools needed to adopt suicide prevention programs that were LGBTQ inclusive and promote prevention education in a way that wouldn\u2019t create a \u201csuicide contagion\u201d or cause students to think suicide was part of their identity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/03/transgender-student-bathroom-virginia-supreme-court-order\">Supreme court blocks order to let transgender student use boys' bathroom</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cDo not be afraid to ask someone: are you thinking of killing yourself? It is a striking question to say out loud and there\u2019s a myth that it will get someone who wasn\u2019t thinking about it to start thinking about it,\u201d Bond said. \u201cYou give someone an opportunity to say, \u2018Yes, I am.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>These reforms can be difficult to implement, especially in states which have restrictive laws against discussions of homosexuality in education, which Greytak and Bond called \u201cno promo homo\u201d laws. Greytak said eight states \u2013 Alabama, Arizona, Lousiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Utah \u2013 had laws which \u201cforbid educators from talking about LGBT issues in a positive light or at all\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cCan you imagine? The only time you\u2019re allowed to speak about homosexual people or homosexuality is talking about Aids, and that\u2019s about it,\u201d Greytak said. \u201cWhat kind of message does that send?\u201d</p> <p> While advocates were frustrated that the CDC only recently required questions on sexuality on its survey, they applauded the step forward. \u201cYou don\u2019t count until someone counts you,\u201d Bond said, though he regretted that trans and non-binary genders were left out.</p> <p>\u201cI stood in the face of vitriol and bullying because of who I am and I\u2019ve seen what this does to other people\u2019s lives, as it\u2019s done to mine,\u201d Deese said. \u201cIt makes me hopeful for the future that we will continue to make things better not just for the LGBTQ community but for Americans all over.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em><em>In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is <a href=\"tel:+18002738255\">1-800-273-8255</a>.

Overall, they found that neonicotinoids were responsible for a 10% reduction in the distribution of bee species that forage on oilseed rape.</p> <p>They found that the benefits of feeding from oilseed rape, with its abundant flowers, were more than outweighed by the harm it caused the bees. Among the species of wild bee most affected were the buff-tailed bumble bee (<em>Bombus terrestris</em>), the spined mason bee (<em>Osmia spinulosa</em>) and the furrow bee (<em>Lasioglossum fulvicorne</em>).</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/21/oilseed-pesticide-linked-to-uk-honeybee-deaths-study-finds\">Oilseed rape is likely to be particularly damaging</a>, according to the researchers, because the active compounds of the neonicotinoid pesticides are not just applied to the surface but expressed in the plant\u2019s tissues, meaning that bees can ingest the chemicals in the nectar and pollen of affected crops. The pattern of bee decline compared with oilseed rape planting showed that the crop was \u201ca principle mechanism of neonicotinoid exposure among wild bee communities\u201d, the researchers said.</p> <p>The findings come from field data in England spanning 17 years and represent one of the most comprehensive and conclusive pieces of research amid recent rising concerns over the effects of neonicotinoids and other pesticides on pollinators.</p> <p>Green campaigners hailed the research and called for strict restrictions on the use of such pesticides, to stem the decline in bee populations. The EU issued a temporary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/apr/29/bee-harming-pesticides-banned-europe\">ban on certain neonicotinoid </a>pesticides in 2013, but this has already been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/23/uk-suspends-ban-pesticides-linked-serious-harm-bees\">successfully challenged by the UK\u2019s farming organisation, the National Farmers Union (NFU), </a>leading to a partial revocation last year specifically to allow the spraying of oilseed rape.</p> <p>The future of such EU rules is under question in the UK, as ministers consider rewriting current regulations to follow Britain\u2019s exit from the bloc, and the NFU has called for farmers to be allowed to use neonicotinoids again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/15/bees-would-suffer-from-brexit-say-campaigners\">Brexit would be bad for bees, say campaigners</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Matt Shardlow, chief executive of the charity Buglife, told the Guardian: \u201cWith this dramatic evidence, it looks like case closed on neonics and bees.

What is indisputable is that at the same time as he was advising Yanukovych, Manafort was also building personal business links with some of the most powerful figures in the post-Soviet world.<br></p> <p>Before his arrival in Kiev, Manafort had long <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/27/paul-manafort-donald-trump-campaign-past-clients\">specialised in taking on unsavoury clients</a>, such as Ferdinand Marcos, the Filipino dictator, and Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, and subtly retooling their public reputations. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"574ff8bb5ff116f5c7507095fc82041c94c1b5df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/574ff8bb5ff116f5c7507095fc82041c94c1b5df/0_84_4199_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump has expressed admiration for Putin and encouraged Russia to hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Swensen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was recruited to work in Ukraine in the summer of 2005 by the oligarch Rinat Akhmetov \u2013 the main financial backer of Yanukovych\u2019s Party of Regions. </p> <p>That autumn, Manafort and his team \u2013 including longtime aide Rick Gates, another future Trump hire \u2013 began work for the Party of Regions. They rented an anonymous office at number 4 Sophia Street in Kiev, opposite the stop for the 16 and 18 trolley buses. Typically, its white blinds were drawn.</p> <p>The Americans kept a low profile, but Manafort\u2019s efforts didn\u2019t go entirely unnoticed. In a 2006 cable to the state department in Washington, US diplomats reported that the Party of Regions had undergone a mysterious transformation. \u201cLong a haven for Donetsk-based mobsters and oligarchs it is in the midst of an \u2018extreme makeover\u2019,\u201d they observed.</p> <p>The party had enlisted \u201chelp and advice from veteran K street political tacticians\u201d, the diplomats said, referring to Washington DC\u2019s lobbying district. Manafort\u2019s firm \u2013 Davis, Manafort &amp; Freedman \u2013 was busy \u201cnipping and tucking\u201d. Its goal was to rid the party of its gangster image and to change it into a \u201clegitimate political force\u201d.</p> <p>I met Manafort in September 2007, on the eve of the Ostroh rally. This was just before the parliamentary elections, and Yanukovych was frantically touring the regions on a campaign helicopter. </p> <p>Close up, Manafort looked every inch the classic Washington lobbyist. He wore an expensive suit and tie and exuded seriousness. He also bore a faint physical resemblance to his client \u2013 even their hairstyles were similar. (Manafort, I was told later, had instructed Yanukovych to blow-dry his hair. Manafort\u2019s camp denies this.)</p> <p>The American had an interesting story to tell \u2013 one which may sound familiar to observers of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign \u2013 of how his candidate had been almost wilfully misunderstood by the west, especially by its media.<br></p> <p>The new Yanukovych was nothing like the old one, Manafort suggested. He had absorbed the lessons of his previous defeats, was studying English \u2013 and was even playing tennis with the US ambassador.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are still looking at the political system in this country through the prism of 2004,\u201d Manafort told me. \u201cThat\u2019s not at all the situation here.\u201d <br></p> <p>Yanukovych was no puppet of Putin, Manafort said; he wanted a pragmatic foreign policy \u2013 good relations with Russia and the EU. </p> <p>\u201cAs a person, he [Yanukovych] is growing,\u201d Manafort assured me. \u201cI think the time out of power helped him.\u201d</p> <p>Manafort introduced professional techniques. He gathered polling data, worked on messaging and distributed talking points. His efforts were at least partially successful: Yanukovych\u2019s Party of Regions won the 2007 parliamentary elections, and in 2010 Yanukovych beat his rival Yulia Tymoshenko in a presidential runoff. Within a few months, it had become clear that he was hellbent on reversing the modest democratic gains of the Orange Revolution. </p> <p>Yanukovych moved quickly to consolidate all instruments of power: the courts, parliament, the prosecutor\u2019s office, <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/sergii-leshchenko/two-worlds-of-viktor-yanukovych%E2%80%99s-ukraine\">the media and TV</a>. Tymoshenko was charged with corruption and jailed; Yankovych repeatedly shrugged off western calls for her release. </p> <p>In late 2013, Yanukovych was due to sign an association agreement with the European Union, but at the last minute he dumped the plan and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/17/ukraine-russia-leaders-talks-kremlin-loan-deal\">instead accepted a $15bn Kremlin bailout</a>. </p> <p>Pro-EU demonstrators flooded the Maidan, Kiev\u2019s main square, and protests turned violent after a brutal crackdown by security forces.</p> <p>In February 2014, riot police shot dead 100 people in downtown Kiev.

Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/russia-accuses-ukraine-of-armed-crimea-incursion\">Russia claimed Ukrainian agents had attacked Crimea</a>, further fueling tensions in the region.<br></p> <p>Those who worked with Manafort say that he cannot be blamed for the Ukrainian disaster. Oleg Voloshin, a former aide to Kostyantyn Gryshchenko, Yanukovych\u2019s 2010-12 foreign minister who now works as a political consultant, says Manafort urged Yanukovych to press ahead with the EU integration agenda.</p> <p>Voloshin still has ties with the ex-Party of Regions, which Manafort rebranded in 2014 as the Opposition Bloc. (Manafort\u2019s consultancy in Ukraine continued until at least parliamentary elections in 2014.)</p> <p>He suggests that Yanukovych \u201clistened to what Paul said\u201d between 2007-2010, but then, once he became president, stopped listening \u2013 with catastrophic results.</p> <p>Manafort\u2019s advice was always non-ideological, Voloshin recalls. He would calmly explain: \u201cThese people won\u2019t vote for you, don\u2019t bother with them,\u201d and then suggest he \u201cpromote this message, promote that message\u201d. \u201cIt was a very American approach. Do this, do that.\u201d And, crucially: \u201cHe was the person dragging Yanukovych to the west.\u201d<br></p> <p>According to Voloshin, Manafort was an advocate of US interests and promoted American oil companies such as Chevron \u2013 so much so that the joke inside the Party of Regions was that Manafort was actually from the CIA. \u201cYou can blame him for whatever. The only thing you can\u2019t blame him for is lack of will in lobbying for American interests in Ukraine in the commercial sphere.\u201d</p> <p>Voloshin insists that it was Manafort who persuaded Yanukovych to press ahead with the EU integration agenda, arguing that it would counter Yanukovych\u2019s sagging ratings. Manafort also strongly objected to Tymoshenko\u2019s imprisonment, telling Yanukovych bluntly: \u201cYou are going to have very bad times with the west.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Paul\u2019s fault that Yanukovych didn\u2019t listen to him. If it weren\u2019t for Paul, Ukraine would have gone under Russia much earlier,\u201d Voloshin claims. </p> <p>During the period that he was advising Yanukovych, Manafort\u2019s interests in the post-Soviet world were not restricted to politics.<br></p> <p>In 2007, he set up a private equity firm called Pericles Emerging Partners LP.<br></p> <p>Based offshore in the Caymans, the firm had three American partners \u2013 Manafort, Rick Gates and Rick Davis. Davis had cofounded Davis Manafort, Manfort\u2019s lobbying company in Delaware. The new firm\u2019s aim was to make investments in the Ukrainian cities of Kiev, Odessa and Mariupol. It would acquire small companies, consolidate them into larger national enterprises, then sell them on.</p> <p>One of those tempted by this prospectus was the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, an aluminum baron and close friend of Putin, who stumped up almost $19m. Gates, Manafort\u2019s right-hand man, sealed the agreement in trips to Moscow.</p> <p>What happened next was strange indeed. Only one investment by Pericles was ever made, in a Ukrainian telecoms company called Black Sea Cable. According to court documents, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-07-20/trump-s-manager-is-a-master-of-post-soviet-business\">the cash was funnelled into various offshore companies</a>, including one called CardMan ImpEx Corp, registered in the tax haven of the British Virgin Islands. The trail wound through other opaque shell firms, including Cascado AG, set up by the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.</p> <p>A search of the Panama Papers leak gives a few details. Cascado has two Latvian directors, <a href=\"https://www.icij.org/offshore/faux-corporate-directors-stand-fraudsters-despots-and-spies\">Erik Vanagels and Stan Gorin</a>. In reality, they are mere nominees. The pair have been <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-07-20/trump-s-manager-is-a-master-of-post-soviet-business\">linked on paper to a network of offshore companies and multimillion-dollar scams involving Ukrainian state assets</a>.<br></p> <p>When the global financial crisis hit in 2008, Deripaska wanted out \u2013 and his cash back. In 2011, the Americans emailed to say that it was proving tricky to sell Deripaska\u2019s stake because of \u201cmarket conditions\u201d. Further emails went unanswered.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6888bef114164dde81ae3754fac68b6d909db459\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6888bef114164dde81ae3754fac68b6d909db459/0_98_3469_2082/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yulia Tymoshenko\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko alleged that Manafort \u2018played a key role in [a] conspiracy and racketeering enterprise\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Genya Savilov/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt appears that Paul Manafort and Rick Gates have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-business-as-in-politics-trump-adviser-no-stranger-to-controversial-figures/2016/04/26/970db232-08c7-11e6-b283-e79d81c63c1b_story.html\">simply disappeared</a>,\u201d <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2814130/Pericles-Winding-Up-Petition.pdf\">Deripaska\u2019s frustrated lawyers wrote</a>, in a 2014 petition to have Manafort\u2019s firm wound up.</p> <p>It\u2019s unclear if Deripaska ever got his money. Either way, the episode illustrates Manafort\u2019s personal links to figures close to Putin. </p> <p>Later, Manafort introduced Deripaska to Senator John McCain, when the oligarch was having problems travelling to the US. (In 2006, the US had revoked Deripaska\u2019s visa, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/31/oleg-deripaska-us-visa-rusal\">citing alleged \u201ccriminal associations\u201d</a>. Deripaska denies the allegation, and his visa was subsequently reinstated.)</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t the only embarrassing legal scrape arising from Manafort\u2019s capitalist adventures. In November 2011, Tymoshenko unsuccessfully sued him and several of her political opponents in the district court in New York. <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/manafort-complaint-2.pdf\">Her lengthy writ</a> alleged that Manafort \u201cplayed a key role in [a] conspiracy and racketeering enterprise\u201d to launder cash for Yanukovych\u2019s oligarch friends and invest it in New York real estate.</p> <p>In particular, she pointed the finger at Dmitry Firtash, a Ukrainian businessman whose generous contributions helped Yanukovych. Firtash is a shareholder and public face for RosUkrEnergo, an intermediary company co-owned by Gazprom, which imports gas from Russia and resells it to Ukraine. Tymoshenko tried unsuccessfully to get rid of it. </p> <p>The RusUkrEnergo scheme was a mechanism for corruption, she alleged in legal filings. Its real owner, she claimed, was Semyon Mogilevich, a Ukrainian-Russian mobster, and one of the FBI\u2019s top fugitives. Firtash denies this.</p> <p>According to her writ, Firtash and his companies and associates were able to skim billions of dollars from gas transactions. The cash was laundered \u201cthrough a labyrinth of shell companies\u201d. It was then returned to Ukraine, with the money used to bribe Ukrainian officials. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Manafort sells the unsellable product.

Manafort\u2019s plan was to buy the site of the demolished Drake Hotel in Manhattan and to redevelop it at a cost of almost $900m. <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/manafort-complaint-2.pdf\">Firtash transferred at least $25m to the project</a>.

I have come to sell a product called football.\u201d Judged on those criteria, his 24 years in office were more successful than even he \u2013 a man of unshakeable self-belief \u2013 could have foreseen.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/16/joao-havelange-president-fifa-ioc-dies\">Jo\u00e3o Havelange, president of Fifa from 1974 to 1998, dies aged 100</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Havelange, who has died aged 100, increased the revenue of global football and modernised the game, launching a wave of new tournaments, including world championships at under-17 and under-20 level, the Confederations Cup and the Women\u2019s World Cup. He expanded the World Cup finals from a 16-nation to 24-nation and then 32-nation competition, invited almost all the countries in the world to join Fifa, and offered them increased involvement in it. By the time he left office in 1998, the organisation had more members than the UN.</p> <p>He was the first sports administrator to pursue global sponsors, such as Adidas and Coca-Cola, and gain total control of television rights and advertising, through his links with the now discredited and defunct sports marketing company ISL. The revolutionary lobbying and business techniques he used to win votes and contracts are now employed routinely.</p> <p>And yet, to his many critics, Havelange\u2019s zeal for commercialising football resulted in it losing its soul. There was rarely any evidence of his love for the game \u2013 the players, countries and hundreds of millions of fans to whom the game brings such joy seemed but parts of his money-spinning masterplan. Worse still, his administrative era was severely tainted by allegations of bribery and corruption, which intensified under the man he pushed forward to be his anointed successor, Sepp Blatter.</p> <p>Havelange was born in Rio de Janeiro to Belgian parents. His father was an arms trader who sent his son to school in France, and the family spoke French at home. Havelange played football as a youth but it was swimming at which he excelled, and he represented Brazil at the Berlin Olympics in 1936 (the year in which he also earned a law degree). He won a bronze medal for water polo at the Pan American Games in 1951, and represented Brazil in the sport at the Helsinki Olympics in 1952.</p> <p>He made his fortune building up Cometa, a transport businesses, but it was as a sports administrator that Havelange made his name. He led the Brazilian delegation to the Melbourne Olympics in 1956 and became a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1963. In 1958 he was appointed head of the CBD, the Brazilian Sports Confederation, which oversaw all the nation\u2019s sports.</p> <p>The appointment was made six months before Brazil won their first World Cup, in Sweden, and coincided with a golden era of Brazilian football as they went on to win the tournament again in Chile in 1962 and Mexico in 1970. The 1958 and 1970 teams included a galaxy of stars, among them Pel\u00e9, who would become an important figure in Havelange\u2019s quest for power.</p> <p>His role in funding and organising Brazil\u2019s World Cup victories was important, if typically autocratic. In 1958 he included a psychologist in the party (fearing some players were still affected by the trauma of 1950, when Brazil lost in the final at home in Rio, in front of 200,000 people), and wanted to impose <em>concentra\u00e7\u00e3o total </em>on the squad, effectively round-the-clock supervision, believing that football was too important to be left to the footballers.</p> <p>By the late 1960s Brazil was entering the most brutal phase of a 20-year military dictatorship and Havelange appeased the generals by sacking the coach, Jo\u00e3o Saldanha, a member of the Brazilian Communist party, in 1969. He also instigated a three-month pre-tournament training camp for the squad. They won the 1970 World Cup playing some of the best football ever seen, but they arrived in Mexico wearing dark green, military-style suits.</p> <p>In 1969, with an eye on the Fifa votes of African football federations, he organised a tour of the continent for Pel\u00e9\u2019s club, Santos. It was Havelange who circulated the story that the opposing sides in the Biafran civil war in Nigeria declared a two-day truce so they could watch Pel\u00e9 play. Years later, Pel\u00e9 claimed the story was exaggerated. There was the chance for more lobbying in 1972 when Havelange invited 20 countries to Brazil, all expenses paid, to play in an unrecognised football tournament, the Brazil Independence Cup.</p> <p>By the time of the 1974 election for Fifa president, Havelange had spent millions touring the world lobbying for votes, often accompanied by Pel\u00e9. He reckoned he had visited 86 countries in 10 weeks in the runup to the election.</p> <p>His strategy was to attack the European dominance of Fifa while promising developing countries a greater role, money for their football infrastructure and an expanded World Cup. He paid for many poorer African delegates, who otherwise rarely bothered to turn up at such meetings, to attend for the vote. Despite the enormous global success of the 1970 World Cup, broadcast for the first time in colour, the incumbent Fifa president, Sir Stanley Rous, was hanging on to amateur traditions and supported apartheid in South African sport. He was an easy opponent for Havelange to outmanoeuvre.</p> <p>According to Patrick Nally, a pioneer of modern sports marketing who played a key role in the victory, interviewed by the journalist Andrew Jennings for Dishonored Games (1992): \u201cHavelange had seen the future \u2026 He knew that if he became the president of the only federation already running its own high-profile world championship, then he would enjoy huge economic power.\u201d</p> <p>Havelange had relatively little influence on his first World Cup as Fifa president, held in Argentina, then ruled by a military junta. He let the generals and the head of the Argentinian organising committee, Vice-Admiral Carlos Lacoste, run it their way. In the semi-final stage, Argentina beat Peru 6-0, one of the most controversial results in the history of the tournament.</p> <p>While that match was in progress, a bomb exploded at the home of the Argentinian finance secretary, Juan Alemann, who had criticised the organising committee for wasting millions of dollars on the World Cup. Alemann believed Lacoste had masterminded the operation. Two years later, Havelange appointed Lacoste a Fifa vice-president. When democratic rule was restored to Argentina in 1983, Lacoste was investigated for corruption.</p> <p>Havelange\u2019s expansion of the World Cup began at the 1982 tournament in Spain, when the number of teams increased from 16 to 24. The following World Cup was scheduled to be held in Colombia, but when the country pulled out in financial difficulties, the US, Canada and Mexico put themselves forward to host it. In a show of strength that typified Havelange\u2019s rule, every member of the Fifa executive committee voted with him in support of Mexico.</p> <p>Mexico 1986 set a template for future World Cups \u2013 and was soon copied by other global sports federations. Havelange backed Mexico\u2019s bid because of his close relationship with <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/news/y=1997/m=1/news=fifa-senior-vice-president-guillermo-canedo-has-died-70175.html\">Guillermo Ca\u00f1edo</a>, a Fifa vice-president and Mexican media baron who brokered a lucrative global TV deal with ISL.</p> <p>The founder of ISL was the German businessman Horst Dassler, former boss of Adidas, who, together with Havelange and the IOC chairman <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/apr/21/juan-antonio-samaranch-obituary\">Juan Antonio Samaranch</a>, were the most senior members of \u201cthe club\u201d, an exclusive group of sports administrators and marketing men who controlled a large proportion of international sport. It was a cosy relationship, with the world\u2019s two most powerful sporting bodies and the company that provided the lion\u2019s share of their income all based in Switzerland.</p> <p>ISL bought the rights to the World Cup for enormous sums, peaking in 1996 at the \u00a31.45bn combined bid for rights to the 2002 and 2006 finals. The company folded in 2001, leaving debts of \u00a3153m and a trail of corruption that led to Fifa\u2019s door. A Swiss court investigating the collapse, and the whereabouts of millions of missing dollars, heard evidence from a legal representative of Christoph Malms, a former ISL chief executive, that \u201cthe company became a private source of money for Fifa, virtually their private bank\u201d.</p> <p>After two decades, Havelange\u2019s Napoleonic rule began to stretch the patience of even loyal Fifa executives. He developed the habit of closing executive meetings by simply leaving the room and, in one famous case, postponing a discussion on Fifa appointments by handing out his own list of new committee members, then declaring the list passed without a vote.</p> <p>He banned Pel\u00e9 from attending the draw for the 1994 World Cup in Las Vegas after a feud involving Ricardo Teixeira, Havelange\u2019s then son-in-law and president of the Brazilian Football Confederation. This behaviour towards Pel\u00e9 would have raised eyebrows anywhere in the world. In the US, where he was the only soccer player known to many Americans, it was reckless.</p> <p>Havelange survived one more term as president, secured after further intensive lobbying and a promise to expand the World Cup from 24 to 32 teams for the 1998 tournament. Before resigning in 1998, he helped his righthand man, Blatter, to win the vote to succeed him, over the Uefa president, Lennart Johansson.</p> <p>In 2011, Jennings told a Brazilian senate investigation that Havelange had received bribes totalling around $50m from ISL. Later that year the IOC ethics committee announced that it would investigate claims that he had received bribes of $1m. Soon afterwards, he resigned from the IOC for health reasons.</p> <p>In April 2013 he resigned as honorary president of Fifa, again citing health reasons. Jennings led a BBC team for a Panorama programme in December 2015 that revealed the existence of a letter written by Havelange in 2010 claiming that disputed payments to him were above board and known to Blatter. An investigation by the FBI led to Blatter\u2019s ejection from Fifa later that month.</p> <p>Havelange and his wife, Anna Maria (nee Hermanny), had a daughter, L\u00facia, who was divorced from Teixeira in 1997, a granddaughter, Joana, director of the organising committee of the Brazil 2014 World Cup, and two grandsons, Ricardo and Roberto.</p> <p>\u2022 Jean-Marie Faustin Godefroid de Havelange, lawyer, sports administrator and businessman, born 8 May 1916; died 16 August 2016</p>",

Now Prince looked outside and saw 2ft of water everywhere, and rising fast. </p> <p>Prince, 33, sat on a chair on Monday afternoon at a Red Cross shelter in Hammond, stunned by the scope of the flooding. In some communities \u2013 Denham Springs, for instance \u2013 90% of houses flooded, leaving their owners homeless. </p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t even have time to grab anything,\u201d Prince said. He, his wife and his father-in-law scrambled to gather up the couple\u2019s five children, aged three to 12, and make an escape to passing National Guard vehicles. They now have nothing. </p> <p>Prince and 500 other rescued people landed at the Red Cross center in Hammond, one of dozens across the region that sprang up in response to the high water. </p> <p>On Monday afternoon at the shelter, housed in a gym, those people sat or lay on cots and stared into rafters overhead.

Instead it poked westward along the gulf coast, finally settling over southern Louisiana, where it shed up to 3in of rain an hour. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/15/louisiana-flooding-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5vvny\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2657847\"            data-video-name=\"Louisiana flooding: five dead, 20,000 rescued so far \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57b1d7d3e4b0c23bfed89b5d\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/15/160815loufloods2_KP-28815187_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/15/160815loufloods2_KP-28815187.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/15/160815loufloods2_KP-28815187_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/15/louisiana-flooding-video\">Louisiana flooding: five dead, 20,000 rescued so far</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The governor, John Bel Edwards, appealed to the federal government for help.

  "<p>Jo\u00e3o Havelange, the Brazilian who reshaped the football world before his reputation was tainted by corruption scandals, has died aged 100 during a Rio Olympics that he helped secure and is taking place in a stadium once named after him.</p> <p>It was Havelange who paved the way for the huge commercial exploitation of major sporting events, including the Olympics and the World Cup, but also for the lurid allegations of bribery and corruption that have dogged them ever since.</p> <p>A former Olympic athlete, Havelange was an International Olympic Committee member from 1963 to 2011 and used his position at the head of the Brazilian FA (the CBF) during the golden period when his country won three World Cups, between 1958 and 1970, to launch a bid for control of Fifa.</p> <p>His campaign to oust Sir Stanley Rous as president marked a decisive moment in world sport. The Englishman was seen as fusty and out of touch, representative of a colonial old guard trying to maintain their grip on a global game, while Havelange ushered in a new way of doing business that mixed personal, political and corporate interests until they became indistinguishable.</p> <p>With the help of Horst Dassler, the Adidas scion who founded the sports marketing agency ISL, and Fifa\u2019s young secretary general, Sepp Blatter, Havelange oversaw an explosion in the governing body\u2019s revenues as broadcasting and sponsorship deals rolled in.</p> <p>Along the way, it has been alleged, he was one of a great many sports executives who shared in the proceeds. In 2010, the BBC produced a list of individuals, which included Havelange, who received bribes totalling $100m from ISL through front companies.</p> <p>In death as in life, Havelange took centre stage. The news of his passing quickly dominated headlines overshadowing the Olympic triumph of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/16/brazilthiago-braz-da-silva-elevated-to-national-hero-status-after-pole-vault-gold\">Brazil\u2019s first gold in the pole vault for Thiago Braz da Silva</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/16/joao-havelange-obituary\">Jo\u00e3o Havelange obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The tone was respectful but far from universally laudatory. While newspapers noted Havelange had massively expanded Fifa and its finances, they also focused on his corrupt practices, obsession with power and occasional quarrels with Pel\u00e9.</p> <p>In a piece titled \u201cThe worst kind of politics\u201d, the influential columnist Juca Kfouri noted the behind-the-scenes deal-making of a figure who claimed to be free of ideological bias yet worked with Brazil\u2019s military dictators and then built a global empire that was bigger than that of many nations or multinationals. \u201cHavelange did the worst kind of politics when he claimed to be apolitical and he used this to justify his close relationship with dictatorships around the world, whether it was in Africa and South America,\u201d Kfouri wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s undeniable that he transformed Fifa into a great money-making machine and made football popular in the five continents. Unfortunately he did this with a family that even the Cosa Nostra [Italian mafia] has nothing on.\u201d</p> <p>TV stations showed images of his life \u2013 black-and-white photographs of him as a lawyer and member of the Brazilian Olympic team at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, as head of the Brazilian Football Confederation during a period when his country won the World Cup three times, and then as president of Fifa from 1974 to 1998, when the world football body expanded its reach with a system of patronage that strengthened his grip and left a legacy of corruption that continues to this day.</p> <p>Allegations of bribe-taking dogged his career and his family. In 1993, his former ally Pel\u00e9 accused Havelange\u2019s son-in-law Ricardo Teixeira, the then president of the CBF, of corruption, a charge which was denied. Six years later a German newspaper reported Havelange had accepted diamonds and other gifts in connection with Amsterdam\u2019s bid for the 1992 Olympics.</p> <p>In 2006, the British investigative journalist Andrew Jennings told the Brazilian senate that Havelange may have built a fortune of tens of millions of dollars from bribes paid through a front company. He also revealed that a $1m bribe apparently meant for Havelange had crossed the desk of Blatter, who was later found by the Fifa ethics committee to have been \u201cclumsy rather than criminal\u201d in his handling of it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6794cf5d59de1e6a8506e1b2fe5101ca5ab095c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6794cf5d59de1e6a8506e1b2fe5101ca5ab095c/0_15_2625_1575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brazil won three World Cups under Havelange\u2019s presidency of the country\u2019s confederation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brazil won three World Cups under Havelange\u2019s presidency of the country\u2019s confederation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2011, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/dec/04/joao-havelange-resigns-international-olympic-committee\">Havelange resigned from the IOC</a> citing health concerns, the day before he was to appear before an ethics committee investigating claims that he received a bribe of $1m from ISL.</p> <p>But his influence continues to be felt. <a href=\"http://esportes.estadao.com.br\">Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo noted</a> that Havelange\u2019s connection and ability to secure votes played a decisive role in securing the Olympics for Rio de Janeiro during the bidding competition. \u201cI invite you all to come to my city, to honour the Games, on my 100th birthday.

  "<p>Charles Manson made many grand predictions in the 60s to his doped-up, damaged followers about his future, but he never foresaw that he would waste away pathetically, a broken old man in prison. Rather, he said he would be a rock star \u2013 \u201cbigger than the Beatles\u201d, he promised. Failing that, or perhaps as well as that, he would be the triumphant Aryan leader in a global race revolution. But what he really wanted, more than anything, was to be famous. In that pursuit, if nothing else, he wholly succeeded.</p> <p>It is 47 years this month since Manson and his mostly female followers, known as the Family, committed the killings that have become as much a part of the story of 20th-century America as the assassination of JFK and the OJ Simpson trial. However, unlike those crimes, there are no questions about what happened with the Manson murders: we know pretty much exactly who did what to whom, when and why, down to some of the victims\u2019 last words.</p> <p>Late on 9 August 1969, under Manson\u2019s instruction, four Family members \u2013 Tex Watson, Susan Atkins, Linda Kasabian and Patricia Krenwinkel \u2013 left their commune on Spahn Ranch, which had been used frequently in westerns, and drove to 10050 Cielo Drive, a house formerly rented by record producer Terry Melcher, but then inhabited by Roman Polanski and his wife, Sharon Tate. Manson had been introduced to Melcher by Dennis Wilson, a dopey, druggy Beach Boy who wrongly thought Manson \u201chad something\u201d. \u201cCharlie\u2019s real cosmic, man. He\u2019s deep. He listens to Beatles records and gets messages from them about what to do next,\u201d Wilson told friends.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f94d353b6631cbcd63780bd6239d7d5d907ce93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f94d353b6631cbcd63780bd6239d7d5d907ce93/0_0_1992_1356/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Family members Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten were convicted for the Tate-LaBianca murders.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Melcher was less impressed and declined to give Manson a record deal. It is often said wrongly that Manson sent his followers to Cielo Drive to kill Melcher in revenge, but in fact he had been told the producer had since moved out. He did, however, want to give him \u201ca scare\u201d. So, at Melcher\u2019s former house, Manson\u2019s followers slaughtered five people: 18-year-old Steven Parent; coffee heiress Abigail Folger; her boyfriend Wojciech Frykowski; celebrity hairdresser Jay Sebring; and Tate, who was eight and a half months pregnant and died begging for the life of her baby. \u201cLook, bitch, I don\u2019t care about you,\u201d said Atkins. Tate was stabbed 16 times. Her baby son died inside her 20 minutes later.</p> <p>The following night, the same four killers, plus Manson and Family members Leslie Van Houten and Clem Grogan, drove to 3301 Waverly Drive and killed retail executives Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. They were probably chosen because the Family previously had been to a party at the house next door. At both murder scenes, the Family scrawled words and symbols on the walls, which Manson hoped would lead the police to think <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/03/black-panthers-vanguard-revolution-film\">the Black Panthers</a> committed the killings, thus starting a race riot. They also wrote lyrics from the Beatles\u2019 White Album, which Manson believed was a coded message to him to start a racial uprising. Sandwiching these murders were many others, some definitely committed by Manson and the Family, some only possibly \u2013 of drug dealers, hangers-on and unfortunate innocents, including Manson\u2019s uncle and Van Houten\u2019s lawyer.</p> <p>Yet, despite the lack of any meaty mystery, the bones of the Manson story are still being picked over.

While that\u2019s largely a testimony to Cline\u2019s breathtaking talent, the attention-grabbing Manson peg will not have hurt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"00eaf7eb5a4413fd6fc640dd7421cd3cd3a3c87a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00eaf7eb5a4413fd6fc640dd7421cd3cd3a3c87a/0_0_1661_1859/893.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski\" width=\"893\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Misogyny was \u2018a given in the gilded circles in which Manson lurked\u2019 \u2013 Roman Polanski was \u2018compulsively unfaithful\u2019 to his wife, Sharon Tate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ROM/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The second series of the NBC series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/27/charles-manson-family-pop-culture-aquarius\">Aquarius</a>, starring David Duchovny as a cop hired to track down a teenage runaway in 1967 who is hanging out with, yes, Charles Manson, kicked off in June in the US. Finally, Alison Umminger\u2019s newly released novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/jun/01/my-favourite-manson-girl-alison-umminger-review\">American Girls</a>, is about a modern-day teenager who becomes fascinated with the women in Manson\u2019s Family.</p> <p>All of this follows last year\u2019s brilliant 12-episode series on Manson on Karina Longworth\u2019s excellent podcast <a href=\"http://www.youmustrememberthispodcast.com/\">You Must Remember This</a>, which Vanity Fair called \u201cthe summer\u2019s best drama\u201d. By the end of the series, the podcast\u2019s listenership had doubled. \u201cMany of the stories on my podcast have to do with how people change when they become famous, or when fame slips through their fingers,\u201d Longworth says. \u201cI was fascinated by the idea that this era-defining tragedy happened at least in part because this guy got so close to becoming famous, but just couldn\u2019t get there.\u201d</p> <p>Manson references are never far from pop culture. Mad Men heightened the tension around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/jun/06/mad-men-season-six-theories\">Megan Draper by styling her to resemble Tate</a>. Leicester band Kasabian, in a characteristically cack-handed grasp for cool, named themselves after Linda Kasabian. Brian Warner chose Manson as the emblem of the US\u2019s dark side \u2013 and Marilyn Monroe of its goodness \u2013 when he settled on Marilyn Manson as his stage name. Given the violence of the murders, that the killers were largely women in thrall to a male cult leader, and that one of the victims was a beautiful celebrity, it is no surprise that the crimes still hold a fascination for so many people. The question is why they have proved so especially fascinating now.</p> <p>Since the day Tate and her friends\u2019 bodies were discovered, people have searched for meaning in the Manson murders, bleaching out the bloodiness of the crimes with clinical symbolism and neat narrative. This is often justified by reference to Joan Didion\u2019s famous quote at the beginning of The White Album, her essay about the late 60s, which touches on Manson: \u201cWe tell ourselves stories in order to live.\u201d In fact, Didion\u2019s point was that no meaning could be found in that chaotic era. \u201cSo many encounters in those years were devoid of any logic, save that of the dreamwork,\u201d she writes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc5cc88f8a63545f67b0fe8ebbf3b49a1dd02f26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc5cc88f8a63545f67b0fe8ebbf3b49a1dd02f26/0_0_3032_1819/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Terry Melcher and Doris Day\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terry Melcher \u2013 pictured with his mother, Doris Day \u2013 embodied Hollywood\u2019s transition to the late 20th century.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David McGough/Time Life Pictures/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Manson himself was famously adept at shape-shifting, altering himself to suit his audience. He could be the hip rocker with Wilson and Melcher, the Christ-like guru with his followers, the racist redneck with the bikers who came to the ranch. Similarly, his crimes can be cut to fit almost anyone\u2019s cloth. The story can be one of Hollywood\u2019s transition to the late 20th century, embodied by Terry Melcher, the son of Doris Day (old Hollywood), but friends with the Laurel Canyon crowd (new Hollywood). Or it can be a morality tale about the toxic desire for fame, symbolised by Manson even taking up residence on an old movie lot.</p> <p>The most common cliche is that the killings marked \u201cthe end of the 60s\u201d, when in fact <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2016/jul/11/woodstock-in-pictures\">Woodstock</a>, arguably the crowning moment of the decade, happened afterwards, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/dec/08/rolling-stones-concert-altamont-1969\">Altamont</a>, the definitive end of the rock\u2019n\u2019roll hippie dream, was also yet to come. The second-most common cliche is that Manson represented \u201cthe dark side of 60s hippy culture\u201d. But in the immediate aftermath of Manson\u2019s arrest, many people were certain that he actually represented an attempt by the establishment \u2013 the straights \u2013 to suppress the counterculture.</p> <p>\u201cI saw the Manson case as a fight for the life of the counterculture itself \u2013 one of our own was being martyred, our most cherished beliefs were being trashed by the cynical establishment and their lackies, the LAPD,\u201d <a href=\"http://murdersofaugust69.freeforums.net/thread/163/david-daltons-interview-jail-manson\">journalist David Dalton later wrote</a>. He planned to write a piece for Rolling Stone (\u201cWe\u2019ll put \u2018MANSON IS INNOCENT!\u2019 on the cover,\u201d the magazine\u2019s publisher, Jann Wenner, reportedly crowed), and even stayed on Spahn Ranch with his wife after interviewing Manson. But when the LAPD showed him photos from the crime scenes, with the same Beatles song titles Manson had referenced to him daubed around in blood, Dalton knew he had been a fool.</p> <p>\u201cAll that had seemed solid an hour earlier had vanished into thin air. I couldn\u2019t afford to dwell at any length on the metaphysical ramifications of it all \u2013 the fate of the counterculture etc. I had more immediate problems. My wife, Andy, was still out at the Spahn Ranch,\u201d Dalton wrote. He raced back to the ranch, avoided eye contact with everyone there, in case they saw his fear, grabbed his wife and fled.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68955c33e42697bb0fa1eed100b3bf7acec1f30b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68955c33e42697bb0fa1eed100b3bf7acec1f30b/0_0_2400_1664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charles Manson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Manson\u2019s genius lay in exploiting the burgeoning feeling at the time that there needed to be a new way of doing things.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Polanski himself initially dismissed the police\u2019s suspicion of Manson. \u201cI distinctly recall my lukewarm response to this information: \u2018That\u2019s just your anti-hippy bias,\u2019 I said,\u201d he writes in his autobiography.</p> <p>In fact, the idea that the deeply racist, misogynistic and flat-out deranged Manson represented any kind of hippy dream is as deluded as Dennis Wilson\u2019s belief he had musical talent. But it is also a reflection of how, in fact, some of his beliefs weren\u2019t so different from those around him. Much has been written about Manson\u2019s misogyny, and how his belief that it was his right, as a man, to have as many women as he wanted while they all looked after him was by no means unusual at that time. In fact, it was a given in the gilded circles in which he lurked. Melcher and Wilson called themselves \u201cthe golden penetrators\u201d; Polanski was compulsively unfaithful to Tate while she stayed at home painting the nursery.</p> <p>\u201cThe secret history of this story seemed to be the stories of women who were touched by these events, either directly or indirectly,\u201d says Longworth. \u201cIt became gruesomely clear to me that the era of free love didn\u2019t leave every woman who was expected to participate in it feeling more free.\u201d</p> <p>The so-called revolutionaries of the 60s merely recreated old patriarchal structures, with men as the shaggers and women as the submissive sexual and domestic toys. As Robin Morgan wrote in <a href=\"http://blog.fair-use.org/2007/09/29/goodbye-to-all-that-by-robin-morgan-1970/\">Goodbye to All That</a>, her 1970 essay about the 60s: \u201cManson is only the logical extreme of the normal American male\u2019s fantasy, whether he is Dick Nixon or <a href=\"http://www.markrudd.com/?/about-mark-rudd.html\">Mark Rudd</a>: master of a harem, women to do all the shitwork, from raising babies and cooking and hustling to killing people on command.\u201d It was Manson\u2019s luck that so many of his pathologies fitted in so neatly with the time. As Melcher noted after rejecting him for a record deal, Manson didn\u2019t look or sound that different from the hundreds of hobo hippies panhandling around Sunset Boulevard back then.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09ed173a9d640ce1722ac6eaf29370cba206dcba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09ed173a9d640ce1722ac6eaf29370cba206dcba/0_0_2368_1420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Wilson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys was one of many people drawn in by Manson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Globe Photos/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He also didn\u2019t, at first, seem much more crazy than the celebrities. After all, given that the era\u2019s icons included the notoriously loopy Dennis Hopper and John Phillips from the Mamas and the Papas, sanity looked positively bourgeois. In fact, Polanski initially suspected Phillips was the killer, because he had had a one-night stand with Phillips\u2019 wife, Michelle, one of Tate\u2019s best friends, which says something about Polanski\u2019s chronic promiscuity and Phillips\u2019 reputation. \u201cJohn\u2019s outward calm, I knew, concealed a capacity for deep, burning anger,\u201d Polanski later wrote about his former friend.</p> <p>Manson was able to get as far as he did in Hollywood, mingling with rock stars and celebrity producers, for one reason above all: people can be stupid when they seek out authenticity. That Manson was a genuine itinerant, one who had been in and out of reform schools and prison most of his life, was seen as a point in his favour by people such as Wilson. Just as young people in that decade were marching to overthrow old attitudes and restrictions, so the young Hollywood crowd fancied that they were overturning elitist structures, rejecting studio systems in favour of rock\u2019n\u2019roll and new cinema. Manson represented this rejection of conformity in its purest form to rich people slightly embarrassed by their riches. Mingling with him in his squalor made them feel better about themselves; sleeping with the female members of the Family, as Melcher and Wilson did at Manson\u2019s urging, made them feel better still.</p> <p>Longworth describes the Manson story as \u201cvery, very specifically of its time\u201d. It is true, certainly, that it involves so many aspects of the 60s \u2013 from surf music to acid dropouts \u2013 that it can seem like a tidy, if toxic, embodiment of the decade. But if it were merely a period piece, it would not retain such resonance, particularly today. The story of the women, from Atkins to Tate, inevitably fascinates a much younger generation of female writers, who feel far from the sexism of the 60s, but not so distant that they don\u2019t hear its echoes.</p> <p>It is this element of Manson that is the most chameleonic. His genius lay in exploiting the burgeoning feeling at the time that there needed to be a new way of doing things; that the old elites should be overthrown; that the mainstream media and police were in the pocket of the establishment; and that a new generation had been sold out by a system that was supposed to help them. These sentiments were expressed by the counterculture\u2019s leading lights at the time, but they are so common today that it is hard to find a major political news story at the moment that isn\u2019t rooted in them. Once again, the Manson story has shifted to fit another era.</p> <p>When people seek saviours, they generally find false prophets. Manson\u2019s followers had the terrible luck to fall into the path of a genuine psychopath. In that sense, his story is <em>sui generis</em>. But in terms of the needs, desires and frustrations that facilitated his rise, it feels all too modern.</p>",
  "<p>This week sees the nationwide launch of <a href=\"https://www.bk.com/menu-item/whopperrito\">Burger King\u2019s Whopperrito</a>. No, you didn\u2019t read that wrong \u2013 the fast-food king has really put a Whopper in a burrito.</p> <p>Like <a href=\"https://www.kfc.co.uk/our-food/for-one/wraps/zinger-burrito\">KFC\u2019s burrito project</a> before it, the Whopperrito is a bland reminder that mediocre meals remain mediocre even when they put on new party clothes.</p> <p>But it points to a new trend in hipster food: the burritofication of all food types. Jeffrey Pilcher, a food historian and author of Planet Taco: A Global History of Mexican Food, says the burrito and the taco have become a new kind of shorthand for chefs. \u201cPut something in a burrito and it acquires this cool edge,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of Americanizing foreign food, but without that McDonald\u2019s feel.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5250c3e14be4614743ec8005a148cc962a56aa0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5250c3e14be4614743ec8005a148cc962a56aa0f/0_138_3872_2325/1000.jpg\" alt=\"If you can\u2019t stand chicken fries then try Burger King\u2019s new offering, the Whopperrito.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If you can\u2019t stand chicken fries then try Burger King\u2019s new offering, the Whopperrito.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlotte Simmonds/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In San Francisco, the birthplace of the \u201cMission-style\u201d burrito \u2013 the meaty, rice-filled, bean-and-cheese experience that most will recognize \u2013 a growing number of cooks are experimenting with the burrito blueprint. The basics remain the same: a carpeting of carbs (usually rice), meat or fish, and something fresh (avocado, salads or vegetables) twisted up in a tortilla, bread or other wrap. But the results vary wildly.</p> <p>So if the burrito \u2013 not the burger \u2013 is now America\u2019s favorite food playground, who\u2019s getting it right and who\u2019s getting it wrong? I ate my way through nine burritos in four days to bring you the answer.</p> <h2><strong>What doesn\u2019t work</strong></h2> <p><strong>The Whopper-rrito</strong></p> <p>Burger King\u2019s burger in a burrito launched nationwide on Monday. Yes, we tried it. And yes, it\u2019s pretty lame. It lacks inspiration, texture and bite. It\u2019s a taco-flavored burger in a tortilla and none the better for it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3685f18c8706c1d6f65d7ae8f74d138b10252ceb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3685f18c8706c1d6f65d7ae8f74d138b10252ceb/0_151_3872_2325/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Whopperrito, best left unwrapped.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Whopperrito, best left unopened.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlotte Simmonds/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>KFC tried a similar stunt last year by releasing a fried chicken and a pulled chicken burrito in the UK. I tried it on a rainy day in London and it was miserable, tasting simultaneously of nothing at all and overwhelmingly of artificial cheese.</p> <p>Conclusion: good burritos can be made in the same amount of time it takes to get a fast-food burrito and they aren\u2019t much more expensive (my Whopperrito meal cost nearly $7). Treat yourself to the real deal.</p> <p><strong>The ramen-rrito</strong></p> <p>Some restaurants in California have been putting <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-indomie-burrito-komodo-20151030-story.html\">ramen noodles</a> inside <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/-zuzEoI2Oe/\">burritos</a> and, while I have not actually tried it (nearby restaurants no longer serve them.

The account has previously offered \u2013 at 3% \u2013 one of the most competitive rates on the high street. </p> <p>Santander said this decision was made \u201cin response to the lower for longer bank rate environment, as evidenced by the Bank of England\u2019s recent monetary policy actions and the continuing challenges in the market\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>A last-ditch effort to prevent yellow fever spreading through Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and potentially developing into a global epidemic is to be launched using vaccines containing a fifth of the normal dose because the global stockpile is so low.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/aug/26/fighting-yellow-fever-in-the-democratic-republic-of-congo-in-pictures\">Fighting yellow fever in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yellow fever is frequently lethal, killing half of those who develop severe symptoms. It is transmitted by the bite of the <em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquito, which is also responsible for the spread of Zika virus. There is a vaccine which protects people for life, but few adults had been immunised in Angola when yellow fever broke out there in December last year, and in the DRC, to where it has spread.</p> <p>If it takes hold in Kinshasa, a densely packed city of more than 10 million people, it is feared that infected mosquitoes could travel beyond the central African region, which has been experiencing so severe an outbreak that vaccine stocks are almost exhausted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/angola_drc_yellow_fever/giv-31075E0r8API91VwS/\" data-alt=\"Number of confirmed yellow fever cases\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/angola_drc_yellow_fever/giv-31075E0r8API91VwS/\">Number of confirmed yellow fever cases</a> </figure>  <p> In Angola, there have been nearly 4,000 suspected cases of yellow fever of which 879 have been confirmed while DRC had 68 confirmed cases and more than 2,200 suspected cases, with about 400 reported deaths in the two countries, mostly in Angola. Almost 19m doses of vaccine have been administered since January, but there are only 5m left in the emergency stockpile. The vaccine takes a year to make, so even with the handful of manufacturers working flat out, stocks cannot be replenished quickly.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt has got us incredibly worried,\u201d said Ruairidh Villar of Save the Children, which is helping with the vaccination effort. \u201cWe\u2019ve just scrambled an emergency team to DRC to support a last-ditch vaccination campaign before the outbreak reaches Kinshasa. Our fear is it is likely to go global if we can\u2019t stop it soon and it hits the city.\u201d<br></p> <p>He added: \u201cIt is not as fatal as Ebola but it is pretty awful. The symptoms include fever, headache, jaundice, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting and fatigue. Some people recover within a few days but a minority become severely ill, suffering organ failure, bleeding from the eyes and death.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8258190ceec6fcb617f64354dcbdac00f7baf621\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8258190ceec6fcb617f64354dcbdac00f7baf621/363_572_3773_2264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of a M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res team fumigate the Yolo Sud neighbourhood of Kinshasa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of a M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res team fumigate the Yolo Sud neighbourhood of Kinshasa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jerome Delay/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some say the spread of yellow fever shows the world has not learned the lessons of Ebola. </p> <p>\u201cYellow fever is something that we know and it is something for which we have the tools to prevent the spread, which is the vaccine,\u201d said Dr Joanne Liu, international president of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, which is involved in the yellow fever response. \u201cThe first cases of yellow fever were in December 2015 and confirmed in January. The first vaccination started a few weeks afterwards, but it could have been a bit more prompt.</p> <p>\u201cWhat does it tell us? Even if we have the best surveillance systems and tools, we still need the political will to act at local level, regional level and international level. As with Ebola, when that is not enacted, we always, always have a delay in the response. There were some critical weeks which basically allowed fertile ground for spread.</p> <p>\u201cThis makes me deeply saddened and also a little bit in despair. We need to act \u2013 a quick and prompt response.\u201d</p> <p>There have been reports of 1m doses of vaccine disappearing after being delivered to Angola, but the World Health Organisation denies any doses went missing. The government appears to have used the vaccine elsewhere in Angola.</p> <p>\u201cFollowing a review of the first round of vaccination campaigns in Angola, it was found that around 1m doses from the emergency stocks had been used to vaccinate people in other medical facilities that were not part of the initial approved emergency vaccination plans,\u201d a WHO spokesman said. </p> <p>A mass vaccination campaign in western DRC in May immunised more than 200,000 people, said Heather Kerr, Save\u2019s country director there. But it did not stop the spread. \u201cNow we\u2019re planning a second response with the emergency health unit. We work together with them to support the government. The plan is to vaccinate in all the provinces bordering Angola because the yellow fever originally arrived from Angola,\u201d Kerr said by Skype from Kinshasa.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6008850f4c00b228a09d3d1af82240a92fb8b90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6008850f4c00b228a09d3d1af82240a92fb8b90/0_161_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A member of a Doctors Without Borders (MSF) team fumigates the Yolo Sud neighborhood of Kinshasa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Time is running out to prevent the spread of yellow fever because the rains will begin in September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jerome Delay/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cKinshasa is such a huge city. We don\u2019t really know how big it is. We think there are about 10 million people here. Some of the suburbs are very, very crowded. We are close to the Angolan border as well. There have already been cases in Kinshasa \u2013 not many, but a few \u2013 because of the density of the population and the ability of the mosquitoes to travel far.</p> <p>\u201cFortunately for us, we\u2019re in the dry season but there are still people being bitten by mosquitoes and not everybody is sleeping under a mosquito net.\u201d</p> <p>WHO said that, until now, outbreaks in central Africa had been in rural areas, not crowded urban environments, where mosquitoes thrive in standing water. Time is running out to check the spread, however, because the rains will begin in September.<br></p> <p>The emergency vaccination campaign beginning on Wednesday was one of the largest ever attempted, WHO said.</p> <p> \u201cWorking with ministries of health in the two countries, WHO is coordinating 56 global partners to vaccinate more than 14 million people against yellow fever in more than 8,000 locations,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThe yellow fever outbreak has found its way to dense, urban areas and hard-to-reach border regions, making planning for the vaccination campaign especially complex.\u201d</p> <p>The decision to give people one-fifth of the normal dose of vaccine \u2013 known as fractional dosing \u2013 was taken by WHO\u2019s strategic advisory group of experts on immunisation (Sage). There are some small studies that show it gives protection for at least a year and possibly longer. </p> <p>\u2033Protecting as many people as possible is at the heart of this strategy. With a limited supply we need to use these vaccines very carefully,\u2033 said William Perea, coordinator for the control of epidemic diseases unit at WHO. </p>",
  "<p>\u201cDo you remember the girl who did that thing with the stocking: she put it in her mouth and then pulled it out ... somewhere else?\u201d asks former dancer Jo King. \u201cAnd who was the girl with the snake? I remember she used to clear the pub. And Canadian Linda, who was the most graceful, fairy-like doll ... Then there was me, shouting at people if they didn\u2019t put money in the jug!\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s Saturday 30 July, and the White Horse strip pub in London\u2019s Shoreditch is packed for its closing night. On the stage dancers sparkle, people cry, and three generations of landladies wave goodbye. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss it terribly,\u201d says Sue Bristow, the pub\u2019s outgoing boss.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, coins are counted from collection jars amid a clutter of flowers, cards and cake. It\u2019s Legends Night, and dancers across the decades have come back to pay tribute. One woman\u2019s parents are here; another has brought in old photos. At one point in the evening, everyone does the conga. It feels like an anachronism: in Shoreditch, traditional East End boozers are now as out of place as horse-drawn carts.</p> <p>The Bristows opened the White Horse 38 years ago, on the corner of what was then a Hayes warehouse and had previously been a bacon factory (it was built between 1890 and 1931 for the Lipton family of grocers and tea merchants). Shoreditch in the late 1970s was an unloved and unprofitable corner of London. The pub struggled, too \u2013 until the family decided to expand it into a strip club.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7fd2d9a72ab8803473d8717f333c9622be3372b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7fd2d9a72ab8803473d8717f333c9622be3372b/0_0_4683_3122/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Behind the scenes at the White Horse on closing night, Saturday 30 July 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There\u2019s a camaraderie here \u2026\u2019 Behind the scenes at the White Horse on its closing night</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For decades after that, the White Horse held its own as father, mother, daughter and finally granddaughter pulled the pints. \u201cEveryone thought you were Peggy Mitchell,\u201d Sue tells her mother, Pauline. \u201cNo, that was you!\u201d Pauline replies.</p> <p>Shoreditch has since undergone successive identity shifts, colonised first by artists, then by the inhabitants of luxury flats. In the process, this old factory-warehouse became prime real estate, and in 2001 was bought for around \u00a322m (a snip compared to its current value) <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2814788/The-Derwent-London-trend-that-bucks-the-market.html\">by Derwent London</a>, whose property portfolio in the capital is valued at \u00a35bn.</p> <p>Derwent rebranded it the Tea Building, and brought in architects Allford Hall Monaghan Morris to whip it into stylish shape: exposed industrial piping and smooth concrete, complemented by a Lipton-inspired \u201cGreen Tea\u201d energy-saving initiative. The building became a cornerstone of the \u201cnew\u201d Shoreditch: home to members\u2019 club <a href=\"https://www.shoreditchhouse.com/\">Shoreditch House</a> and filled with marketing agencies, media companies and fashion brands.</p> <p>In these circumstances, it is perhaps surprising the White Horse managed to hang on so long. This year, however, Derwent raised the rent considerably, then offered to buy out the White Horse. The Bristows agreed, signing a non-disclosure agreement about the deal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9c1f682133da0ad0124c756e79fd231b6db1780b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c1f682133da0ad0124c756e79fd231b6db1780b/0_331_4961_2976/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The tips jug passed round after each dance\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The tips jug passed round after each dance</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The dancers, however, are outspoken and angry. After all, the White Horse is the birthplace of the <a href=\"http://ethicalstripper.com/site/\">East London Strippers Collective</a> (ELSC), which formed in 2014 to fight strip club closures in Tower Hamlets and improve working conditions across the industry. An atmosphere of mutual support, rather than bitter competition, allowed the collective to flourish.</p> <p>But the White Horse is among the last of its breed. The power to grant licences for sexual entertainment venues is in the hands of local councils, which are expected to make decisions based on evidence of public nuisance. In 2010, however, the local borough, Hackney, imposed a \u201cnil limit\u201d policy, meaning that whenever such venues sell up, the licence is gone forever and no new one will be issued. The decision was made <a href=\"http://www.hackneygazette.co.uk/news/majority_say_no_to_hackney_ban_on_strip_clubs_and_sex_shops_1_772197\">despite 66% of those who took part in a public consultation</a> voting against this effective ban on strip clubs.</p> <p>\u201cSue\u2019s been pushed out, and we\u2019re all devastated \u2013 this is the best place to work in London, \u201d says White Horse dancer and activist Edie Lamort. \u201cThere\u2019s a camaraderie here that I haven\u2019t experienced in any other job.

The dancers, however, argue their workplace security should be the priority, and that moral concerns are rarely so vociferously voiced around other industries.</p> <p>The White Horse has always worked on the old \u201cpound-in-the-jug\u201d model, meaning dancers could make money without having to hustle for private dances, as is the case in most strip clubs. \u201cIt fosters creative stage shows,\u201d Lamort says. \u201cAnd Sue used to let us come in to practise, she let us run life drawing classes upstairs, and we filmed here for a documentary. You\u2019d never get that in the big clubs.\u201d</p> <p>For the dancers, it\u2019s not just sentimentality that is making them tearful tonight. Many are wondering what they\u2019ll do next in a city increasingly hostile to their industry. Some already have second jobs; others say it\u2019s going to be a struggle.

  "<p>One of more unusual records smashed at the Rio Olympics must be the one for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-37079909\">most public marriage proposal ever</a>. One that occurs during the televised awards ceremony of a global sporting tournament will be very hard to beat in terms of audience.</p> <p>However, <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/sport-olympics/chinese-diver-accused-of-stealing-girlfriends-thunder-by-proposing-to-her-as-she-accepts-medal-at-a3320201.html?amp\">not everyone thinks this was appropriate</a>. Many have objected to the gesture, saying it was an attempt by Qin Kai (the proposer) to steal his girlfriend He Zi\u2019s thunder, or that she was under too much pressure to give an honest answer at that point, and so on. </p> <p>In this instance, we just don\u2019t know. Brief footage of someone in an intensely public situation is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2016/aug/04/dont-diagnose-donald-trump-its-not-helpful\">not enough to allow accurate assessments of their thinking or mental state</a>. Maybe He Zi loves the idea of big public proposals? Maybe she\u2019s no issue with huge audiences, what with being an Olympic athlete? Maybe her boyfriend of 6 years knows what she likes better than an audience of remote strangers, most of whom didn\u2019t know she existed the day before? For this couple, we can\u2019t say. But that\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2015/apr/29/outrage-public-widespread-anger-is-so-common-psychology\">never stopped people getting angry on the internet before</a>.</p> <p>Proposing in public seems to be <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/weddings/wedding-proposals-go-from-private-moments-to-public-spectacles/2013/12/26/4de34f40-6cb6-11e3-b405-7e360f7e9fd2_story.html\">increasingly common</a>, incorporating increasingly <a href=\"http://archive.boston.com/lifestyle/relationships/gallery/flashmob_proposals/\">elaborate and grandiose fashions</a>, involving many people, as participants and observers.

Peacocks have their elaborate tails, deer engage in antler-to-antler combat, so maybe extravagant, expensive proposals are a manifestation of this in humans? Of course, human males are thinking, rational creatures (with the possible exception of those who comment on feminism online), so aren\u2019t purely at the mercy of evolved subconscious tendencies. But, there are also rational reasons for a showy proposal. A sign of dedication. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/28/five-worst-public-marriage-proposals\">Risking public rejection</a> shows how committed you are to your partner. It will make the moment far more memorable. It\u2019s more \u201cromantic\u201d. It\u2019s a celebration of love. And so on.</p> <p>So what\u2019s the harm with big public proposals? Sadly, there are far more cynical ways to view it. </p> <p>Humans have long been monogamous (for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/apr/12/stis-may-have-driven-ancient-humans-to-monogamy-study-says\">possibly less-than-romantic reasons</a>) and got married, so a lot of cultural inertia has built up around the process. Many aspects of marriage and weddings are now regarded as <a href=\"http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493908660\">status symbols</a>. The size of the engagement ring, the wedding, the dress, there are many ways to use your marriage to <a href=\"http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/opinion/columnists/my-wedding-is-going-to-be-so-much-better-than-yours-200704134\">emphasise your social superiority over others</a>. Big showy proposals can become just another way of flaunting your status. </p> <p>But a showy proposal is one thing. A showy <em>public </em>proposal is something else. Doing it in front of friends or family is one thing, no relationship occurs in a vacuum. But in front of numerous strangers? This potentially adds a far more sinister element. </p> <p>People care about their image, about how other people see them, down to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impression_management\">the neurological level</a>. We all want to be seen by others as good and decent no matter what the truth, hence racists always say \u201cI\u2019m not racist but\u2026\u201d before being racist. This is why the majority of people fear embarrassing themselves or failing in some way when in a public situation (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/oct/16/social-anxiety-mundane-terrifying-psychology-stress\">social anxieties are incredibly common</a>).</p> <p>The desire to avoid the negative judgement of others is an incredibly powerful motivator for humans.

But for investors, the Global Fund represents an opportunity both to manifest the ideal of global citizenship and to reap the dividends of greater security and stability that come with improvements in global health.</p> <p>At the opening of the International Aids Conference, Bill Gates described the Global Fund as \u201cone of the best and kindest things people have ever done for one another.

She paints a fine picture of a dynamic Labour party and approves of its leftward turn (for which she admits Jeremy Corbyn can claim credit) and the junking of the Blairite \u201cthird way\u201d .</p> <p>What she does not say is that these are already the policies of Corbyn, who has been consistent in his call for wages councils and increasing corporation taxes. She says that the choice is between two candidates on the left, soft and hard. What exactly defines Corbyn as hard left and Smith as soft left? Maybe \u201csoft left\u201d means left in words but not in reality and \u201chard left\u201d means left in words and action. If that is so then she has hit upon the reason why, in the face of underhand tactics by the Parliamentary Labour party (PLP) lapped up by the press, Corbyn continues to be very popular among Labour party members.</p> <p>One would expect the daily drip-feed of anti-Corbyn propaganda in the press would put a dent in his popularity, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. The reason is that, in this world of \u201cpost-truth\u201d politics, people have learnt not to trust words, but actions. Trust comes with consistency and Corbyn has been consistent in his position on the left of the party for decades, whereas Smith came from nowhere and proposes more or less the same things.</p> <p>Labour party members voted overwhelmingly for Corbyn last year but apparently, according to the PLP, they voted wrongly so they must vote again. \u201cDemocracy is fine as long as you vote the way we want you to\u201d is guaranteed to stick in the gut and produce the opposite of what they hope.<br><strong>David Murray</strong><br>Montbrun Bocage, France</p> <p>\u2022 I read Polly Toynbee\u2019s article and was shocked at the double-talk that is repeated by the pro-Owen Smith caucus. Smith\u2019s election manifesto includes the pledge to bring the party together, yet by establishing his caucus of anti-Corbyn MPs, he is doing precisely the opposite: attempting to split the party.</p> <p>Smith\u2019s proclaimed agenda is so close to that of Corbyn that it can only be assumed that he and the other MPs opposed to Corbyn are doing so with a hidden Blairite agenda that is firmly opposed to many of Corbyn\u2019s socialist policies. It is clear from the overwhelming support for Corbyn that he is far from being weak or unelectable.</p> <p>To pursue election to parliament at the cost of abandonment of socialist principles and declared Labour party precepts is to undermine any hope of a social democratic government. To do this is destined to split the party, and that is what would make it unelectable. Electability follows from the declared adherence to principle, not from compromise and irresolution in the face of Tory reaction.<br><strong>Alexander Schoen</strong><br>London, UK</p> <h2><strong>Life in the Canadian Arctic</strong><br></h2> <p>Your Weekly Review article about life in the Canadian Arctic was keenly read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jul/05/struggle-iqaluit-north-south-tensions-canada-arctic-capital-inuit\" title=\"\">(29 July)</a>. I covered the north country for CBC Northern Service and other outlets from 1969 to 1973. At no time did I hear of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) shooting dogs to encourage Inuit people to stay in one place.</p> <p>However, there is no denying that there was a shortage of dogs even in my day. Indeed, the situation was so desperate that it forced the Italian explorer Guido Monzino, who wanted to re-enact Admiral Peary\u2019s dog trek to the Pole, to send his agents to Greenland to get the necessary number of dogs. When the Northwest Territories government heard about the project, it sent an officer to make sure that the dogs were returned after the expedition reached the Pole.</p> <p>The reason that there were no dogs in the Arctic, I was told, was because of the ubiquitous snowmobile. Most hunters used machines to hunt. However, as one veteran hunter told me, there was not much meat on a carburettor when you were caught in a whiteout at 50 below. The RCMP had their own dog teams that also gave way to machines.</p> <p>The RCMP was proud of its relationship with the Inuit people. However, they did make mistakes.

  "<p>Oscar was 16 when his cousin \u201csold\u201d him to the owner of an illegal gold mine deep in Peru\u2019s Amazonian jungle. Life in Madre de Dios \u2013 a huge encampment scarred by deforestation and mercury-filled pools \u2013 was dirty, desperate and dangerous: food and water were scarce; malaria and yellow fever were rampant; and trafficked girls as young as 12 worked as prostitutes in the surrounding bars.</p> <p>Business, however, was booming. Fuelled by the huge global demand for gold, thousands of miners like Oscar trawled over the hills with wheelbarrows and pickaxes, finding metal that would eventually pass through various intermediaries \u2013 from criminal groups to corrupt exporters to Swiss refineries \u2013 before ending up in a jewellery shop, a smartphone or even a central bank anywhere in the world.</p> <p>Gold is Peru\u2019s primary export, worth an estimated $3bn (\u00a32.3bn), yet violence, corruption, laundering and exploitation \u2013 including debt bondage, human trafficking and child labour \u2013 within the industry are rife across Latin America\u2019s illegal gold mines, according to a <a href=\"http://www.verite.org/sites/default/files/Verite-Report-Illegal_Gold_Mining.pdf\">report by fair labour NGO Verit\u00e9</a>.

Yet some of the world\u2019s most active paramilitary and organised crime groups are directly involved in the production and sale of this illegal gold, from the Farc guerrilla group in Colombia, to Mexico\u2019s Sinaloa cartel and Italy\u2019s \u2019Ndrangheta mafia, as well as Chinese, Brazilian and Russian syndicates. Illegally produced gold is laundered and exported with the help of corrupt officials, sent to refineries, melted down with legally produced and scrap gold, mixed to make alloys, then exported worldwide. Verit\u00e9\u2019s research found that 90% of the Fortune 500 companies that filed conflict mineral disclosures last year \u2013 in industries from telecoms and IT to car makers and machinery manufacturers \u2013 had purchased gold from refineries linked to illegally mined gold from Latin America.</p> <p>\u201cAmerica imports far more gold than many of these Latin American countries claim has even been mined,\u201d MacDonald said. \u201cUp to 87% of Colombia\u2019s gold exports \u2013 and 91% of Venezuela\u2019s \u2013 are illegally produced.

A movement to mine \u201cfairer\u201d gold already exists, yet Verit\u00e9 says some companies are using this to their advantage. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is that some Swiss refineries have stopped purchasing gold from these suppliers linked to illegal gold mining and human rights abuses,\u201d said MacDonald, \u201cand we\u2019ve seen US refineries coming in and \u2026 purchasing the gold instead, which is very worrying.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8450712c53b35eabe8c13f1f62909e624897d11a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8450712c53b35eabe8c13f1f62909e624897d11a/0_350_2956_1774/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An illegal gold mine encroaches into the Tambopata reserve in Peru\u2019s rainforest, 10 June 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An illegal gold mine encroaches into the Tambopata reserve in Peru\u2019s rainforest, 10 June 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Planet</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The US-based <a href=\"http://globalinitiative.net/\">Global Initiative against Transnational Organised Crime</a> (Gitoc) \u2013 <a href=\"http://globalinitiative.net/organized-crime-and-illegally-mined-gold-in-latin-america/\">which has also researched into illegal gold mines in Latin America</a> \u2013 claims the industry needs a massive slimming down to help clean up. </p> <p>\u201cFewer intermediaries in the supply chain will help regulate the industry,\u201d said Gitoc\u2019s Livia Wagner, who adds that exporting and importers need to look more closely at their supply chains and be held accountable for any discrepancies and abuses within them.</p> <p>For Oscar, who has contracted malaria, yellow fever and a fungal infection while working in Madre de Dios, there is no way out.

I am paying \u00a3620 a month for a box-room in a shared flat in Brixton, the same amount I would pay for a large three-bedroom terraced house in a leafy area of my hometown in Lancashire.

  "<p>Amazonian leaders, in Britain to protest against the construction of several large dams which they say will destroy the lives of thousands of indigenous people, will on Tuesday be shown head-dresses and other objects made by their tribe more than 150 years ago.</p> <p>The two chiefs of the Munduruku civilisation, which has flourished peacefully for centuries by fishing and farming along the banks of the great Tapaj\u00f3s river and its tributaries in the rainforests of central Brazil, will visit the massive storeroom of the British Museum in London, where a collection of 50 objects brought to Britain by a Victorian merchant are kept. </p> <p>\u201cThe Munduruku collection is particularly significant given that the majority of items are between 150 and 190 years old, and were therefore collected during the early period of contact between the Munduruku and Europeans. They are all in an astonishing state of preservation for objects of such great age,\u201d said a museum spokeswoman. </p> <p>The leaders have welcomed the museum visit but say that their people\u2019s future is now at stake. If the dams are built, said general chief Arnaldo Kaba Munduruku, they will destroy a way of life that has barely changed from the time that the British collector, Richard Carruthers, was living in Rio de Janeiro and exploring Brazil\u2019s interior. </p> <p>\u201cThe Tapaj\u00f3s valley is our supermarket, our church, our office, our school, our home, our life. We have been fighting to protect it for many years, and we will not give up. But it is not just our homes that are under threat. Many trees, animals and fish will be wiped out if the river is dammed and the valley is flooded,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Carruthers left Brazil in 1837 and his collection of objects was given to the museum in 1854. Since then, the Munduruku\u2019s contact with Europeans has been less than happy. Most recently, giant German technology company Siemens has provided equipment for several mega-dams which have had massive ecological effects in the Amazon.</p> <p>Until now, the Munduruku have tried to reason with the Brazilian government over the dams. Last year they invited Greenpeace to help them, and the focus is now on persuading the corporations and dam-builders not to enter the indigenous territories.

Altogether, 528 residents, 205 care home staff and 44 healthcare professionals took part in the research.</p> <p>We found that end-of-life interventions were characterised by uncertainty in three key areas: </p> <ol> <li>Which is the \u201cright\u201d treatment? </li> <li>Who should do what and when? </li> <li>In which setting should end-of-life care be delivered and by whom?</li> </ol> <p>Treatment uncertainty was an issue when a resident had been stable with no signs of decline, had previously recovered from a similar episode of ill health or when deterioration was protracted with periods of good health between episodes of ill health. </p> <p>It was further complicated by how quality of life was defined. Care home staff, residents and family members said it was about residents\u2019 ability to respond, engage with others and appreciate the home environment. For visiting primary care staff, it was linked to whether the intervention would lead to recovery of function or improvement.</p> <p>Even where an advance care plan had been put in place, these competing narratives of what a good outcome looked like could not always be resolved.</p> <p>When it came to who should do what when someone was dying, there was uncertainty about roles and responsibilities at both an organisational and an individual level.</p> <p>Decisions to treat were GP-led, but this was a complex process between care home staff, visiting healthcare professionals and families. Visiting GPs had the (clinical) authority to make key decisions about hospitalisation or treatments, but this was undermined by infrequent contact with, and partial knowledge of, residents.

  "<p>Gabon is 85% rainforest. Flying over the giant canopy, the miles pass without a glimpse of the forest floor.</p> <p>Then a bald patch emerges. In the clearing in Awala, which has become Africa\u2019s biggest industrial plantation, men in boots tend to thousands of small palm trees in long rows.</p> <p>They are setting the scene for palm oil production, which the government says is one of the best ways to tackle the country\u2019s terrible inequality.

Although there is growth, it is not necessarily inclusive. There is still a level of precariousness that we should absolutely fight.\u201d</p> <p>The need to diversify industry has grown more urgent as falling oil prices have slashed the country\u2019s income, with a knock-on effect on the poorest citizens.</p> <p>With a still relatively unskilled workforce, attracting foreign investment is key, according to the country\u2019s president, Ali Bongo Ondimba. His bold ambition is to <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2013/car022813c.htm\">turn Gabon into an emerging economy</a> by 2025.</p> <p>\u201cAli Bongo is very sharp and he could see that the difficulty with producing raw materials was that it doesn\u2019t create many jobs,\u201d says Paul Melly, an associate fellow at Chatham House. \u201cHis goal has been to move Gabon to a higher-tech, skilled economy.\u201d</p> <p>Bongo has signed deals worth $4.5bn with three Asian companies. One is Singapore-based Olam, which is developing 100,000 hectares (247,105 acres) of oil palm trees in Gabon. The company has also collaborated with the government to set up a 1,000 hectare special economic zone, in a 40-60% public-private partnership. The government offers special terms to any foreign firm willing to build inside the zone.</p> <p>There are no taxes or customs duties for the first 10 years. The zone offers fast-tracked documentation \u2013 you can create a company in 48 hours, or get an investor\u2019s visa in three days.</p> <p>The walled-off zone is in Nkok, just outside the capital, Libreville, on a road that is being rebuilt. Just inside the gate, two concrete panthers gaze down from a large replica of the national coat of arms.</p> <p>Warehouses containing logs, scrap metal and workers are inside the walls. Most of the land is empty, although it is a constant race against the forest to keep it so. Here, abandoned cars don\u2019t just sit and rust, they are swallowed by the jungle.</p> <p>Most of the warehouses are used to process timber \u2013 one of the country\u2019s main exports. However, Gabon has banned the export of raw logs to ensure materials are transformed in-country, to create more jobs.</p> <p>Many of the skilled jobs \u2013 in Nkok and on the plantations \u2013 are done by foreign workers while Gabonese are trained.</p> <p></p> <p>Bongo, who became president in 2009, has sought to distance himself from the legacy of his late father, Omar, who was president for 42 years and was accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/05/1\">squandering Gabon\u2019s oil wealth</a>.

In Mouila, in Gabon\u2019s south-west, a plantation meant a $1.5m monthly salary injection into what was previously a subsistence economy, according to Gupta.</p> <p>\u201cPutting money in is very easy,\u201d he says. \u201cThe more difficult bit is how you make a public-private partnership work. The government brings the ability to give investors ease of doing business. We bring technical experience. We bring credibility. When we go to the banks and say we\u2019re executing it, the banks are much more comfortable that if Olam is doing it, it\u2019ll get done.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the government does not bring, which helps us, is interference. About 6,000 people work in the extractive industry. And with us, you have about 9,000 people working in a project that\u2019s six years old. Olam and the government of Gabon have brought relevant contributions to this partnership and actually made a success [of it].\u201d</p> <p>However, big plantations like Olam\u2019s are a serious threat to biodiversity and rural populations, <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif2tXN_bjOAhUqCsAKHbOAAtYQFggeMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fern.org%2Fsites%2Ffern.org%2Ffiles%2FFW%2520181%2520April%25202013_0.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNE6HILyFtY3cv4-0Cpf-HyLsQgflw&amp;sig2=XVbX4ynfdM49q79LZuXQ-A&amp;cad=rja\">according to a 2013 report by Brainforest</a>, an environmental NGO in Gabon.</p> <p>Building up other industries to lower oil dependency could have taken other, more sustainable routes, Brainforest said.</p> <p>\u201cGabon is very dependent on other countries for its food. So their efforts to diversify away from oil should have been focused on planting food crops, so as to move towards self-sufficiency,\u201d says Brainforest\u2019s Protet Essono-Ondo. \u201cBut since 2009, the government has been focused on agribusiness, specifically palm oil and rubber, even though various studies have shown that people\u2019s priority is food crops and vegetables.\u201d</p> <p>Most of the jobs created were \u201cprecarious seasonal jobs, without any security or sustainability,\u201d says Essono-Ondo.</p> <p>He added there is not enough consultation about government initiatives to attract business, and the awarding of contracts is murky.</p> <p>Ultimately, Melly says, delivering results for the poorest will depend on how strong the government\u2019s willpower is, or the leverage donors can still exercise. \u201cIn other countries they can still strike a bargain, and if you\u2019re in Mali or Benin, you\u2019re not in a position to argue.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/17/kate-humble-value-food-not-expensive-enough\">Kate Humble</a> is looking for a husband, and I think she might have found one deep in the Welsh forests. Simon and his dog are rounding up rogue sheep who have escaped their flock and gone feral. He looks like a 19th-century bounty hunter \u2013 beefy, with braces and a mutton-chop beard, able to lift a huge sheep over one shoulder, no problem. \u201cThere\u2019s another potential husband,\u201d says Humble, twinkling. \u201cNot Simon, obviously. He\u2019s married. For Teg. Tango, I mean.\u201d Teg is Humble\u2019s dog; Tango belongs to Simon.</p> <p><strong>Kate Humble: My Sheepdog &amp; Me</strong> (BBC2) was a warming programme featuring farmhouses, glorious countryside and puppies. Two-year-old Teg is old enough to be a mum, and Humble \u2013 the most puppyish of TV presenters \u2013 hopes her pups will carry on the dwindling Welsh sheepdog line. Everyone knows the border collie, but there are about 20 breeds of herding dog and more than half of them are extinct. Welsh sheepdogs appear to be the best, but the people who rave about them are Welsh farmers, so they would say that.</p> <p>There isn\u2019t a uniform look to the breed \u2013 it\u2019s all about their behaviour \u2013 but Teg, says Humble, \u201clooks like a cross between David Bowie and Basil Brush\u201d, thanks to her different coloured eyes and shagginess (not that kind of shagginess \u2013 that comes later). She\u2019s supposed to be a working dog on Humble\u2019s Monmouthshire farm, but she\u2019s been allowed to become a sofa-dwelling, pampered pet. Humble needs to train her to get her recognised by the <a href=\"http://www.welshsheepdogsociety.com/\">Welsh Sheepdog Society</a>, but also in a more existential way, to fulfil her very nature. \u201cI feel I owe it not only to her but to the Welsh sheepdog as a breed,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ab1987673be91b1690ee0414b51db1ba9eb22422\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab1987673be91b1690ee0414b51db1ba9eb22422/0_88_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate's dog Teg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Teg, who Humble says looks like \u2018a cross between David Bowie and Basil Brush\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Morris/BBC/Tatu Pictures Ltd/Craig Morris</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They spend several weeks training together and Teg successfully herds some sheep into a trailer. She looks pleased with herself and gets a tummy rub. Now the test \u2013 can she impress the society? Of course she can. But it\u2019s not enough to act like a Welsh sheepdog. They tell Humble that because she doesn\u2019t know her dog\u2019s parentage, Teg can\u2019t be registered. Her puppies might become official, but only if they can herd sheep, too. They might prefer the sofa.</p> <p>Undeterred, Humble turns her attention to the subplot, ambling away in the background like a wandering sheep, which is to discover, with the help of Aberystwyth University, if the Welsh sheepdog has distinct genes \u2013 if herding is in its nature rather than nurture. And it is! Teg is 75% Welsh sheepdog and a quarter border collie. The news gets better \u2013 Tango is interested. Alas, Simon still appears to be married.</p> <p>Two months later, Teg gives birth to six puppies \u2013 tiny, soft, pink little things, like mewling marshmallows. If you\u2019re the sort of person who wells up at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/jan/10/one-born-every-minute\">One Born Every Minute</a> (and I am), it was a treat. Five of the puppies made it but one didn\u2019t, and the shot of just its miniature paws and neat, white-tipped tail, as peacefully still as its brother and sisters were energetic, was a mournful sight.</p> <p>There was little sentimentality in <strong>One Punch Killers</strong> (C5). The number of people killed by a single punch is rising, and this documentary followed the consequences: should a fatal punch be considered murder, or the unintended split-second actions of an idiotic thug? Watching this, I swung from one to the other. With immense magnanimity, Joan has become a kind of mentor to her son\u2019s killer, Jacob. The night he killed James Hodgkinson with a single blow was \u201cjust another fight, another weekend\u201d, he says. He served 14 months in prison and says Joan saved his life \u2013 he went back to school to get his GCSEs and A-levels, and is now doing a degree in criminology. He\u2019s a young man, clearly mortified at his mindless action, who is looking to spend the rest of his life trying to make up for it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed9a8e16b57f592f4e43440074264602177c3f23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed9a8e16b57f592f4e43440074264602177c3f23/0_147_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aaron Roach Bridgeman with Ann Bartlett\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aaron Roach Bridgeman (presenter) with mother Ann Bartlett, whose son Kyle was killed in a drunken fight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 5</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But then there\u2019s the man who killed Robert Holland. Robert\u2019s mother, Therese, is consumed with anger and sends messages to him on Facebook saying she hopes someone close to him is murdered one day so he can feel her pain. He never responds. That\u2019s because, we find out later, he\u2019s serving another prison sentence, this time for GBH. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute joke,\u201d says Therese. \u201cI thought he would have learned his lesson.\u201d</p> <p>It was presented by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ARoachBridgeman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Aaron Roach Bridgeman</a>, a performance poet and regular presenter on a youth TV channel, and this was aimed at a younger audience. He was a likeable, sympathetic guide \u2013 though I couldn\u2019t decide if he meant to keep referring to the light sentences for these manslaughter convictions as \u201ca slap in the face\u201d for the victims\u2019 families \u2013 but the film felt irritatingly superficial at times.</p> <p>It was the mothers who saved it. Most affecting of all was Ann, the mother of Kyle Bartlett who was killed in a drunken fight, who described turning off her son\u2019s life-support machine. She is a campaigner now, and must have told this story hundreds of times, but it can\u2019t have got any easier. The way she talked \u2013 so calm, and clear-eyed \u2013 was devastating.</p>",

It is important to work with organisers to produce schedules which meet their requirements which is what we have tried to achieve in this case.</p> <p>\u201cSpecifically with regard to the time allowed between the semi-final and final of the 100m, this has been the same in past Games where there was a world record (Atlanta).

A fairly insignificant news, you might say and normally you\u2019d be right, but defending champion Anna Meares finds herself slumming it along the also-rans having failed to qualify for the last eight. The Australian will leave Rio with a bronze from the keirin, her sixth Olympic medal in all. Whether or not this will be the 32-year-old great\u2019s last hurrah in an Olympic velodrome remains to be seen.\u201d </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b21005e4b0178756b5cfc9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/emmajohn\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-15T18:55:15.331Z\">7.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cDon\u2019t know if this is a regular occurrence in Rio but some sort of Monday Madness seems to be in play on the roads.

Sports broadcasters are often criticised for ignoring female athletes but so far this Olympics, NBC has devoted 58.5% of its coverage to events involving women. That doesn\u2019t quite make up for the inequality in nearly every other sports broadcast but it\u2019s perhaps exposes the old argument that people won\u2019t tune in to watch women\u2019s sport. There are a few reasons NBC has decided to go down this road - women\u2019s gymnastics is always a huge draw, particularly this year with the brilliant Simone Biles, while American women have excelled in the pool. Then there\u2019s the viewers themselves: NBC says 55% of its audience for the Olympics is female.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5892e76add16c1070f293734ce0e433eb414f20c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5892e76add16c1070f293734ce0e433eb414f20c/0_0_5184_3558/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yilin Fan begins the balance beam final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yilin Fan begins the balance beam final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lars Baron/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-15T18:56:18.417Z\">at 7.56pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b20df3e4b062ce4d223a39\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-15T18:49:04.905Z\">7.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So Fan Yilin starts, and looks nervous - she\u2019s a bit shaky on some of her landings, but does some very nice gear at the same time.

Now Katie Taylor, invincible at lightweight four years ago and considered Ireland\u2019s best hope of gold, has gone out at the quarter-final stage to Finland\u2019s Mira Potkonen. This succession of failures will doubtless be blamed on the loss of head coach Billy Walsh to the US team last autumn, which caused a huge furore.

These were in the rowing, for the coxless pairs and the 4s. These two gold medals were won on the same day in an hour, on August 13. I do believe that with Max Whitlock winning his two gold medals in gymnastics yesterday (almost exactly 84 years to the day!) he becomes the first GB athlete to win those consecutive golds on the same day since Hugh Edwards. I\u2019ve not seen it reported on at all \u2013 which is not too surprising as the story of Jumbo\u2019s exploits in 1932 are not well known, he is a lot more renowned for his coaching of Oxford in the 1950s and 60s.<br></p> <p> Here is a very short biography and his <a href=\"https://www.olympic.org/en/Home/News/News/2015/05/18/21/20/25/Jumbo%20rows%20to%20victory\">exploits as a Wing Commander in World War II and rowing through a minefield to save his life</a>.</p> <p>Jumbo\u2019s story is astounding, and his two gold medals (Britain only won 4 events in 1932) were not reported on back home \u2013 other than a brief mention beside the cricket results.

He didn\u2019t. Before the race began <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/usainbolt\">Usain Bolt</a> said that the only question in his head was whether he should take it easy in the 100m final so he could spare himself for the longer sprints next week. He has his heart set, you see, on trying to break the 19 second barrier in the 200m. The big worry, Bolt explained, wasn\u2019t that this plan might make him vulnerable to his fellow competitors, but rather that it may upset his public. \u201cShould I run the 100m just to win and save my energy for the 200m?\u201d he explained. \u201cIf I shut it down in the 100, will people be happy? I don\u2019t know.\u201d He shouldn\u2019t have worried. They love him what ever he does. And no one much minded that his time of 9.81sec was his slowest in an Olympic final, and short of his own superhuman standards.</p> <p>As Bolt said, \u201cit wasn\u2019t a perfect race, but the fact is that I won, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re all here for.\u201d The sad thing was the Olympic Stadium wasn\u2019t actually full. There were some conspicuous blue blotches of empty seats in the ends behind the bends, even after Bolt himself had urged his Twitter followers to buy up tickets. But it was as close to capacity as it is going to get. By six o\u2019clock, when the hills surrounding Engenho de Dentro, were backlit brilliant red by the sunset, the queue already wound round two sides of the stadium. More fans were pouring off every train and bus out from downtown. Once they were in, they roared their appreciation for each little thing he did, giving ovations to every wink and wag of his finger.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/15/ever-the-entertainer-usain-bolt-plays-conductor-to-olympic-orchestra\">Read the full story here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b16af9e4b0c23bfed8995b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-15T07:15:46.619Z\">8.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Every gold rush needs a spark right?</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/14/gb-max-whitlock-floor-gold-gymnastics-rio-olympics\">And Great Britain\u2019s yesterday was undoubtedly Max Whitlock</a>.

  "<p>As Labour nationally sinks into an internecine slough, it is easy to forget how emphatically it passed its biggest electoral test since the general election as recently as 5 May this year. Sadiq Khan\u2019s triumph over Conservative Zac Goldsmith strengthened Labour\u2019s dominance in the capital despite a heavily negative Tory campaign. </p> <p>In his first 100 days at City Hall, while assembling his team and pressing ahead with initiatives on policing, air quality and the workings of Transport for London (TfL), much of Khan\u2019s focus has been on lobbying the Conservative government for resources and devolved powers to nurture London\u2019s economy. </p> <p>The uncertainties caused by Brexit, which Khan strongly opposed, have added urgency to this: the prime minister, Theresa May, will be well aware that the UK depends heavily on London\u2019s generation of wealth and taxes. Khan, who said early in the election campaign that he intended to be \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/jan/09/london-mayor-race-the-new-labour-flavour-of-sadiq-khan\">the most business-friendly mayor of all time</a>\u201d, has responded to the EU referendum outcome by joining with the City of London and others in a campaign to demonstrate that \u201cLondon Is Open\u201d for global trade and visitors as before.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is now impossible to imagine anyone more suitable for his job</p> <footer> <cite>Evening Standard</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A backdrop of the shock of Brexit in a city that voted 60% to remain and Labour\u2019s turmoil under Jeremy Corbyn may have enhanced Khan\u2019s honeymoon, with even the Evening Standard, which facilitated many of the Goldsmith campaign\u2019s attacks, declaring in a recent feature that it is now \u201cimpossible to imagine anyone more suitable\u201d for his job. </p> <p>Claims that Khan, an observant Muslim and former civil rights lawyer, had provided, in Goldsmith\u2019s word, \u201ccover\u201d to Islamist fanatics in the past, now seem as shrill as they had felt menacing at the time. Apart from calling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/10/sadiq-khan-i-dont-want-ignorant-donald-trump-to-make-me-an-exception\">Donald Trump\u2019s view of Islam ignorant</a> and being the star speaker at the annual Eid event in Trafalgar Square, Khan\u2019s religion has become a background theme. Addressing the Pride in London parade and giving senior jobs to women have underlined his social liberalism. A self-declared \u201cproud feminist\u201d, he has announced an end to \u201cbody\u2013shaming\u201d adverts on the Tube and bus network. </p> <p>Soon he will need bigger achievements. This Friday\u2019s launch of a 24-hour service on two of London\u2019s underground lines is a delayed Boris Johnson policy. Khan\u2019s new \u201chopper\u201d bus fare, which will allow passengers two journeys for the price of one within a 60-minute window, will start in September, though Khan has faced claims that his pledge to freeze public transport fares for four years was misleading, as it will not, as things stand, apply to travelcards, whose prices are set by the Department for Transport. More detail about his affordable housing plans is awaited, and Londoners will soon be looking for evidence of solid progress in all key policy areas. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/aug/15/sadiq-khans-first-100-days-london-mayor-brexit\">Sure-footed start but trials ahead: Sadiq Khan's first 100 days as London mayor</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Devolution</strong></h2> <p>Khan is seeking more control for the mayoralty and London\u2019s local authorities over investment in housing and transport, the running of health and social care services, skills and further education, property taxes and suburban rail services in order to use the capital\u2019s resources better. He has revived Johnson\u2019s London Finance Commission to look at further powers that might be devolved. Khan has demanded a seat for London at the Brexit negotiations, stressing the importance of continued full access to the European single market. He likes the idea of a London-only work visa for migrant workers. </p> <h2><strong>Housing</strong></h2> <p>Khan\u2019s choice of housing chief, James Murray, perturbed some commercial developers, housing associations and even other Labour boroughs, who saw the former Islington councillor as an oppositional left hardliner. However, Murray has been bringing his grasp of London\u2019s complex housing equations to bear on the practicalities of delivering more \u201cgenuinely affordable\u201d homes to rent or buy \u2013 a forthcoming more stringent definition of \u201caffordable\u201d than used by Johnson or the government \u2013 and building bridges across the housing sector.</p> <p>A manifesto goal of making 50% of all new homes \u201cgenuinely affordable\u201d has been mildly finessed into a \u201clong-term strategic target\u201d and Khan has so far declined to set a straight numerical target. But an intervention in the vast Old Oak redevelopment scheme in the west of the city to increase the affordable element planned there showed intent, and he is eager to get building on public land, notably sites owned by TfL.

Shawcross is a champion of public transport \u2013 especially the somewhat neglected bus service \u2013 and understands the complex, some say opaque, finances of TfL, which Khan wants overhauled. </p> <h2><strong>Policing and security</strong></h2> <p>Khan countered campaign claims such as that by the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, that he was unfit to be mayor at a time of terrorist threat because he had in the past criticised British foreign policy, by proclaiming himself \u201cthe British Muslim who will take the fight to the extremists\u201d. He has welcomed the forthcoming increase in armed police patrolling London. In line with a pledge to strengthen community policing, he has vowed to introduce a second dedicated beat constable to each of London\u2019s 629 electoral wards by the end of 2017. </p> <h2><strong>Air pollution</strong></h2> <p>A consultation has been conducted on proposals for reducing the number of polluting vehicles driving in London, which has serious air quality problems. Khan has already been bolder than Johnson, producing plans that include extending and bringing forward implementation of the central London ultra low emission zone. This has pleased environmentalists, though they will watch carefully to see how far he eventually goes.</p>",
  "<p>Veganism is not the simple solution to sustainability that George Monbiot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/09/vegan-corrupt-food-system-meat-dairy\">recently argued</a>.

Research suggests otherwise. An <a href=\"https://www.elementascience.org/articles/116/tabs/article_info\">investigation published in the US</a> last month compared 10 different eating patterns and <a href=\"http://qz.com/749443/being-vegan-isnt-as-environmentally-friendly-as-you-think/\">concluded</a> that diets incorporating some animal-source foods (especially milk and eggs) use less land than their vegan alternative. </p> <p>This is because more inclusive diets make optimal use of all existing land to feed people. That includes croplands and rangelands where grain and hay can be grown to feed livestock. A lot of meat and milk that would remain unproductive in a vegan context is produced on these marginal rangelands. For example, 60% of sub-Saharan Africa is <a href=\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/586291468193771160/pdf/105197-WP-PUBLIC-PUBDATE-5-16-2016.pdf\">covered by drylands</a> where raising livestock is the main, and often the only, land use option available.</p> <p>Decades of research <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2001GB001661/abstract\">have shown</a> that medium levels of livestock grazing, rather than none at all, are better for the health, productivity and biodiversity of these rangelands. When managed well, such areas also <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3437e/i3437e00.htm\">sequester large amounts of carbon</a> in their soils. </p> <p>People in high-income countries could do much to reduce their dietary impact on the world. They could moderate their intake of all foods and reducing the amount they waste, for example. <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-first-comprehensive-look-at-global-food-waste-is-as-bad-as-you-d-expect/?CID=AGR_TT_agriculture_EN_EXT\">Food waste</a> accounts for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jan/10/half-world-food-waste\">up to 50% of total production</a> globally and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/26/world-leaders-urged-to-tackle-food-waste-to-save-billions-and-cut-emissions\">7% of total greenhouse gas emissions</a>.<br></p> <p>Above all, livestock are essential to many of the world\u2019s poorest people and can\u2019t simply be cast aside. In low- and middle-income economies, where livestock account for <a href=\"ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/010/a0701e/a0701e07.pdf\">40-60% of agricultural GDP</a>, farm animals provide livelihoods for almost <a href=\"http://www.livestockdialogue.org/fileadmin/templates/res_livestock/docs/2014_Colombia/2014_Towards_Sustainable_Livestock-dec.pdf\">1 billion people</a>, many of whom are <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2744e/i2744e00.pdf\">women</a>. Cows, goats, sheep, pigs and poultry are scarce assets for these people, bringing in regular household income, and can be sold in emergencies to pay for school or medical fees. For those who would otherwise have to subsist largely on cheap grains and tubers \u2013 risking malnutrition and stunted children \u2013 livestock can provide energy-dense, micronutrient-rich food. Animal-source foods are especially important for <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/immpact/micronutrients/\">pregnant women, babies in their first 1,000 days of life, and young children</a>.</p> <p>When so many lives and livelihoods depend on these animals, should we really envision a scenario where an African household is denied the chance to raise a few chickens or a couple of stall-fed dairy cows? Or an Asian family is prevented from keeping a dozen pigs on a tiny plot? Or pastoralists are prevented from herding goats, sheep and cattle across drylands?</p> <p>Like any other sector, livestock production faces challenges. It is a big user of water and other natural resources, and its greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change. Moreover, <a href=\"http://www.livestockdialogue.org/fileadmin/templates/res_livestock/docs/2014_Colombia/2014_Towards_Sustainable_Livestock-dec.pdf\">overconsumption</a> of animal-source foods can lead to obesity and ill health; many human infectious diseases originate in livestock and other animals.

Thank you.</p> <h2>The big picture</h2> <p>Uncertainty and confusion \u2013 so what\u2019s new? \u2013 reigned again last week, over what form Brexit might take and when it might happen. The government is reportedly still more than a year away from even beginning the actual exit process. </p> <p>What with a Westminster turf war (see below) and the complete absence of any prep work for the referendum outcome, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-timing-idUSKCN10O0Y9\">the Sunday Times</a> said, the situation was so chaotic that ministers are not now envisaging starting formal two-year exit talks until late next year, delaying the UK\u2019s exit until the end of 2019.</p> <p>The two new government departments created to handle Brexit and the multiple highly complex new trade deals Britain needs to negotiate are far from being fully functional, lacking basic office infrastructure \u2013 and most of their staff.</p> <p>David Davis\u2019s Department for Exiting the European Union did <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/545007/Department_for_Exiting_the_EU_-_Senior_Management_Team.pdf\">publish details of its senior management team last week</a> but has so far made only 110 of its 250 planned hires, while Liam Fox\u2019s Department for International Trade has fewer than 100 of the 500-plus negotiators it is seeking. </p> <p>Besides the critical question of Britain\u2019s readiness (or not) to trigger article 50, delaying the fatal moment until the end of next year would also \u2013 with Dutch, French and German elections all coming up \u2013 mean the government at least knows who else will be round the negotiating table. </p> <p>And the growing frustration of assorted pro-Brexiters notwithstanding, a longer delay in triggering article 50 would be no bad thing \u2013 because the UK is still nowhere near working out what kind of trade model with Europe it should seek. </p> <p>Norway dropped a bit of a bombshell on that front, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/norway-may-block-uk-return-to-european-free-trade-association\">raising serious questions about the feasibility</a> of one option for single market membership that was widely touted in the pro-Brexit camp running up to the referendum.</p> <p>As a member of the <a href=\"http://www.efta.int/\">European Free Trade Association</a>, Norway is part of the single market without being a member of the EU. But Elisabeth Vik Aspaker, its European affairs minister, told Aftenposten: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s not certain that it would be a good idea to let a big country into this organisation. It would shift the balance, which is not necessarily in Norway\u2019s interests. </p> </blockquote> <p>Canadian officials, too, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/brexit-canada-trade-deal-eu-model-next-steps\">have confessed they are at a loss to understand</a> why their country\u2019s 1,600-page agreement with Brussels, which took seven full years to negotiate, should be seen as a potential blueprint in London:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t understand [the Canada deal] as the answer to Brexit when the British will be taking a 43-year step backwards in terms of the current access they have to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\">European Union</a>. </p> </blockquote> <p>Whatever trade model Britain does eventually manage to agree with Europe, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), one of the country\u2019s leading thinktanks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/10/uk-membership-european-single-market-worth-4-more-gdp-eu-referendum-economy\">left no one in any doubt as to what it thought would be best for the economy</a>. </p> <p>Britain could of course enjoy the same sort of access to the EU\u2019s single market on the same World Trade Organisation terms as other non-EU member states such as the US, China or India, the IFS said \u2013 but full membership of the single market is worth an additional 4% of GDP to the economy. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cdd3ab53693e048e9254140fc517b5a184966ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cdd3ab53693e048e9254140fc517b5a184966ee/0_0_5422_3615/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Canary Wharf in London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Canary Wharf in London.

Ian Mitchell, the report\u2019s author, warned bluntly: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We still face some very big choices indeed in terms of our future relationship with the EU. There is all the difference in the world between \u2018access to\u2019 and \u2018membership of\u2019 the single market.</p> </blockquote> <p>Thankfully, though, the chancellor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/13/philip-hammond-treasury-to-guarantee-post-brexit-funding-for-eu-backed-projects\">Philip Hammond, reassured everyone who currently receives EU funding</a> that they will not \u2013 for the time being, anyway \u2013 lose out as a result of the referendum vote. <br></p> <p>Hammond said government would guarantee billions of pounds for current and pending scientific research, agricultural subsidies and \u2013 as long as they are agreed before the autumn statement \u2013 structural and investment projects . </p> <p>Campaigners including <a href=\"http://scientistsforeu.uk/2016/08/press-release-philip-hammond-guarantees-eu-funding/\">Scientists for EU welcomed the announcement but said it was a stopgap measure</a> that covered \u201cthe bare essentials, and no more\u201d. Longer term measures would be complex and critical, they added: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After that, we must tackle the longer term issues of immigration policies, shared infrastructure and regulations, national funding, and the future relationship of the UK with the EU science programmes.</p> </blockquote> <h2>The view from Europe</h2> <p>It\u2019s August. Europe is on holiday. But a former Danish foreign minister popped up to warn \u2013 as the man who negotiated Greenland\u2019s departure from the EU after it gained autonomy from Denmark and voted to leave in 1982 \u2013 that Brexit would not be a walk in the park. <br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-09/brexit-timeline-illusions-exposed-in-unusual-tale-of-greenland\">Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, now 74, told Bloomberg</a> it took Greenland, which has a population of 56,000, only one real industry (fishing) and whose laws, customs and institutions were barely entwined with the EU\u2019s at all, three years to get out: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Negotiating Greenland\u2019s exit was a fairly simple task that resulted in a relatively simple and easy to understand protocol. Britain will take much longer; it\u2019s impossible to say how long. Basically, the British need to understand what an enormous task they took upon themselves.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Meanwhile, back in Westminster</h2> <p>There\u2019s trouble at Brexit Towers and it\u2019s not just a squabble over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/18/boris-johnson-forced-to-share-mansion-with-liam-fox-and-david-davis\">use of the Chevening mansion</a> shared by foreign secretary Boris Johnson, Fox and Davis. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/14/liam-fox-attempt-wrest-control-foreign-office-duties-boris-johnson\">Fox made an audacious power grab</a> to bring key parts of the Foreign Office (FCO) remit under the umbrella of his new department, asking Johnson and the prime minister, Theresa May, for a restructuring to give him responsibility for economic diplomacy \u2013 a move given short shrift by No 10 and the FCO, which has nonetheless agreed to second some expert staff to the new department. </p> <p>That capped off an embarrassing week for Fox\u2019s department. On Friday, it hastily removed from its website a press release published \u201cin error\u201d that appeared to announce that the UK would still trade with the EU under WTO rules after leaving the bloc, \u201cuntil any new trade deals are negotiated\u201d. <br></p> <p>Economists quickly pointed out that such a move would be hugely damaging for businesses, who would be subject to steep tariffs on goods exported to the EU \u2013 including a 10% duty on cars and 12% on clothing \u2013 and would have no access to the EU\u2019s service or financial service markets. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn remains streets ahead in nominations for the Labour party leadership, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/15/jeremy-corbyn-wins-backing-84-per-cent-local-labour-parties\">taking 84% of local party nominations</a> and endorsements from the UK\u2019s two largest unions. </p> <p>One group whose support he has not won, however, is the Labour Movement for Europe, chaired by the former party leader Neil Kinnock.

Because of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.co.uk/business/2015/may/21/temporary-and-part-time-jobs-surge-promotes-inequality-says-oecd\" rel=\"nofollow\">rise in temporary contracts</a>, the UK also provides less on-the-job training. \u201cThis means employees feel less valued and, because workers aren\u2019t as well-trained, the overall productivity and efficiency of the workforce drops,\u201d adds Polaski.<br></p> <p>The resulting lack of job security leads to unproductive workers, argues neuroscientist and productivity coach Magdalena Bak-Maier. \u201cUnderneath the statistics, there is a sense of uncertainty and fear. People feel insecure in terms of their employment and low wages. And it\u2019s a fundamental fear \u2013 if you have people worried about paying their bills next month, they are not going to be able to concentrate on the job.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/16/zero-hours-banned-new-zealand-unite-union-mcdonalds-sports-direct-hermens-deliveroo\">Yes, zero hours work can be banned: New Zealand has just done it | Aditya Chakrabortty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So what should companies be doing to boost productivity? One way is for managers to encourage flexible styles of working.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://hrweb.mit.edu/system/files/all/worklife/flexible_work_arrangements.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</a> showed that after six months of giving people the option to work from home, employee productivity significantly increased, while stress decreased. \u201cBut this boost only worked when employers also gave workers more autonomy over their time \u2013 for example, not requiring them to log in at a certain time or tell their boss what they\u2019re doing. That kind of big brother control can be highly draining,\u201d adds Bak-Maier.<br></p> <p>Obviously, this new kind of working requires a lot of trust from bosses. At the moment there\u2019s such fear from managers that people will use the time badly, says Bak-Maier. \u201cBut in the UK as productivity is plummeting, we desperately need a culture shift. Companies need to put the focus on results, not presenteeism.\u201d</p> <p>Office design may also be harming UK productivity. \u201cOffices are set up by extroverts for extroverts; they don\u2019t cater for people who need quiet places to focus,\u201d says Graham Allcott, founder of Think Productive. Again allowing flexible working policies \u2013 such as the ability to work from home \u2013 is one way to enable people to choose the most productive working environment for them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/27/britons-working-longer-hours-with-no-gain-in-productivity-study-finds\">Britons working longer hours with no gain in productivity, study finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The UK could learn a thing or two from Sweden, where a retirement home in Gothenburg trialled a <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/six-hour-working-day-sweden-boosts-productivity-and-makes-people-happier-a7023741.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">six-hour working day</a>.

Allcott says this may be because staff who worked shorter shifts spent less time socialising: \u201cThey knew at the end of their shift they\u2019d have time for socialising in the evening. So there was more separation between work and social time than we have in the UK.\u201d<br></p> <p>Overall, productivity is a question of keeping people motivated, says Irene Wennemo, state secretary to Sweden\u2019s minister for employment. \u201cMost of labour market policy has focused on the whip \u2013 the idea that if you are whipping people, for example increasing workload and putting people under pressure, then they will do more at work. But the whip doesn\u2019t work anymore.\u201d<br></p> <p>Though companies may think they want cheap, disposable workers, having permanent employees who are paid fairly, given autonomy and engaged in improving the company will help productivity, efficiency and profits in the long term.<br></p> <p>\u201cThat was the formula for success during many successful economic decades since world war two. And it\u2019s the formula for the future,\u201d says Polaski.</p> <p><strong>Looking for a job?

  "<p>Ruddy-faced tourists in beige shorts, cherry gateaux and lots of trees. Those were my, admittedly limited, expectations of the Black Forest. What I didn\u2019t anticipate was hurtling down a hillside on a go-kart. Just getting to the Hasenhorn Coaster is an adventure. A chairlift transported us to the top, and while my partner took selfies in the chair behind, I was focusing very hard on trying to enjoy the scenery and not think about my six-year-old son slipping under the safety bar and falling to the ground below. Speeding down the coaster\u2019s 2.9km looping track on a go-kart was much less alarming than dangling 30ft above it, so much so that when I got to the bottom I wanted another go.</p> <p>A rectangle of land about 200km long and 60km wide in the south-west corner of Germany, the Black Forest region isn\u2019t a huge area, but the diversity and beauty of its landscape have made it one of the most popular holiday destinations among Germans. Many come for the hiking \u2013 this is the place that claims to have invented hiking for pleasure, when Philipp Bussemer from Baden Baden opened the first tourist information centre in 1864. A century and a half later, 23,000km of walking trails are signposted across its forests, meadows, vineyards and lakesides.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6a57a1560e90e872542320948921b4fbfaf73ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6a57a1560e90e872542320948921b4fbfaf73ba/0_38_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Black Forest go-kart\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 2.9km-long Hasenhorn go-kart coaster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In another sporting precedent, it established the first ski club in central Europe in 1891, and now boasts 250km of downhill slopes and 1,700km of cross-country trails. In summer the hills and forests are alive with the sound of mountain bikers on its dedicated 8,000km of trails. Then there are the activity parks and climbing. The lakes, including the largest, Schluchsee, and Titisee, offer yet more ways to enjoy the natural environment - from Schluchsee\u2019s lido with a giant slide into the lake, to kayaking, canoeing and sailing. In short, the Black Forest is a giant adventure playground. Active fun is in its DNA.</p> <p>Despite this giddy array of activities, the region\u2019s reputation in the UK as a walking destination means it\u2019s not a natural choice for British families. Yet you\u2019d be hard pushed to find a better-value family activity holiday. For one thing, more than 350 hotels, campsites and apartments in the region offer guests staying two nights or more a <a href=\"http://www.hochschwarzwald.de/Card\">Hochschwarzwald Card</a> giving free access to over 70 attractions. Second, Germans are the masters of the child-friendly hotel. We stayed at the Feldberger Hof at the base of Mount Feldberg, which, while not part of the well-known <a href=\"http://www.kinderhotel.de/\">kinderhotel.de</a> network, could not have been more kinder-oriented. Some might argue that it is too kinder-oriented. My partner took one look at the swarm of small children milling about the reception on our arrival and said he needed a drink. At 11am. Further exploration of the hotel \u2013 with its indoor play area, buffet meals, daily programme of fun games and singalongs, and staff with their Happy Team badges \u2013 made it feel like we were trapped in a giant soft-play centre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eec269ebbae83676012a33c0e44c68ecf2a1342d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eec269ebbae83676012a33c0e44c68ecf2a1342d/0_381_1076_646/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The writer\u2019s son on a bug hunt in the Black Forest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The writer\u2019s son on a bug hunt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isabel Choat/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But other guests weren\u2019t as cynical. Most parents we spoke to \u2013 both English and German \u2013 were booked in for a full week, many on repeat visits, and raved about the place; and naturally our son thought it was brilliant. He loved the play area, the pool and waterslide, and the fact that there was a ready supply of kids his age to play with. Not speaking the same language was no barrier to instant friendship. For us, the best thing about it was what lay outside.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1a42157877afaeccafb6de25adac9f00e858e530\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a42157877afaeccafb6de25adac9f00e858e530/0_40_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Prime hiking country in the Black Country\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prime hiking country\u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The hotel is located in the Hochschwarzwald, or the High Black Forest, at the foot of the region\u2019s highest peak, the 1,493m Feldberg. A cable car takes you to the top for views across the Feldberg massif and, on a clear day, the Alps beyond. Directly behind the hotel is Kletterwald, a sprawling treetop obstacle course. Sadly, driving rain and fog meant that this was closed. Instead, we ducked in to the <a href=\"http://www.blackforest-tourism.com/Media/Attraktionen/House-of-Nature\">House of Nature</a> opposite the hotel, with displays about the local wildlife and culture, and a virtual hot air balloon ride. There we met head ranger Achim Laber for a guided walk of the Witchelpfad, a new trail where children follow clues along a mile-long forest path bordered by blueberry bushes in search of the capercaillie bird, via displays of gnome-like creatures and their dwellings. A keen hiker, Achim devised the path while remembering how difficult it had been to motivate his own children to go on walks. It worked for our son, who was happy to skip through the damp forest in search of tiny doors built into the trees, fairies and a model fox in his den.</p> <p>The next day we headed to Spasspark, where little kids can ride giant tyres down a fake grass slope and jump on a large, bouncy dome. That afternoon we walked from picturesque St Blasien-Menzenschwand \u2013 a traditional village of slopey-roofed, timber-framed houses sprouting red geraniums under every window, and famed for its domed cathedral \u2013 to a waterfall, past fields of wild flowers, a goat farm and hillsides thick with fir trees. Again we were grateful for a distraction for my son, in the form of a rucksack hired from the tourist office (\u20ac5) and packed with everything a mini explorer might need. He threw himself into trapping insects in his plastic jar with such vim he barely noticed he was being made to use his legs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4bd3bcbda0e6d4908fd1326b171c0652e704c026\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bd3bcbda0e6d4908fd1326b171c0652e704c026/0_48_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black Forest woodland trail\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Witchelpfad Naturpark.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hochschwarzwald Tourismus GmbH</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If the Black Forest was forward thinking when it came to outdoor tourism, nowadays the focus is on preserving its past. The entire area is so steeped in tradition it almost feels frozen in time, with barely a modern blot on the landscape. The <a href=\"http://www.hirschen-fischbach.de/\">Hirschen Gasthof</a>, a restaurant with rooms 3km from Lake Schluchsee, is a classic example. While the wooden interior is arguably more modern than most, we were greeted by a woman dressed in a dirndl. Its designation as a \u201cnature park inn\u201d requires it to offer at least three regional dishes and use local ingredients, so the menu is heavy on rich, meaty dishes like pork fillet rolls stuffed with ham and cheese, venison medallions and smoked duck. Those 19th-century hikers might never have predicted that the tourists of the future would be squealing down hillsides on go-karts, but they would have surely approved that they refuel on such traditional hearty fare.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The trip was provided by </em><em><a href=\"http://www.hochschwarzwald.de/\">Hochschwarzwald tourism office</a>. </em><em>A two-bedroom family<a href=\"http://www.hochschwarzwald.de/\"> </a></em><em>apartment at the Feldberger Hof hotel (</em><a href=\"https://www.feldberger-hof.de/en/startpage/startpage.html\"><em>feldberger-hof.de</em></a><em>) costs \u20ac262 per night half-board for two adults and one child.

  "<p>The Republican party, its leaders like to say, is a party of ideas. Debates over budgets and government programmes are important, but they must be conducted with an eye on the bigger questions \u2013 questions about the character of the state, the future of freedom and the meaning of virtue. These beliefs provide the foundation for a conservative intellectual establishment \u2013 thinktanks such as the American Enterprise Institute, magazines such as National Review, pundits such as George Will and Bill Kristol \u2013 dedicated to advancing the right\u2019s agenda.</p> <p>Over the last year, that establishment has been united by one thing: opposition to Donald Trump. Republican voters may have succumbed to a temporary bout of collective insanity \u2013 or so Trump\u2019s critics on the right believe \u2013 but the party\u2019s intelligentsia remain certain that entrusting the Republican nomination to a reality television star turned populist demagogue has been a disaster for their cause and their country. Whatever Trump might be, he is not a conservative.</p> <p>That belief is comforting, but it is wrong. Trump is a unique character, but the principles he defends and the passions he inflames have been part of the modern American right since its formation in the aftermath of the second world war. Most conservative thinkers have forgotten or repressed this part of their history, which is why they are undergoing a collective nervous breakdown today.

Posts analysing the campaign with titles such as The Twilight of Jeb! alternated with more ambitious forays in philosophy such as Paleo-Straussianism, Part I: Metaphysics and Epistemology. More intellectually demanding than the typical National Review article, the style of their prose also suggested writers who were having fun. Disquisitions on Aristotle could be followed by an emoji mocking the latest outraged responses to Trump.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/sep/02/the-dark-history-of-donald-trumps-rightwing-revolt-podcast\">The dark history of Donald Trump's rightwing revolt \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The authors at JAG were not all backing Trump himself \u2013 officially, they were \u201celectorally agnostic\u201d \u2013 but they were united by their enthusiasm for Trumpism (as they put it, \u201cfor what Trumpism could become if thought through with wisdom and moderation\u201d). They dismissed commentators who attributed Trump\u2019s victory to his celebrity, arguing that a campaign could not resonate with so many voters unless it spoke to genuine public concerns.</p> <p>JAG condensed Trumpism into three key elements: economic nationalism, controlled borders and a foreign policy that put American interests first.</p> <p>These policies, they asserted, were a direct challenge to the views of America\u2019s new ruling class \u2013 a cosmopolitan elite of wealthy professionals who controlled the commanding heights of public discourse. This new ruling class of \u201ctransnational post-Americans\u201d was united by its belief that the welfare of the world just happened to coincide with programmes that catered to its own self-interest: free trade, open borders, globalisation and a suite of other policies designed to ease the transition to a post-national future overseen by enlightened experts. In the language of JAG, they are the \u201cDavoisie\u201d, a global elite that is most at ease among its international peers at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/21/-sp-davos-guide-world-economic-forum\">World Economic Forum</a> in Davos and totally out of touch with ordinary Americans.</p> <p>Mainstream conservatives and their liberal counterparts were equally complicit in sustaining this regime, but JAG focused its attention on the right. Leading Republican politicians and the journalists who fawned over them in the rightwing press were pedlars of an \u201cintellectually bankrupt\u201d doctrine whose obsessions \u2013 cutting taxes, policing sexual norms, slashing government regulation \u2013 distracted from \u201cthe fundamental question\u201d Trump had put on the agenda: \u201cdestruction of the soulless managerial class\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A dissenting minority has been waging a guerrilla war against the conservative establishment for three decades</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>JAG unleashed salvo after salvo against \u201cConservatism Inc\u201d, the network of journals and thinktanks that, along with talk radio and Fox News, has made defending the party of ideas into a lucrative career path. \u201cIf Trump ends up destroying the Republican party,\u201d they wrote, \u201cit is because the Republican party, as it exists today, is little more than a jobs programme for failed academics and journalists.\u201d</p> <p>News of JAG began circulating on the right shortly after its debut early in the primary season. \u201cThe first time I heard someone refer to it, I thought it was a joke,\u201d says former George W Bush speechwriter David Frum. But it quickly found an audience. \u201cThey got a huge response almost immediately,\u201d says conservative activist Chris Buskirk, who recalled excited emails and frantic texting among his colleagues. In June, the Wall Street Journal columnist and former Ronald Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan alerted her readers to the \u201csophisticated, rather brilliant and anonymous website\u201d. A link from the popular rightwing website Breitbart News drove traffic even higher, and JAG seemed poised to shape the discussion over the future of conservatism.</p> <p>Then it disappeared. Months of posts, totalling more than 175,000 words, were scrubbed from the internet, replaced by <a href=\"http://journalofamericangreatness.blogspot.co.uk/\">a note labelling the site an \u201cinside joke\u201d </a>that had spiralled out of control. Within the right, rumours swirled about the real motives behind the vanishing act; fans of JAG took its self-immolation as further evidence that the conservative establishment would not tolerate any dissent. But the brief life of the Journal of American Greatness did more than provide grist for feverish speculation on Twitter. Patrolling the boundaries of acceptable thought on the right has always been one of the central duties of the conservative intellectual, and JAG\u2019s voluntary purging was the latest chapter in a long battle to define the meaning of conservatism.</p> <p>Conservatives tend to portray their cause as the child of a revolt against the liberal status quo that began in the aftermath of the second world war, gained momentum in the 1950s when a cohort of intellectuals supplied the right with its philosophical underpinning, attained political consciousness in Barry Goldwater\u2019s 1964 presidential campaign, and won vindication with Ronald Reagan\u2019s election to the White House. Ideas have consequences, they proclaimed. Just look at us.</p> <p>But there is another way of interpreting the history of the American right, one that puts less emphasis on the power of ideas and more on power itself \u2013 a history of white voters fighting to defend their place in the social hierarchy, politicians appealing to the prejudices of their constituents so they can satisfy the wishes of their donors, and the industry that has turned conservatism into a billion-dollar business.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"ae7d7b44419c18020b88dc87a97c874e7ed3802a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae7d7b44419c18020b88dc87a97c874e7ed3802a/0_168_5100_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"White segregationist demonstrators protesting at the admission of the Little Rock Nine, to Central High School, 1959\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">White segregationist demonstrators protesting in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1959.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal History Archive/UIG via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is the explanation preferred by leftwing critics, who typically regard the Republican party as a coalition fuelled by white nationalism and funded by billionaires. But this line of attack also has a long history on the right, where a dissenting minority has been waging a guerrilla war against the conservative establishment for three decades. Now the unlikely figure of Donald Trump has brought in a wave of reinforcements \u2013 over 13 million in the primaries alone. Their target is the managerial elite, and their history begins in the run-up to the second world war, when a forgotten founder of modern American conservatism became a public sensation with a book that announced the dawning of a civilisation ruled by experts.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The Managerial Revolution: What Is Happening in the World was the most unlikely bestseller of 1941. The author, James Burnham, was a philosophy professor at New York University who until the previous year had been one of Leon Trotsky\u2019s most trusted counsellors in the US. Time called Burnham\u2019s work a grim outline of \u201cthe totalitarian world soon to come\u201d that was \u201cas morbidly fascinating as a textbook vivisection\u201d.</p> <p>The son of a wealthy railway executive, Burnham graduated near the top of his class in Princeton in 1927 before studying at Oxford and then securing his post at NYU. But the Great Depression radicalised him, and he began a double life, lecturing on Aquinas by day and polemicising against capital by night. By 1940, Burnham had lost his faith in the revolution of the proletariat. While Trotsky denounced his erstwhile disciple as an \u201ceducated witch doctor\u201d, Burnham started work on the book that would justify his apostasy.</p> <p>According to Burnham, Marxists were right to anticipate capitalism\u2019s imminent demise but wrong about what would come next. Around the turn of the 20th century, he claimed, the scale of life had changed. Population growth surged, immense corporations gobbled up smaller rivals, and government officials struggled to expand their powers to match the growing size of the challenges they faced.</p> <p>These structural changes fundamentally altered the distribution of power in society. In the 18th century, authority had rested with aristocrats; in the 19th century with capitalists; in the 20th century it had passed on to the managers, whose authority derived from their unique ability to operate the complex institutions that now dominated mass society.</p> <p>Technocrats had become the new ruling class. According to Burnham, fascism, Stalinism and Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal were all products of this transformation, and there was no use struggling against the world that was coming into being \u2013 a world where state ownership of the means of production had become the norm, where sovereignty had shifted to a bureaucratic elite, and where the globe was divided into rival superstates.</p> <p>Burnham was not the first to foresee a society run by managers, but the arguments he borrowed from others took on a different meaning when brought together in this form. His sweep was global, his narrative reached back centuries, and he almost seemed to welcome a totalitarian future. For Burnham, the only sensible response to the managerial revolution was to recognise that it had occurred and accept there was no point in trying to bring back a world that was already lost. This bleak forecast captured the public imagination. Fortune called it \u201cthe most debated book published so far this year\u201d and it went on to sell more than 200,000 copies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"aa3e0ba00d4ccf09fa0677b95894a780e68dac59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa3e0ba00d4ccf09fa0677b95894a780e68dac59/0_115_1992_1195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard C Levin with William F Buckley Jr, Yale University, 2000\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">William F Buckley Jr collects an honorary doctorate from Yale University, 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bob Child/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Burnham quickly moved on to new territory. His true subject, he concluded, was power, and to understand power he needed a theory of politics. Marx had been his guiding influence in The Managerial Revolution; now he turned to Machiavelli, constructing the genealogy of a political theory that began with the author of The Prince and continued into the present.</p> <p>For a Machiavellian, Burnham wrote, politics was an unending war for dominance: democracy was a myth, and all ideologies were thinly veiled rationalisations for self-interest. The great mass of humanity, in Burnham\u2019s dark vision, would never have any control over their own lives. They could only hope that clashes between rival elites might weaken the power of the ruling class and open up small spaces of freedom.</p> <p>Burnham\u2019s newfound zeal for defending freedom led him, in 1955, to a conservative magazine called National Review, and to the magazine\u2019s charismatic young founder, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/27/business/media/27cnd-buckley.html?_r=0\">William F Buckley Jr</a>. Buckley\u2019s goal was to turn a scattered collection of reactionaries into the seeds of a movement. His journal set out to make the right intellectually respectable, stripping it of the associations with kooks and cranks that allowed liberals to depict it as a politics for cave-dwellers who had not reconciled themselves to modernity. Burnham was there at the start, one of five senior editors on the masthead of the first issue.</p> <p>Soon Burnham was Buckley\u2019s ranking deputy. But in an editorial staff riven by abstract debates between ardent libertarians and devout Christians, Burnham was the pragmatist who urged his colleagues not to ask politicians for more than the electorate would accept. For the right to win over working-class voters, Burnham argued, the movement had to embrace a more populist economic policy \u2013 contrary to the wishes of his anti-statist colleagues and their corporate backers, who wanted to lower taxes on the rich and roll back the welfare state. \u201cMuch of conservative doctrine,\u201d Burnham wrote in 1972, \u201cis, if not quite bankrupt, more and more obviously obsolescent.\u201d Less than a decade later, Ronald Reagan was president, and it was Burnham who seemed like a relic of the past.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>For a long time, the only major study of Burnham\u2019s work was a slim volume published in 1984 by a minor academic press under the title Power and History. The book\u2019s author, Samuel Francis, seemed a typical product of the insurgent conservative movement Burnham had helped to create \u2013 though by the late 1990s, when Francis published an updated version of Power and History, it made more sense to speak of a new conservative establishment. Outsiders who arrived at the White House with Reagan had become senior executives in Conservatism Inc. With the end of the cold war, the right had lost the glue that had bound its coalition, but there were still battles to be waged, and the money was better than ever.</p> <p>Francis was never going to become a star in the emerging rightwing infotainment complex. Shy and overweight, with teeth stained from smoking, he had difficulty making it through cocktail parties. After completing a PhD in British history at the University of North Carolina, Francis left academia for Washington \u2013 first working at a rightwing thinktank, then serving as an aide to a Republican senator, and finally joining the editorial staff of the capital\u2019s influential conservative daily newspaper, the Washington Times.</p> <p>Francis retained his academic interests while he ascended into the ranks of the conservative establishment. He published six books in his lifetime, but he worked in private on one massive volume that he hoped would bring together all the disparate strands of his thought. Finished in 1995 but not discovered until after his death a decade later, the result was published earlier this year under the title Leviathan and Its Enemies. It is a sprawling text, more than 700 pages long, digressive, repetitive and in desperate need of an editor.</p> <p>It is also one of the most impressive books to come out of the American right in a generation \u2013 and the most frightening. It is a searching diagnosis of managerial society, written by an author looking for a strategy that could break it apart.</p> <p>Like much of Francis\u2019s writing, Leviathan and Its Enemies began with Burnham \u2013 in this case, quite literally. \u201cThis book,\u201d Francis announced in the first sentence, \u201cis an effort to revise and reformulate the theory of the managerial revolution as advanced by James Burnham in 1941.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Paleoconservatives depicted themselves as spokesmen for the forgotten residents of flyover country</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Francis agreed that society had been taken over by managers, but he believed the new ruling class was far more vulnerable than Burnham had realised. Not everyone had benefited from the rise of the experts \u2013 and Francis saw this unequal distribution of rewards as the managerial regime\u2019s greatest weakness.</p> <p>For reasons he never quite explained, he insisted that the cosmopolitan elite threatened the traditional values cherished by most Americans: \u201cmorality and religion, family, nation, local community, and at times racial integrity and identity\u201d. These were sacred principles for members of a new \u201cpost-bourgeois proletariat\u201d drawn from the working class and the lower ranks of the middle class. Lacking the skills prized by technocrats, but not far enough down the social ladder to win the attention of reformers, these white voters considered themselves victims of a coalition between the top and bottom against the middle.</p> <p>According to Francis, this cohort had supplied the animating spirit of rightwing politics since the death of Franklin Roosevelt in 1945. They had supported Goldwater \u2013 but Francis regarded Goldwater\u2019s programme, like the \u201cmovement conservatism\u201d of the National Review, as a \u201cquaintly bourgeois\u201d throwback to the oligarchic politics of the 19th century, with nothing to offer the modern working man. Their tribune was not Goldwater but <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/14/us/george-wallace-segregation-symbol-dies-at-79.html?pagewanted=all\">George Wallace</a>, the notorious segregationist and Democratic governor of Alabama \u2013 who won five southern states as an anti-civil rights third-party candidate in the 1968 presidential election. Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan had appealed to this group, too, but neglected their interests after taking office. Despite having elected multiple presidents, the post-bourgeois proletariat had yet to find a voice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"b9f9fe228b411a3f9b75c94215a7aaa10509c370\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9f9fe228b411a3f9b75c94215a7aaa10509c370/76_16_2917_1750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Third-party presidential candidate George Wallace campaigns in Boston, 1968\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Third-party presidential candidate George Wallace campaigns in Boston, 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet Francis had difficulty explaining why managerial society would generate so much opposition in the first place. In Leviathan and Its Enemies, he argued that resistance to the cosmopolitan elite would be driven by \u201cimmutable elements of human nature\u201d that \u201cnecessitate attachment to the concrete and historical roots of moral values and meaning\u201d.</p> <p>He was more candid in a speech he gave while working on the book. \u201cWhat we as whites must do,\u201d he declared, \u201cis reassert our identity and our solidarity, and we must do so in explicitly racial terms through the articulation of a racial consciousness as whites.\u201d Where mainstream conservatives depicted the US as a nation whose diverse population was linked by devotion to its founding principles, Francis viewed it as a racial project inextricably bound up with white rule. The managerial revolution jeopardised this racial hierarchy, and so it must be overthrown.</p> <p>Francis delivered his remarks on racial consciousness at a conference organised by <a href=\"http://www.amren.com/\">American Renaissance</a>, an obscure journal devoted to promoting white nationalism. Years earlier, Francis had struck up a friendship with Jared Taylor, who went on to found the magazine with Francis\u2019s encouragement. From their first encounter, Taylor recalled, he and Francis \u201cunderstood each other immediately\u201d.</p> <p>Francis\u2019s employers at the Washington Times were not as sympathetic. The paper fired him after his comments were released, a move that was part of his larger expulsion from the respectable right. Buckley himself dismissed Francis as \u201cspokesman\u201d for a group that had \u201cearned their exclusion from thoughtful conservative ranks\u201d.</p> <p>Yet Francis would not be so easily purged. For years he had cultivated a relationship with Pat Buchanan, a one-time Nixon protege who had become one of the country\u2019s most recognisable conservatives thanks to his role as co-host of CNN\u2019s popular debating programme Crossfire. In 1992, Buchanan launched a long-shot campaign against incumbent president George HW Bush that, against all expectations, garnered almost 3m votes in the primaries. While all this was going on, Buchanan was growing closer to Francis, whom he later called \u201cperhaps the brightest and best thinker on the right\u201d.</p> <p>Francis and Buchanan were linked by their association with a breakaway faction on the right known as paleoconservatism. While mainstream conservatives had taken advantage of cushy gigs in New York and Washington, paleocons depicted themselves as spokesmen for the forgotten residents of <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/03/160314-flyover-country-origin-language-midwest/\">flyover country</a>. Francis urged Buchanan to make another run for the White House in 1996, this time as the candidate of the post-bourgeois resistance. That campaign would be based on three issues: protectionism, opposition to immigration and an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy that repudiated global commitments and foreign interventions in order to focus on defending the national interest.</p> <p>Buchanan listened, and he went on to a surprise win in New Hampshire\u2019s pivotal early primary, convincing Francis that the managerial elite was more vulnerable than at any point in his lifetime. While mainstream Republicans and Democrats celebrated forecasts that the US population was on track to become less than 50% white as a sign of America\u2019s capacity to adapt and grow, Francis believed that the members of his post-bourgeois proletariat regarded these shifting demographics as another reminder of their dwindling power.</p> <p>Buchanan\u2019s campaign fizzled after New Hampshire, but Francis had a ready explanation for the collapse: Buchanan was too loyal to the Republican party to seize the opportunity he had been granted. \u201cDon\u2019t even use the word \u2018conservative,\u2019\u201d Francis told Buchanan. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything any more.\u201d The managerial class had absorbed Buckley and his followers. They, too, were the enemy.</p> <p>After Buchanan\u2019s defeat and his own exile from mainstream conservatism, Francis devoted himself to what he called \u201cracialpolitik\u201d. He was a regular contributor to outlets promoting white racial consciousness \u2013 becoming, in Jared Taylor\u2019s words, \u201cthe intellectual leader of a small but growing movement\u201d. Francis denied that he was a white supremacist, but he condemned interracial sex, warned of \u201cincipient race war\u201d and drafted a manifesto for a white nationalist group arguing: \u201cThe American people and government should remain European in their composition and character.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"088706af3fbf2b6b4d0d62ec41dfa8b18a8d90ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/088706af3fbf2b6b4d0d62ec41dfa8b18a8d90ac/0_74_2039_1223/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pat Buchanan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Republican presidential candidate Pat Buchanan at the Cross Roads of the West gun show in Phoenix, Arizona, 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Bourg/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When he looked ahead, Francis was especially concerned with the threat that one rising political star posed to his vision of the future. Barack Obama, he remarked in 2004, was \u201cthe model of what the New American is supposed to be\u201d. Ivy League-educated, effortlessly cosmopolitan, promising to transcend barriers of race \u2013 Obama was the embodiment of the managerial elite. He represented everything Francis loathed about the contemporary United States.</p> <p>The fact that Obama, Francis\u2019s symbol for American decadence, became one of the most popular figures in the country brought the great contradiction of his thought into relief. The 19th century belonged to the bourgeoisie and the 20th century to the managers, he argued, because these rising classes had performed necessary social functions. His post-bourgeois proletariat, by contrast, were on the decline.</p> <p>So was Francis. The supposed realist who cast hunger for power as the driving force of world history spent most of his time writing for journals with subscribers in the low five figures. In his last years, he was a lonely man. Before his sudden death from a cardiac aneurism in 2005, he had begun a study of conservatism and race. His masterpiece, Leviathan and Its Enemies, was still tucked away in a box of floppy disks; when it was published 11 years later, it would be under the auspices of a white-nationalist press. The right-leaning Washington Examiner ran one of his few obituaries. \u201cSam Francis,\u201d it said, \u201cwas merely a racist and doesn\u2019t deserve to be remembered as anything less.\u201d It seemed just as likely that Francis would not be remembered at all.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI want you to really listen<strong> </strong>to this,\u201d Rush Limbaugh told his listeners in January this year. The king of rightwing talk radio was lecturing his audience, which averages around 13 million people a week, on Samuel Francis. Prompted by a magazine article casting Francis as the prophet of Trumpism, Limbaugh read aloud from one of Francis\u2019s post-mortems on the Buchanan campaign. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting,\u201d Limbaugh said, \u201cis how right on it is in foretelling Trump.\u201d Before abandoning the subject, he added one point. Francis, Limbaugh noted, \u201clater in life suffered the \u2013 acquired the \u2013 reputation of being a white supremacist\u201d, a reputation Limbaugh insisted was undeserved.</p> <p>The white nationalists who rallied to Francis in the last decade of his life disagree on that point, but they also see Trump as a vindication of their longtime inspiration. \u201cSam would have said that Trump is doing exactly what he advised Patrick Buchanan to do,\u201d maintains Jared Taylor, who made news in the primary season when it was revealed that he had recorded automated phone messages endorsing Trump. (\u201cWhite Supremacist Robocall Heartily Urges Iowa Voters to Support Trump,\u201d reported a headline in the conservative Daily Caller.) According to Taylor\u2019s American Renaissance, \u201cFrancis would be very pleased to see the GOP and conservative establishments mocked and destroyed.\u201d</p> <p>Even liberal commentators are looking back at Francis \u2013 whose prediction of a white working-class backlash against a globalist ruling elite seems to be coming true not just in the US but across Europe. \u201cIf you just drop the white nationalism a lot of Francis makes sense,\u201d says Michael Lind, who once worked as an assistant to Buckley but now describes himself as a \u201cradical centrist\u201d. According to Lind, conservatives have been \u201cspurning their natural constituency \u2013 the mostly white working class\u201d, creating space for the rise of Trump.</p> <p>Francis was also an inspiration for the team at the Journal of American Greatness, who called him \u201cthe closest thing to what could be described as the source of Trumpian thought\u201d in their very first post. They admitted that Francis\u2019s writing \u201covertly indulges various Southern nostalgias\u201d, but insisted that his \u201cdeservedly criticised statements on race\u201d could be separated from the core of his analysis. The managerial class was still the enemy, and only Trump seemed even dimly aware of what it would take to mount an effective challenge.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The authors of JAG looked at the problems facing the US and concluded that Donald Trump might be the answer</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the authors at JAG wanted to do more than add chapters to the history Francis had already sketched. While they remain anonymous, sources have identified them as part of a conservative establishment located outside the Washington-New York axis that dominates the intellectual life of the American right \u2013 probably associated with the California-based <a href=\"http://www.claremont.org/\">Claremont Institute</a> and the midwestern <a href=\"https://www.hillsdale.edu/\">Hillsdale College</a>.</p> <p>Trump the candidate, they admitted, was at best an imperfect messenger. But it was the message that counted: \u201cThe American regime \u2013 like nearly all its cousins in the west \u2013 has devolved into an oligarchy.\u201d JAG was not just arguing that Trump\u2019s campaign had a coherent agenda \u2013 a controversial assertion, given that many on both the left and right have dismissed Trump as an unhinged demagogue jabbing randomly at pressure points in the electorate. It was arguing that Trump succeeded <em>because</em> of his platform. Without those ideas, he would have been just another novelty candidate. Armed with them, any of Trump\u2019s more disciplined rivals might have stolen the nomination from him \u2013 but instead they opted for recycled bromides from the Reagan era.</p> <p>The site could be fiery in its defence of Trump, but the best moments came when its targets were the grandees of the right. There are plenty of scathing articles about rightwing thinktanks written from the left, but none of their authors could write a sentence such as \u201cSeeing conservatives court billionaires \u2013 which I have had occasion to do dozens, if not hundreds, of times \u2013 is like watching dorks tell cheerleaders how pretty they are.\u201d</p> <p>For all that, the authors of JAG were still thinkers who looked at the problems facing the US and concluded that Donald Trump might be the answer. They denounced conservatives for accepting \u201cthe leftist lie\u201d that having a \u201cnatural affinity for people who look, think and speak\u201d alike \u201cis shameful and illegitimate\u201d. \u201cThe ceaseless importation of people unaccustomed to liberty,\u201d they wrote \u2013 referring to \u201cmass third world immigration\u201d \u2013 \u201cmakes the American people less fit for liberty every day\u201d. Islam was a subject of particular concern. \u201cWhat good,\u201d they asked, \u201chas Muslim immigration done for the United States and the American people?\u201d Francis would have approved.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>With its archive deleted, JAG\u2019s internet presence is now confined to the occasional mournful tweet from one of its former readers, but the problems it identified on the right are more glaring than ever. \u201cThe conservative movement\u2019s mission has become providing comfortable professional livelihoods to literally hundreds of people,\u201d David Frum told me recently. Although this behemoth has proved effective at turning a profit, the intellectual returns on the investment have been paltry. \u201cConservatism was a lot more creative and effective when it had less money,\u201d Frum said.</p> <p>This narrowing of intellectual ambitions has coincided with a crisis of authority. When asked to name the dominant theme of the right\u2019s intellectual history since George W Bush left office, conservative journalist Michael Brendan Dougherty responded with one word: \u201cdisintegration\u201d. Buckley has been dead for the better part of a decade, and no successor has emerged with the clout to take up his role as arbiter of the true faith.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the little magazines that once set the tempo of debate have struggled to maintain their influence in the age of social media. \u201cTwenty years ago if you got the summer internship at National Review you were high-fiving everyone you knew,\u201d one conservative activist told me. \u201cThat was like getting the Goldman Sachs internship. You were set.\u201d</p> <p>Charles Kesler, a senior fellow at the Claremont Institute and professor at nearby Claremont McKenna College, sees a generational change underway. His best students, he says, used to seek out three paths: some went into academia, others into politics, and a third group tried to navigate a path between the two as writers for middlebrow journals such as National Review. But that middle ground has eroded in the last decade, Kesler says. Now many feel \u201crevulsion\u201d at the state of public debate and take refuge in academia \u2013 or they succumb to a \u201cpopulist tug\u201d and end up at rightwing clickbait factories such as <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/01/how-breitbart-unleashes-hate-mobs-to-threaten-dox-and-troll-trump-critics.html\">Breitbart News</a>. That pull will only grow stronger now that Trump has shown how little influence establishment conservatives have over the constituency they claim to represent.</p> <p>In Washington, a policy-minded cohort dubbed the <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/republican-conservative-reformicons-put-new-twist-on-tax-debate-1423010939\">reformicons</a> has become the great hope for conservatives planning their response to the rise of Trump. Long before this year\u2019s campaign, they had begun to devise a more populist agenda to appeal to the working-class voters who have become an increasingly significant part of the Republican electorate. With an eye to the future, they are also convinced that Republicans need to reject Trump\u2019s brand of white identity politics if it hopes to win elections in a country becoming more diverse by the day.</p> <p>From the reformicon perspective, Trump represents a pathological response to the legitimate complaints of voters whose concerns have been overlooked for too long. The challenge for savvy Republican politicians is to convert the impulses that have propelled Trump\u2019s rise into a platform that can appeal to a multiracial coalition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"4e54fa933163284de5893fa844788d8525b4f65f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e54fa933163284de5893fa844788d8525b4f65f/0_56_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump speaks at the Republican national convention in Cleveland, Ohio, July 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the well-intentioned reforming wonks have struggled to find an audience outside the capital. Part of the problem is financial. \u201cThere\u2019s no money from rich donors even for reasonable populism,\u201d says Michael Lind. To the ears of conservative billionaires, pleas for economic policies that appeal to workers sound like the prelude to tax hikes on the wealthy. For a Washington-based movement offering what the sceptics at JAG called \u201cmanagerialism with a human face\u201d, a lack of wealthy donors is a potentially fatal obstacle.</p> <p>Of all the forces unleashed by the rise of Trump, the one that may pose the greatest threat to the relevance of the conservative intellectual establishment is the gleefully offensive movement known as the alt-right. Nurtured by online forums such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/reddit\">Reddit</a> and 4chan, along with white-nationalist standbys such as American Renaissance, the alt-right has become a vehicle for the simmering anger of mostly white and mostly young men \u2013 with strong links to the earlier varieties of racialpolitik promoted by Francis, who is sometimes cited as a founder of the alt-right. Mainstream conservatives have reacted with shock and horror to this development. \u201cThe nasty mouth-breathers Buckley expelled from conservatism have returned,\u201d declared a typical response from Commentary, one of the major journals of the establishment right.</p> <p>But the new iconoclasts of the alt-right can\u2019t be purged from a conservative movement they have no desire to join, especially when they can reach an audience of millions on social media. If there is an heir today to the young William F Buckley \u2013 who launched his career with exuberant attacks on the hypocrisy of the liberal establishment and managed to make conservatism look like a stylish rebellion against the powers-that-be \u2013 it might be someone like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/20/milo-yiannopoulos-nero-permanently-banned-twitter\">Milo Yiannopoulos</a>, a professional provocateur who has become a spokesman for the alt-right. At one typical event this spring, Yiannopoulos, who refers to Trump as \u201cDaddy\u201d, delivered a lecture with the title Feminism Is Cancer after being ushered into the auditorium on a throne held aloft by students wearing \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats. Yiannopoulos\u2019s critics are rightly concerned that his main agenda is promoting himself, but Brand Milo is a booming business.</p> <p>The future looks more precarious for the guardians of True Conservatism. They have strong support from leading figures in the Republican party such as Paul Ryan, and retain control over an infrastructure of donors, thinktanks and journals. A landslide defeat for Trump could still revive their cause, but they could just as easily be swept aside by a rising generation of rightwing activists with a more Trumpian set of concerns.</p> <p>Their brand of conservatism won\u2019t disappear, but it could become more a curiosity than a movement, as it was in the days before the birth of the modern right over half a century ago. \u201cThe whole Buckley experiment may have been a passing phase,\u201d says Lind \u2013 a strange interlude when a cohort of writers mistook their ideological preferences for the will of the people and, even stranger, provided the basis for an industry based on that delusion. The anxiety that its time has passed lurks underneath all the conservative establishment\u2019s impassioned denunciations of Trump: a fear that his unprecedented victory in the Republican primary has demonstrated it is already obsolete. \u201cI\u2019m a conservative,\u201d Trump said in April, \u201cbut at this point who cares?\u201d</p> <p>But Trump may have unintentionally pointed the way for a new kind of American conservatism, driven by resentment at the globalist diktats of the hated managerial class. Over the last year, that anger has emerged in surprising venues. In language that Francis would have recognised, the billionaire <a href=\"http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/06/peter-thiel.html\">PayPal co-founder and Silicon Valley guru Peter Thiel</a> declared that America is no longer a democracy \u2013 since it has become a country \u201cdominated by very unelected, technocratic agencies\u201d.</p> <p>Thiel has been an outspoken libertarian since his days as an undergraduate at Stanford in the 1980s, and in 2008 he supplied $500,000 for an attempt to create manmade islands that would provide an \u201cescape from politics in all its forms\u201d, but lately he has started to associate himself with a different crowd. In July, following an outpouring of criticism, <a href=\"https://news.fastcompany.com/peter-thiel-to-speak-atconference-thrown-by-group-tied-to-white-nationalists-4010060\">he cancelled a planned appearance</a> in front of a group that has provided a meeting ground for libertarians and white nationalists, including Francis\u2019s close friend Jared Taylor. But a similar public outcry did not persuade him to drop another speaking engagement earlier that month: a speech on the final night of the Republican national convention, where he had come as a delegate to cast his vote for Donald Trump.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>",

The comments were made when gas use was forecast to grow, and since then it has declined.

The commission <a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/release-of-east-coast-gas-inquiry-report-into-the-increasingly-complex-and-uncertain-gas-market\">released the results of the inquiry</a> and chairman Rod Sims said: \u201cThere are currently very few constraints on monopoly pricing by pipeline operators.\u201d</p> <p>Since recent spikes in the price of electricity have been blamed on the rising price of gas, the new federal minister for the environment and energy, Josh Frydenberg, indicated more gas was needed in Australia. \u201cWe need more gas supply and more gas supplies in Australia, and gas is an important part of the energy mix,\u201d Frydenberg <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2016/s4508656.htm\">told ABC\u2019s Lateline</a>.</p> <p>Robertson said since the price hikes are a result of low competition rather than low supply, opening up new supplies that are owned by the same companies controlling current supply would do nothing to lower prices.</p> <p>But with little public information about gas supplies, Robertson said it was impossible for policymakers to make informed decisions about the supply of gas.</p> <p>\u201cYou have policymakers suggesting policy responses to a problem they can\u2019t see the dimensions of. And that\u2019s a very dangerous situation.\u201d</p> <p>That lack of available information was also highlighted by the ACCC\u2019s inquiry in April. \u201cThe lack of consistent, publicly available data on the sector is an impediment to participants, investors and policymakers,\u201d Sims said.</p> <p>Robertson said he was concerned that without more information the wrong decisions would be made at the Coag Energy Council meeting on Friday. \u201cThey\u2019ve set the agenda for more gas production and that ain\u2019t the solution,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Robertson was critical of the ACCC\u2019s report for recommending more gas supply be opened up, since that report itself pointed out there was a lack of information about current levels of supply.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s appalling they suggest that solution when they have no bloody idea of the productive capacity of existing wells,\u201d said Robertson.</p>",

  "<p>MS Estraden looks, on first glance, like a normal cargo ship. Just another one of the 50,000 <a href=\"http://www.ics-shipping.org/shipping-facts/shipping-and-world-trade\" rel=\"nofollow\">vessels</a> transporting pretty much everything we buy, sell and consume. </p> <p>But on closer inspection, ship-spotting enthusiasts will notice two large cylinders rising from the deck.

There is an agreement for ships to record and report data on fuel consumption, but not until 2018 at the earliest, and rules to ensure new ships being built are more efficient.<br></p> <p>\u201cRecent new ships have regularly been achieving design improvements not because of the regulation, but because of market forces including an oversupply of ships forcing greater competition and increased pressure for owners to seek margins through efficiency,\u201d says Smith. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fd5094d2c4f6e0a30654dfd619aef6a76cb5f68c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd5094d2c4f6e0a30654dfd619aef6a76cb5f68c/102_458_2970_1782/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The MS Estraden cut fuel use by 6% after installing the wind cylinders.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The MS Estraden cut fuel use by 6% after installing the rotor sails.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Norsepower</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shipping companies blame factors outside their control for their climate impact, in particular a tripling in demand for shipping over the past 40 years.

Although he does now have interest from other shipping companies in Europe and Asia, the original funding for his research came from venture-capitalists rather than the shipping sector.</p> <p>Another company pushing wind technology is the Germany-based SkySails. It has equipped five ships so far with automated kites to help propel them and cut fuel consumption. Despite average fuel savings of 2-3 tonnes a day, it has found it difficult to attract interest from ship companies.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"81740ad733aef7fe64f3230934d5614a815bf4f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81740ad733aef7fe64f3230934d5614a815bf4f4/0_322_2362_2951/800.jpg\" alt=\"SkySails\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Germany-based SkySails is equipping ships with automated kites to help propel them and cut fuel consumption.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SkySails</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMany ship owners struggle to survive and there\u2019s not much money for investing in solutions improving long-term profitability \u2013 \u2018We don\u2019t even know if we\u2019re still there in five years\u2019 is what we hear,\u201d says Henning Kuehl, head of business development at SkySails.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s also a structural problem slowing down the process: ship owners (who have to make the investment) often don\u2019t pay for the fuel \u2013 that\u2019s the charterer\u2019s duty. The charterer on the other side doesn\u2019t charter the ship for long enough a period to make low-carbon technologies pay back.\u201d </p> <h2>Making green shipping work<br></h2> <p>With a wariness about renewables, low fuel prices and little political incentive, the onus is on numerous trials to convince shipping companies of the benefit. \u201cThe sector is risk-adverse so expanding uptake requires a high burden of proof,\u201d says Conor Walsh, research associate on shipping at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. \u201cMost of the technologies at the moment are low-scale and not mainstream. There are not yet many in commercial use.</p> <p>One fast-track solution could be for major users of cargo such as retailers and commodity companies to start insisting on the use of more efficient, low-carbon ships.

To make a change, cargo owners, charterers and ship owners need to come to one table and work out long-term cooperations so that green shipping works for each party.\u201d</p> <p></p>",

That is not true. That children are failing because their families are bad. It is not true. The state is abusive, the welfare system is abusive, and after decades of this many people can\u2019t cope.\u201d</p> <p>Although child poverty is most visible in the major cities, Kaa says he has relatives in the isolated regions of the East Cape and Northland who are going without many basics \u2013 including electricity.</p> <p>\u201cThe level of intergenerational, ingrained child poverty has reached a point that it is challenging the idea New Zealand has of itself as an egalitarian nation; the myth that we are god\u2019s own country,\u201d he says.</p> <p>It\u2019s Sunday night at the Rayland Motel and Emily Saitu is preparing for another week of holding out the begging bowl.</p> <p>In her youth she worked for the ministry of justice as a secretary. She thrived on the order and routine of the job, and the regular pay cheques that allowed her to eat pancakes and cappuccinos at Denny\u2019s with her brother.</p> <p>But that was nearly 20 years ago \u2013 before she had four children, before her husband lost his job in a meat processing factory, before life in New Zealand became hard.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I meet my counterparts around the world they are deeply shocked to learn of such ingrained, desperate poverty in New Zealand,\u201d says Maidaborn of Unicef. \u201cWe have been very good at selling a brand New Zealand. And increasingly that brand is being exposed as a marketing ploy, not a deep systemic reality.\u201d</p> <p>As Saitu pores over files of documentation \u2013 applications for benefits, applications for disability assistance, applications for help \u2013 her two daughters draw pictures in the misted glass of the motel room. Looking in from outside the whole door is covered in their finger paintings \u2013 squiggly patterns, rain drops and a frowning sun. </p> <p>\u201cNew Zealand is ashamed of us, they want to forget about us,\u201d says Saitu, aggressively wiping tears from her eyes. \u201cNew Zealand doesn\u2019t want my children.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 August 2016 to correct the spelling of Papatoetoe.<br></p>"
