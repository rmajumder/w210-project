There are zero opportunities for higher education and it\u2019s really sad to see when the young girls have so much ambition.\u201d </p> <p>Stoddart says the needs of displaced children go beyond the basics of food and water. \u201cChildren who have fled violence are suffering extreme trauma \u2026 There is acute long-term damage when children are not supported through trauma, or are out of school.\u201d She says there is also a risk of sexual violence, as girls may be married off at the age of 12 because their parents believe it will give them protection. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/countries-who-pledged-to-help-syrian-refugees-not-doing-it-report-finds\">global picture for funding all humanitarian response</a> work is one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/14/war-disasters-epidemics-exhaust-aid-resources\">of persistent and chronic underfunding</a>, with appeals for Syria, Afghanistan and Somalia underfunded by around 60%. </p> <p>But the report notes that children\u2019s services are particularly poorly resourced. Only 5% of humanitarian funding is dedicated to child protection and education. Schooling was the least funded sector in almost a third of countries affected by conflict in 2015, with 73% and 85% of funding needs unmet in Iraq and the Democratic Republic of the Congo respectively in 2015. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/07/nearly-half-of-all-refugees-are-children-unicef-report-migrants-united-nations\">Nearly half of all refugees are children, says Unicef</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Adding to the complex picture of need faced by humanitarian groups working with children is the fact that more young people than ever before are travelling without their families. In 2015, nearly <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/publications/files/Uprooted_growing_crisis_for_refugee_and_migrant_children.pdf\">100,000 unaccompanied minors applied for asylum in 78 countries</a> (pdf), almost triple the number seen the year before. The report warns that in the next 10 years on current trends at least 300,000 child refugees will end up separated from their families. </p> <p>Stoddart says the projected increase is related to the changing nature of hostilities. \u201cThe intensity and the protracted nature of the conflict means there are higher concentrations of people fleeing conflicts that seem to know no end. Syria is an illustration. It is intense, brutal and has been ongoing for six years. If there isn\u2019t a dramatic change then people will flee, children will flee and families will be separated as they seize any opportunity for a better life.\u201d</p> <p>World leaders are due to meet in New York on 19 September for a high-level summit on refugees and migrants. In a pre-summit statement completed in August, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/03/un-members-reject-concrete-refugee-resettlement-target\">negotiators removed an earlier promise to move one in 10 refugees to the developed world</a>.<br></p> <p>Emily Garin, Unicef\u2019s policy specialist, says there will be a concerted effort to put the rights of children at the heart of discussions in New York. \u201cWe believe children should be the primary focus. The real tragedy is that children have been suffering because of conflicts not of their making, and that this is not new. There are children <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/27/life-dadaab-three-generations-of-refugees-isolated-from-kenyan-society\">born into refugee camps in northern Kenya</a> who are second- and third-generation Somali refugees. We hope we can turn outrage over individual child cases into care for the bigger issue.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Sir James Dyson, the billionaire inventor, has said there is no reason for businesses in Britain to be uncertain as a result of the EU referendum and that they would be mad to withhold investment on the back of the vote.</p> <p>Speaking as his company, Dyson, unveiled a \u00a3250m expansion of its research and development centre in the Cotswolds, the engineer said Britain could now reach trade agreements with countries outside Europe \u201cmuch more easily and flexibly\u201d and reconsider its approach to immigration from around the world so it can attract more engineers and scientists from India, China and the far east.</p> <p>Dyson was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/11/sir-james-dyson-dismisses-brexit-trade-fears-as-cobblers\">one of the most prominent business leaders to publicly support Brexit before the referendum in June</a>. His company has developed from a firm specialising in bagless vacuum cleaners into a fast-growing multinational technology company selling bladeless fans, air purifiers, hand-dryers, hairdryers and robotic vacuum cleaners.<br></p> <p>In the past four years the company\u2019s sales have doubled. Dyson reported revenues of \u00a31.7bn in 2015, up 26% year on year, with profits of \u00a3448m. It is investing \u00a35m a week in research and development.</p> <p>Dyson said he could not understand why businesses would stop investing because of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">prospect of import duties being introduced on trade between the UK and Europe.</a></p> <p>Asked whether the economic uncertainty in the UK could hold Dyson back from investing, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be arrogant about this, but I don\u2019t understand why people are uncertain. I think it is something put around. If you are a business, do you actually say, \u2018I am not going to make a decision to invest in that factory or I am not going to make a decision to set up in Europe because of this potential 3% [tax].\u2019 As a business, are you actually stopping and not investing because of that? If you were, you would be mad because currency can move 10% in a couple of days. A 3% import duty is not something to worry about. </p> <p>\u201cIt is highly unlikely it will come in anyway. The imbalance of trade is \u00a3100bn a year. Are you seriously saying that Germany wants to be putting an import duty on British goods going into Germany when we can punish them much greater on their goods?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c947e4c1e284d16b6f23d355eb11195bd70f8ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c947e4c1e284d16b6f23d355eb11195bd70f8ee/0_245_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dyson 360 Eye robot vacuum cleaner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dyson 360 Eye robot vacuum cleaner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe trend is towards free trade. The failure of Europe to negotiate a free trade agreement with America, the TTIP, is really worrying. That is uncertainty. If you are waiting for Europe to negotiate free trade agreements China, North America and so on, that is a far greater uncertainty then whether or not you pay 3% to go into Europe.\u201d</p> <p>Dyson\u2019s latest investment involves the opening of a new research building at its campus in Malmesbury, Wiltshire. The building, nicknamed D9, will house up to 450 engineers working on top-secret projects. These projects involve work on robotics and battery technology, two key new areas for the company. There are now 2,500 people working at the site out of 7,000 Dyson employees globally.</p> <p>Europe accounts for around 16% of Dyson sales and is still an \u201cattractive\u201d market for the company, its founder and chairman said. However, the business is growing faster in China, South Korea and Japan and Dyson said that Europe was not a single market for his company anyway.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not a single market as far as we are concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are different plugs, different languages, different boxes, different instructions, different laws, different national characteristics, different psychology, different marketing and different companies.\u201d</p> <p>Dyson insisted that leaving the EU is positive for the UK despite warnings of a slow down in the economy. \u201cIt is a positive because we can now negotiate trade agreements with countries much more easily and flexibly on our own then we ever could with 29 countries in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have those problems, we are on our own, we can negotiated a very rapid trade agreement with other countries.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e5ff0df234618689806025be00fea4bcc85186c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e5ff0df234618689806025be00fea4bcc85186c/0_778_5576_3346/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dyson\u2019s HQ\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dyson\u2019s HQ.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WilkinsonEyre &amp; Dyson Research Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 69-year-old also said it was opportunity for Britain to address a shortage of engineers in the country by making its immigration system global.</p> <p>Dyson said: \u201cIt has been very much a Europe-focused immigration system, not a global immigration system. A lot of people who want to be engineers come from India, China, and the far east. In Pune [India] there are 40,000 engineers that come out of Pune University every year, which is twice as many as the British [engineers] that come out of the whole of British universities.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe just don\u2019t have the scale. China produces something like 2 million engineers a year, we produce 20,000. We are just not going to compete globally unless we seriously ramp up the number of people.\u201d</p> <p>The entrepreneur played down <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/09/fat-and-lazy-britain-is-ill-prepared-to-secure-future-outside-eu-says-fox\">criticism from Liam Fox, the international trade secretary</a>, that business executives would rather be playing golf on a Friday afternoon than negotiating export deals.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think many businesses survive nowadays if you spend your time playing golf,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I have been saying is that to compete globally and to export now it is a technology race. If companies aren\u2019t developing technology and this country doesn\u2019t produce enough engineers to take advantage of all the wonderful universities and commercialise their technology we will lag behind economically and be outstripped by our competitors all over the world.\u201d</p> <h2>An experimental approach</h2> <p>Dyson has become the UK\u2019s nearest equivalent to Apple. It develops cutting-edge technology, is renowned for sleek design and has even opened its own shop on Oxford Street in London.</p> <p>The new \u00a3250m extension at its 56-acre campus in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, which is unveiled today, could even help Dyson take on Apple directly. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/11/dysons-electric-car-development-could-become-the-next-tesla\">Government documents revealed earlier this year Dyson is working on a battery-powered electric vehicle</a>, although the company refuses to confirm the project. Apple is also rumoured to be working on an electric car.</p> <p>Founded in 1993, Dyson is a young company in more ways than one. The average age of its staff is just 26, a deliberate attempt by founder and chairman Sir James Dyson to try to keep the company on its toes. Dyson\u2019s headquarters is designed to feel like a university campus and even has a sports centre nicknamed \u201cthe hangar\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is going to sound wrong , but we don\u2019t like experience,\u201d he explains in a rare interview at Dyson\u2019s headquarters. \u201cExperience can be inhibiting. I would rather have a naive, flexible, experimental, pioneering approach, because we want to do everything differently. It is a lot easier if people don\u2019t come along \u2013 and this is going to sound slightly nasty \u2013 with baggage, and experience with how things are done. We want to find a new and better way of doing things. Graduates are very good at doing that.\u201d</p> <p>Max Conze, the chief executive of Dyson, who joined in 2010 from Procter &amp; Gamble, said the company\u2019s growth is built on a \u201cbet on young people, young graduates\u201d and a \u201cbelief in technology and innovation as the engine for growth\u201d. He added: \u201cYou have to be willing to listen to people who have just come in and the people who have done this for many years.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cb94b678a13d01ef60eed655304f2475002f0f23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb94b678a13d01ef60eed655304f2475002f0f23/0_0_5431_5431/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sports centre at Dyson HQ\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dyson\u2019s headquarters are designed to feel like a university campus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WilkinsonEyre &amp; Dyson Research Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dyson\u2019s headquarters are shrouded in mystique and secrecy. From the road, the only evidence of the cutting-edge work that is taking place is a lonely blue airsock bearing its logo. The campus is hidden behind lines of trees.</p> <p>The new D9 research building is a futuristic two-storey structure with reflective glass that offers no sign of what the engineers inside are up to. The company has 129 laboratories for its research and development team, who are working on more than 200 projects.</p> <p>Dyson appears to be on the cusp of major expansion. Its revenues have doubled in the past four years and it wants to double its team of 3,000 engineers by 2021, wit<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/21/dyson-to-invest-1bn-in-battery-technology-thanks-to-profit-surge\">h \u00a31bn committed to developing new battery technology.</a></p> <p>The company\u2019s new robotic vacuum cleaner \u2013 the Dyson 360 Eye \u2013 is a new avenue. After initially specialising in the movement of air, Dyson has broadened its technology into robotics, electric motors and 360-degree cameras. These technologies would clearly be helpful for an electric vehicle. \u201cI don\u2019t think we could deny that,\u201d Dyson says. \u201cBut we don\u2019t talk about what we are doing.\u201d</p> <p>The inventor still owns 100% of the company and is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/24/sunday-times-rich-list-simon-david-reuben-lewis-hamilton-adele\">estimated to be worth \u00a35bn</a> \u2013 more than Sir Richard Branson.</p> <p>Dyson says he has no plans to sell a stake in the business and that its private ownership has been key to its success. \u201cOur CEO can think long term, he doesn\u2019t have to satisfy the newspapers or investorsevery quarter he is raising the profits. We can afford to invest more in research and development, invest in long-term stuff.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019ll be his first club start of the season and, unless Petr Cech is injured (but not seriously enough to prevent him sitting on the bench), represents a demonstration of Wenger\u2019s belief in his players/incorrigible stubbornness. He was lambasted at this stage last season for playing Opsina ahead of Cech against Olympiakos and he insisted back then, after an embarrassing defeat, that the criticism was unfair: Ospina made mistakes but, said Wenger, that could have happened to anyone and did not mean the decision to pick him was flawed. To prove his point, he\u2019s picked Ospina again here. Let\u2019s hope the Colombian does not suffer in Paris the way that Arsenal keepers (Seaman and Lehmann) have done previously. Otherwise the rage of Arsenal fans will break the internet. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d83cb7e4b067ad30087581\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-13T17:53:31.658Z\">6.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble:</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hello and welcome. We are gathered here today to witness the start of the latest Champions League adventure of Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain and to look for signs that this one won\u2019t end the same way as all the others. These teams have never met in the tournament before but share a slightly similar relationship with it, insofar as both regular participants and serial flops. But let\u2019s not give up on them because they\u2019re both very entertaining, for the reason just mentioned as well as for their style of play.</p> <p> Mind you, neither sides\u2019 style of play has been particularly swish so far this season, as both have yet to hit a groove. Umai Emery, the manager whom PSG lured from Sevilla in the summer to replace Laurent Blanc, has endured a difficult start to his reign. The team have looked like they\u2019re caught between two stools (or like one big steaming stool, if you want to be harsh about it) and that\u2019s not acceptable for a team of their resources and ambitions, as Marco Verratti confirmed in yesterday\u2019s press conference when he said: \u201cI don\u2019t play for a club that does transitions\u201d. One big victory would do Emery and PSG a power of good right now. </p> <p> Pretty much the same thing, of course, goes for Arsenal. Win in Paris, their strongest rivals, and Arsenal will have raised hope that they are not about to repeat the mistakes of previous seasons and are ready and able to seize every opportunity rather than fritter it away. And Arsenal fans will be able to recall a trip to Paris for happier reasons than Nayim\u2019s lob and Jen Lehmann\u2019s foul. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d7bd9de4b07ac3d446bb14\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-13T08:49:34.694Z\">9.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Teams:</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong> PSG</strong>: Areola; Aurier, Marquinhos, Thiago Silva, Maxwell; Verratti, Krychowiak, Rabiot; Di Maria, Cavani, Matuidi</p> <p><em> Subs: Trapp, Kimpembe, Moura, Motta, Pastore, Meunier, Jes\u00e9</em></p> <p><strong> Arsenal</strong>: Ospina; Bellerin, Mustafi, Koscielny, Monreal; Cazorla, Coquelin; Iwobi, Ozil, Oxlade-Chamberlain; Sanchez </p> <p><em> Subs: Cech, Holding, Gibbs, Xhaka, Elneny, Lucas, Giroud</em></p> <p><strong> Referee</strong>: V Kassai (Hun)</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-13T18:13:40.228Z\">at 7.13pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

  "<p>It would be wrong in an adult workplace, and it is much more so when the targets are pupils in a classroom. More than a fifth of girls aged seven to 12 have experienced sexual jokes from boys; almost a third of 16- to 18-year-old girls have suffered unwanted sexual touching. Nearly three-quarters of teenagers heard girls denigrated with words such as \u201cslut\u201d or \u201cslag\u201d regularly. Teachers report frequent incidents of girls sending nude pictures to their boyfriends \u2013 then finding they have been forwarded to others.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmwomeq/91/9102.htm\" title=\"\">report from the House of Commons women and equalities committee</a> paints an alarming picture of widespread sexual harassment in schools across England. Unveiled is a culture that is damaging not only to girls, but also to boys, who are sometimes victims and often face pressure to \u201cprove their masculinity\u201d by objectifying and baiting their schoolmates. Charities report similar findings from across Britain. Some of these problems are longstanding. It is disturbing to learn that teachers still write it off as \u201chorseplay\u201d when boys lift the skirts of girls, or ignore aggressive sexual remarks. Failure to take harassment seriously encourages perpetrators to see their behaviour as normal and to escalate their actions; it also deters victims from reporting what has happened.</p> <p>Such problems have been exacerbated by new developments. Government guidance on sex education, drawn up 16 years ago, does not even mention pornography. That must change given that polls suggest almost a quarter of young people were 12 or younger when they first saw porn, and what was previously considered hardcore material has become increasingly mainstream. The emergence of an internet culture that treats young girls \u2013 and suggests that they treat themselves \u2013 as sexual objects must be recognised and challenged. Pornographic images, demeaning comments and outright misogyny damage the wellbeing and self-esteem of our young people. Disturbingly, there is evidence that children are referencing pornography as a \u201cbenchmark\u201d in sexual relationships. This environment promotes an insidious suggestion that hypersexualised self-presentation is a freely chosen expression of body confidence. It\u2019s not.</p> <p>To roll back the advance of pornography will need Theresa May to pick up where David Cameron left off. The government has already pledged to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/04/tories-promise-to-enforce-age-limits-on-online-pornography\" title=\"\">introduce age-verification</a> for porn websites in the digital economy bill now under consideration. This will mean British porn sites will be accessed often only by credit card holders. To deal with foreign-based sites, ministers should revisit the idea that internet service providers should block porn unless customers ask that they do not. In the offline world, Tuesday\u2019s report makes many sensible recommendations for further action, including ensuring that Ofsted inspectors consider sexual harassment as well as other forms of bullying, and updating guidance to&#xa0;schools on how to tackle these problems.</p> <p>Most importantly, perhaps, is the need to combine zero tolerance of abuse with the fostering of positive attitudes towards sexuality. Sex education is compulsory in maintained secondary schools, and may be taught by primary schools.

  "<p>Some rules of politics are so widely observed that their existence only becomes apparent in the breach. So it was when the Conservative Ruth Davidson told an audience in London on Monday that the capital <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/JGForsyth/status/775310159589543936?p=v\" title=\"\">should count itself \u201cvery lucky\u201d to have Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan as its mayor</a>. They had met as pro-European debating partners in the referendum campaign. \u201cHe\u2019s the real deal,\u201d Davidson added. It was the present tense that made the remark stand out. Standard procedure for praising politicians from another party is to wait until their careers are over.</p> <p>It is relevant that Davidson is not a Westminster MP. She belongs to a new class of devolved politician, unbound by protocols of the ancient parliament. So now does Khan. His escape from that airless chamber was one of the most shrewdly executed career moves in recent memory. He and Davidson are still 100% political animals, but there is something free-range about their manner that casts a sad light on the battery-farming style of the Commons.</p> <p>Dread of the cage prompted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/12/david-cameron-to-stand-down-as-mp-for-witney\" title=\"\">David Cameron to quit his seat in parliament</a>. There is a high-minded attack on Cameron\u2019s decision that paints him as a selfish coward abandoning public service when it ceased to be glamorous: all constituency surgeries, no Chequers. In this view, former prime ministers should pin themselves to the green benches like campaign ribbons on a war veteran\u2019s tunic, signalling wisdom acquired in bloody service. Cameron knows that such a role is either disruptive or ceremonial. He could speak his mind, in which case every intervention would be deconstructed as a harsh verdict on Theresa May; stay silent; or stay away, in which case he would be damned for bunking off. He could be candid or stay in parliament, but not both.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The last thing MPs need now is to be forced into a brutal game of musical chairs against their colleagues</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Observing the rule about saving generosity for retirement tributes, Jeremy Corbyn warmly endorsed Cameron\u2019s choice. \u201cWe should respect someone who moves on to do something else with their lives,\u201d<a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/update/2016-09-12/corbyn-wishes-cameron-all-the-best-for-the-future/\" title=\"\"> the Labour leader said</a>, adding that he had always got on with his old adversary \u201con a human level\u201d. Corbyn would spend less time in the Commons too, if he could. His best years as a parliamentarian were spent in maverick rebellion, saluting no leader. But conscientious objectors do not make great commanding officers. Corbyn\u2019s preferred milieu these days is the open-air rally of willing supporters, not the claustrophobic cockpit of dissent, some mastery of which is inconveniently contained in his job description.</p> <p>Meanwhile the emergence of a grassroots movement on the left that venerates the Labour leader and vilifies most of his MPs is accelerating a flow of political energy away from parliament. The Corbynite ethos demands an adherence to lines of doctrine that is both more onerous than old-fashioned whipping, and less interested in the realities of the legislative process.</p> <p>A similar dynamic was unleashed by the EU referendum. The result hangs over MPs as a general order to satisfy the popular will, with no clarity about specifics. This puts the majority, who voted remain, in an invidious position. Their duty as legislators is to act in what they believe is the national interest, but if that impulse steers them towards a milder flavour of Brexit they will be accused by hardliners of traducing democracy. There is a paradoxical conflict between the constitutional primacy of MPs and the plebiscitary mandate that grew out of a Eurosceptic fixation on parliamentary sovereignty.</p> <p>The last thing MPs need in this context is a process that rips up their existing mandates, scraps 50 constituencies and forces them into a brutal game of musical chairs against their colleagues for the remaining seats.</p> <p>Yet that is what <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/13/corbyn-johnson-and-osborne-among-mps-hit-by-electoral-shakeup\" title=\"\">the boundary review</a>, published yesterday, achieves. There is logic to the reform: voters move around, and to equalise the numbers represented in each area the map needs periodic redrafting. But the latest application of that principle has been contaminated by partisanship from the start. Its aggressive promotion alongside a slapdash change to the voter registration system came about under the coalition government because the combined effect was sure to tilt the balance of newly allocated seats towards Conservatives (the Liberal Democrats tried to kill the reforms for the same reason).</p> <p>An unforeseen consequence is the opportunity that boundary changes now afford to pro-Corbyn activists, who can use a flurry of candidate selection contests to purge refusenik incumbents and replace them with loyalists. If Corbyn retains the leadership, as seems likely, Labour politics will retreat even further from the realm of wider public engagement and plunge into recesses of dark factional combat. Tory selection contests might be more civil, but they will not be immune from equivalent pressure on candidates to flatter members\u2019 obsessions \u2013 a mechanism that ratchets the party to ever greater heights of impractical Europhobia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/13/boundary-changes-labour-party-seats-mp\">This boundary gerrymandering is grotesque.

When the legislature needs to keep its eyes on the wider European horizon, its members will be haggling over minute slivers of domestic turf.</p> <p>When MPs need to lead from the front, they will be watching their backs. The process could hardly be better designed to make Westminster politics less attractive and less relevant to the challenges of the moment. Appropriately, the boundary review was first advertised as an indulgence to anti-politics rhetoric. David Cameron said a reduction in the number of seats would <a href=\"http://conservative-speeches.sayit.mysociety.org/speech/601316\" title=\"\">\u201ccut the cost of politics\u201d</a>, as if MPs are best understood as a burden on the taxpayer.</p> <p>The unfashionable truth is different. There is no more vital a component in British democracy than the diligent constituency MP. The duty to serve everyone in a seat regardless of political allegiance affords a depth of perspective and sensitivity to the contours of public opinion that refutes caricatures of an out-of-touch elite. And committed public servants in parliament outnumber the idlers, carpetbaggers and expenses-gobblers, most of whom have been weeded out in recent elections. You don\u2019t hear this often because of another unwritten rule: the busiest, most conscientious MPs are often the ones who are least complacent about a need for politics to change. So those who work hardest in Westminster do not dare to say in public that Westminster works at all.</p>",

  "<p>My colleague Harrison Spencer, who has died aged 71, was dean of the <a href=\"http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine</a> between 1996 and 2000.

This was a time when those in the fight against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/malaria\" title=\"\">malaria</a> could celebrate considerable success, such as the eradication of disease from southern Europe, but were confronting significant challenges elsewhere, including concerns about the persistence of DDT in the environment and resistance to insecticides and antimalarial medicines.</p> <p>After an initial posting to El Salvador, Harrison moved to the <a href=\"http://www.uonbi.ac.ke/\" title=\"\">University of Nairobi</a>, where he founded a new CDC research station. He gained a solid grounding in both the technical and, arguably more importantly, political challenges involved in eradicating malaria. He would later move to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organisation\" title=\"\">World Health Organisation</a> in Geneva and back to CDC, where he became head of its parasitic diseases branch.</p> <p>By the early 1990s he was ready for a move to academia and became dean of the <a href=\"http://www.sph.tulane.edu/\" title=\"\">Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine</a> in New Orleans. Later in the 1990s, as dean of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, he led a major expansion in the school\u2019s activities.</p> <p>His time overseas had convinced him that schools of public health in northern countries would have to reach out to students who would never be able to find the time or resources to come to them. He initiated an ambitious distance learning programme that since its inception has trained more than 8,000 health professionals from more than 130 countries.</p> <p>Harrison also recognised the need for new approaches to the many complex challenges facing global health, including climate change, mass migration, conflict and political and economic transition. He encouraged the development of research centres that broke down the traditional barriers between disciplines and connected researchers with policymakers.</p> <p>After London, he returned to Washington to lead the US <a href=\"http://www.aspph.org/\" title=\"\">Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health</a>, applying many of the same principles that had been so successful in London.

Over the next 20 years, Hugh and the team exerted an immense influence encouraging younger ornithologists and developing \u201ccitizen science\u201d networks of volunteer counters for annual monitoring of waterbird population sizes.</p> <p>They instigated multinational inquiries into bird migration routes, the ringing of swans, ducks and geese using novel techniques such as rocket netting and the study of bird behaviours at close range from specially constructed hides \u2013 all techniques we now take for granted in the management of contemporary migratory waterbird populations. At Slimbridge they created what one African professor has called \u201cthe white-hot world centre of waterbird research\u201d.

Hugh\u2019s outstanding talents were quickly recognised and he was made the CWS\u2019s chief of migratory birds. In this role he applied himself as much to fostering the growth of research on migratory passerines, seabirds and waders, as to the ducks, geese and swans about which he knew most.</p> <p>As a senior CWS staff member he wielded huge influence in promoting international cooperation on conservation of waterbird habitats, and was instrumental in persuading the Canadian government to play a crucial role in the development of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. Canada not only became one of the first state members in the Americas, but hosted a series of international meetings which led to first the US, then most of the central and aouthern American states, joining the convention. The Canadian government recognised his work by appointing him a member of the Order of Canada.</p> <p>Hugh was the son of Alice (nee Clark), a junior school teacher, and Henry Boyd, a pharmacist. Born in Bristol, he attended both the grammar school and university there.</p> <p>In 1954 he met Gillian Corin, a secretary at Slimbridge. They married two years later and had three sons.</p> <p>After his retirement in 1991, Hugh continued to study geese, celebrating his 80th birthday in Iceland observing Brent geese and publishing his last scientific article in 2012.</p> <p>He is survived by Gillian and their sons, Alastair, Duncan and Guy.</p>",

  "<p>The World Anti-Doping Agency on Tuesday night condemned the hacking of a confidential database by a Russian cyber-espionage group which leaked the personal files of several top American athletes, including the tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams and the gymnast Simone Biles, and promised that it would soon publish \u201csensational proof\u201d of famous athletes taking doping substances.</p> <p>Documents published on the Fancy Bear website appeared to show that Serena Williams had taken the restricted drugs prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisone, hydromorphone and oxycodone between 2010 and 2015, while her sister Venus had taken prednisone, prednisolone, triamcinolone and formoterol. Biles, meanwhile, was given methylphenidate for attention-deficit disorder. In all cases, however, Wada confirmed that the athletes had committed no offence because they had been granted therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) by the relevant international sports federations and national anti-doping organisations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/12/wada-hackers-athletes-drug-testing-information\">Wada targeted by hackers seeking athletes' drug testing data</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The International Olympic Committee said it \u201cstrongly condemned\u201d the cyber attack which it said was \u201cclearly aimed at tarnishing the reputation of clean athletes\u201d and confirmed the athletes mentioned had not violated any anti-doping rules during the Rio Olympics.</p> <p>Venus Williams said she was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that her medical data has been \u201ccompromised by hackers and published without \u2026 permission\u201d. She said in a statement: \u201cI have followed the rules established under the Tennis Anti-Doping Program in applying for, and being granted, \u2018therapeutic use exemptions\u2019. The applications for TUEs under the Tennis Anti-Doping Program require a strict process of approval which I have adhered to when serious medical conditions have occurred.\u201d The 36-year-old added she was \u201cone of the strongest supporters of maintaining the highest level of integrity in competitive sport\u201d.</p> <p>Speaking about Biles, Steve Penny, president of USA Gymnastics, said: \u201cSimone has filed the proper paperwork per Usada and Wada requirements and there is no violation. The International Gymnastics Federation, the United States Olympic Committee and Usada have confirmed this.\u201d</p> <p>Biles added in a short statement on her Twitter page: \u201cI have ADHD and I have taken medicine for it since I was a kid.

Its director general, Olivier Niggli, insisted he \u201cdeeply regretted\u201d the violation and was \u201cvery conscious of the threat that it represents to athletes whose confidential information has been divulged through this criminal act\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWada condemns these ongoing cyber attacks that are being carried out in an attempt to undermine Wada and the global anti-doping system. Wada has been informed by law enforcement authorities that these attacks are originating out of Russia. Let it be known that these criminal acts are greatly compromising the effort by the global anti-doping community to re-establish trust in Russia further to the outcomes of the Agency\u2019s independent McLaren Investigation Report.\u201d</p> <p>The attack raises worrying questions for athletes\u2019 privacy as well as Wada\u2019s security systems. Last month Yuliya Stepanova \u2013 the key whistleblower for Wada\u2019s Independent Pound Commission that exposed widespread doping in Russian athletics \u2013 had her password for Adams illegally obtained. However, Wada insisted it was taking the attack seriously and was working with law-enforcement agencies to protect itself and its athletes from being hacked.</p> <p>Several figures in the anti-doping community told the Guardian they believed the hack was not only a retaliation against Wada, which published a scathing report on the Russian government\u2019s vast cover\u2011up of doping during the Sochi Winter Games in 2014, but also an attempt by the Russian authorities to persuade their own people that the problems in their country were just as bad elsewhere. Some of the strongest criticism came from Travis Tygaart, the head of Usada, who called the cyber attacks \u201ccowardly and despicable\u201d and reiterated that the athletes named had done nothing wrong. \u201cIt\u2019s unthinkable that in the Olympic movement, hackers would illegally obtain confidential medical information in an attempt to smear athletes to make it look as if they have done something wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThe athletes haven\u2019t. In fact, in each of the situations, the athlete has done everything right in adhering to the global rules for obtaining permission to use a needed medication. The cyber-bullying of innocent athletes being engaged in by these hackers is cowardly and despicable. It is time for the entire international community to stand up and condemn this cyber attack on clean sport and athletes\u2019 rights.\u201d</p> <p>But Fancy Bear, which has links to its country\u2019s security agency GRU and has previously been accused of defacing Wada\u2019s website, accessing the private whereabouts details of Stepanova, and hacking into the Democratic National Committee, promised it would release more information in the coming weeks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/13/four-russian-athletes-sanctioned-ioc-failed-drugs-tests\">Four more Russian athletes sanctioned by IOC for failed drugs tests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe are going to tell you how Olympic medals are won,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hacked World Anti-Doping Agency databases and were shocked with what we saw. We will start with the US team which disgraced itself by tainted victories. We will also disclose exclusive information about other national Olympic teams later. Wait for sensational proof of famous athletes taking doping substance any time soon.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the British javelin thrower Goldie Sayers and the GB men\u2019s 4x400m relay team found out on Tuesday night that their fourth places at the 2008 Beijing Olympics would be upgraded to bronze after official confirmation that their Russian rivals have retrospectively failed drug tests.</p> <p>The IOC confirmed that the javelin silver medallist Mariya Abakumova and the 400m runner Denis Alexeev, a member of the bronze medal-winning relay team, had tested positive for the banned substance dehydrochlormethyltestosterone at the Games following the retesting of their samples earlier this year and as a result been disqualified and ordered to return their medals.</p> <p>The entire Russian relay team have been disqualified as a result of Alexeev\u2019s doping, meaning the British squad of Andrew Steele, Robert Tobin, Michael Bingham and Martyn Rooney will move up from fourth place. The IOC also announced that Inga Abitova, who finished sixth in the 10,000m in Beijing, had also failed a retrospective drug test, as has the cyclist Ekaterina Gnidenko, who finished eighth in the keirin at London 2012.</p>",
  "<p>Each year, I look so forward to Eid Al Adha \u2013 the holiest holiday for Muslims worldwide \u2013 but not this year. As I watched my daughters prepare for the celebrations with joy, I learned of a horrific crime. A 36-year-old woman dressed in traditional garb was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/muslim-woman-set-on-firenew-york-police-search\">set on fire</a> on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. She was the same age as me, walking in the city where I was born and raised. This comes at the heels of two Muslim women in Brooklyn who were <a href=\"http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Woman-Attacks-2-Muslim-Women-Tries-to-Rip-Their-Hijabs-off-393012361.html\">physically assaulted</a> by a woman as they pushed their babies in strollers.</p> <p>As if this news wasn\u2019t enough, we also learned that a mosque in Fort Pierce, Florida, which Omar Mateen reportedly used to visit, had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/12/mosque-fire-arson-orlando-shooter-video\">set on fire</a>. They had to cancel their planned holiday celebrations as a result. How could I enjoy the day without thinking of them? Instead of celebrating as planned, the community in Florida has to explain to their children why someone would intentionally set their place of worship, their sanctuary, on fire the night before the highest holy holiday.</p> <p>These horrific acts follow the execution style murders of an imam and his assistant in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/15/imam-maulama-akonjee-fatal-shooting-new-york-muslim-community-funeral-thara-uddin\">Ozone Park</a>, and the stabbing of a 60-year old Muslim woman in Queens. These are only the stories that make the headlines. I don\u2019t think we know the extent of the impact, trauma and pain of Muslim communities nationwide.</p> <p>Muslim Americans found themselves caught in a conversation about how close Eid Al Adha was to the 15th anniversary of 9/11. Pundits wondered whether Muslims would alter their annual Eid celebrations for sensitivity purposes. This insinuation both disappointed and outraged me. Muslims, like any other faith community, deserve to be Muslim, and celebrate their high holy holidays. We would never ask that of any other faith community and it should never be asked or implied to Muslim Americans. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/12/mosque-fire-arson-orlando-shooter-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/52yep\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2712283\"            data-video-name=\"Fire at mosque of Orlando shooter may be arson, say police \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters/NBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d6cfcee4b013613fffc869\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/12/160912orlando2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/12/160912orlando2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11872644&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/12/mosque-fire-arson-orlando-shooter-video\">Fire at mosque of Orlando shooter may be arson, say police</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Muslim American communities are facing the most hostile civic and political environment since days, weeks and months after 9/11. Hate crimes against Muslims or those perceived to be Muslim has risen exponentially in the last year. All people of faith, Muslims included, should be able to practice their religion freely without fear and intimidation. Bigotry against Muslims has become the norm and often has no consequences. The irresponsible and rhetorical vilification of Muslims in this current election cycle is leading to violent acts against members of a faith community and it must stop. </p> <p>It is time for all Americans to speak out. When we allow one faith community to be targets then we open the doors for others to be targeted. I believe the worst is yet to come unless more people actively intervene with their voices, their votes and in public acts of solidarity with their Muslim neighbors. In a time of growing tensions we must uphold our fundamental freedom to worship in the land of religious freedom and its why I choose to be unapologetically Muslim every day. As a Muslim woman, not only is wearing my religious headscarf in public an act of faith, but it has become an act of courage. </p>",
  "<p>On 6 June 2013, the Guardian broke the news National Security Agency (NSA) had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order\">ordered Verizon</a> to provide it with the phone records of its customers. As the story developed it became clear that the <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324299104578529112289298922\">two other major telephone networks</a> as well as credit card companies were doing the same thing; and that the NSA and FBI were being provided with access to server systems operated by Google, Apple, Facebook, Yahoo, Microsoft and Skype.</p> <p>On 11 June the Guardian reported the source as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance\">Edward Snowden</a>, a 29-year-old who had been working at the NSA for four years.</p> <p>Snowden believed it was important for him to publicly acknowledge his role in order to provide a human face to the story. He knew he was putting his life at risk and exposing himself to decades of incarceration. \u201cMy sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them,\u201d he explained. Snowden hoped to trigger a debate \u201cabout the kind of world we want to live in\u201d. The US government began an immediate campaign to track, harass and silence him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/edward-snowden-why-barack-obama-should-grant-me-a-pardon\">Edward Snowden makes 'moral' case for presidential pardon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More revelations followed that exposed a massive national security complex that spies on virtually everyone, everywhere. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA), which is a secret court that was supposed to protect our privacy rights, was rubber-stamping every NSA request for the authority to spy without any real oversight. The US government was spying on foreign leaders, working with British spies to collect massive amounts of global data across the planet, and collecting over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/16/nsa-collects-millions-text-messages-daily-untargeted-global-sweep\">200 million text messages</a> daily. And the NSA was working to stop encryption (a technology developed to protect the privacy of both private individuals and businesses).</p> <p>NSA director James Clapper was forced to acknowledge that he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/02/james-clapper-senate-erroneous\">given false testimony</a> to Congress about NSA spying on Americans, and that Snowden\u2019s leaks had created a healthy public debate about the balance between privacy and national security. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that some of the conversations this has generated, some of the debate, actually needed to happen,\u201d he said. Even Barack Obama admitted that the revelations required the US to re-think how we uphold \u201cthe civil liberties and privacy protections that our ideals \u2013 and our Constitution \u2013 require.\u201d</p> <p>Federal judges ruled that such massive collection of citizens\u2019 metadata without any connection to a particular investigation was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/us/nsa-phone-records-collection-ruled-illegal-by-appeals-court.html\">patently illegal</a>, essentially vindicating Snowden. His goal was to tell the truth about the government spying on all of us, and to create public and judicial pressure on the government to create real changes in the way things are done and to stop the trajectory towards a surveillance state.</p> <p>Snowden\u2019s whistleblowing was among the most important in US history. It showed us that the relationship between the people of the United States and the government has gone off track and needs a major course correction.</p> <p>The fourth amendment of the constitution provides that a court must find probable cause that an individual has committed a crime before issuing a warrant, and forbids systematic spying on the American people. The requirement of individualized suspicion should prohibit this type of dragnet surveillance. Spying on whole populations is not necessary, and is actually counterproductive. </p> <p>If elected president I will immediately pardon Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning and John Kiriakou for their important work in exposing the massive, systematic violation of our constitutional rights. I would invite them to the White House to publicly acknowledge their heroism, and create a role for them in the Stein-Baraka Green party administration to help us create a modern framework that protects personal privacy while still conducting effective investigations where warranted.</p> <p>The American people have a right to privacy. My hope is that Obama uses his power to pardon Snowden now. The debate he began must be continued so we find a resolution that protects the freedom of press, association, religion and speech as well as the privacy of people in the United States and around the world.</p>",
  "<p>To some, he will resemble a ghost at the feast \u2013 a reminder to football\u2019s twisted and dysfunctional family of the sins of their fathers. But for many more of the delegates from Uefa\u2019s 55 members gathered to elect their next president at the Astir Palace Beach Resort in Athens, the surprise address from Michel Platini will be warmly welcomed.</p> <p>Ever since the three-times world footballer of the year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/09/michel-platini-cas-appeal-ban-football\" title=\"\">became embroiled in a Byzantine scandal</a> concerning a \u00a31.35m \u201cdisloyal payment\u201d from the similarly disgraced Fifa president Sepp Blatter, many in Europe have remained loyal to their former leader.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/12/michel-platini-address-uefa-congress-despite-four-year-football-ban-fifa\">Michel Platini to address Uefa congress despite four-year football ban</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just as the collapse of global football governance does not seem to have dented the desire of its power brokers to meet in luxurious surroundings (the venue for their congress nestles in \u201c75 acres of sun-drenched gardens on a pine-dotted private peninsula\u201d according to its website), so the election to decide Platini\u2019s successor seems to have heralded a return to business as usual.</p> <p>So it is that an election that has boiled down to two candidates \u2013 the little known but hotly tipped Slovenian Aleksander Ceferin and the veteran former <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/07/fa-announce-backing-for-michael-van-praag-in-race-to-be-uefa-president\" title=\"\">Dutch FA chief Michael van Praag</a> \u2013 has taken place largely in the shadows.</p> <p>Bizarrely, despite his ban from all football-related activities (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/09/michel-platini-cas-appeal-ban-football\" title=\"\">reduced to four years on appeal</a>), Platini has been given a dispensation on \u201chumanitarian grounds\u201d to address the congress on Wednesday.</p> <p>Given Platini referred to himself in an interview last year as an Icarus-like figure, there is a certain poetic justice in his Greek tragedy coming full circle in Athens. The suspicion of some of those supportive of Van Praag, the capable administrator who failed in a bid to challenge Blatter earlier this year and threw his weight behind the similarly doomed Prince Ali of Jordan, is that the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, may have had some influence in the decision to allow Platini to speak.</p> <p>As outlined in an excellent, lengthy summary on the <a href=\"http://twohundredpercent.net/democracy-uefa-style/\" title=\"\">Two Hundred Percent website</a>, the latter stages of the campaign have been studded by the usual wearying claims of backroom dealing.</p> <p>Ceferin, a 48-year-old lawyer who has been president of the Slovenian FA since 2011, is said to enjoy the backing of Infantino, who until he was unexpectedly pitched into the Fifa race was Uefa\u2019s secretary-general.</p> <p>The Fifa president was alleged by the Dutch newspaper De Volksrant to have sent an adviser to a meeting of northern European FAs to lobby on Ceferin\u2019s behalf before the Champions League final on 28 May. Ceferin had been invited to the meeting to discuss his plans for his prospective candidacy. Before Ceferin had even announced his campaign, the Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish FAs had come out in favour of his candidacy.</p> <p>The adviser sent to the May meeting was the Norwegian FA\u2019s secretary-general Kjetil Siem, who was announced as Infantino\u2019s \u201cdirector of strategic affairs\u201d on 18 May. Fifa said Siem was still working for the Norwegian FA at the time of the meeting.</p> <p>An investigation by the Norwegian football magazine Josimar detailed allegations that Siem worked to gather votes for Ceferin and in return promised seats on Uefa\u2019s board and favourable consideration for tournament bids. Ceferin angrily called the claims \u201calmost completely not true\u201d and said it was \u201ca lie\u201d Siem had pledged Infantino\u2019s support.</p> <p>Ceferin is the favourite, with the confirmed support of at least 17 smaller nations as well as France, Germany and \u2013 perhaps crucially \u2013 Russia. In total, as many as 35 federations are believed to have declared support for Ceferin. Like Blatter, he has pursued a strategy of positioning himself as the man who will stand up for the little guys. In a one-member, one-vote election it is a sensible move. Safe in the knowledge the recent Champions League deal that favoured bigger European clubs in order to head off breakaway threats cannot be unpicked, Ceferin can now afford to say he will stand up for smaller countries in future.</p> <p>\u201cThose changes are clearly not in favour of small and mid-sized associations,\u201d he said. \u201cThe process was not good. The clubs didn\u2019t know anything about it and that should be changed in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond the bare bones of his CV, little is known about Ceferin. In many ways he appears similar to Infantino \u2013 a plausible, multi-lingual lawyer with a smooth manner. That is less of a compliment than it once may have appeared in light of Infantino\u2019s increasingly egocentric approach to the huge challenges at Fifa.</p> <p>Those with a glass half-full mentality may harbour hopes a new man atop European football with an avowed mission to level the playing field could be a positive force. Those who have grown cynical watching the machinations at Fifa and Uefa down the years are instead wondering who is really pulling the strings. Even they, however, take some comfort from the fact the veteran Spanish Fifa executive committee member \u00c1ngel Mar\u00eda Villar Llona was forced to withdraw owing to lack of support.</p> <p>It was Villar Llona who was investigated in connection with an alleged vote swapping deal with Qatar during the tainted 2018-22 World Cup bidding process, before trying to shut down <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/13/farce-fifa-michael-garcia-erroneous-ethics-report\" title=\"\">Michael Garcia\u2019s investigation</a>. His withdrawal was one final humiliation for the old guard.</p> <p>Yet even as Uefa has remained without a leader in light of Platini\u2019s enforced absence, the machine has rolled on. The expanded Euro 2016 made a huge profit despite concerns over the new format and, following much sabre rattling, that crucial deal over the future of the Champions League has been secured. In other words, behind the politicking the popularity of modern football means the cash continues to roll in as never before.</p> <p>The English FA finds itself in a familiar bind. On the one hand it has thrown its backing behind Van Praag in the knowledge his agenda is closest to its own. On the other, it is loath to create too many waves in the knowledge that thanks to the former Manchester United chief executive David Gill it has more clout in the Fifa and Uefa corridors of power than at any time for the past two decades.</p> <p>\u201cHe is someone we have come to know very well and worked closely with in recent years, particularly because of our shared commitment to securing Fifa reform,\u201d said Gill, the FA\u2019s vice-chairman and Uefa executive committee member, explaining the decision last week. \u201cAs Uefa president, Mr Van Praag would be able to provide the strong and credible leadership European football requires at a crucial moment for the global game.\u201d</p> <p>The Football Association of Ireland has thrown its backing behind Ceferin. \u201cHe has been a very progressive and extremely innovative leader in his native Slovenia and his successful candidacy would be a very positive move for European football and the administration as a whole,\u201d said the chief executive, John Delaney.</p> <p>The manifestos of the candidates, both 17 pages long and crammed full of the sort of motherhood and apple pie sentiments that will be familiar to any student of global sports politics, provide little clue as to how they would approach the role.</p> <p>Even if, as in most recent elections, the FA ends up backing the loser there is confidence its hard-won influence will not be affected. As well as Gill, the FA chief executive, Martin Glenn, and the chairman, Greg Clarke, will also travel to Athens.</p> <p>The first public engagement of the new president will be at a launch in London next week for Platini\u2019s one-off, continent-wide Euro 2020 competition, the semi-finals and final of which will be at Wembley.</p> <p>For those who hoped the lurid collapse of Fifa would herald a new age, the manoeuvrings of recent months have been a depressing reminder that the more things change, the more they appear to stay the same.</p>",

The government wants to cut the size of the House of Commons from 650 MPs to 600 MPs and today we are getting draft plans for new boundaries for England and Wales. Labour is said to be overrepresented in the current House of Commons, on the basis of the number of voters per Labour constituency compared to number of voters per Conservative constituency, and if the changes are actually implemented, the Conservatives will almost certainly benefit. But the \u201cif\u201d is important. The Tories tried, and failed, to implement boundary changes in the last parliament and it is quite possible that rebel Tory MPs, unhappy about the prospect of losing their seats, could block the process again.</p> <p>Partly this is a story about electoral politics, and the way the voting system impacts on the Conservative/Labour battle. But redrawing boundaries means MPs end up fighting colleagues from the same party for the right to represent the new and most winnable constituencies. This is never an easy process at the best of times, but it poses a particular challenge for Labour, where some grassroots activists are looking for an opportunity to purge MPs disloyal to Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>Here is our splash on the story.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/13/corbyn-johnson-and-osborne-among-mps-hit-by-electoral-shakeup\">Jeremy Corbyn, Boris Johnson and George Osborne among MPs hit by boundary shakeup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And here you can read more details of the proposals in full.</p> <ul> <li>Here is <a href=\"http://boundarycommissionforengland.independent.gov.uk/2018-boundary-review-initial-proposals-launched/\">the press notice from the Boundary Commission for England. </a>And here is <a href=\"http://www.bce2018.org.uk/\">the consultation page, </a>where you can find details of the proposals constituency by constituency.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Here is<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-37338042\"> a guide to the plans for Wales.</a> And here is <a href=\"http://bcomm-wales.gov.uk/?lang=en\">the Boundary Commission for Wales website.</a></li> </ul> <p>The plans for Northern Ireland were <a href=\"https://www.boundarycommission.org.uk/news\">published by the Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland last week.</a> And <a href=\"http://www.bcomm-scotland.independent.gov.uk/\">the Boundary Commission for Scotland</a> is due to publish its proposals in October.</p> <p>Labour has been criticising the plans mainly on the grounds that they are not based on the most up-to-date electoral registration figures.

These are the norms that cause the underrepresentation of <a href=\"http://www.iop.org/publications/iop/2013/closingdoors/\">girls studying physics</a> at A-level and boys taking up careers in <a href=\"https://www.nursingtimes.net/why-are-there-so-few-men-in-nursing/849269.article\">nursing</a>. These norms mean that girls get teased for playing sport, an allegedly \u201cmasculine\u201d pursuit. These same norms feed into the idea that girls\u2019 bodies are inherently sexual and enticing to boys and men, who cannot control their desires.</p> <p>As educators, we have an important role in building cultures of consent and respect among our students. Here are three simple steps you can take in your classroom:<br></p> <h2>Challenge sexist language</h2> <p>When you hear a sexist comment, don\u2019t think of it as a drain on your subject teaching time, but a useful teachable moment. I\u2019ve certainly been guilty of responding with a cursory \u201cPlease don\u2019t use that language in my classroom\u201d, suggesting that the comment is mildly offensive and inconsequential, or \u2013 worse \u2013 not allowed within the formal teaching environment, but acceptable elsewhere. </p> <p>Blaming and shaming young people for saying such things only encourages them to say it in private, it doesn\u2019t stop it from happening. Instead, see these comments as opportunities to engage students in critical thinking: explore what was said, and why. This approach allows you to bring learning to all students in the class.</p> <p>Questions could include:<br></p> <ul> <li>What made you say that?<br></li> <li>Do you think it\u2019s true?<br></li> <li>Is there any evidence that it may not be the case?<br></li> <li>What do you think the consequences are of saying what you\u2019ve said?</li> </ul> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/20/six-best-sex-education-programmes-around-the-world\">Six of the best sex education programmes around the world</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Deal with causes, not consequences</h2> <p>Imagine you are a headteacher and you are told that two boys sexually harassed a girl while they were all playing sport at lunchtime. What do you do? You could ban the mixed playing of sport going forward. This is a common response.<br></p> <p>But the root of the issue is not that the girls and boys were playing sport together. The problem was that, in this scenario, boys touched a girl non-consensually. Treating the symptom rather than the cause does not create a safe learning environment or healthy relationships. So what could be done instead?</p> <p>You need to engage the students responsible in a frank discussion about their behaviour. Help them to understand why what they did was harmful. <a href=\"http://www.rasasc.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Young-People-I-Heart-Consent-workshopsback-and-front.pdf\">Ensure that they understand the meaning of consent</a>.<br></p> <p>As for the victim of the harassment: it is imperative that they receive a clear message from staff that what happened was not their fault. They did not provoke the behaviour. They are not to blame.<br></p> <p>Your own school behaviour management policy will guide the punishment, but it is important that you don\u2019t ban the activity or environment where the harassment has taken place (whether it is girls and boys sitting next to one another in class or young people hugging in the playground). Doing so tells young people that sexual harassment is a result of an unsuitable activity or environment, not an unacceptable behaviour itself.<br></p> <h2>Examine your own assumptions</h2> <p>The way we engage with inequality shapes the learning of the young people we are teaching. Look at the way you treat girls and boys, and think about the assumptions you may be subconsciously bringing into the classroom. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/oct/01/young-human-rights-reporter-competition\">How to teach ... human rights</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We need to interrogate why we do these things, and develop our skills and knowledge. Without doing this important work ourselves, as teachers and school leaders, we\u2019ll be unable to truly support young people to move beyond thinking these things too.</p> <p>To move away from a world that allows sexual harassment and violence to happen, we must ensure everyone\u2019s right to participate in education free from fear, in a culture underpinned by mutual respect.

You messed with the club. We\u2019ll kill you with Aids, you faggot,\u201d read one.</p> <p>Another message, featuring a photograph of a handgun and bullets, said: \u201cNot long left to live, faggot.\u201d </p> <p>Tomillero said he had begun receiving the messages after posting details of what happened at the match.</p> <p>\u201cI go the first one about three o\u2019clock yesterday afternoon,\u201d he told the Guardian on Tuesday. \u201cIt said: \u2018Reporting this was a mistake, Jes\u00fas.

But we got into a taxi and went to the police. They\u2019re investigating the case, not just here but all over Spain.

The final straw came when someone shouted from the stands: \u201cThat\u2019s that poof who was on the telly \u2026 You can stick the goal up your arse, you fucking poof.\u201d</p> <p>Worse than the homophobic slurs themselves, Tomillero <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/10/spains-gay-referee-football-abuse-jesus-tomillero\">said at the time</a>, was the fact that everyone in the crowd then laughed.</p> <p>Spain has generally embraced sexual tolerance since the death of General Franco in 1975, and became the third European country to legalise same-sex marriage, in 2005. </p> <p>A survey conducted three years ago suggested Spain was the most accepting country in Europe when it came to homosexuality, with <a href=\"http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/06/04/the-global-divide-on-homosexuality/\">88% of respondents</a> saying society should accept it. </p> <p>But prejudice remains a problem.

  "<p>Fifteen years ago I made the fateful decision to travel from my home in New York to Berlin to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/radiohead\">Radiohead</a> perform. At the time, I worked as a radio producer at the BBC\u2019s New York bureau, and the date on my ticket had yet to acquire its tragic significance: 11 September 2001. Like many other people, that day is seared into my brain: a day of horror, disbelief, anger and sadness, and all of it \u2013 for me \u2013 forever associated with the sublime music of Radiohead.<br></p> <p> Last Sunday, Radiohead were back in Berlin, performing as the headlining act of the <a href=\"http://www.lollapaloozade.com/\">Lollapalooza Berlin</a> festival, the date of their show falling on the 15th anniversary of 9/11. I made the trip back to see a band that had provided a significant soundtrack to my life so far, believing this moment would be among other things a point of reflection on that dark day. It seemed unlikely that the band\u2019s famously taciturn lead singer, Thom Yorke, would say anything about that historic anniversary, and yet there always seems to be a heartbreaking line in his elliptical lyrics that says it all. \u201cAnd it\u2019s too late / The damage is done,\u201d Yorke sings in the recent song Daydreaming. That feels about right to me.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTAU7lLDZYU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TTAU7lLDZYU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p> On that late summer\u2019s evening at Treptower Park, the events of 15 years ago perhaps seemed far away, even as the world commemorated. Certainly the mood among the estimated 60,000 people who attended this concert was mellow and positive \u2013 a far cry from the heightened, edgy state of alert that defined the 9/11 concert, which took place in an outdoor amphitheatre in Wuhlheide Park. The coincidence of the dates wasn\u2019t missed by the German newspapers, which recalled the 2001 event as a \u201cspooky and rainy night\u201d.</p> <p> If anyone needed reminding that the repercussions of 9/11 were still being felt, the very location of Lollapalooza Berlin was testimony to that. The festival was supposed to take place on the grounds of the now-defunct Tempelhof airport, where its debut was held in 2015. But in the year since, Germany has welcomed more than a million refugees and, as of two weeks ago, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/fluechtlinge-im-berliner-flughafen-tempelhof-notunterkunft-bedeutet-das-aus-fuer-event-ort/12882334.html\">is currently housing nearly 1,500 refugees at Tempelhof, according to several German newspapers</a>. It\u2019s not difficult to make the connection between the legacy of 9/11 and the present refugee crisis resulting from war in Syria and violence in the Middle East.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/may/08/radiohead-a-moon-shaped-pool-review\">Radiohead: A Moon Shaped Pool review \u2013 something they've never achieved before</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Radiohead started their set on Sunday with the first five tracks from their newest album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/may/08/radiohead-a-moon-shaped-pool-review\">A Moon Shaped Pool</a>. The stage was drenched in red light as the band opened up with Burn the Witch, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/04/johnny-greenwood-radiohead-burn-the-witch-strings\">Jonny Greenwood using a bow on his electric guitar to approximate the nervy <em>col legno </em>strings that open the track</a>. Yorke sings, \u201cThis is a low-flying panic attack.\u201d That urgency gave way to the drifting beauty of Daydreaming, and soon we were inside that melancholy ambience \u2013 the mystery of music able to change the nature of the air \u2013 that is specific to Radiohead.</p> <p> The atmosphere on 11 September 2001 was of a different order, an extraordinary sensory event in my life. I remember a series of impressions: the walk from the S-Bahn through the dark forest of the park; the rain starting to pour; my awareness of being deep within the former East Berlin, a novelty for me that seemed to add historical darkness to my sense of place; the banks of fluorescent white lights on the stage (my friend commenting that this was a homage to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAj2iX9xqCo\">David Bowie\u2019s 1976 White Light Tour</a>); a state of vulnerability and anxiety and, perhaps, guilt over going to a musical event after the horror of the day. If apocalypse was upon us \u2013 as many felt \u2013 then all we needed was a soundtrack, and who better to supply it than Radiohead, a band whose music charted fear, alienation and paranoia, but also made it OK to feel those things. And here we were, the band kicking off with sampled German talk radio before the raspy fuzz of the bass loop that defines The National Anthem: \u201cEveryone is so near / Everyone has got the fear.\u201d </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/51713268\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/51713268\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p> Thirty-eight minutes passed before Yorke said: \u201cI\u2019m trying not to say anything. Well, what the fuck are you going to say after today? You know. There\u2019s absolutely nothing <em>to</em> say.\u201d After that, the band launched into a ferocious version of Airbag, from OK Computer, Greenwood ripping the opening/closing guitar riff with a vengeance. Was there a sense that the band was out of sorts? Why wouldn\u2019t they be? Then, after the disorienting affect of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3M_Gg1xAHE4\">Pyramid Song</a>, something happened. Yorke said: \u201cSo who here doesn\u2019t know about it? Everybody knows what I\u2019m talking about?\u201d Clearly some people did not. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about? You don\u2019t know about the aeroplanes in America?</p> <p>\u201cSomebody tell them,\u201d said Yorke. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p> <p>Yorke explained what had happened in New York and Washington DC. There was still a degree of uncertainty about the facts (and in 2001, it wasn\u2019t as if people had iPhones to give them updates). I was already aware of the news, having been glued to BBC World television all day long in a friend\u2019s flat, watching the pictures from New York with disbelief \u2013 and here was Yorke talking about it. It was surreal and unsettling. \u201cSo \u2026 that\u2019s why, you know, things are a little mute tonight,\u201d Yorke says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. This is called Paranoid Android.\u201d</p> <p>If the crowd was looking for some kind of communion in its fear and anxiety, in its grief and empathy, Paranoid Android was the song that opened the floodgates. By the time the song broke into its hymn-like invocation, with Yorke singing, \u201cRain down / Come on rain down on me / From a great height,\u201d it was both a lament and a glorious catharsis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3498d534efe8f38cf8bf7eb1d118380daa0dfec7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3498d534efe8f38cf8bf7eb1d118380daa0dfec7/0_0_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thom Yorke and Colin Greenwood (back) perform at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, 16 August 2001.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thom Yorke and Colin Greenwood (back) perform at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, 16 August 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STR/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Toward the climax of the concert, Yorke returned to the news, dedicating the song You and Whose Army (albeit in a hesitant manner) to the Bush administration. The playground posturing of the lyrics with their \u201cCome on if you think / You can take us on\u201d line is undercut by the defeated air of the music. There\u2019s nothing triumphant here, but it was a song that perfectly captured the mood of weary defiance. And so to the final encore, Street Spirit, with Yorke\u2019s introduction articulating an unspoken fear: \u201cThis is hoping \u2026 George W Bush doesn\u2019t declare world war three.\u201d</p> <p> And fade out again. Fifteen years later, I still recall all the coiled anxiety of that moment. We didn\u2019t know there would be wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as a direct consequence of the September 11 attacks. But we knew there would be something. Of course we couldn\u2019t go home after the adrenaline surge of this epic concert. We walked to a bar, not quite knowing what to make of this strange mixture of uplift and dread, a combination that Radiohead have mastered. As my friend and I walked through the streets of Berlin, it was still raining, but we had already submitted to this. It felt only appropriate after such an invocation. And it afforded us one advantage: the concert posters advertising the Radiohead concert plastered on billboards and walls around the city were soaked through. The glue was wet. This allowed us to peel them off cleanly and roll them up like treasure maps. The black posters bore the image of a weeping devil, with the date \u2013 in European format \u2013 printed beneath, in bold white lettering: \u201c11.09.2001 BERLIN\u201d. Eventually I framed the poster, which now adorns my living room wall in New York \u2013 a prized possession.</p> <p> Of course Yorke didn\u2019t mention the 9/11 show at the Lollapalooza Berlin concert on Sunday. He was never going to. But it was all there in the songs, which, despite the balmy weather this time around, took me right back to the scene of the most important, emotionally charged gig I\u2019ve ever experienced. At the end of the set, I joined in with the crowd and we sang, \u201cFor a minute there / I lost myself.\u201d</p>",

An embryo could even be made by merging a skin cell with sperm from the same man.<br></p> <p>Perhaps more immediately, the research might help conservationists to maintain populations of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/04/eastern-gorilla-critically-endangered-illegal-hunting-iucn-red-list\">endangered animals</a> by giving them an alternative way to make embryos from rare creatures that can be carried to term in surrogate mothers.<br></p> <p>Robin Lovell-Badge, a geneticist at the <a href=\"https://www.crick.ac.uk/\">Francis Crick Institute</a>, who was not involved in the project, called the work a \u201ctechnical tour de force\u201d, adding: \u201cI\u2019m not surprised that the authors are excited about this.\u201d<br></p> <p>Writing in the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nature.com/ncomms/index.html\">Nature Communications</a> journal, the scientists described how they took mouse eggs and used chemicals to trick them into developing as if they had been fertilised. Known as parthenogenotes, these unusual embryos behave much like skin and other cells in the body.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The scientists next injected sperm into the embryos and found that rather than dying, they developed normally, and when transferred into female mice, led to apparently healthy mouse pups. The study shows that normal egg fertilisation is not the only way to mature a sperm into the form needed to make all the tissues in the body.<br></p> <p>In all, the researchers produced 30 pups with a success rate up to 24%. Some of the mice born in the latest study have gone on to have pups of their own, and some of these have had offspring too. The researchers said they have seen no sign that the procedure harms the animals.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Perry said his group hoped to study the potential for skin cells to replace eggs in future research. \u201cWill we be able to do that?

  "<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jul/09/the-phrase-economic-development-has-bad-associations-in-latin-america\">The phrase 'economic development' has bad associations  in Latin America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Development. Poverty. Africa. These are just three words on a page \u2013 almost no information at all \u2013 but how many realities did our readers just conjure? And how many thoughts filled the spaces in-between? Cover yourselves. Your biases are showing.</p> <p>In the last few decades, groundbreaking work by psychologists and behavioural economists has exposed unconscious biases in the way we think. And as the World Bank\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2015\">2015 World Development Report</a> points out, development professionals are not immune to these biases. There is a real possibility that seemingly unbiased and well-intentioned development professionals are capable of making consequential mistakes, with significant impacts upon the lives of others, namely the poor. The problem arises when mindsets are just that \u2013 set.</p> <h2>Systems of thinking</h2> <p>As the work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/feb/16/daniel-kahneman-thinking-fast-and-slow-tributes\">Daniel Kahneman</a> and Amos Tversky has shown, development professionals \u2013 like people generally \u2013 have two systems of thinking; the automatic and the deliberative. For the automatic, instead of performing complex rational calculations every time we need to make a decision, much of our thinking relies on pre-existing mental models and shortcuts. These are based on assumptions we create throughout our lives and that stem from our experiences and education. More often than not, these mental models are incomplete and shortcuts can lead us down the wrong path. Thinking automatically then becomes thinking harmfully.</p> <p>So what can be done? Awareness and acknowledgment of these problems must be followed by carefully-designed mechanisms and measures for counteracting these unthoughtful thought patterns. In other words, we need to combat this unintentionalism with intentionalism. But how? There is, perhaps, no system more explicitly dedicated to the business of (re)shaping mindsets than the educational system. This seems like the best place to begin trying to tackle this issue. </p> <h2>Underpinnings of behaviour</h2> <p>Take the <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/Publications/WDR/WDR%202015/Chapter-10.pdf\">four cognitive biases</a> (pdf), identified by the World Development Report, which have surfaced from recent findings on the psychological and social underpinnings of behaviour:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Thin simplification</strong> \u2013 when the number of policy options increases, the ability of people to evaluate them decreases critically, leading to greater influence of framing effects for the sake of simplification.<strong> </strong>In other words, the more options with which people are presented, the harder it becomes to make a decision and the more susceptible they are to being influenced by information \u2013 depending on how that information is presented.<br></li> <li><strong>Confirmation bias</strong> \u2013 when individuals selectively gather (or give differential weight to) certain information in order to support a previously held belief.<br></li> <li><strong>Sunk cost bias</strong> \u2013 when individuals tend to continue a project once an initial investment is made, and stopping a project would mean acknowledging that previously-allocated resources have been wasted.<br></li> <li><strong>The influence of context</strong> \u2013 when development practitioners do not fully understand the mindset and circumstances of those they are trying to help and fill the gaps with their own assumptions and perceptions.<br></li> </ul> <p>If we take the issue of thin simplification, it is evident that when dealing with complex issues and problems development agencies often apply standardised management tools and certain uniform approaches. But this behaviour discourages the kind of regular re-examination of the underlying assumptions about problems that a constantly evolving world necessitates. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/mar/05/does-west-care-development\">Does the west really care about development?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To combat this bias, development professionals need to learn how to identify a problem correctly, perhaps by working in a space where all assumptions and perspectives can be heard and challenged. This should be followed by the creation of a set of manageable goals with \u201csmall wins\u201d that contribute to the overall solution. </p> <p>Classrooms should be stressing collaborative techniques for identifying problems and thinking them through. In Columbia University\u2019s <a href=\"https://sipa.columbia.edu/news-center/article/new-mpa-dp-lab-enhances-learning-environments\">development practice lab</a>, for example, students are taught to create problem trees and then turn them into solution trees, before they work through how interventions might be measured and evaluated. In the course of 16 labs, high priority skills in the field of development are experimented and piloted in real world contexts to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andre-correa-dalmeida/the-meaning-of-practice-i_1_b_7479860.html\">enhance the role of practice</a>. </p> <p>What about confirmation bias? Placing students into situations in which they are exposed to multiple and divergent viewpoints, large data sets, and new information and communication technology, forces them to produce the best versions of their arguments. When this is done in groups, it provides the social pressure to debate in an articulate and compelling way. For instance, orchestrating intentionally adversarial setups, known as \u201cred teaming\u201d, through role play or by introducing people with different viewpoints, prompts perspective shifts.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Too often, solutions are designed by people who don't understand the cultural norms of the people they seek to serve</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The battle of the sunk cost bias is one of changing attitudes. Under the watchful eye of donors, there is a pressure to not recognise failure. It might not be covered up, but failure is not broadcast or shared alongside best practices, where such stories might actually be useful. While most people would agree that failure is part of life, there seems to be a pretence that the development world should somehow be immune, that colourful vignettes of successful projects should be shared the widest. Acknowledging that resources have been wasted \u2013 even if that decision means redirecting them towards programmes and projects where they could make a real and positive impact \u2013 is seen as something to be ashamed of. </p> <p>Educational programmes and respected instructors might fight this notion by setting the example of openly discussing failures in their own work, as well as what they gleaned from these failures. As Einstein once observed: \u201cThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.\u201d If we are only sharing the successful half of what we are doing (and half may be a generous estimate), we allow the entire unsuccessful half to repeat itself, without caveat. How can we expect different results when there is a culture of hiding some of them? It\u2019s time to restore sense, not perpetuate insanity.</p> <p>Lastly, we come to context. There urgently needs to be a recognition of the two-way street whereby mindsets not only shape poverty, but where poverty shapes mindsets. The manner in which development practitioners perceive the poor and their problems greatly affects how development interventions are created, implemented and assessed. Too often, solutions are designed by people who do not share or understand the cultural norms, dispositions, history, or mindsets of the people they seek to serve. </p> <h2>Intelligence training</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/mar/08/secret-aid-worker-buzzwords-are-killing-development-human-centred-grassroots\">Secret aid worker: buzzwords are killing development</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.aud.ac.in/academic/programs/masters_programmes-2/mphil_programme_in_development_practice-594\">Immersion programmes</a> are useful for practitioners to walk a mile in the shoes of the poor, internalise their problems, and motivate more contextually driven solutions \u2013 though they may be time intensive and require significant travel resources. However, this kind of social and emotional intelligence training in an institutional system that seems to place a pre-eminence on conventional intelligence (IQ) is arguably worth the investment. Educational programmes should therefore make it their priority to sponsor their students to travel and work in developing country settings for a set period of time, as is done at Columbia\u2019s <a href=\"https://sipa.columbia.edu/academics/programs/MPA-DP/summer-placement-profiles\">summer placement programme</a> at the School of International and Public Affairs\u2019 masters in development practice.</p> <p>The educational system can be a powerful lever of change for building the support systems needed to tackle the unconscious biases development professionals face while addressing monumental global development challenges. With three billion people, nearly half the world\u2019s population, living on less than $2.50 (\u00a31.90) per day, the case is urgent.

In recent months, there has been a spate of men stepping up to foist their own, less informed perspectives on far more qualified women.</p> <p>At a rally last week, Donald Trump got in on the act.

These interactions are the visible manifestation of societal assumptions about women\u2019s inferiority in intellectual and professional situations. They represent the same ingrained stereotypes that lead to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/mar/20/highereducation.uk5\">women being less frequently promoted</a> or hired for certain jobs. </p> <p>The same issues are at play when women find themselves being spoken over in the workplace, when a client directs every question to a junior male colleague or when a woman makes a suggestion in a meeting and is ignored, only for the same idea to be voiced by a male colleague, to loud agreement, moments later. It is what writer <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/soraya-chemaly/10-ways-society-can-close-the-confidence-gap_b_5200419.html\">Soraya Chemaly has described as</a> \u201cgood old-fashioned sexism expressed in gendered socialization and a default cultural preference for institutionalized male domination of public life\u201d.</p> <p>However, as Chemaly points out, the way to fix it isn\u2019t simply to suggest that women need to be more assertive, as we are often told. The problem doesn\u2019t spring from hesitant women wringing their hands and dithering until a heroic man rides in and provides an explanation. The aforementioned astronaut, astrophysicist, Marine Corp veteran and Olympic cyclist hardly fit that description. </p> <p>No, it arises when men are brought up in a world that teaches them that their knowledge and opinions are worth more than those of a far more qualified woman. It happens when some men act on these ingrained assumptions. And its impact, particularly in the workplace, can go far beyond the initial annoyance.

And this has not been spread evenly across the whole economy, but has been concentrated in some local labor markets that have faced deep, long-lasting effects from overseas competition.\u201d</p> <p>The IMF was a cheerleader in the 1990s and early 2000s for free movement of capital but Lagarde acknowledged there were drawbacks to financial liberalisation.</p> <p>\u201cBetween 1980 and 2007, global capital flows increased more than twenty-fivefold, compared with an eightfold expansion in global trade. This has underpinned investment, especially in emerging economies. But it has also opened the door to financial contagion and concerns about the stability of financial systems.\u201d</p> <p>Growing inequality in wealth, income, and opportunity in many countries had added to a groundswell of discontent, especially in the industrialised world, Lagarde said. There was a \u201cgrowing sense among some citizens that they \u201clack control\u201d, that the system is somehow against them.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>With about two months remaining until the US Presidential Elections, and much at stake for Americans and the rest of the world, the time has come to examine how the election of each candidate might affect science and scientific research. </p> <p>Although relatively little has been said directly about science and science policy, both Democratic candidate <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/\">Hillary Clinton</a> and Republican nominee <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/POSITIONS\">Donald Trump</a> have official websites with a list of their key policy issues, and how they will be addressed.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton, who has made a number of statements broadly supportive of science and scientific research, has at least seven distinct issues on her website that directly relate to science and research. Clinton cites the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s and related diseases, and the allocation of 2 billion dollars annually towards research in the field. </p> <p>She has a similar plan for the study of autism and HIV/Aids, with a commitment to eradicating Aids in the US and abroad. She specifically calls for an investment in brain behavioural research as part of broad-based support for research on brain development and human behaviour. She also supports research on addiction and substance abuse, as part of an overall plan to address these problems in American society. </p> <p>In addition, there is an overall goal of enhancing technology and innovation, which goes hand-in-hand with science. Clinton has also outlined a plan to protect animals and wildlife, and ensure that national parks and protected wildlife areas are not privatised. Finally, she has cobbled together a substantial plan to deal with the threat of climate change and global warming. Her website also lists a variety of substantial issues tangential to science policy concerns, including healthcare, Medicare, paid family and medical leave, and so on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2016/apr/06/eu-brexit-scientific-impact-complicated\">The scientific impact of Brexit: it's complicated</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Donald Trump, on the other hand, has a very sparse and rather amateurishly composed list of policies on his website. None of them address science in any way. </p> <p>The public is not completely in the dark with regard to Trump\u2019s opinions on some matters of science, however, because he has made or tweeted key statements that illuminate his views on these important topics. </p> <p>For example, Trump tweeted: \u201cNBC News just called it the great freeze \u2013 coldest weather in years. Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?\u201d <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/427226424987385856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">NBC News just called it the great freeze - coldest weather in years.

His comments about spreading out vaccine doses come from the annals of superstition, rather than informed views. There is no scientific evidence in support of the notion that vaccine doses, or the times between vaccines, affect autism; indeed, years of trials, data, research, experience and statistics have brought us to the current <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/\">Centers for Disease Control (CDC)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/immunization/Pages/Immunization-Schedule.aspx?nfstatus=401&amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR:+No+local+token\">American Association of Pediatrics</a> recommendations for vaccines. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2016/feb/22/making-the-meningitis-b-vaccine-available-for-all-children-makes-sense\">Making the meningitis B vaccine available for all children makes sense | Jenny Rohn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s approach is not science, it is bunk.<br></p> <p>A lot has also been said about the health of each of the two candidates, with Clinton and Trump at 68 and 70 years of age, respectively. Indeed, Hillary Clinton\u2019s recent pneumonia diagnosis and cancellation of her schedule for the next few days highlights the mortality of aging presidential candidates. So it would be worthy to look at statements made by the vice presidential candidates. </p> <p>While Democrat Tim Kaine is largely in line with Clinton, Republican Mike Pence has made statements that may even outdo those of Trump. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/15/mike-pence-donald-trumps-vp-pick-smoking-doesnt-kill.html\">Time for a quick reality check</a>,\u201d wrote Pence. \u201cDespite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn\u2019t kill. Two out of every three smokers doesn\u2019t die from a smoking-related disease.\u201d </p> <p>So according to Pence, smoking doesn\u2019t kill, but a third of the smoking population DOES die from smoking. Am I missing something? It sounds like it\u2019s definitely time for Mr Pence to do a reality check.</p> <p>This upcoming election is like no other election in US history. Far more important than mere policy is the foundation on which science is based: truth. Science is, for the most part, objective, built on facts and the most likely explanation that those facts can provide at any given time. As more facts arise, models can be modified or expanded. Or revised altogether. But any model/theory/hypothesis must always fit the facts. And while all politicians tend to embellish and bend facts to some degree, more than any candidate ever in US history, Trump has been ignoring facts and promoting falsehoods. </p> <p>Paul Krugman of the New York Times wrote a recent opinion piece called <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/09/opinion/donald-trumps-big-liar-technique.html\">Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018Big Liar\u2019 Technique</a>. In this article, Krugman outlines how Trump repeatedly lies about points that are demonstrably false, and when challenged, merely repeats them. As one of many examples, he notes how Trump insists that he was against the war in Iraq \u2013 and yet, the only on-record statement he made prior to the invasion was that he was for it. Or <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/\">Trump\u2019s assertion that he saw thousands of cheering Muslims in Jersey City after 9-11</a>. It is Krugman\u2019s hypothesis that the sheer volume of lies has saturated and overwhelmed the American public and journalists. It is almost to the point where journalists no longer challenge yesterday\u2019s lies because they are so busy dealing with today\u2019s new round of lies.</p> <p>Trump, however, is not only adept about lying; he is a master of innuendo-based conspiracy theories. He will frequently use openings such as \u201cPeople tell me that \u2026\u201d to spread false rumours and lies. He will talk about President Obama\u2019s reaction to the murderous attack at the Orlando night-club and use phrases such as \u201cThere\u2019s something going on,\u201d as if suggesting that the president was part of a conspiracy involved in the mass shooting. And then drift away and watch his surrogates promote the conspiracy.</p> <p>A candidate who has such a loose and irreverent relationship with the truth will not be good for science, whether or not he has a solid policy to support science \u2013 and Trump does not. But science serves as a microcosm for everything else. </p> <p>If a candidate refuses to accept the advice of the vast majority of the most knowledgeable experts in a scientific field, such as those who have debunked any relationship between autism and vaccines, then why would this candidate pay any heed to foreign policy experts with regard to international affairs? Or experienced generals with regard to military issues? Indeed, Trump has already stated, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/29/us/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-intelligence-briefings.html?_r=0\">I know more than the generals about ISIS</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the most serious concern about the Trump candidacy is that it heralds a new era that some are calling \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-truth_politics\">post-truth politics</a>\u201d. Once the truth has become irrelevant to the American electorate, scientists may as well pack up their microscopes and test tubes and look for other careers. However, with two months until the election, there is still time to campaign for facts, truth \u2013 and yes, science.</p>",

My more tenacious Nigerian friends refuse to let their green passports stop them. To secure permission to travel in Europe, they queue, they print out their bank statements, they take the day off work to make their visa appointment, they take a second day off work because they forgot to bring a signed letter from their office, and they pay the visa fee. And all for a two-week pass into Europe.</p> <p>To Britons contemplating a life of more restricted travel, I reassure you that it\u2019s not all doom and bureaucracy. There are some perks. Say you\u2019re invited to an event in Europe, a family holiday or wedding for example, and you can\u2019t afford it, or you really just don\u2019t want to go. You can always say: \u201cCouldn\u2019t get my travel documents sorted out fast enough,\u201d and the matter magically ends there.</p> <p>Yet, perhaps my gloating is misplaced. We all know that freedom of movement is not equally applied to UK citizens. All British passports are equal, but some are more equal than others. The Olympic legend Mo Farah was one of the most recent British victims of travelling while black. Flying back from the Rio games <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/athletics/37331870\">he was sent to the back of the queue by an airline official</a> who, according to his wife, refused to believe he had a business class ticket.</p> <p>Also this year, my friend Laolu Opebiyi was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/03/man-removed-easyjet-flight-luton-prayer-message-phone\"> kicked off a flight</a> at Luton airport when a Christian prayer message on his phone sparked a terror alert. My sister, a mechanical engineering student at the time, with a valid ticket and ample proof of her identity, was kept in a detention area for hours in Miami, almost missing her flight. She was let go without any explanation for why she had been held. British Muslim women wearing headscarves have had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/25/racist-profiling-bigotry-headscarf-flight\">similar experiences</a>.</p> <p>. If you\u2019re black, whatever the colour of your passport, you have your travel stories. The friend with dreadlocks who is always pulled aside for \u201crandom\u201d body searches; the relative with grandchildren in England who was told by immigration not to visit so often. We trade our stories, and then we laugh. You can slow us down, but you can\u2019t stop us moving.</p> <p>So, British people, welcome to the world of restricted travel. Fear not. You\u2019re in good company. Billions of people around the globe also have their movement across borders restricted. Yes, the forms can be a hassle. However, if you have all your paperwork in order, and evidence that you\u2019re a law-abiding sort, you\u2019ll get accustomed to the process. But woe betide those who go to Europe only to pick fights at foreign football stadiums. Your days of punching rival fans in France may be numbered.</p> <p>And who knows? Maybe filling out forms will make Britain more sympathetic to immigrants. I bet Nigel Farage didn\u2019t think of that.</p>",
  "<p>Campaigners have attacked the government for rejecting calls by MPs for greater action on air pollution, as severe pollution episodes were predicted for parts of the UK this week.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/27/uk-air-pollution-public-health-emergency-crisis-diesel-cars\">MPs warned in April</a> that dangerously high pollution in British cities was a \u201cpublic health emergency\u201d, and told ministers to take further measures, including more clean air zones and a diesel scrappage scheme.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmenvfru/665/665.pdf\">its formal response</a> on Tuesday, officials claimed that the government was already spending heavily on cleaner transport and that it plans to consult on a framework for clean air zones later this year.</p> <p>\u201cWe will introduce new, tougher targets which will drive down air pollution from all sources, reducing transboundary pollution and significantly reducing the number of premature deaths across the EU caused by poor air quality,\u201d said the response.</p> <p>The MPs had wanted all cities to be able to charge polluting vehicles instead of just the five which government is planning to allow. But officials responded: \u201cLocal authorities can take action as and when necessary to improve air quality and we encourage them to do so.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201c[The government] has established the UK as a global leader in ultra low-emission vehicles. We are one of the largest and fastest growing markets in Europe and last year around one in five battery electric cars sold in the UK was built in the UK\u201d.<br></p> <p>It also flatly rejected the idea of a diesel scrappage scheme: \u201cWe have considered the use of scrappage schemes ... and have concluded that this may not be an appropriate and proportionate response.\u201d</p> <p>The publication came as <a href=\"https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/forecasting/\">the environment department warned of \u201cvery high\u201d air pollution</a> \u2013 the worst on the scale \u2013 in and around Hull on Wednesday, and \u201chigh\u201d pollution across much of northern England. The health advice for very high episodes is for the entire population to reduce physical exercise outdoors, and for asthma sufferers and other vulnerable groups to avoid any exertion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/adamvaughan_uk/status/775654152714190848\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If you&#39;re in Hull tomorrow, try not to breathe the air.

In <a href=\"https://greenallianceblog.org.uk/2016/09/12/a-strategy-to-solve-air-inequality-and-keep-britain-moving/\">an article on the Green Alliance thinktank\u2019s blog</a>, Stephen Heidari-Robinson said that: \u201c[court action] focuses on compliance with EU standards for just one pollutant, rather than addressing the problem holistically to save lives\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWorse, it encourages the belief that Brexit can simply sweep away the problem (it can\u2019t). Second, it sets up a zero sum game \u2013 ban cars, save lives \u2013 when, to solve the problem with the consent of the population, we need to improve air quality and maintain mobility.

On Monday he said that at that time he expected a \u201cdark end\u201d in which he was either killed or jailed in the US.</p> <p>More than three years on, he appears cheerful and relaxed. He has avoided the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/30/bradley-manning-wikileaks-judge-verdict\">fate of fellow whistleblower Chelsea Manning</a>, who is in solitary confinement in the US. Snowden is free to communicate with supporters and chats online late into the night. </p> <p>His 2.3 million followers on Twitter give him a huge platform to express his views. He works on tools to try to help journalists. He is not restricted to Moscow and has travelled around Russia, and his family in the US have been to visit him.</p> <p>But Snowden still wants to return to the US and seems confident, in spite of all the evidence to the contrary, that it will happen. \u201cIn the fullness of time, I think I will end up back home,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cOnce the officials, who felt like they had to protect the programmes, their positions, their careers, have left government and we start looking at things from a more historical perspective, it will be pretty clear that this war on whistleblowers does not serve the interests of the United States; rather it harms them.\u201d</p> <p>Snowden attracts lots of conspiracy theories. Early on, he was accused of being a spy for China and then a Russian spy. In August a cryptic tweet followed by an unusual absence prompted speculation that he was dead. He said he had simply gone on holiday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765136486417231872\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated. <a href=\"https://t.co/ZgIkapmcOC\">pic.twitter.com/ZgIkapmcOC</a></p>&mdash; Edward Snowden (@Snowden) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765136486417231872\">August 15, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>There had also been rumours that his partner, Lindsay Mills, had left him, which would have been embarrassing as their romance occupies a large part of the Stone film.

More significant, perhaps, is that surveillance and the impact of technological change has seeped into popular culture, in films such as the latest Jason Bourne and television series, such as the Good Wife.</p> <p>Snowden also welcomed \u201ca renaissance of scepticism\u201d on the part of at least some journalists when confronted by anonymous briefings by officials not backed by evidence.<br></p> <p>He warned three years ago of the danger that one day there might be a president who abused the system. The warning failed to gain much traction, given that Obama\u2019s presidency seemed relatively benign. But it resonates more today, in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s response to <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/7/27/12298664/trump-dnc-hacking-power\">the Russian hacking of the Democratic party</a>: that he wished he had the power to hack into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails.</p> <p>If Obama, as seems likely, declines to pardon Snowden, his chances under either Clinton or Trump would seem to be even slimmer. He described the 2016 presidential race as unprecedented \u201cin terms of the sort of authoritarian policies that are being put forward\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, many candidates in the political mainstream today, even pundits and commentators who aren\u2019t running for office, believe we have to be able to do anything, no matter what, as long as there is some benefit to be had in doing so.

Russia is not my area of focus. It is not my area of expertise. I don\u2019t speak Russian in a fluent manner that I could really participate in and influence policy. But when something happens that I believe is clearly a violation of the right thing, I believe we should stand up and say something about it.</p> <p>\u201cMy priority always has to be my own country rather than Russia. I would like to help reform the human rights situation in Russia but I will never be well placed to do so relative to actual Russian activists themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Might he end up as part of a US-Russian prisoner exchange, with Putin possibly more amenable to the idea if Trump was in power? \u201cThere has always been the possibility that any government could say, \u2018Well, it does not really matter whether it is a violation of human rights, it does not really matter whether it is a violation of law, it will be beneficial to use this individual as a bargaining chip\u2019. This is not exclusive to me. This happens to activists around the world every day.\u201d</p> <p>He said he saw the Stone film as a mechanism for getting people to talk about surveillance, though he felt uncomfortable with other people telling his story.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/apr/28/edward-snowden-nsa-trailer-oliver-stone-thriller-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4ty9f\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2495625\"            data-video-name=\"Snowden: the trailer for Oliver Stone\u2019s thriller \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Open Road Films\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5721dac1e4b02c55b6401323\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/04/28/160428snowden_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11443130&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/04/28/160428snowden_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/04/28/160428snowden_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/04/28/160428snowden.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/apr/28/edward-snowden-nsa-trailer-oliver-stone-thriller-video\">Snowden: the trailer for Oliver Stone\u2019s thriller</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Snowden has toyed with writing his memoirs but has not made much progress.

Massimo Taibi may be a standard bearer for difficult starts to a keeper\u2019s career but he is certainly not alone.</p> <p>Of course at the very top level of football, players\u2019 performances are put under microscopic scrutiny but there has to be an acceptance and an understanding that keepers especially need time to adjust and settle. It\u2019s just too easy and lazy to describe a goalkeeper as \u201cshocking\u201d without this caveat as to why and how it might have come about.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/10/pep-guardiola-claudio-bravo-horror-show-manchester-city-united\">Pep Guardiola backs Claudio Bravo after serene start turns into horror show | Jamie Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Guardiola\u2019s post match comments describing Bravo\u2019s debut as \u201camazing\u201d and praising him for attacking the ball all stem from his acceptance that keepers who are positive in taking high balls and playing what many would call \u201crisky\u201d passes, may just get caught out now and again. To have that kind of backing from your manager means that when errors do happen, they don\u2019t affect you as much.</p> <p>Because of the consequences to any errors of judgement, familiarity with regards to team-mates and the environment around them on and off the pitch is paramount to a goalkeeper\u2019s state of mind. At this early stage in Hart\u2019s and Bravo\u2019s time at their clubs almost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/20/pep-guardiola-ruthless-joe-hart-manchester-city\">everything is alien to them</a> and it is imperative they find a routine to provide them with a comfort blanket that will aid their consistency.</p> <p>I know from experience in my own career how difficult it can be. I changed clubs twice on the eve of a season\u2019s start, with contrasting results. As a 22-year-old with Darlington I moved to Aberdeen two days before the season opener. One minute I was preparing to face Halifax, the next I was on a flight to Scotland and shoved into a hotel room with a piece of paper, revising the names of my team-mates and preparing to face Celtic live on TV. I returned to my room later that evening, overwhelmed by the occasion and a 5-0 defeat.</p> <p>Six years later as I joined Silkeborg in Denmark under similar circumstances, plus a language barrier and more unfamiliar names to add to it. This time it ended with 3-2 win against Sonderjyske, which included some important saves but still an error costing us their first goal but luckily, like Bravo, not the win.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1695cfaf1eb84b396e957f73ea2e86af399db26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1695cfaf1eb84b396e957f73ea2e86af399db26/0_141_1912_1147/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Hart during the Serie A match between Atalanta and Torino.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Hart during the Serie A match between Atalanta and Torino.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pier Marco Tacca/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/10/pep-guardiola-claudio-bravo-horror-show-manchester-city-united\">The relationship between a goalkeeper and the players</a> directly in front of him is key as it is needed to provide a platform. A keeper should know the strengths and, perhaps more importantly, the weaknesses of his team-mates, so he can adjust his positions and actions accordingly. With just over a week since both players arrived, there has been little time to strike up a professional rapport and for a few weeks at least they will be playing from instinct, doing what comes naturally until they begin to shape their game into that of their team.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/11/joe-hart-torino-error-on-debut-atalanta-serie-a\">Joe Hart makes costly error to gift Atalanta equaliser on Torino debut</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you look back at both of their mistakes, they are actually positive decisions and as a rule you\u2019d applaud them both for being bold. With hindsight though, it\u2019s easy to say they should have played safe and let their defenders deal with those kinds of deliveries until they have their feet under the table but perhaps that may have proved a good policy. Whatever position you hold in team, when you arrive at a new club there\u2019s a desire to impress but as a keeper that can prove to be a dangerous notion. More often than not, your keenness to be pro-active leads to you manufacturing situations, coming for balls that defenders can easily deal with instead of letting the play come to you.</p> <p>A keeper\u2019s decision-making process is affected by his senses being battered with new information; his clarity of thought is clouded, which is why erratic performances are so common and that is why in these initial few weeks at a club a keeper should play safe until calm has been restored to his head and his game.</p> <p>Clubs and managers need to take this into account when bringing in a cornerstone of their side and if their has been a failing by anyone it\u2019s by the clubs themselves. Circumstances can dictate the timing of a signing and Jasper Cillessen\u2019s arrival at Bar\u00e7a triggered Bravo\u2019s move and in turn Hart\u2019s but all three clubs would have been better served by getting their business done at the beginning of pre-season, giving their keepers the time necessary to bed in.</p> <p>Not that this is new territory for Bravo. On his arrival at Barcelona from Real Sociedad, his debut in a friendly against Napoli was ruined by a double error, after first giving the ball away with a loose pass and then allowing the ball to squirm though his hands from the subsequent shot. But it was a friendly, a chance to get that first, difficult game out of the way and move on as he did so successfully, showing the value of time spent developing bonds.</p> <p>In six weeks\u2019 time Zlatan Ibrahimovic\u2019s goal will be less likely to happen because the hours spent together during games and on the training pitch will mean Bravo\u2019s voice and style of play will be more known to John Stones and their work together will be less jarring and much more cohesive.</p> <p><em>David Preece is a goalkeeping coach and writer who played professionally in England, Scotland, Denmark and Iceland between 1992-2014</em></p>",

Well above ground level we still see \u2013 directly \u2013 the lamps of street lights, as we do over any other town or city. Why? Surely the lamps themselves should be invisible from above street level.</p> <p>This indicates that neither society nor its leaders are interested in saving power or money. Rather, they use lighting as an ostentatious display to prove that, like the peacock\u2019s gaudy, impractical plumage, they have more than enough power and money to waste.</p> <p>Remember that if the lights had downward directing shades, all the horizontally and upwardly wasted light would illuminate the road. Thus only 30% of the power would achieve the same result.

Ironically this narrow goal is then rebutted by soft drink manufacturers as unlikely to have a meaningful impact on levels of obesity.</p> <p>Big ideas in the past have inspired us politically: witness the rebuilding of the UK housing stock after the world wars.

Hancock recognises this, and the fact that the hipster epitomises both the old and the new. A perfectly preened vision of 21st century Conservativism.</p> <p>The hipster may be a capitalist, although aren\u2019t we all nowadays? The hipster is also ethical, sustainable and highly mobile. Retro, beautifully reconditioned fixed wheel bikes with 70s steel frames and state of the art aero wheels are their trusty steeds.<strong> </strong>With carefully coiffed beards and retro haircuts, they dwell in craft beer drinking dens, pop-up shops, tattoo parlours, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/28/cereal-killer-cafe-protesters\" title=\"\">restaurants selling cereal</a>. The hipster is so very carefully considered: everything stylised; everything thought through.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d51876fc291f65550004b7a4f0311b9b812b719f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d51876fc291f65550004b7a4f0311b9b812b719f/0_204_5976_3584/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tattoo parlours \u2013 a favoured hangout of hipsters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tattoo parlours \u2013 a favoured hangout of hipsters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A recent visit to my newly opened, \u201ctraditional barber\u201d gave an insight into the world of the hipster. The thirtysomething owner \u201ccrafted\u201d each haircut as a \u201cunique experience\u201d. Reclaimed barbering implements and blades hung on hidden magnetic pads beneath salvage yard beams; faux \u201chunting lodge\u201d panelling was lit by wireless mood lighting; customers sat on \u201cre-engineered\u201d 1920s barbering chairs; hidden state-of-the-art speakers played tech-house from what appeared to be a vintage iPhone dock.</p> <p>I asked the hipster owner and his beard-nurturing hipster customer (a tattooist from across the road) how they described themselves. \u201cSocialists,\u201d they replied, quickly adding that they were not looking \u201cto build empires\u201d, just to \u201cmake a living\u201d. They had both left safe jobs working for the state and local government respectively. This led me to wonder about <a href=\"https://briarpatchmagazine.com/articles/view/when-hipsters-dream\" title=\"\">suggestions that the hipster may represent some form of reincarnated frontiersman/woman or pioneer</a>. In many ways, I think they do. Their styling certainly harks back to the mid-to-late 19th century; to the British colonialists and the western frontiers. These people want to earn a reasonable living, independently, by \u201ccrafting\u201d and \u201ccreating\u201d. They, like the original pioneers, are explorers and artists and they are capitalists.</p> <p>Unlike the colonising pioneer of the past, however, the hipster is postmodern, post-industrial, and post-Fordist. It is little wonder, then, that Hancock fetishises the hipster as both an ideal actor in his post-Brexit creative industries fantasy and an exemplar of small-scale, micro-enterprise: a capitalist. An <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/london-hipsters-key-to-boosting-british-economy-after-brexit-a3341091.html\" title=\"\">article in the Evening Standard</a> suggested that the minister\u2019s comments might surprise many hipsters, who pride themselves in \u201cbreaking away from the mainstream economy with independent-minded and ethical ideas and work practices\u201d. But isn\u2019t this an exact description of the kind of small-scale capitalist \u201cinnovation\u201d that Hancock envisages as driving the core of Britain\u2019s much-hoped-for creative industries revolution; itself a coded form of cultural imperialism?</p> <p>The trouble is that this model of art as part-cultural civiliser, part-economic driver, part-social cohesion improver is deeply problematic. Hancock believes that knocking-up more glass-fronted \u201ccultural quarters\u201d will bring multiple benefits to everyone: \u201cThe lesson is clear: make an area interesting and you attract interesting people to work there.\u201d You see, for Hancock, \u201ccultural rebirth, connectivity, and economic revival go hand in hand\u201d. And, of course, the hipster seems to personify these neoliberal ideals. However, whereas the minister said he was keen to avoid the state adopting a \u201ctop-down\u201d and \u201cprescriptive approach\u201d, the state is actually doing exactly that, along with the support of capitalist bodies, like the Orwellian-sounding Creative Industries Federation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/06/hipster-aesthetic-taking-over-world\">Same old, same old. How the hipster aesthetic is taking over the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is the establishment that now sees the hipster as the embodiment of autonomous, small-scale capitalist expansionism. But it is not just the hipster cast in this role. Artists are the neoliberal state\u2019s troops. Artists make the first move into post-industrial, post-welfare state wastelands like brownfield sites and council housing estates and sow the seeds of cultural capital. They attract hipsters before, eventually, being displaced by them and their new middle-class neighbours. Both the artists and (some) of the hipsters \u2013 the ones who haven\u2019t \u201csettled\u201d yet \u2013 will move on, exploring, breaking away (again), developing new potential sites for capital \u201cinvestment\u201d. And so the cycle of gentrification starts over again.</p> <p>Hancock knows this. Investors know this. The creative industries (in all their many increasingly homogeneous guises) know this. They believe in miracles because they create them. Hipsters are just the latest stylisation that fits perfectly with the rediscovery of the (economic) value of place. And, just like the gentrifying slogan, <a href=\"http://webgram.co/p/BJMvUdHAWvw\" title=\"\">\u201cCupcakes are muffins that believed in miracles\u201d</a>, it would seem that for Hancock, hipsters are people who believe in miracles.

A government would then work with donors to match the allocated funds (to ensure adequate buy-in by the national authorities) and offer its people a platform to weigh in on how this money would be spent.</p> <p>Citizens could themselves suggest, design and monitor projects that would be of greatest benefit, submit these to an online platform for potential support and even pledge their own resources (financial or human) to back their ideas. Meanwhile, the aid agencies and government ministries would provide or outsource management, oversight and evaluation to ensure the funds were used for the intended purposes and that feedback loops were in place to adapt the system over time. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/26/southern-africa-appeals-for-billions-el-nino-devastation-drought\">Southern Africa appeals for billions to cope with El Ni\u00f1o devastation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Think of the advantages: a demand-driven process through which citizens could design development projects themselves; a new form of donor-government-citizen relationship in which each had a clear, coordinated and mutually reinforcing role; and a selection of innovative, context-specific development projects that would receive the funding they deserve.</p> <p>This is a radical idea, and it has its drawbacks. There would need to be a way to vet projects and ensure financial support could be channelled to them in effective ways; there would be a danger that projects on the platform could be captured by political parties or groups that would rather use the funds for their own purposes; and internet access in many countries is still extremely low, meaning a number of people may not be able to access this kind of website.</p> <p>But these are problems that traditional development models also face. Procedures could be put in place to verify and facilitate projects on the site. Finances could be channelled through community banks or microfinance institutions to even the most remote communities. The social, crowdsourced nature of the process would mean that project funds and costs would be completely transparent, reducing the scope for graft.

  "<p>The word \u201cturnover\u201d, which has until now applied to The Great British Bake Off only as a technical challenge, has become an instruction to its fans. The news that the show will pitch its tent at Channel 4 from next year has raised two main questions. Can it work on another channel? And how on earth did this happen?</p> <p>The question of how the show will look post-2017 became considerably more complex with the announcement that Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins will not be joining the big-money move to Channel 4, rolling out a typical bread-related pun about not \u201cgoing with the dough\u201d, which seemed to suggest that Love Productions (the independent company that invented and owns the show) was being greedy. Mel and Sue may have been influenced by the fact that a previous move from Channel 4 to ITV in 1999 stalled their career.</p> <p>Channel 4 and Love may bravely tell themselves that Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood are more crucial to the brand, and that is true. But signing up the expert duo becomes vital now \u2013 and the new presenters will of course shape attitudes to the Channel 4 launch, if the new quartet is perceived to be a petit four beside the original lineup. The show\u2019s new home will also be acutely aware, from the BBC\u2019s recent experience with Top Gear, of the instability of a format without its familiar faces.</p> <p>Some have suggested that ad-breaks at Channel 4 will ruin the experience. But the Bake Off format has already been adapted to many countries with commercial structures, and the BBC already uses little films about the histories of cakes and biscuits as internal breaks, which could be removed without much loss.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/13/sue-perkins-and-mel-giedroyc-to-leave-great-british-bake-off\">Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc to leave Great British Bake Off</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Understandably, though, the fact that up to 13 million viewers will suddenly be told to change channel for their favourite show has caused oven-hot indignation on social media. Shock has been expressed at the BBC having so little control over the destiny of one of its brand-name programmes.</p> <p>But this is the way television has gone. Although the Sunday night stand-off between shows such as Poldark and Victoria is still conventionally seen as a fight between BBC and ITV, both were actually made by the same independent producer, Mammoth Screen. This trend \u2013 known as \u201cpublisher broadcasting\u201d \u2013 was introduced to Britain with the launch of Channel 4 in 1982, but, encouraged by successive Conservative and Labour governments, has increasingly spread to ITV and now the BBC.</p> <p>Of the BBC1 trinity of hit autumn franchises \u2013 Bake Off, The Apprentice and Strictly Come Dancing \u2013 the only one wholly owned by the BBC is Strictly, a clever reboot of Come Dancing, which had run since the 1950s. The Apprentice is originally an American format, from which Donald Trump recently became the first TV presenter to take leave of absence to run for US president. Bake Off was invented by Love, which just secured a far better deal from Channel 4. The Voice has just moved from BBC1 to ITV in similar circumstances, although amid rather less dismay.</p> <p>The ownership of shows has not always been straightforward: the original Come Dancing was created by an external impresario, Miss World mogul Eric Morley, but he needed a TV company to make it. The rise of independent production has removed that barrier. And the BBC will only become less likely to own its hits under a stipulation in the current government white paper on the future of the BBC that almost 100% of its non-news output (rather than, as before, a minority) should be available for external commercial tender on a \u201ccompete and compare\u201d basis that assesses commercial and cultural value.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1c5c0b1e33ca9c66f17d038542383d12e9197d40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c5c0b1e33ca9c66f17d038542383d12e9197d40/0_24_4171_2504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The fact that 13 million fans will suddenly have to change channel for their favourite show has caused oven-hot indignation on social media.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The fact that 13 million fans will suddenly have to change channel for their favourite show has caused oven-hot indignation on social media.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Bourdillon/BBC/Love Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the case of Bake Off, the BBC has a reasonable case to feel that, having been loyal to the show, some might have been returned. And, although there is always difficulty in delineating the exact creative input between the company that makes a show and the network that screens it, Bake Off has reflected some crucial BBC values: one Reithian \u2013 Mary and Paul are, in a light way, educational about their skills \u2013 and one more recent, in the commendable diversity of the contestants.</p> <p>Those qualities, though, seem unlikely to be reduced at Channel 4, which remains a public service broadcaster. A more pressing issue, then, is whether the BBC\u2019s structure discourages creativity. </p> <p>It often seems that the best and most original ideas \u2013 especially in entertainment \u2013 on the BBC have been brought by (and therefore have to be bought from) independent companies. The next director general needs to take a hard look at why this is the case.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/12/bbc-loses-great-british-bake-off\">Great British Bake Off moves to Channel 4 as BBC negotiations collapse over fee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Certainly a young upstart might conclude from the celebrity and lifestyle of major independent producers such as Burnett, Simon Cowell and Jan De Mol (Big Brother) that it is more rewarding to create and sell formats than make them in-house and share control, ownership and income. This means that if, as a BBC staff producer, you had an idea for a new show, the inescapable logic is that you should leave your job, set up an independent production company and then ask the BBC to buy it from you.</p> <p>Even more worrying is whether those on staff feel enough incentive to develop successful concepts. An independent producer who fails to come up with enough great ideas risks losing their job and their house; a senior BBC manager running an unproductive department is likely to be moved to new responsibilities at equivalent income or even, in some cases, be handed output from more industrious units.</p> <p>The BBC\u2019s 19,000 staff base and generally benevolent employment practices are impressive from a moral and trade union perspective, but you don\u2019t need to be a zealous free-marketeer to wonder whether, in a TV environment that is increasingly deregulated and international, the corporation\u2019s structures ensure the best ideas get made at maximum value to the licence-payer.

  "<p>Canada\u2019s early exit from 2018 World Cup qualifying should spark many questions in any rigorous postmortem. The glaringly obvious are rarely asked: why do Canadian teams play in Major League Soccer, and how exactly does Canadian soccer benefit?</p> <p>It\u2019s a question the most powerful man in Canadian soccer \u2013 who now also happens to be the most powerful man at Concacaf \u2013 is thinking about. And Victor Montagliani, Soccer Canada\u2019s president and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/05/concacaf-president-vincent-montagliani-interview-fifa-corruption\">recently elected head of Concacaf</a>, is not happy with the answers.</p> <p>Montagliani warns that unless a critical issue is addressed \u2013 that Canadian players are treated as equal to Americans under MLS rules \u2013 Soccer Canada may take sweeping and dramatic action to block Toronto FC, Montreal Impact and Vancouver Whitecaps from continuing to play in the league.</p> <p>\u201cIt is always going to create a glass ceiling when a Canadian passport makes you a second-class citizen in a league where three of your teams play,\u201d says Montagliani. \u201cWe have been trying to address the issue but it has been frustratingly slow. Until that is dealt with, it is always going to be a challenge to put the Canadian flag equal to the American flag in MLS. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/05/concacaf-president-vincent-montagliani-interview-fifa-corruption\">Concacaf president Victor Montagliani: 'There has been a shitstorm here'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The big issue for Canadian soccer is an MLS rule that declares American players as \u201cdomestic\u201d regardless of whether they play for teams north or south of the border, while Canadian players are designated \u201cinternational\u201d if they play for an MLS team on American soil.</p> <p>This is great for American players \u2013 more teams equals more opportunities \u2013 but terrible for Canadians. They face unlimited challenges from Americans for roster places in Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver and are considered equal to a midfielder from Ghana or Belize when a coach of an American team is balancing his roster. MLS rules designate eight spots per club for international players although those slots may be traded between teams in exchange for other roster benefits. </p> <p>The numbers tell the story: according to MLS, of the possible 560 roster places available on MLS teams, just 24 are taken by Canadian players. Just five of those play for non-Canadian teams. The balance is so skewed, the math is worth checking again and again. But it\u2019s true. Canadian teams make up 15% of the league but only just over four percent of the league\u2019s players are Canadian. </p> <p>League executives pitch the positives of Canada\u2019s presence in MLS. Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal contribute stability, MLS market growth, league expansion, more opportunities for players, and excellent local stadiums such as TFC\u2019s purpose-built BMO Field. There\u2019s a good argument that MLS in Canada benefits everyone. Unless, you are Canadian.</p> <p>In New York, the MLS president Mark Abbott sees only sunshine: \u201cWe have created lots of opportunities for Canadian players that did not exist before those teams were there. The investment that each of our teams are making in player development, if not exclusively focussed on Canadian players, is also a benefit.\u201d</p> <p>Abbott says \u201cimmigration laws in the United States don\u2019t allow us to treat Canadian players as domestic in the US.\u201d However, Bob Foos, executive director of the MLS players union, says the issue is MLS not wanting to challenge US discrimination laws and expose the league to a potential lawsuit.</p> <p>\u201cIn essence, [if MLS claimed Canadian players as domestic] you would be discriminating against non-Canadian people in the US in favor of Canadians,\u201d says Foos. \u201cIt is one thing to say you need to be a US citizen or a green card holder to be considered domestic. It is another thing to say if you\u2019re Canadian you have these rights and if you\u2019re not Canadian you have different rights.\u201d</p> <p>But the disparity cuts deep into Canadian soccer, especially for youth development at a time Canadian soccer is desperate to improve its national team. Tim Bezbatchenko, the general manager at Toronto FC, is an American whose previous roles at MLS head office included acting as a liaison between MLS and Canada Soccer. He believes under current regulations Canadian MLS teams are running expensive youth academies for players that have nowhere to go.</p> <p>\u201cOur players are less desirable for US teams,\u201d Bezbatchenko says. \u201cWe put a lot of money into our academy system but the players we are developing have limited roster spots. If there is an additional restriction, that is an impediment for those Canadian players to move to the US That impacts our team and our budget and the way that we operate our roster.\u201d</p> <p>In 2006, MLS announced expansion into Canada by announcing the arrival of Toronto FC. The new team would be run by Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment \u2013 an organization that also owns Toronto\u2019s professional hockey and basketball teams, the Maple Leafs and Raptors.</p> <p>Cross-border teams are not unusual in North America. The NHL has Canadian teams as do, to a lesser extent, the NBA and MLB. In soccer, crossed borders are unusual. Australia\u2019s A-League includes New Zealand\u2019s Wellington Phoenix while England\u2019s football competitions include teams from Wales. We could argue whether Monaco, with a team in Ligue 1, is actually part of France.</p> <p>\u201cThe league benefits from having strong markets with strong owners and great stadiums,\u201d Mark Abbott says and, while Toronto\u2019s Bezbatchenko has issues with the player status rules, he echoes MLS\u2019s enthusiasm.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at attendance, [Canadian teams] have some of the most passionate fans in MLS,\u201d he says. \u201cAdd the money we are investing in our academies and ownership that believes soccer will be the biggest sport in North America. The league wants to grow and it sees new markets where it can grow. It is important for MLS to be in the biggest markets in North America.\u201d</p> <p>Bob Foos, from the players union, agrees: \u201cIt is very logical from an economic perspective as to why it would be good to have teams from Canada in the league. I think that has borne itself out. They have all been good markets.\u201d<br></p> <p>Canada has been great for MLS on many levels, many of them financial. Just not so great for Canada\u2019s MLS players. It\u2019s not just young academy players or mid-level midfielders who struggle. Even the country\u2019s top players \u2013 those MLS should want to attract to its teams \u2013 feel shut out. <br></p> <p>Kuala Terengganu, population 400,000, is a city on the east coast of Malaysia. In good traffic, it\u2019s about a six-hour bus ride to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\u2019s capital. Thirty-two-year-old Issey Nakajima-Farran, born in Calgary, is one of just two foreigners who play for Terengganu FA, the local professional team that competes in the Malaysian Super League.</p> <p>Nakajima-Farran has played 37 times for Canada during a club career that has taken him from Singapore\u2019s S League to Denmark\u2019s Superliga, and a season with Brisbane Roar under current Australia coach Ange Postecoglou in the A-League. He can also add stints with both Toronto FC and Montreal Impact in MLS. </p> <p>Nakajima-Farran knows the ropes of the sub-superstar professional soccer circuit. However, his time in Canada during the 2014 season was a confusing disaster. He played just five times for Toronto, scoring three goals, before being surprised on his birthday with an overnight trade to Montreal Impact. </p> <p>\u201cI was like, hell, no,\u201d he recalls. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me to go to Montreal. I don\u2019t want to go there. I love it here!\u201d</p> <p>Nakajima-Farran said, approaching 30, he quit Europe \u2013 he was playing in Cyprus at the time \u2013 for Toronto to play out his career at home. He liked the idea where, as a national team player, he might be regarded the way he\u2019d seen local players treated in leagues he\u2019d played in abroad. National team players, he observed, are used as role models and \u201chave a reputation and get respect.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs I experienced it, it wasn\u2019t about the Canadian players,\u201d Nakajima-Farran says. \u201cIt was about the American league exploiting the Canadian cities. I would understand it if the Canadian teams were bringing in young players and promoting them but Toronto was bringing these American guys back. Even Montreal was trying to replace me with an American guy.\u201d </p> <p>Montreal Impact proved no different and, after one season, Nakajima-Farran left for Malaysia. He is cautious to criticize, claiming he doesn\u2019t want important issues for Canadian soccer to be clouded by sounding like a disgruntled former player whose deal didn\u2019t work out. But he says he\u2019s not alone. During his time with the Canadian national team, players talked about MLS. Team-mates, many who played abroad, were envious he had a MLS deal. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83a19af6db0eb26c6d2ce46f9f45564713baa214\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83a19af6db0eb26c6d2ce46f9f45564713baa214/0_0_3538_2359/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Orlando City\u2019s Cyle Larin is one of few Canadian players to play for American MLS clubs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Orlando City\u2019s Cyle Larin is one of few Canadian players to play for American MLS clubs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jae C. Hong/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe Canadian boys had been together for a long time,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhen you play with guys who have gone through the same system, you have respect for each other. We had always wanted to play together in a domestic league. We thought that would be Toronto, Vancouver, or Montreal. It would make sense. But there is no respect for Canadian players in MLS.\u201d</p> <p>Mark Abbott says that at its conception, MLS wanted to create interdependence between the US national team and the same concept applies to Canada: \u201cThe league would work hard to provide opportunities for American players and, by the same token, the league would benefit from the national team\u2019s success. I think we have seen that play out over the last 20 or so years. </p> <p>\u201cThere is an opportunity to contribute to the growth of Canadian soccer in a variety of different ways: providing playing opportunities and investing in player development programs focussed on players that live in Canada. As you elevate the opportunity for Canadian players, we believe the Canadian national team will benefit from that.\u201d</p> <p>The actual benefits are debatable. Canada\u2019s starting lineup for its last World Cup qualifier against El Salvador featured just two players from Canadian MLS teams - Marcel de Jong (Vancouver Whitecaps) and Tosaint Ricketts (Toronto FC). Striker Cyle Larin plays for Orlando City. By contrast, the United States team against Trinidad &amp; Tobago included six starters from MLS. It\u2019s worth noting that skipper Michael Bradley and striker Jozy Altidore play for Toronto FC.</p> <p>Montagliani says that when Canada Soccer signed off on MLS operating clubs within its jurisdiction (a national federation, as well as the regional confederation, and FIFA must approve cross-border participation in leagues) the intention was for many Canadian players to be on the teams. </p> <p>\u201cThat never came to fruition,\u201d he says. \u201cMLS still hasn\u2019t dealt with the issue of treating Canadian players equal to American players. The truth is that if there was no protection for the American player like there is I bet there would be less American players in MLS. That protectionist attitude has helped the American player. Good on them but it definitely hasn\u2019t helped the Canadian player. MLS has a duty to clubs in both countries. I think they are sincere but I don\u2019t think they wake up in the morning and the first thing they think about is how they can help the Canadian players.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, MLS in Canada might be moot if a pro soccer league existed in the country. There is the the semi-pro Canadian Soccer League made up of teams from Ontario. That competition <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/11932437/Revealed-Entire-rogue-league-corrupted-by-match-fixing.html\">was embroiled in a 2009 match-fixing controversy</a> and decertified by Canada Soccer in 2013. An investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is ongoing.</p> <p>Soccer officials highlight several challenges facing any professional Canadian league including geography, population size, and travel expenses. Australia, however, with comparable obstacles, has carved out a professional league that is both a talent pipeline for its national team and a legitimate attraction for (ageing) international stars like Alessandro Del Piero, Robbie Fowler, and Dwight Yorke.</p> <p>\u201cIt is possible but where are you going to get the players?\u201d asks union boss Bob Foose. \u201cIt is going to be of a substantially lower quality. If you are going to put together 10 or 12 teams I don\u2019t think you are going to find the volume of guys.\u201d </p> <p>Montagliani believes a Canadian professional league will be launched within five years. Canada Soccer is currently evaluating how such a competition will operate in conjunction with the five Canadian teams that play in MLS and NASL. While he is bullish about withdrawing approval for MLS to operate in Canada, he hopes to announce \u201cby the end of the year\u201d a solution about player status rules that will see more Canadian players in MLS teams south of the border.</p> <p>\u201cThere is some movement with MLS where a Canadian player has an opportunity other than just with three teams,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is an opportunity where players who come through the system are going to be considered domestics on both side of the ledger. With a pro league, a lot of the challenges can always be overcome by money.\u201d</p> <p>It is unlikely Canada\u2019s MLS teams will participate in a national league, however.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere is no reason to foresee any change,\u201d says Toronto\u2019s Tim Bezbatchenko, adding he can see a place for Toronto FC\u2019s reserve side in a future Canadian league. <br></p> <p>\u201cI think the more players that can be playing professionally and earning a living in Canada is going to help the national team more,\u201d Bezbatchenko says. \u201cIf you have more coaches, more administrators, more strength and conditioning coaches and more people staying in the game, then you have a wider net that is going to help the game grow.\u201d<br></p> <p>Canada last appeared at a World Cup in 1986 in Mexico. They are currently <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/\">No100 in Fifa\u2019s rankings</a>, just one place above Haiti (Canada\u2019s women are ranked fourth in the world but that is another story). Many reasons are given for the national team\u2019s mediocrity: a dysfunctional youth system, a lack of qualified coaches failure to attract talented dual citizens over the country of their parents or grandparents, the team\u2019s lack of national identity; and, believe it or not, the weather.</p> <p>But if World Cup qualifying results are any evidence, MLS has not helped Canada\u2019s national team to any degree.

  "<p>After lab-grown meat, get ready for animal-free cow\u2019s milk. A San-Francisco startup believes it has found a solution for the guilty conscience of consumers who love eating dairy ice-cream, cheese and yoghurt, but oppose factory-style farming and its environmental footprint.</p> <p>Through a combination of yeast, cow DNA and plant nutrients, Perfect Day claims to have created a product identical in taste and nutritional value to cow\u2019s milk, but without any udders involved.<br></p> <p>Sales of milk alternatives such as soy, coconut, almond and more recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/25/pea-milk-non-dairy-ripple-france-environment\">pea milk</a> are expected to be worth more than <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-markets-for-milk-alternatives-300293746.html\">$10bn</a> by 2019. But until now they have not cut traditional milk and dairy production.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe alternatives for yoghurt, cheese and ice-cream are so bad that people don\u2019t even want to try them,\u201d says Perfect Day co-founder Ryan Pandya. \u201cMany have been switching to more plant-based diets but when you have to give up cheese you think \u2018oh my god my life sucks I love pizza\u2019. If you try to make cheese out of pea milk you will be sorely disappointed.\u201d<br></p> <p>The missing ingredient in plant-based alternatives is milk protein. To make the animal-free cow\u2019s milk, Perfect Day insert cow DNA \u2013 which is readily available thanks to decades of research by the dairy industry \u2013 into yeast and add sugar to create milk proteins through fermentation. These milk proteins are then combined with sugar, fats and nutrients to create the final product.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking plant nutrients and transforming them into animals proteins the same way that cows do, using the same milk proteins as found in cow\u2019s milk, but much more efficiently, because we\u2019re using a yeast cell not a 2,000lb animal,\u201d said Pandya.<br></p> <p>Although comparisons have been made with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/aug/05/world-first-synthetic-hamburger-mouth-feel\">lab-grown meat</a>, Pandya said they are not using novel technology. \u201cMany people initially go \u2018oh is this like lab or test-tube milk\u2019, but that\u2019s wrong. There are no test tubes in our fermentation process it\u2019s just like brewing craft beer. The meat folks are trying to invent technology that doesn\u2019t exist today, but our milk is made through techniques in use for more than three decades.\u201d<br></p> <p>While there is no sign yet of a commercial lab-grown meat product, Perfect Day said it plans to launch a cheese, yoghurt or ice-cream product by the end of 2017, with milk following later. It will be priced similar to organic dairy, but the company expects to quickly have a lower cost of production than milk.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The startup has already raised $4m from investors and been in talks, perhaps surprisingly, with a number of traditional dairy companies. \u201cThe assumption was that we\u2019d be hated by the dairy industry but it\u2019s actually the opposite. They see us as the long-term solution to problems they didn\u2019t even know were solvable,\u201d said Pandya.<br></p> <p>Those problems include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/05/think-dairy-farming-is-benign-our-rivers-tell-a-different-story\">water pollution</a> and climate change. The world\u2019s quarter of a billion dairy cows are responsible for <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/i3437e.pdf\">just under 3%</a> of global greenhouse gas emissions. A <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.animalfreemilk.com/files/PD-LCA.pdf\">study commissioned</a> by Perfect Day found its animal-free milk uses approximately 24\u00ad-84% lower energy use, 98% lower water use, 77-\u00ad91% lower land use, and 35\u00ad-65% lower emissions.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Rather than bringing to an end traditional dairy farming, Pandya expects their milk product to help negate the need for ever more intensive dairy farm systems. \u201cWe\u2019re here to create another option for people. There is more and more demand for dairy and that is causing increasing factory farming. Everyone agrees we should do less of that and that\u2019s something we\u2019ll actually be able to do.\u201d<br></p> <p>However, it seems unlikely they will be able to call their new product cow or dairy milk. </p> <p>A spokesperson for the US Food and Drug Administration said a product labelled as dairy milk needed to involve the \u201ccomplete milking of one or more healthy cows\u201d. If a food does not meet these standards then it must be labelled \u201cwith a common or usual name or an appropriately descriptive term, and the labelling must be truthful and not misleading\u201d.<br></p>",

  "<p>John Ford shot Monument Valley, Wes Anderson shoots highly stylized interiors and, if Nick Cannon continues to make films like King of the Dancehall, historians will note him for his worshipful appreciation of the female posterior.

And adapting to a new culture is, to a degree, what this lighthearted and agreeable story is all about. Cannon\u2019s Tarzan is a New Yorker just finishing a five year prison sentence. His ill mother (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/shortcuts/2016/jul/24/from-michael-caine-to-whoopi-goldberg-how-celebs-chose-their-stage-names\">Whoopi Goldberg</a>) has bills up to the wazoo, so Tarzan heads down to his cousin Toaster in Kingston (an almost unrecognisable Busta Rhymes) to work out a low-level drug running scheme.</p> <p>But this is not a Scarface-like saga. Tarzan just wants enough money to make things right (Mum needs surgery, if you can believe it) but what he really needs is the love of his neighbour Maya (remarkable newcomer Kimberly Patterson). Maya is a Bishop\u2019s daughter and steadfastly chaste, but that doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t get rambunctious at the dancehall. The way to her heart is to learn the moves, so Tarzan joins up with a crew of ridiculously buff guys, takes off his shirt and starts getting in rhythm.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/feb/12/reggae-dancehall-artwork-wilfred-limonious\">King of the dancehall: the reggae art of Wilfred Limonious \u2013\u00a0in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The nightlife scenes are euphoric and sensual, and Cannon has the good sense to let them play out at length. Scenes of Tarzan and Toaster busting each other\u2019s chops are terrific, especially when the sourpuss aunt who \u201chasn\u2019t smiled since 1979\u201d is giving them guff as she serves them rice and peas. Everyone but Tarzan speaks in a patois so thick the film uses subtitles and Jamaican music legend Beenie Man acts as something of a Greek chorus. Even though the screenplay is loaded with cliche and its twists are absurd and predictable, when it settles into a groove there is a terrific sense of place. Somehow, the far-fetched nature of the plot still rings true.</p> <p>The third act of the film ties itself up in some ridiculous mob boss scenes (Peter Stormare plays a European who likes to tell stories about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/23/the-clash-10-of-the-best\">Paul Simonon of the Clash</a>) and while many may turn their nose up at this sharp tonal turn, it feels in line with the low budget regional filmmaking from the 1970s. The 1972 Jimmy Cliff vehicle The Harder They Come is clearly something of an influence here.</p> <p>For all the oogling on the dance floor, the gaze does go both ways, and there is something of a respectful message to women. For every patriarchal utterance of \u201cyou\u2019re my girl\u201d there\u2019s a willingness to respect Maya\u2019s decision to keep things slow in the bedroom. But the dancehall is a fire pit, and naturally the picture ends with a battle royale in which Tarzan (who only just started to learn his moves) has to save the world with his sweat-glistening abs and thrusting pelvis. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m calling a travel agent to book a trip to Jamaica. </p>",
  "<p>Electric car charging points could appear alongside petrol pumps at Shell\u2019s UK service stations as soon as next year, the oil giant confirmed after emails between the company and government officials revealed discussions on introducing them.</p> <p>The company also asked the government how serious it is about wireless charging roads which could top up an electric car without the need to plug in, as mooted by Conservative MP Oliver Letwin.</p> <p>The diversification into infrastructure for battery-powered cars would mark a new departure for the company, which has largely backed biofuels as a greener alternative to petrol and diesel in the past. It could also suggest a softening of stance from an industry which Telsa co-founder Elon Musk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/24/elon-musk-oil-electric-cars-tobacco-tesla\">has accused of using misinformation campaigns against electric cars</a>.<br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.desmog.uk/2016/09/12/revealed-exxon-mobil-lobbying-against-electric-vehicles-uk\">Emails released after a Freedom of Information request by DeSmogBlog</a>, a site which monitors fossil fuel lobbying, shows that Shell staff and government transport officials discussed both electric cars and hydrogen fuel this year.<br></p> <p>In one exchange, a Shell staffer on secondment from the Department for Business writes to the government\u2019s Office for Low Emission Vehicles to suggest electric cars are being held back by a lack of public charging points and the cars\u2019 range, which is typically around 100 miles for many models.<br></p> <p>\u201cYou will know more of the challenges around electric cars than me but the availability of fast charging infrastructure, and how that links to range anxiety, is probably up there with one of the main issues concerning customers,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAs a sample of one, I do not have access to off road parking so buying an EV myself is not currently viable.\u201d</p> <p>In a later exchange, a Shell employee appeals for more detail on the regulatory regime for charging point operators. \u201cI have been asked whether Shell will need an electricity supply license if we are to provide a service to customers to charge their electric cars.\u201d Shell also asks about whether the idea of wireless charging roads in Britain \u201chas legs\u201d and how ambitious the government is about the idea.</p> <p>Asked if the emails show Shell is moving into charging points, a spokeswoman said: \u201cWe are examining the potential to introduce electric vehicle charging points across some parts of our UK retail network from early 2017 onwards.\u201d<br></p> <p>Shell will be going into competition with companies such as Chargemaster, Ecotricity and Tesla, which have all been building out networks of charging points in the UK. <a href=\"https://www.zap-map.com/statistics/#location\">According to Zap Map</a>, there are more than 12,000 chargers in the UK.</p> <p>David Martell, CEO of Chargemaster, which owns more than 4,000 of the UK\u2019s chargers, said: \u201cI think it\u2019s great.

  "<p>NWA\u2019s first EP was called Panic Zone. Released in 1987, it features Dope Man, a song written by a teenage Ice Cube that foreshadowed the group\u2019s sound and image to come. It alternately glamorizes and condemns the drug pusher and his lifestyle, ending with a stern warning voiced by Mexican-American rapper Krazy Dee: \u201cYou sold crack to my sister and now she\u2019s sick / But if she happens to die because of your drug / I\u2019m putting in your culo a .38 slug.\u201d<br></p> <p>For Dr Dre, the group\u2019s main producer, it was his first use of the \u201cfunky worm\u201d, the high-pitched, irresistible Moog synthesizer sound whose name was coined from a song by the 70s funk group Ohio Players. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/mar/17/george-clinton-listen-conversation-with-alexis-petridis\">George Clinton: funk legend talks to Alexis Petridis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The sound was next heard on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/apr/09/nwa-admitted-to-rock-roll-hall-of-fame-at-ceremony-mired-by-bad-blood\">NWA\u2019s second full-length album</a>, 1991\u2019s Efil4zaggin (Niggaz 4 Life spelled backward), the first gangsta rap album to hit No1. Efil4zaggin marks a great leap forward in Dr Dre\u2019s production skills. Whereas their previous album Straight Outta Compton was all over the place sonically, Efil is mostly unified in its doomsday grooves. Always into Something is a slow-building sonic masterpiece, kicking off with a spoken word MC Ren introduction and a quick Dre verse before unveiling the alien-sounding, high-pitched synthesizer sound, similar to the \u201cfunky worm\u201d. In the studio, Dre was hoping to capture the magic of Parliament-Funkadelic member Bernie Worrell\u2019s eerie, melodic keyboard sounds, and so he had engineer Colin Wolfe go out and buy a Moog.</p> <p>Following the album Dre left NWA and its label Ruthless Records, owing to a money dispute with Eazy-E, who owned the label, and NWA\u2019s manager, Jerry Heller. Dre recorded the first half of his solo debut The Chronic (which came out near the end of 1992) at his Calabasas house, in a bedroom he\u2019d converted into a studio. After a fire there, the rest was made at Solar\u2019s Galaxy studios, where he made use of a state-of-the-art SSL console, a huge, futuristic mixing board with pre-programmable \u201cflying faders\u201d capable of automatically adjusting itself to your preferred settings. \u201cIt was like the Starship Enterprise,\u201d producer Rhythm D, who worked with Death Row for a time, told me. </p> <p>Yet it was still the pre-digital era, and so they edited on analog tapes, literally cutting them by hand. \u201cYou would mark the tape with a grease pencil and then use a razor blade,\u201d remembered Chris \u201cThe Glove\u201d Taylor, an engineer and musician on the album.</p> <p>More than ever, Dre was finding inspiration in Parliament-Funkadelic. He again used the Moog to create both a chunky bass effect using different settings and the \u201cfunky worm\u201d squeal. It\u2019s that enchanting, high-pitched whine that is the signature sound of The Chronic. It\u2019s melodic, it\u2019s somewhat terrifying, it instantly makes your ears prick up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1c7c285e20aea5569e0e79c478cd83db213b060\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1c7c285e20aea5569e0e79c478cd83db213b060/0_76_4400_2640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Clinton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Clinton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone Pictures USA / Alamy/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was also the perfect, terrifying sound for Chronic diss track Fuck wit Dre Day (And Everybody\u2019s Celebratin\u2019). The song\u2019s venom was directed at Eazy\u2011E, starting with a skit preceding the video, in which Eazy is portrayed by comedian AJ Johnson as a locs-clad, Jheri-curled Uncle Tom being sold a load of BS from Heller, played by portly Interscope executive Steve Berman. Over the bass-rattling, slow funk track, Dre took direct aim at Eazy: \u201cUsed to be my homie, used to be my ace / Now I want to slap the taste out your mouth / Make you bow down to the Row / Fuckin\u2019 me, now I\u2019m fuckin\u2019 you, little ho. Eazy was no longer respected by his own people, he went on, and should watch his back because he might get smoked.\u201d</p> <p>Backed by emerging rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg, the album featured Dre sampling or interpolating a half dozen songs from either Parliament or Funkadelic, sister groups that were both led by George Clinton. Dre\u2019s genius was realizing how well they\u2019d combine with rap lyrics. Part of the connection was emotional. P-Funk\u2019s psychedelic rock was cutting edge, but to those who grew up in the 70s it was also warm and nostalgic, the soundtrack to back-yard parties and civil rights rallies. Combining it with the rough-and-tumble lyrics of gangsta rap merged the hard and the soft, the light and the dark. The sound was called G-funk \u2013 gangsta funk \u2013 and it would come to dominate hip-hop for years.</p> <p>What made G-funk so effective? An LA musician named D\u00e2m-Funk \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/03/dam-funk-snoop-dogg-stones-throw-hudson-mohawke-ariel-pink\">a keytar-toting funk revivalist who collaborated with Snoop on the 2013 album 7 Days of Funk</a> \u2013 put it well. He told me that, for many who grew up on Parliament-Funkadelic, the sound came to symbolize a halcyon time before crack cocaine came along in the early 80s and decimated the inner city. D\u00e2m-Funk cites Funkadelic\u2019s 1979 song Not Just (Knee Deep), which Dre would later sample for a Tupac track, as \u201calmost like the end credits rolling on a certain era.</p> <p>\u201cBecause, before that, there wasn\u2019t crack,\u201d he went on. \u201cAnd then that era came, and a lot of people got lost after that. You can almost feel it in the music that something was on the horizon ... It symbolizes happiness and sadness. That\u2019s what the funk is.\u201d</p> <h2>Who invented G-funk?</h2> <p>Who invented G-funk? Though Dr Dre is its most famous purveyor, the question is controversial.</p> <p>DJ Quik, who emerged in the early 90s, has long been injecting serious funk into his hip-hop, and was undoubtedly influential on Dre\u2019s sound. But it was the Ruthless gangsta rap group Above the Law that would directly claim credit for the G-funk sound, offering as evidence their early 1993 sophomore album Black Mafia Life. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6a7a24dafa6f7cd6d0aef809ae768c92da581a7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a7a24dafa6f7cd6d0aef809ae768c92da581a7f/0_164_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"D\u00e2m-Funk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">D\u00e2m-Funk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Scott</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That work wasn\u2019t a massive hit like The Chronic, but the albums bear some clear similarities: Nuthin\u2019 But a G Thang echoes Above the Law\u2019s Never Missin\u2019 a Beat, for example, while their Pimp Clinic and Dre\u2019s Let Me Ride both borrow from Parliament-Funkadelic\u2019s take on the spiritual Swing Low, Sweet Chariot. Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and, let me ride.</p> <p>Black Mafia Life was released in early 1993, about two months after The Chronic, but, according to many accounts, was finished beforehand. \u201cG-funk was our style of music,\u201d said Above the Law collaborator Kokane, adding that group producers Cold 187um and KMG the Illustrator forged the sound.</p> <p>During Dre\u2019s final months at Ruthless, he worked on NWA\u2019s Efil4zaggin while Cold 187um was simultaneously working on Black Mafia Life, and the pair often sounded each other out. It was during this period that he fashioned the G-funk sound, said Cold 187um. \u201cThe only thing I can say is that G-funk was my theory,\u201d he said. Dre \u201cutilized it and made lots of money and commercialized it, and I never got credit for it. All I wanted was my credit. I don\u2019t think he was being malicious. I think he heard a hot sound and then he used it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All I wanted was my credit. I don\u2019t think he was being malicious. I think he heard a hot sound and then he used it</p> <footer> <cite>Cold 187um</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many agree with this version of events, including Eazy-E. \u201cDre stole that style,\u201d he told writer Phyllis Pollack. \u201cDre stole stuff from Above the Law, Black Mafia Life\u2019s Never Missing a Beat.\u201d NWA promoter Doug Young agreed that Above the Law had the sound first. But Dre, he added, deserves credit for turning G-funk into the powerhouse it became. \u201cWhen you listen to that stuff to this day, it still holds up because of the sonics of the production,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The dispute caused tension between Ruthless and Death Row to nearly boil over. In February 1993, at an industry event called the Urban Network Power Jam held at the Marriott Hotel near LAX, Cold 187um angrily approached Warren G, Dr Dre\u2019s stepbrother. Warren G would later become famous for his song with Nate Dogg, Regulate, and had worked closely on The Chronic. Warren had also previously stayed, for a time, at Cold 187um\u2019s crash pad in Colton, California, along with members of Above the Law. Warren and Cold187um had previously been friendly, but now there was tension in the air. According to Cold187um, a dispute erupted:</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s fucked up how motherfuckers just integrated our style into they shit and created The Chronic,\u201d Cold 187um said. \u201cI ain\u2019t got nothing to do with that, that\u2019s between you and Dre,\u201d Warren responded.</p> <p>\u201cWait a minute man, I let you stay at my house, I let you be a part of my family, and you treat me like this?\u201d said Cold 187um. \u201cIf you ain\u2019t got nothing to do with that, you ain\u2019t got nothing to do with me no more.\u201d</p> <p>Warren was accompanied by fellow Death Row affiliates Snoop Dogg, Lil\u2019 \u00bd Dead, and others. Cold 187um was backed by artists including Eazy-E and an artist Eazy was recruiting at the time \u2013 Tupac Shakur, about two years before he signed with Death Row. </p> <p>The camps got to barking at each other, and before long everyone reached for their guns. \u201cThere were 15 of them, and about 25 to 30 of us,\u201d remembered Charis Henry, Eazy-E\u2019s assistant. \u201cIt was a standoff. It was the most nerve-racking thing imaginable.\u201d No one pulled the trigger. A bodyguard named Hollywood \u2013 who had worked with both camps \u2013 interceded. \u201cI need you, Death Row, to turn around, drop your guns, and walk out the door,\u201d he said, in Henry\u2019s recollection. \u201c[Eazy], I need you to wait for 15 minutes, and then take yourself home.\u201d Both sides complied, and the situation resolved peacefully.</p> <p>The G-funk drama was far from over, however. </p> <h2>\u2018You rollin\u2019 with Ruthless\u2019</h2> <p>Producer Rhythm D smelled the stench of defeat when he walked into Eazy\u2011E\u2019s Norwalk home around this time. Morale was low. Bodyguards were lying around on couches, while Ruthless affiliates watched LaserDiscs from Eazy\u2019s library or were out driving his luxury cars. The house boasted a top-of-the-line studio, armed with equipment like a brand new E-mu SP-1200 drum machine and sampler. But nobody was using it.</p> <p>Rhythm D had come over to play Eazy his beats. It was something of an audition for the tall, light-skinned South Central producer, whose career was on the rise thanks to his hit track for Los Angeles rapper Paperboy, Ditty. During his brief dalliance with Death Row, Rhythm D also made a song for the Deep Cover soundtrack called Down with My Nigga, featuring rapper Paradise. But he was broke and anxious for his next payday. To Eazy\u2019s house he brought with him a green tackle box. Rather than fishing lures, it held a floppy disk of his beats.</p> <p>While Rhythm cued up his songs, Eazy ducked into the shower. He seemed to have only half his mind on the proceedings. Undaunted, Rhythm plugged in his speakers and played a beat. It featured him and producer Battlecat going back and forth, trying to outdo each other with samples. The track had a wild energy about it, which Eazy felt immediately. He jumped out of the shower, hair all crazy, throwing on a towel and running into the room.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0f0c2d68f918c5aa2941a1d6e48fd6b3e7054ef4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f0c2d68f918c5aa2941a1d6e48fd6b3e7054ef4/5_0_595_744/400.jpg\" alt=\"Jerry Heller with Eazy-E of NWA.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jerry Heller with Eazy-E of NWA.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ruthless Record</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou rollin\u2019 with Ruthless,\u201d he exclaimed, signing Rhythm to a deal on the spot. Rhythm immediately moved into the house and got to work. Now that Dre was gone, his job description was Ruthless\u2019s newest in-house producer.</p> <p>Rhythm quickly realized he would have to do more than just make songs \u2013 he was going to have to shake Eazy out of his creative coma. He wasn\u2019t himself lately. The conflicts with Dre and Death Row leader Suge Knight had taken a toll.</p> <p>Eazy\u2019s first instinct was to craft a diss record scathing enough to send Dre scurrying under a rock. But his timing was bad. In this pre-YouTube era, rap beef moved at the speed of molasses. Eazy\u2019s last EP, 5150: Home 4 tha Sick, came out just a few days before The Chronic dropped, and didn\u2019t address Dre by name. It sold only a bit more than 500,000 copies, a flop considering Eazy\u2019s previous platinum sales history. </p> <p>Rhythm D had sat in on The Chronic recording sessions and had a strong feeling that G-funk was about to take over. After much arguing, he convinced Eazy that their Fuck wit Dre Day response should include the haunting new gangsta sound. But what about the song\u2019s message? How could they hit Dre back where it hurt?</p> <p>Rhythm lit up a fat one and got to thinking. Sure, Dre was practically untouchable right now, from a musical perspective. But there was a big difference between sounding like a gangsta and being a gangsta. To the guys in the streets, this was not incidental.</p> <p>They needed to convince these guys that Dre was phony, an opportunist. After all, not long ago, while Eazy was out selling crack and getting into trouble, Dre was dancing on stage and wearing makeup and fitted suits in his first group, called World Class Wreckin\u2019 Cru. Eazy was authentic. He was real. It was time to drive that point home. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"13a7b57957fde28c547070896c5db8721580b250\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13a7b57957fde28c547070896c5db8721580b250/166_595_2085_1250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"World Class Wreckin\u2019 Cru.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">World Class Wreckin\u2019 Cru.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rhythm stayed up all night one night in 1993, fashioning the template for the song that would become Real Muthaphuckkin G\u2019s, or, on the radio, Real Compton City G\u2019s.</p> <p>Mirroring the tempo of Dre Day, the track also features a high-pitched Moog squeal. But it sounds even more intimidating, owing largely to Eazy\u2019s performance. The pace of Real Muthaphuckkin G\u2019s suited him, and his own eerie instrument-a \u201cdemonic, gnome type of voice\u201d, Rhythm D called it \u2013 fit the track\u2019s tone. And so, in the studio, Eazy launched into a series of disses and rebuttals. (\u201cAll of the sudden Dr Dre is the G thang / But on his old album covers he was a she-thang\u201d).</p> <p>The song also took aim at Snoop Dogg (Tell me where the fuck you found an anorexic rapper) and featured Eazy-E\u2019s newest, toughest recruits: Dresta, who had recently emerged from prison for assault, and who wrote the hook and Eazy\u2019s verses, and Dresta\u2019s younger brother BG Knocc Out. Both of them were Nutty Blocc Crips whom Eazy met through a connection from Watts\u2019s Jordan Downs projects. </p> <p>The song\u2019s accompanying EP It\u2019s On (Dr. Dre) 187um Killa contained a photo of Dre in his snug\u2011fitting doctor\u2019s outfit from his World Class Wreckin\u2019 Cru photo shoot, with arrows pointing out his eye shadow\u201d, \u201ceyeliner\u201d, \u201clipstick\u201d, and \u201csequins\u201d. In an era before Google, the mere existence of this photo probably came as a surprise to many Dre fans.</p> <p>The disses were disingenuous at times. The stuff about Dre\u2019s glam days overstated, and besides Eazy knew about all of that when he signed on with Dre for NWA, and it didn\u2019t bother him back then.</p> <p>The particulars aside, one thing was clear: Eazy was back on message, and had his swagger back. It\u2019s On reinvigorated Eazy, selling more than 2m copies.</p> <p>So, who won this G-funk showdown, Eazy or Dre? You could say they both did, as it reignited both of their careers. But one could argue that hip-hop ultimately lost, as their dispute had far-reaching consequences, foreshadowing the murders of Tupac and Biggie. </p> <p>Previously, rap confrontations had been about who was superior on the microphone. The Eazy v Dre battle, however, was about who was the toughest in real life.

  "<p>The cost to taxpayers of running Australia\u2019s offshore detention centres was higher than necessary because the Department of Border Protection and Immigration failed to comply with the commonwealth procurement standards, a report by the Australian National Audit Office has found.</p> <p>The report into the procurement of garrison support and welfare services for the offshore processing centres on Manus Island and Nauru, <a href=\"https://www.anao.gov.au/work/performance-audit/offshore-processing-centres-nauru-and-papua-new-guinea-procurement\">released on Tuesday</a>, found the department had \u201cfallen well short of effective procurement practice\u201d in negotiating more than $3bn worth of contracts for both centres since they were reopened in 2012.</p> <p>It identified \u201cserious and persistent deficiencies\u201d in the department\u2019s management of the contracts, including \u201csignificant skill and capability gaps\u201d among staff and \u201cpersistent shortcomings\u201d in areas ranging from record keeping to the ability to assess value for money.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/13/australia-has-spent-96bn-on-asylum-seeker-policy-in-four-years-says-report\">Australia has spent $9.6bn on asylum seeker policy in four years, says report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said the report was \u201can independent expose of the absolute chaos and dysfunction at the heart of the Rudd-Gillard Labor governments in their handling of border security\u201d and that \u201ctotal responsibility for the problems and processes outlined in the report falls upon Labor\u201d.</p> <p>However, the report reserved its strongest criticism for the handling of an open tender process that began under the Abbott government.</p> <p>Asylum seekers began arriving at the reopened offshore processing centre in Nauru on 14 September 2012, three weeks after the Gillard government passed legislation to reopen camps on both Nauru and Manus Island under a deal that saw the Australian government bear the cost of establishing and running the centres. </p> <p>Manus Island received its first arrivals on 21 November 2012.</p> <p>The report said the contracts for garrison support \u2013 security, cleaning, and catering \u2013 and welfare services, which included education and recreation, were awarded under a limited tender process in August 2012 and again in 2013, when the department consolidated the contracts by making Transfield the principal contractor across both centres.</p> <p>The initial contract with Transfield for garrison support at Nauru, which ran from September 2012 to March 2014, was worth $351m. The current contract, for garrison support and welfare services at both Manus and Nauru until February 2017, is worth almost $2.2bn.</p> <p>The report said the department failed to demonstrate value for money in either of the initial limited tender processes or in the subsequent open tender process, which began in 2015 and was abandoned on 29 July 2016, after the department failed to assure a steering committee its renegotiated agreement with Transfield represented value for money.</p> <p>\u201cProcurement is core business for commonwealth entities and the deficiencies have resulted in higher than necessary expense for taxpayers and significant reputational risks for the Australian government and [the department],\u201d it said.</p> <p>The audit said the failures in the open tender process, conducted under the Abbott-Turnbull government, were of \u201cmost concern,\u201d finding the department allowed Transfield to negotiate a $1.1bn increase in the value of the contract without checking whether it had the authority to agree to that increase or whether other tenderers could best that price.</p> <p>It said that was of particular concern because the department had been explicitly ordered to reduce the cost per head of running the centres.</p> <p>According to figures provided by the department, the average cost per head declined from $698,000 in 2012-13 to $529,000 in 2015-2016 but, when you exclude capital expenditure from that calculation, the cost had actually gone up from $427,000 to $464,000.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://newsroom.border.gov.au/releases/79a3be7b-0b3c-4aab-9e3a-a5c6aecf15fe\">a statement on Tuesday</a>, the department said its conduct \u201cmust be considered in the context of the unique operational environment [it] faced at the time\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe department met the requirement of the government of the day in an environment that was high-tempo and complicated by logistics and procurement activities in foreign countries,\u201d it said.</p> <p>\u201cDelegates were required to make decisions on complex matters within very short timeframes. It remains the department\u2019s position that decisions taken in this period were reasonable under the circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>The department said Australia\u2019s immigration detention network was under \u201cconsiderable strain\u201d from the arrival of almost 7,000 asylum seekers by boat in the first seven months of 2012 and said it acknowledged that \u201cdecision-making processes in this complex and rapidly evolving environment were not adequately documented\u201d.</p> <p>The department said it accepted the audit office\u2019s recommendations and had already begun to update its computer systems to allow for better record-keeping.</p> <p>Dutton said the Coalition was \u201cworking steadfastly to clean up Labor\u2019s monumental mess\u201d and called on Labor to \u201cacknowledge that its incompetent performance placed an impossible burden on the public service\u201d, saying department and Australian Border Force staff deserved an apology from the opposition leader, Bill Shorten.</p>",
  "<p>For many teenagers, North Korea is written off as a meme, a silly joke, or a country that could not possibly be real.</p> <p>This view mostly comes from The Interview, Seth Rogen and James Franco\u2019s comedy about a pair of journalists who try to assassinate dictator Kim Jong-un \u2013 a film that riled North Korea and almost brought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/07/fbi-director-north-korea-source-sony-cyber-attack-james-comey\">Sony Pictures to its knees</a> last year.</p> <p>But in his memoir, <a href=\"http://www.abramsandchronicle.co.uk/books/young-adult/9781419723810-every-falling-star\">Every Falling Star</a>, North Korean defector Sungju Lee attempts to flip this narrative on its head. </p> <p>Lee was born into a wealthy military family but when he turned 12 things started to go wrong. He was separated from his parents and forced to fend for himself on the streets of Gyeong-seong, in the north-east of the country, where he joined a street gang.</p> <p>Every Falling Star presents North Korea as a horrifying real-life dystopia. The book, the first of its kind aimed at young adults, is a first-person account of what it is like to be born and raised in a terrifying environment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/sep/13/i-was-in-a-north-korean-street-gang-now-i-study-at-warwick-any-questions\">'I was in a North Korean street gang, now I study at Warwick' \u2013 any questions?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lee describes how he ate insects to survive, became a pickpocket and, in one of the book\u2019s most heartbreaking scenes, was forced to bury some of his close friends.</p> <p>Every Falling Star is part memoir, part history lesson \u2013 a welcome approach as reliable information from the country is notoriously tricky to source.</p> <p>Young adult literature has repeatedly proved it can be as emotionally mature as adult fiction, a fact sometimes misjudged by new writers to the genre. Lee does not patronise or dilute any of the emotion in his account \u2013 several chapters are harrowing to read, and the book is better for it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/01/north-koreans-dollar-loving-market-generation\">How my generation of dollar-loving North Koreans will shake up regime</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My biggest<em> </em>concern about the book was that it would follow the all too familiar tale of finding a family in the form of a street gang, but this was not the case. Lee manages to portray the complex nature of his former peers: they are sweet, empathetic young men bound by circumstance. The book\u2019s strongest suit is that it never resorts to cliche, which is often difficult to achieve in a memoir. </p> <p>But there are occasions when Lee references some detail about life in North Korea, but then moves on without fully expanding on it. It is understandable that he would want to protect those he left behind, but it does at times become frustrating.</p> <p>Lee has crafted a novel that is both educational (the history of North Korea is explained in an extended prologue) yet gripping, and one that ends with a message of hope. </p> <p>With a narrative that never feels like it is talking down to its audience, this memoir is an enlightening and poignant read.</p>",

There were long nights, I\u2019m told, weighing up the approach to an election against Turnbull, who was basking in political sunshine and flowers. The immediate decision was whether to go with Labor\u2019s electorally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/11/the-10-big-issues-of-election-2016-how-coalition-labor-and-greens-policies-compare\">risky negative gearing policy</a>. But it seemed to reflect a larger decision as to whether to die on his feet or live on his knees, as <strong>Peter Garrett</strong> would sing. Obviously, with nothing to lose, Shorten declared \u201cduck it\u201d and started <em>behaving</em> as though he had nothing to lose. </p> <p>History records that from December last year, Turnbull\u2019s stocks began to fall and Shorten\u2019s began to rise.</p> <p>Segue to the Newspoll this morning, released in the Oz. Here is <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/newspoll/newspoll-turnbull-trails-shorten-with-coalition-and-alp-in-tie/news-story/30cf1b393b8511a89152e71a718235f9\">Phil Hudson</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Malcolm Turnbull reaches his \u00adone-year anniversary as prime minister with a worse approval rating than Bill Shorten and his government tied at 50-50 with the \u00adopposition.<br></p> <p>Despite Labor\u2019s calamity last week with the forced resignation of prominent senator <strong>Sam Dastyari</strong> from its frontbench, there has been no gain for the Coalition according to the latest Newspoll, taken exclusively for the Australian<em>.</em> </p> </blockquote> <p>And this:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Analysis by the Australian<em> </em>shows the Coalition\u2019s average 50.7 per cent result in two-party terms under Mr Turnbull\u2019s leadership is the second best performance for a prime minister since 2002. Yet while Mr Turnbull remains the preferred prime minister by 43 per cent to Mr Shorten\u2019s 31 per cent, after spending a week overseas attending summits with world leaders, satisfaction with his performance is at its lowest level since he took power. Only 34 per cent of voters say they are satisfied with Mr Turnbull\u2019s performance as prime minister, \u00adalmost half the 60 per cent satisfaction peak he reached late last year.</p> </blockquote> <p>Now, obviously, there is a whole lot more at play for Turnbull. But for the outside observer, Turnbull continues to looked like a trapped man, trapped by his party\u2019s right and racked by indecision. If he were free, would he have a different agenda? We may never know. </p> <p>As of last night, the conservatives have just insisted on funding for the yes and no cases for the same-sex marriage plebiscite \u2013 a figure I am told is $7.5m for each side. The date of the vote will be 11 February, if the party room agrees. Given the guy did not want a plebiscite and supports marriage equality, it is a long way down off that horse. </p> <p>Next, the news. Strap yourself in. Party-room meetings coming up. Australian Marriage Equality is speaking to the National party room.

  "<p>\u201cWhen you don\u2019t have any support structure that becomes a barrier to getting back to work for both men and women.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m discussing a new <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/women-and-equalities-committee/news-parliament-2015/pregnancy-and-maternity-report-published-16-17/\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a> showing that each year 54,000 women face some form of maternity discrimination with Nora Senior, UK and Ireland chair of Weber Shandwick, who recently stepped down as president of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC).<br></p> <p>The report highlights a clear problem facing UK business. Despite the changes to parental leave legislation and greater awareness of how to retain women after they\u2019ve had children, it seems the rhetoric isn\u2019t being put into practice. Senior agrees with the key finding of the report, that climbing the corporate ladder is much, much harder if you\u2019re a woman with children, and feels this is down to timing and childcare options.<br></p> <p>She wants the government to look at how it funds childcare. At the moment funding only starts when a child is three, and so anyone acting as a chief caregiver of children could be out of the workforce for three years.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/31/mps-urge-better-job-protection-for-expectant-and-new-mothers\">MPs urge better job protection for expectant and new mothers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cGovernment has to look at putting in place better childcare facilities,\u201d she says. \u201cIf women do take time out to care for family they are then out of the office for a longer period of time and find it hard to come back.\u201d<br></p> <p>For Senior, the role business plays in the retention of women comes down to two things; an understanding of how to engage employees and the reality that for many small businesses their priority is simply staying afloat, not gender equality.<br></p> <p>\u201cBusinesses should look at how they maintain contact and bring women back into the workforce. One way for this is looking at the tech available, looking at flexible working options \u2026 [Also], one of the biggest ways to retain staff is training, they see a career path that is going to upskill them and they see a career path within the company. More needs to be done to encourage and incentivise training.<br></p> <p>\u201cI think at the moment staying in businesses is a bigger priority and profitability will always come first. Being able to keep your business trading with a profit line is a bigger issue. Small businesses don\u2019t have the time to sit down and work out policies and training programmes that support women, or even men.\u201d<br></p> <p>This lack of time and infrastructure is an issue that comes up in different guises again and again. Her time running the BCC allowed Senior to work with businesses at all different sizes and stages of their development, and in a range of political climates, but she clearly thinks there are some problems that are perennial. As someone with a languages background and a role that requires constantly advising international clients she\u2019s understandably interested in the UK\u2019s export market, although she is surprisingly sanguine about Brexit.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere are lots of issues that were present before Brexit and are still present. Our economy is underperforming, we need to think about incentivising smaller businesses to enter into export, how do we get those businesses access to finance etc. We have infrastructure challenges around getting goods in and out of the country, as well as local issues such as transport and access to skilled labour. From there you look at local planning and houses, because businesses need a workforce that can live around them. There are lots of challenges.\u201d<br></p> <p>How does she think the change of prime minister will affect the future of British business?<br></p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a cohesive international trade strategy, Theresa May has created an international trade department, but I don\u2019t think we have collectively moved forward in a cohesive manner on [this agenda] and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see an upward swing in export. That\u2019s a challenge for the UK economy.\u201d<br></p> <p>Senior\u2019s eyes have always been set firmly outside the UK. She did a degree in languages to \u201cescape and travel the world\u201d but after she found a job with a UK-based company promotion after promotion kept her in the country. She makes up for this by using all the technology at her disposal to work with international clients.<br></p> <p>\u201cA lot of companies I work with are doing work across the world so a lot of my time is spent on Skype helping them roll out international programmes. Tech helps you operate more easily in a global environment, when you have the mobile connectivity and the speed that\u2019s needed.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/feb/15/self-employed-women-disadvantaged-by-maternity-leave-says-report\">Self-employed women disadvantaged by maternity leave, says report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This last comment seems like a small dig at the UK\u2019s plans around this.

She points out that the UK is Europe\u2019s biggest online shopper, so the opportunity for digital businesses is huge, but we need to have the infrastructure in place.<br></p> <p>She\u2019s the sort of woman who you\u2019d trust with infrastructure and planning. She describes herself as always having been able to multi-task, and as well as juggling a big job at Weber Shandwick and presidency of the BCC, she also lives between Nottingham and Edinburgh with her husband and daughter.<br></p> <p>\u201cCommunication is at the heart of everything, I have a brilliant support team both at work and at home. My husband and I have a military approach to our diaries, so we make sure one of us is at home for our daughter.\u201d<br></p> <p>It is common for businesswomen to be asked about their home lives in a way a man simply wouldn\u2019t be, so it\u2019s not surprising that she gives a brief overview but doesn\u2019t go into much detail. I suspect she\u2019d rather I hadn\u2019t asked the question at all; maybe she\u2019s right. </p> <p>When I ask her if there\u2019s anything she wanted to talk about that I haven\u2019t mentioned she brings up the need to show young girls the options available to them. She wants to see more successful women speaking about their experiences in schools, in literature and in the media.

The Philippines may be a small nation in terms of the global games industry, but it has a sizeable fighting game community, and now in its second year the Manila Cup is an ambitious event. From September 10 to 11, the capital hosted tournaments for a range of the latest fighting games such as Mortal Kombat XL, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/08/chibi-robo-zip-lash-corpse-party-blood-drive\">BlazBlue Chronophantasma Extend</a>, and Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator. But the Philippines is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/15/street-fighter-v-review-capcom\">Street Fighter V</a> country, with almost 200 people signed up for that tournament alone. The Manila Cup is part of the global Capcom Pro Tour; winners get points that determine placement, and may lead to an appearance at the Capcom Cup in December. That\u2019s why the heavy hitters of the FGC are here \u2013 Ricki Ortiz, Justin Wong, and Kenneth \u201cK-Brad\u201d Bradley from Evil Geniuses, PandaTV\u2019s Xijie \u201cDark Jiewa\u201d Zeng, and Red Bull\u2019s Masato \u201cBonchan\u201d Takahashi, to name but a few.</p> <p>Unlike in other eSports, there are no invitation-only events or qualifiers. You sign up for the games you want, get divided into pools, and, like your gaming avatars, fight your way to the top. The tournament follows a double elimination format; lose your first game and you get sent to the losers bracket. Lose again and you\u2019re out. Given the format, there is a good possibility of slaying some giants, but a bigger one of getting slain yourself. Not that many mind; my friend Boni tells me, \u201cIt would be an honour to get bodied by Justin Wong.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m here as my friends Tzi and Billy have signed up for the Street Fighter V tournament, which has a P150,000 (\u00a32,400) grand prize. A paltry sum compared to tournaments like EVO, where prize money goes up to $100,000 (\u00a375,000), but still big money in a country where the minimum wage is barely $10 per day. I\u2019m a lowly button masher, a class of people for whom I understand there is a special circle of hell. This is my first fighting game tournament, and I\u2019m here solely for moral support.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc5e47a8c9beed42b8ea3789647356f5f739a888\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc5e47a8c9beed42b8ea3789647356f5f739a888/3_111_1277_766/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From the left: Manila Cup competitors Justin Wong and Ricki Ortiz, Patricia Wong, and Youtube personality Mike Ross\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From the left: Manila Cup competitors Justin Wong and Ricki Ortiz, Tala Wong, and YouTube personality Mike Ross.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emile Garcia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today\u2019s arena is the clubhouse of a posh neighbourhood \u2013 a gated community where everyone needs a gate pass to enter.</p> <p>Next to us in the registration queue are some of the members of Evil Geniuses (EG), one of the original and most popular pro-gaming teams. Ortiz and Wong are legends, along with YouTube personality Mike Ross. A friend eggs me on to ask for a photo with the pros while they\u2019re not busy. I relent. While English is my first language, it disintegrates in the presence of these greats. There are so many things I want to say to them \u2013 you\u2019re amazing, I love your show, you\u2019re my favorite Chun-Li player \u2013 but I settle for a photo.</p> <p>A kid, no more than 18 or 19 comes over to EG, fight stick, notebook and a scouring pad in hand. The latter he hands to Ross, who looks confused. The kid explains, using hand gestures, that it\u2019s a scrubber \u2013 \u201cscrub\u201d being gamer parlance for a bad player. It\u2019s a gag gift, a product of the Filipino fondness for wordplay. Ross laughs.</p> <p>Giddy with excitement, the kid asks Wong and Ortiz to sign his fight stick and notebook. It\u2019s probably one of the best days of his life, and it\u2019s doubtful he would be alone in feeling that. We\u2019re a small country in Southeast Asia; we don\u2019t expect the giants of the fighting game world to descend onto the Philippines en masse. Yet, here they are today, within picture-taking, autograph-signing reach. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"733d057a0a6ab73a5af92a9c4757bef64d022ace\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/733d057a0a6ab73a5af92a9c4757bef64d022ace/0_0_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manila Cup\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The event starts an hour late, as most events do in the Philippines.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emile Garcia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The event starts an hour late, as most events do in the Philippines. Everything here runs on \u201cFilipino time\u201d, a reflection of the laid-back, easygoing nature of the people. But there is a frenetic energy in the air as the pools for the different games begin, with two rows of monitors and PS4s on either side of the room. Select Street Fighter V games, usually ones where the foreign pros are playing, take place on the modest stage, streamed worldwide on Team Spooky\u2019s Twitch channel. </p> <p>Tzi\u2019s pool starts first. His Ryu gets demolished by a Cammy player, sending him to the loser\u2019s bracket, which he doesn\u2019t recover from. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d he admits afterwards. \u201cToo much Overwatch\u201d. Billy fares a bit better, losing his first two matches with Nash, but scraping out of the loser\u2019s bracket with Ken. He gets one more match before he\u2019s eliminated. \u201cAt least someone went home because of me,\u201d he says with pride. </p> <p>My friends have no illusions that they\u2019re going to beat beasts like Ryota \u201cKazunoko\u201d Inoue or K-Brad. While Billy, like many other local players, joined to test his skill level against the best local and global players, Tzi wanted to reawaken the long dormant competitive gamer in him. Losing is a humbling experience, but neither are despondent \u2013 they\u2019re only more determined to prepare for next year. Their parts over, we settle among the throng to watch the Top 32 in action.</p> <p>Chants are integral to the Filipino crowd experience, and there is pride in getting a chant going. When Wong\u2019s Karin uses her super, the whole crowd does her distinctive heiress laugh along with her, amusing the commentators. \u201cIt [Manila] doesn\u2019t get hype, it stays hype!\u201d commentator Ryan \u201cGootecks\u201d Gutierrez says on the Twitch stream. The crowd, as if to prove Gutierrez\u2019s point, does a round of the \u201cOle\u201d chant for local player Ron \u201cLimfiltration\u201d Lim. </p> <p>The local geek community is notorious for their in-jokes \u2013 a mix of 90s pop culture references, internet memes and current events. The infamous \u201cTapusin!\u201d [Finish him] chant from \u201cGost Payter\u201d, a parody of the Yu Yu Hakusho anime so central to many a Filipino childhood, starts up for Don \u201cDon\u201d Gim, the only Filipino to make it to the Top eight of the Manila Cup. The chant reverberates throughout the venue, so loud that Gutierrez removes his noise-cancelling headset to try and figure out what we\u2019re all shouting. In a nutshell, this is the Filipino FGC \u2013 snarky, irreverent, raucous and undeniably passionate.</p> <p>The fact that a Filipino player has made it to the Top eight of the Manila Cup is big. Filipinos are known for beauty pageants, music and a foul-mouthed president; fighting game players, not so much. There are so few of us competing globally that Filipino-American pro players like Ryan \u201cFilipinoChamp\u201d Ramirez and Gerald \u201cFilipinoman\u201d Herrera have made being Filipino part of their gamer identities. </p> <p>On the Twitch stream, Gutierrez, half of the eponymous \u201cExcellent Adventures of Gootecks and Mike Ross\u201d, mentions that someone asked him what Filipino players needed to do to compete with the Justin Wongs of the world. Play more and travel, Gutierrez responds.</p> <p>His answer reveals a fundamental problem when it comes to developing world class pro-gaming teams in the Philippines \u2013 a lack of funding and sponsorship. The Philippines is a developing country, and carries all the baggage of being classified as one. Corporate sponsorship isn\u2019t feasible; the goal of sponsoring professional gamers is global recognition, ie making sure that Twitch viewers in different continents can see your brand. Very few Filipino brands have global reach, and even then, they\u2019re not tech or energy drink brands, the typical sponsors for pro-gamers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aac2ea6e9374fd0d885ae42fa99c1197ac721307\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aac2ea6e9374fd0d885ae42fa99c1197ac721307/77_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Street Fighter V is the key draw in the Manila Cup\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Street Fighter V is the key draw in the Manila Cup</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Without steady financial backing, it\u2019s nearly impossible for a Filipino pro-gamer to pay for travel expenses to and from major tournaments in the United States and Japan. On top of that, Filipinos, unlike many of their Western counterparts, have to worry about visas. Getting a visa, especially to the United States, is no mean feat for the average Filipino, as embassy officials worry that we\u2019ll become illegal aliens, adding another barrier to the Philippines\u2019 pro-gaming dreams. We can\u2019t compete with the pros if we don\u2019t have the luxury to practice like the pros, and we can\u2019t do that if we\u2019re not getting backed like the pros.</p> <p>One by one, the big names bow out on Day Two. The journey ends for Bonchan and K-Brad at the Top 16; Li Wei \u201cOil King\u201d Lin with his memorable floral shorts, Ortiz, and Eita make it to the Top eight before they\u2019re eliminated. In the end, it\u2019s USA v Taiwan, Wong versus Bruce \u201cGamerbee\u201d Hsiang. When Wong, the most popular foreign player in the Philippines, hits Hsiang\u2019s Necalli with the EX version of Karin\u2019s Ressenha special attack, it\u2019s over. The crowd erupts into deafening cries of \u201cJustin Wong!\u201d and \u201cUSA! USA! USA!\u201d </p> <p>Typically stony-faced during his matches, Wong stands up and pops a fist in the air before shaking Hsiang\u2019s hand. The childhood hero of so many, one of the men responsible for creating the pro-gamer dream and living it, raises his gold trophy above his head. It\u2019s raw, electric, utter chaos, and he\u2019s immediately swarmed by fans begging him to sign their fight sticks or pose with them for selfies. Everyone wants selfies with the pros.</p> <p>It\u2019s close to 9 pm when I finally get home. It\u2019s an understatement to say it\u2019s been a long and exhausting couple of days. Before I collapse for the night, I go on YouTube to look for tutorial videos. This tournament has helped me make up my mind about who I want to main: Dhalsim. I saw two players at Manila Cup using this classic SF2 character and on finding that his move-set is close to Seth\u2019s (very slippery), he appealed greatly to me. He also reminds me of Zenyatta, my main character in Overwatch. But after 48 hours of continual Street Fighter, that\u2019s a story \u2013 and a game \u2013 for another day.</p>",
  "<p>I hate to disappoint you folks, but unless we stretch the topic to breaking point this address will not be about \u201ccommunity and belonging.\u201d In fact, you have to hand it to this festival\u2019s organisers: inviting a renowned iconoclast to speak about \u201ccommunity and belonging\u201d is like expecting a great white shark to balance a beach ball on its nose.<br></p> <p>The topic I had submitted instead was \u201cfiction and identity politics,\u201d which may sound on its face equally dreary. </p> <p>But I\u2019m afraid the bramble of thorny issues that cluster around \u201cidentity politics\u201d has got all too interesting, particularly for people pursuing the occupation I share with many gathered in this hall: fiction writing. Taken to their logical conclusion, ideologies recently come into vogue challenge our right to write fiction at all. Meanwhile, the kind of fiction we are \u201callowed\u201d to write is in danger of becoming so hedged, so circumscribed, so tippy-toe, that we\u2019d indeed be better off not writing the anodyne drivel to begin with.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with a tempest-in-a-teacup at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. Earlier this year, two students, both members of student government, threw a tequila-themed birthday party for a friend. The hosts provided attendees with miniature sombreros, which\u2014the horror\u2014 numerous partygoers wore.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/10/as-lionel-shriver-made-light-of-identity-i-had-no-choice-but-to-walk-out-on-her\">As Lionel Shriver made light of identity, I had no choice but to walk out on her | Yassmin Abdel-Magied</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When photos of the party circulated on social media, campus-wide outrage ensued. Administrators sent multiple emails to the \u201cculprits\u201d threatening an investigation into an \u201cact of ethnic stereotyping.\u201d Partygoers were placed on \u201csocial probation,\u201d while the two hosts were ejected from their dorm and later impeached. Bowdoin\u2019s student newspaper decried the attendees\u2019 lack of \u201cbasic empathy.\u201d </p> <p>The student government issued a \u201cstatement of solidarity\u201d with \u201call the students who were injured and affected by the incident,\u201d and demanded that administrators \u201ccreate a safe space for those students who have been or feel specifically targeted.\u201d The tequila party, the statement specified, was just the sort of occasion that \u201ccreates an environment where students of colour, particularly Latino, and especially Mexican, feel unsafe.\u201d In sum, the party-favour hats constituted \u2013 wait for it \u2013 \u201ccultural appropriation.\u201d</p> <p>Curiously, across my country Mexican restaurants, often owned and run by Mexicans, are festooned with sombreros \u2013 if perhaps not for long. At the UK\u2019s University of East Anglia, the student union has banned a Mexican restaurant from giving out sombreros, deemed once more an act of \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d that was also racist.</p> <p>Now, I am a little at a loss to explain what\u2019s so insulting about a sombrero \u2013 a practical piece of headgear for a hot climate that keeps out the sun with a wide brim. My parents went to Mexico when I was small, and brought a sombrero back from their travels, the better for my brothers and I to unashamedly <em>appropriate </em>the souvenir to play dress-up. For my part, as a German-American on both sides, I\u2019m more than happy for anyone who doesn\u2019t share my genetic pedigree to don a Tyrolean hat, pull on some leiderhosen, pour themselves a <em>weisbier, </em>and belt out the Hoffbrauhaus Song.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The ultimate endpoint of keeping out mitts off experience that doesn\u2019t belong to us is that there is no fiction.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But what does this have to do with writing fiction? The moral of the sombrero scandals is clear: <em>you\u2019re not supposed to try on other people\u2019s hats</em>. Yet that\u2019s what we\u2019re paid to do, isn\u2019t it? Step into other people\u2019s shoes, and try on their hats.</p> <p>In the latest ethos, which has spun well beyond college campuses in short order, any tradition, any experience, any costume, any way of doing and saying things, that is associated with a minority or disadvantaged group is ring-fenced: look-but-don\u2019t-touch. Those who embrace a vast range of \u201cidentities\u201d \u2013 ethnicities, nationalities, races, sexual and gender categories, classes of economic under-privilege and disability \u2013 are now encouraged to be possessive of their experience and to regard other peoples\u2019 attempts to participate in their lives and traditions, either actively or imaginatively, as a form of theft.</p> <p>Yet were their authors honouring the new rules against helping yourself to what doesn\u2019t belong to you, we would not have Malcolm Lowry\u2019s Under the Volcano. We wouldn\u2019t have most of Graham Greene\u2019s novels, many of which are set in what for the author were foreign countries, and which therefore have Real Foreigners in them, who speak and act like foreigners, too. </p> <p>In his masterwork English Passengers, Matthew Kneale would have restrained himself from including chapters written in an Aboriginal\u2019s voice \u2013 though these are some of the richest, most compelling passages in that novel. If Dalton Trumbo had been scared off of describing being trapped in a body with no arms, legs, or face because he was not personally disabled \u2013 because he had not been through a World War I maiming himself and therefore had no right to \u201cappropriate\u201d the isolation of a paraplegic \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t have the haunting 1938 classic, Johnny Got His Gun<em>. </em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2016/may/20/lionel-shriver-on-writing-the-mandibles-books-podcast\">Lionel Shriver on writing The Mandibles \u2013 books podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We wouldn\u2019t have Maria McCann\u2019s erotic masterpiece, As Meat Loves Salt \u2013 in which a straight woman writes about gay men in the English Civil War. Though the book is nonfiction, it\u2019s worth noting that we also wouldn\u2019t have 1961\u2019s Black Like Me, for which John Howard Griffin committed the now unpardonable sin of \u201cblackface.\u201d Having his skin darkened \u2013 Michael Jackson in reverse \u2013 Griffin found out what it was like to live as a black man in the segregated American South. He\u2019d be excoriated today, yet that book made a powerful social impact at the time.</p> <p>The author of Who Owns Culture? Appropriation and Authenticity in American Law, Susan Scafidi, a law professor at Fordham University who for the record is white, defines cultural appropriation<em> </em>as \u201ctaking intellectual property, traditional knowledge, cultural expressions, or artifacts from someone else\u2019s culture without permission. This can include unauthorised use of another culture\u2019s dance, dress, music, language, folklore, cuisine, traditional medicine, religious symbols, etc.\u201d</p> <p>What strikes me about that definition is that \u201cwithout permission\u201d bit. However are we fiction writers to seek \u201cpermission\u201d to use a character from another race or culture, or to employ the vernacular of a group to which we don\u2019t belong? Do we set up a stand on the corner and approach passers-by with a clipboard, getting signatures that grant limited rights to employ an Indonesian character in Chapter Twelve, the way political volunteers get a candidate on the ballot?</p> <p>I am hopeful that the concept of \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d is a passing fad: people with different backgrounds rubbing up against each other and exchanging ideas and practices is self-evidently one of the most productive, fascinating aspects of modern urban life. </p> <p>But this latest and little absurd no-no is part of a larger climate of super-sensitivity, giving rise to proliferating prohibitions supposedly in the interest of social justice that constrain fiction writers and prospectively makes our work impossible. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Seriously, we have people questioning whether it\u2019s appropriate for white people to eat pad Thai.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So far, the majority of these farcical cases of \u201cappropriation\u201d have concentrated on fashion, dance, and music: At the American Music Awards 2013, Katy Perry got it in the neck for dressing like a geisha.

Supported by no less than Lena Dunham, students at Oberlin College in Ohio have protested \u201cculturally appropriated food\u201d like sushi in their dining hall (lucky cusses\u2014 in my day, we never had sushi in our dining hall), whose inauthenticity is \u201cinsensitive\u201d to the Japanese. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"979a93c7516da88e5e66c36372867db0e012bf27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/979a93c7516da88e5e66c36372867db0e012bf27/0_0_2912_3904/746.jpg\" alt=\"author Lionel Shriver\" width=\"746\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lionel Shriver is the author of We Need to Talk About Kevin, the winner of the 2005 Orange Prize.

Turnabout, then: I guess that means that as a native of North Carolina, I can ban the Thais from eating barbecue. (I bet they\u2019d swap.)</p> <p>This same sensibility is coming to a bookstore near you. Because who is the appropriator par excellence, really? Who assumes other people\u2019s voices, accents, patois, and distinctive idioms? Who literally puts words into the mouths of people different from themselves? Who dares to get inside the very heads of strangers, who has the chutzpah to project thoughts and feelings into the minds of others, who steals their very souls? Who is a professional kidnapper? Who swipes every sight, smell, sensation, or overheard conversation like a kid in a candy store, and sometimes <em>take notes </em>the better to purloin whole worlds? Who is the premier pickpocket of the arts? </p> <p>The fiction writer, that\u2019s who.</p> <p>This is a disrespectful vocation by its nature \u2013 prying, voyeuristic, kleptomaniacal, and presumptuous. And that is fiction writing at its best. When Truman Capote wrote from the perspective of condemned murderers from a lower economic class than his own, he had some gall. But writing fiction takes gall.</p> <p>As for the culture police\u2019s obsession with \u201cauthenticity,\u201d fiction is inherently inauthentic. It\u2019s fake. It\u2019s self-confessedly fake; that is the nature of the form, which is about people who don\u2019t exist and events that didn\u2019t happen. The name of the game is not whether your novel honours reality; it\u2019s all about what you can get away with.</p> <p>In his 2009 novel Little Bee, Chris Cleave, who as it happens is participating in this festival, dared to write from the point of view of a 14-year-old Nigerian girl, though he is male, white, and British. I\u2019ll remain neutral on whether he \u201cgot away with it\u201d in literary terms, because I haven\u2019t read the book yet. </p> <p>But in principle, I admire his courage \u2013 if only because he invited this kind of ethical forensics in a review out of San Francisco: \u201cWhen a white male author writes as a young Nigerian girl, is it an act of empathy, or identity theft?\u201d the reviewer asked. \u201cWhen an author pretends to be someone he is not, he does it to tell a story outside of his own experiential range. But he has to in turn be careful that he is representing his characters, not using them for his plot.\u201d</p> <p>Hold it. OK, he\u2019s necessarily \u201crepresenting\u201d his characters, by portraying them on the page. But of course he\u2019s using them for his plot! How could he not? They are his characters, to be manipulated at his whim, to fulfill whatever purpose he cares to put them to.</p> <p>This same reviewer recapitulated Cleave\u2019s obligation \u201cto show that he\u2019s representing [the girl], rather than exploiting her.\u201d Again, a false dichotomy. </p> <p>Of course he\u2019s exploiting her. It\u2019s his book, and he made her up. The character is his creature, to be exploited up a storm. Yet the reviewer chides that \u201cspecial care should be taken with a story that\u2019s not implicitly yours to tell\u201d and worries that \u201cCleave pushes his own boundaries maybe further than they were meant to go.\u201d</p> <p>What stories are \u201cimplicitly ours to tell,\u201d and what boundaries around our own lives are we mandated to remain within? I would argue that any story you can <em>make </em>yours is yours to tell, and trying to push the boundaries of the author\u2019s personal experience is part of a fiction writer\u2019s job. </p> <p>I\u2019m hoping that crime writers, for example, don\u2019t all have personal experience of committing murder. Me, I\u2019ve depicted a high school killing spree, and I hate to break it to you: I\u2019ve never shot fatal arrows through seven kids, a teacher, and a cafeteria worker, either. We make things up, we chance our arms, sometimes we do a little research, but in the end it\u2019s still about what we can get away with \u2013 what we can put over on our readers. </p> <p>Because the ultimate endpoint of keeping out mitts off experience <em>that doesn\u2019t belong to us </em>is that there is no fiction. Someone like me only permits herself to write from the perspective of a straight white female born in North Carolina, closing on sixty, able-bodied but with bad knees, skint for years but finally able to buy the odd new shirt. All that\u2019s left is memoir.</p> <p>And here\u2019s the bugbear, here\u2019s where we really can\u2019t win. At the same time that we\u2019re to write about only the few toys that landed in our playpen, we\u2019re also upbraided for failing to portray in our fiction a population that is sufficiently various. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m hoping that crime writers, for example, don\u2019t all have personal experience of committing murder.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My most recent novel The Mandibles<em> </em>was taken to task by one reviewer for addressing an America that is \u201cstraight and white\u201d. It happens that this is a multigenerational family saga \u2013 about a white family. I wasn\u2019t instinctively inclined to insert a transvestite or bisexual, with issues that might distract from my central subject matter of apocalyptic economics. Yet the implication of this criticism is that we novelists need to plug in representatives of a variety of groups in our cast of characters, as if filling out the entering class of freshmen at a university with strict diversity requirements.</p> <p>You do indeed see just this brand of tokenism in television. There was a point in the latter 1990s at which suddenly every sitcom and drama in sight had to have a gay or lesbian character or couple. That was good news as a voucher of the success of the gay rights movement, but it still grew a bit tiresome: <em>look at us, our show is so hip, one of the characters is homosexual! </em></p> <p>We\u2019re now going through the same fashionable exercise in relation to the transgender characters in series like Transparent and Orange is the New Black.</p> <p>Fine. But I still would like to reserve the right as a novelist to use only the characters that pertain to my story.</p> <p>Besides: which is it to be? We have to tend our own gardens, and only write about ourselves or people just like us because we mustn\u2019t pilfer others\u2019 experience, <em>or </em>we have to people our cast like an <em>I\u2019d like to teach the world to sing </em>Coca-Cola advert?</p> <p>For it can be dangerous these days to go the diversity route. Especially since there seems to be a consensus on the notion that San Francisco reviewer put forward that \u201cspecial care should be taken with a story that\u2019s not implicitly yours to tell.\u201d</p> <p>In The Mandibles, I have one secondary character, Luella, who\u2019s black. She\u2019s married to a more central character, Douglas, the Mandible family\u2019s 97-year-old patriarch. I reasoned that Douglas, a liberal New Yorker, would credibly have left his wife for a beautiful, stately African American because arm candy of color would reflect well on him in his circle, and keep his progressive kids\u2019 objections to a minimum. But in the end the joke is on Douglas, because Luella suffers from early onset dementia, while his ex-wife, staunchly of sound mind, ends up running a charity for dementia research. As the novel reaches its climax and the family is reduced to the street, they\u2019re obliged to put the addled, disoriented Luella on a leash, to keep her from wandering off.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I confess that this climate of scrutiny has got under my skin.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Behold, the reviewer in the Washington Post, who groundlessly accused this book of being \u201cracist\u201d because it doesn\u2019t toe a strict Democratic Party line in its political outlook, described the scene thus: \u201cThe Mandibles are white. Luella, the single African American in the family, arrives in Brooklyn incontinent and demented. She needs to be physically restrained. As their fortunes become ever more dire and the family assembles for a perilous trek through the streets of lawless New York, she\u2019s held at the end of a leash. If The Mandibles is ever made into a film, my suggestion is that this image not be employed for the movie poster.\u201d </p> <p>Your author, by implication, yearns to bring back slavery.</p> <p>Thus in the world of identity politics, fiction writers better be careful. If we do choose to import representatives of protected groups, special rules apply. If a character happens to be black, they have to be treated with kid gloves, and never be placed in scenes that, taken out of context, might seem disrespectful. But that\u2019s no way to write. The burden is too great, the self-examination paralysing. The natural result of that kind of criticism in the Post<em> </em>is that next time I don\u2019t use <em>any </em>black characters, lest they do or say anything that is short of perfectly admirable and lovely.</p> <p>In fact, I\u2019m reminded of a letter I received in relation to my seventh novel from an Armenian-American who objected \u2013 why did I have to make the narrator of We Need to Talk About Kevin<em> </em>Armenian? He didn\u2019t like my narrator, and felt that her ethnicity disparaged his community. I took pains to explain that I knew something about Armenian heritage, because my best friend in the States was Armenian, and I also thought there was something dark and aggrieved in the culture of the Armenian diaspora that was atmospherically germane to that book. Besides, I despaired, everyone in the US has an ethnic background of some sort, and she had to be something!</p> <p>Especially for writers from traditionally privileged demographics, the message seems to be that it\u2019s a whole lot safer just to make all your characters from that same demographic, so you can be as hard on them as you care to be, and do with them what you like. Availing yourself of a diverse cast, you are not free; you have inadvertently invited a host of regulations upon your head, as if just having joined the EU. Use different races, ethnicities, and minority gender identities, and you are being watched.</p> <p>I confess that this climate of scrutiny has got under my skin. When I was first starting out as a novelist, I didn\u2019t hesitate to write black characters, for example, or to avail myself of black dialects, for which, having grown up in the American South, I had a pretty good ear. I am now much more anxious about depicting characters of different races, and accents make me nervous. </p> <p>In describing a second-generation Mexican American who\u2019s married to one of my main characters in The Mandibles, I took care to write his dialogue in standard American English, to specify that he spoke without an accent, and to explain that he only dropped Spanish expressions tongue-in-cheek. I would certainly think twice \u2013 more than twice \u2013 about ever writing a whole novel, or even a goodly chunk of one, from the perspective of a character whose race is different from my own \u2013 because I may sell myself as an iconoclast, but I\u2019m as anxious as the next person about attracting vitriol. But I think that\u2019s a loss. I think that indicates a contraction of my fictional universe that is not good for the books, and not good for my soul.</p> <p>Writing under the pseudonym Edward Schlosser on Vox, the author of the essay \u201cI\u2019m a Liberal Professor, and My Liberal Students Scare Me\u201d describes higher education\u2019s \u201ccurrent climate of fear\u201d and its \u201cheavily policed discourse of semantic sensitivity\u201d \u2013 and I am concerned that this touchy ethos, in which offendedness is used as a weapon, has spread far beyond academia, in part thanks to social media. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The left\u2019s embrace of gotcha hypersensitivity inevitably invites backlash.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Why, it\u2019s largely in order to keep from losing my fictional mojo that I stay off Facebook and Twitter, which could surely install an instinctive self-censorship out of fear of attack. Ten years ago, I gave the opening address of this same festival, in which I maintained that fiction writers have a vested interest in protecting everyone\u2019s <em>right </em>to offend others \u2013 because if hurting someone else\u2019s feelings even inadvertently is sufficient justification for muzzling, there will always be someone out there who is miffed by what you say, and freedom of speech is dead. With the rise of identity politics, which privileges a subjective sense of injury as actionable basis for prosecution, that is a battle that in the decade since I last spoke in Brisbane we\u2019ve been losing.</p> <p>Worse: the left\u2019s embrace of <em>gotcha </em>hypersensitivity inevitably invites backlash. Donald Trump appeals to people who have had it up to their eyeballs with being told what they can and cannot say. Pushing back against a mainstream culture of speak-no-evil suppression, they lash out in defiance, and then what they say is pretty appalling.</p> <p>Regarding identity politics, what\u2019s especially saddened me in my recent career is a trend toward rejecting the advocacy of anyone who does not belong to the group. In 2013, I published Big Brother, a novel that grew out of my loss of my own older brother, who in 2009 died from the complications of morbid obesity. I was moved to write the book not only from grief, but also sympathy: in the years before his death, as my brother grew heavier, I saw how dreadfully other people treated him \u2013 how he would be seated off in a corner of a restaurant, how the staff would roll their eyes at each other after he\u2019d ordered, though he hadn\u2019t requested more food than anyone else. </p> <p>I was wildly impatient with the way we assess people\u2019s characters these days in accordance with their weight, and tried to get on the page my dismay at how much energy people waste on this matter, sometimes anguishing for years over a few excess pounds. Both author and book were on the side of the angels, or so you would think.</p> <p>But in my events to promote Big Brother, I started to notice a pattern. Most of the people buying the book in the signing queue were thin. Especially in the US, fat is now one of those issues where you either have to be <em>one of us</em>, or you\u2019re the enemy. I verified this when I had a long email correspondence with a \u201cHealthy at Any Size\u201d activist, who was incensed by the novel, which she hadn\u2019t even read. Which she refused to read. No amount of explaining that the novel was on her side, that it was a book that was terribly pained by the way heavy people are treated and how unfairly they are judged, could overcome the scrawny author\u2019s photo on the flap.</p> <p>She and her colleagues in the fat rights movement did not want my advocacy. I could not <em>weigh in </em>on this material because I did not belong to the club. I found this an artistic, political, and even commercial disappointment \u2013 because in the US and the UK, if only skinny-minnies will buy your book, you\u2019ve evaporated the pool of prospective consumers to a puddle.</p> <p>I worry that the clamorous world of identity politics is also undermining the very causes its activists claim to back. As a fiction writer, yeah, I do sometimes deem my narrator an Armenian. But that\u2019s only by way of a start. Merely being Armenian is not to have a character as I understand the word. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We should be seeking to push beyond the constraining categories into which we have been arbitrarily dropped by birth.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Membership of a larger group is not an identity. Being Asian is not an identity. Being gay is not an identity. Being deaf, blind, or wheelchair-bound is not an identity, nor is being economically deprived. I reviewed a novel recently that I had regretfully to give a thumbs-down, though it was terribly well intended; its heart was in the right place. But in relating the Chinese immigrant experience in America, the author put forward characters that were mostly Chinese. That is, that\u2019s sort of all they were: Chinese. Which isn\u2019t enough.</p> <p>I made this same point in relation to gender in Melbourne last week: both as writers and as people, we should be seeking to push beyond the constraining categories into which we have been arbitrarily dropped by birth. If we embrace narrow group-based identities too fiercely, we cling to the very cages in which others would seek to trap us. We pigeonhole ourselves. We limit our own notion of who we are, and in presenting ourselves as one of a membership, a representative of our <em>type</em>, an ambassador of an amalgam, we ask not to be seen.</p> <p>The reading and writing of fiction is obviously driven in part by a desire to look inward, to be self-examining, reflective. But the form is also born of a desperation to break free of the claustrophobia of our own experience. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/24/white-woman-black-hairstyle-cultural-appropriation\">Why the fuss over a white woman having a black hairstyle? | Sede Alonge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The spirit of good fiction is one of exploration, generosity, curiosity, audacity, and compassion.

My only excuse is that I do it well.\u201d</p> <p>Which brings us to my final point. We do not all do it well. So it\u2019s more than possible that we write from the perspective of a one-legged lesbian from Afghanistan and fall flat on our arses. We don\u2019t get the dialogue right, and for insertions of expressions in Pashto we depend on Google Translate.</p> <p>Halfway through the novel, suddenly the protagonist has lost the right leg instead of the left one.

But maybe rather than having our heads taken off, we should get a few points for trying. After all, most fiction sucks. Most writing sucks. Most things that people make of any sort suck.

  "<p>Staunch advocates of grammar schools have trouble explaining why providing a lottery ticket to a lucky few is a necessary condition for increasing social mobility. It is possible for poor children to shatter glass ceilings after receiving a comprehensive education. Take inner London, where I grew up, which has no grammar schools. Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies this week argues that London schools are a better example of how to improve social mobility than grammar schools. The IFS finds that children from deprived backgrounds are <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8469\" title=\"\">much less likely</a> to attend existing grammar schools than better-off children are, even high-achieving poor pupils, while those who don\u2019t pass the 11-plus do much worse than in a comprehensive system. But in inner London, about half the pupils eligible for free school meals achieve five or more GCSEs at A* to C, double the proportion outside London. It has been able to both \u201cimprove results amongst the brightest pupils and reduce inequality\u201d, the IFS concludes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/12/theresa-may-grammar-schools-maidenhead\">Dear Theresa May, here\u2019s what grammar schools did to my family | John O\u2019Farrell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>St Bonaventure\u2019s comprehensive school in Newham, east London, is in one of the most deprived parts of England. When I went there, the vast majority of the intake were black and minority ethnic (BME), most immigrants or the children of immigrants. Under excellent leadership, brilliant teaching and stretching extracurricular activities, such as competitive debating, the school transformed the lives of a generation of young people. One of my schoolmates has just become a senior lawyer at one of the best law firms in the world. Another has just announced another successful year as a graphic design entrepreneur. A third is now progressing rapidly after joining his company as an apprentice. I would not have achieved at school if it hadn\u2019t been for the influence of able peers acting as role models for me and the entire school. For any young black boy growing up in a poor community (where role models are not in plentiful supply) it would be dangerous to understate that particular benefit of comprehensive education. Grammar schools would cream off many such role models.</p> <p>Forcing new grammars to admit a minimum number of disadvantaged students is not the answer, either. No quota system could guarantee that disadvantaged students would thrive in that environment and would probably have to lower entry requirements in order to ensure the requisite number of poorer pupils. And apart from those who sneak in via a quota, the unlucky many will get left behind with devastating consequences for existing good schools.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/sep/12/the-myth-of-grammar-schools-and-social-mobility\">The myth of grammar schools and social mobility</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Fair Education Alliance believes that every child should have access to a world class education, irrespective of their socio-economic background.

  "<p>Water is essential for life, whether to irrigate crops, to manufacture goods, or for drinking, washing and cleaning.

Lack of awareness was suggested as a likely cause. </p> <p>\u201cIn places where farmers have been hit by drought to the point that it\u2019s impacted their livelihoods, water has become a valued resource,\u201d said Paul Reig, senior associate of the Water Programme and Business Centre at the World Resources Institute. \u201cIt is places that haven\u2019t suffered this kind of impact that lack awareness.\u201d</p> <p>Reig has been working with Valuing Nature, a sustainability consultancy, to understand the value of water in terms of the cost of delivering it in socially, environmentally and economically beneficial ways. \u201cWe think that by understanding the total cost, it could inform the level of investment needed to reach those conditions, as well as the largest impacts that are impeding their achievement,\u201d he said.</p> <h2>Thirsty agriculture</h2> <p>The panel agreed that the agriculture sector has a long way to go before it adequately values water. \u201cAgriculture is the largest consumer and the largest polluter of water,\u201d said Reig. \u201cDespite this, it\u2019s difficult to ask farmers to pay for water when they struggle to make a living.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In many cases, there is a cultural issue around making profit from water</p> <footer> <cite>Anton Earle</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>John Vidal, the Guardian\u2019s Environment editor who chaired the debate, asked whether farmers need to think differently about how they grow and irrigate crops, if they are unwilling or unable to pay for water. </p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s already happening,\u201d said Anton Earle, director of SIWI\u2019s African Regional Centre. The government of Botswana is looking at ways to introduce a water charge for farmers and the farmers SIWI speaks to there say they are already using efficient techniques for irrigation to reduce the cost of powering pumps, he said. </p> <h2>Speaking companies\u2019 language</h2> <p>It is not only in agriculture, however, where operations and processes need to be more water efficient. </p> <p>SIWI has been working with Swedish textile companies to encourage their production plants in countries such as Bangladesh, China and Ethiopia to place greater value on water. \u201cWe talk to these factories and say: \u2018You\u2019re using and polluting many of the water resources in the local area \u2013 you should change your practices\u2019, but factory owners would rather sell to a business that is less pushy,\u201d said Earle. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cc9b74df904bc070f6b911b701087f788e072c93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc9b74df904bc070f6b911b701087f788e072c93/769_125_3231_1939/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abu Talib unloads leather hides from a vat of chemicals at a tannery in Dhaka\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abu Talib unloads leather hides from a vat of chemicals at a tannery in the Hazaribagh neighbourhood of Dhaka, Bangladesh.

We told them we could introduce processes that would reduce those costs,\u201d said Earle. \u201cSo instead of dyeing fabric three or four times and releasing the water, they do it once, capture the chemicals and reuse them. Improving water use is a side effect but the entry point had to be something that the corporates could really relate to.\u201d<br></p> <p>But individual corporate action does not necessarily mean water is being better valued overall. Andr\u00e9 Fourie, head of water security and environmental value at SABMiller, described the company\u2019s work with barley farmers in India, where he says agriculture accounts for 80% of water consumption. \u201cBy having better irrigation \u2013 drip irrigation [where water is directed at the plant\u2019s root], for example \u2013 they save water. But we\u2019ve also seen that the water they save is used by someone else, so we haven\u2019t actually solved the problem.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most effective ways for companies to determine the value of water, says Fourie, is to develop a better understanding of what it costs throughout different parts of the business. \u201cBy having one price [for water] in our thinking it makes our decisions quite blunt. Take a brewery: the water that comes into it has one price, but if the brewery treats it the water is worth more.\u201d </p> <h2>Should we pay more for water?</h2> <p>One of the key challenges in securing a long-term supply of water is finding sustainable streams of finance and working out who should bear the cost. </p> <p>\u201cIn many cases, there is a cultural issue around making profit from water, even in countries where the private sector has played a strong role in different parts of the economy,\u201d said Earle. </p> <p>When it was suggested to the National Treasury of South Africa that the country\u2019s wastewater treatment could be handled by the private sector on the condition that the business could sell off the treated water, the idea, said Earle, was not met with open arms. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/18/africa-drought-untapped-groundwater-aquifers-water-stress-ngo-partnership-ethiopia\">Africa droughts prompt calls to start pumping untapped groundwater</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In some areas, however, many of the poorest people have to buy water from vendors, tankers and other informal providers, and spend as much as 10 times more than someone who has a reliable connection in the home.

  "<p>The last 12 months in Beirut have seen the reopening of the historic Sursock Museum and the inauguration of A\u00efshti, a cutting-edge modern art foundation, while from 15-18 September the <a href=\"http://www.beirut-art-fair.com/\">Beirut Art Fair</a> will showcase 40 galleries from 18 countries.

But if Beit Beirut aims to come to terms with the past, dynamic locals have their eyes set on future projects, and despite uncertainty in the surrounding region, the Lebanese capital has energy and enthusiasm in abundance.

We live in a democracy, and if the navy wants to make P\u00e5gan uninhabitable and turn Tinian into a living hell for its residents, then it has to explain why before it starts moving thousands of marines to Guam.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not saying that the marines shouldn\u2019t fulfill their national security mission \u2013 it\u2019s the why and where that we\u2019re concerned about.\u201d</p> <p>P\u00e5gan\u2019s location is both a blessing and a curse. On Green Beach, known by local people as I Bandera, stands a stone memorial to fallen soldiers from a Japanese garrison that was based here while imperial Japan built its east Asian empire. Tinian, a Japanese base until it was captured by the US in 1944, played a central role in the Pacific conflict as the departure point for the US B-29 superfortresses that dropped nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"631a959cfe3cf4129f8d3644048bcf086abcde91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/631a959cfe3cf4129f8d3644048bcf086abcde91/0_0_1667_1250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"I Bandera (AKA Green Beach), on the western coast of P\u00e5gan Island.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">I Bandera (AKA Green Beach), on the western coast of P\u00e5gan Island.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Lin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Henkin believes that forcing the Pentagon into full disclosure about its plans and their impact will take the discussion on P\u00e5gan\u2019s fate into the court of public opinion. \u201cWhen that happens, we are confident that the US public will oppose the move,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cPeople feel deep connections to P\u00e5gan, and to deprive them of the opportunity to return to this beautiful place is wrong.

  "<p>The Apple iPhone was thought to be safe from cyber attack. Not any more. First to reveal its vulnerabilities was the FBI, which in April paid $1.3m to an unknown source for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/27/fbi-apple-iphone-secret-hack-san-bernardino\">hacking tool</a> to break into an iPhone. Then in August, the US tech giant has found itself hit by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/25/apple-ios-update-arab-activists-iphone-spyware\">text message scam</a> believed to have originated from a private Israeli security company. <br></p> <p>These are just the security breaches we know about. Such is the avalanche of new cyber threats facing big brands like Apple that they are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/22/bounty-hunters-hacking-legally-money-security-apple-pentagon\">paying hackers millions of dollars</a> to search for chinks in their digital armour. Yet even these huge sums are a pittance compared with the growing global industry for formal cyber security services, <a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3135617\" rel=\"nofollow\">valued at $75bn</a> per year. </p> <p>Keeping on top of cyber crime threats has jumped to the top of boardroom agendas at most companies over the past year and a half, says <a href=\"https://www.techuk.org/about/our-staff/programmes/item/3115-talal-rajab\" rel=\"nofollow\">Talal Rajab</a>, head of cyber and national security programmes at techUK.</p> <p>The reasons are not hard to guess. Cyber attacks are now a virtual constant for large companies. US security firm Symantec <a href=\"https://www.symantec.com/security-center/threat-report\" rel=\"nofollow\">estimates</a> more than half a billion personal records were lost or stolen last year. Nor do cyber crooks need to be super-geeks any more; off-the-shelf criminal software is now widely available on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/darknet\">dark web</a>, according to Rajab. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/oct/24/cyber-attacks-could-be-bigger-threat-to-our-banking-system-than-bad-debts\">Cyber attacks could be bigger threat to our banking system than bad debts</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Media attention and the consequent brand damage that security breaches cause also push companies to act. Along with Apple, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/23/talktalk-criticised-for-poor-security-and-handling-of-hack-attack\">TalkTalk,</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jan/29/hsbc-online-banking-cyber-attack\">HSBC</a> and extramarital online hook-up service <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/20/ashley-madison-hack-your-questions-answered\">Ashley Madison</a> are among other recent high-profile victims of hacker attacks. A study by cyber security firm FireEye found more than <a href=\"https://www.fireeye.com/company/press-releases/2016/new-fireeye-research-reveals-the-impact-of-high-profile-security.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">half (54%) of US consumers</a> felt more negatively towards companies that had suffered data breaches.</p> <p>Regulators are beginning to crack the whip. In May the EU published a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/feb/08/huge-rise-hack-attacks-cyber-criminals-target-small-businesses\">reform of data protection rules</a> that could see companies fined up to \u20ac20m, or 4% of global turnover, if they are found guilty of data negligence. \u201cThat\u2019s a real tangible punishment for companies if they come across an attack and they aren\u2019t adequately protected,\u201d says Rajab.</p> <p>Corporate executives may be increasingly aware that they need to act on cyber security, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they know what to do. Most don\u2019t, says Andrew Rogoyski, UK head of cyber security at IT services firm CGI. </p> <p>\u201cPeople have been working in general security for many years, but the really high demand for cyber security has only taken off in the last five years, which doesn\u2019t really give the education and jobs system time to react,\u201d he states. </p> <p>The skills shortage is exacerbated by the maverick character of many cyber experts and the lack of career progression for them in large corporations. \u201cTypically, they are called in to do a job, but then there\u2019s nowhere for them to go,\u201d says Rogoyski. As a consequence, many end up leaving in-house roles in preference for external advisory firms. </p> <p>CGI has close to 200 specialists working solely on cyber advisory work, making it one of the largest such teams in the UK. The cyber services industry is a boom market, populated by giant IT services companies, global defence firms and software manufacturers right through to small, highly specialist start-ups. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/27/fbi-apple-iphone-secret-hack-san-bernardino\">FBI confirms it won't tell Apple how it hacked San Bernardino shooter's iPhone</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked how much companies typically spend on cyber protection, Rogoyski says it differs from company to company depending on their size and vulnerability. Banks, utilities and retailers with a strong online presence tend to prioritise the issue most, he says. As a general rule of thumb, 5% of a company\u2019s IT spend goes on IT security. \u201cIn truth, you only really know when you\u2019ve spent too little,\u201d he adds. </p> <p>Norway-based certification firm DNV GL is one of those looking to increase its foothold in the market. The company, which employs about 40 cyber specialists across its international operations, has just opened a new office in Peterborough, offering product testing and advisory services. </p> <p>The company hopes to exploit the need by business to show that it is taking cyber security seriously by offering independent verification of companies\u2019 data protection practices, especially those in critical infrastructure sectors such as energy or oil and gas. Despite its youth, the cyber security field is already awash with industry standards, says DNV GL\u2019s head of operational excellence, Matthew Freeman. </p> <p>One of the challenges that large companies will face is integrating an array of new technologies with older, more bespoke systems. The wider a company\u2019s net, the bigger the possible holes. <br></p> <p>As long as there are cyber criminals, even the most accredited company can\u2019t be complacent. Not only will a company\u2019s internal systems be evolving continuously, so too will the potential threats, says Freeman: \u201cWhat you absolutely can\u2019t do is do an assessment now and assume that it will remain current without checking it.\u201d<br></p>",

  "<p>A Donald Trump campaign rally was marred by violence yet again on Monday as the Republican nominee attacked Hillary Clinton for <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables-donald-trump\">calling his supporters \u201cdeplorables\u201d</a>.</p> <p>A Trump supporter apparently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ABCPolitics/status/775467362195738624\">punched a protester</a> at a rally held at the US Cellular Center in Asheville, North Carolina. The scuffle was the first violent incident at a Trump rally in months. Although throughout the primary season, Trump campaign events had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/11/donald-trump-campaign-claims-violence-rallies\">marked by violence</a> by both Trump supporters and protesters, culminating in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/12/donald-trump-rally-called-off-in-chicago-amid-protests-violence-and-chaos\">near riots in Chicago</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/02/donald-trump-protests-san-jose-rally-violence-sanders-clinton\">San Jose</a>, California, they had been comparatively peaceful in recent months. Prior to being punched, the protester reportedly directed an obscene gesture in Trump\u2019s direction.</p> <p>The incident happened as Trump attempted to attack Clinton for her statement that half of his supporters belong in \u201ca basket of deplorables\u201d.

The Republican nominee went on to repeat of Clinton: \u201cShe talks about people like they are objects, not human beings.\u201d</p> <p>The attacks come as Clinton has been forced off the campaign trail for health reasons. The Democratic nominee <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/12/hillary-clinton-pneumonia-campaign-regret-911-trump\">was forced to cancel</a> a campaign trip to California after being filmed losing her footing while abruptly leaving a ceremony to commemorate the 9/11 attacks on Sunday. Eventually, after initially claiming that she was \u201coverheated\u201d, the Clinton campaign admitted that the candidate had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday. </p> <p>In a phone interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Monday night, Clinton said she was feeling better and insisted that she did not faint on Sunday. The Democratic nominee said \u201cwe know the least about Donald Trump than any candidate in recent American history\u201d and that he should be held to \u201cthe same standard\u201d as any other candidate. </p> <p>She noted the only medical information released by Trump was a letter addressed \u201cto whom my concern\u201d that proclaimed, if elected, Trump would be \u201cthe healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\u201d. Clinton said \u201cthat\u2019s not even serious\u201d and went on to hammer Trump for refusing to release his tax returns.</p> <p>Trump, who has long made jibes about Clinton\u2019s \u201cstamina\u201d, did not address his rival\u2019s illness on Monday night. Earlier in the day he had said he hoped she got better soon but added that her illness was \u201can issue\u201d. </p> <p>Instead, he continued his offensive against his opponent by claiming that she was running a pessimistic campaign of scare tactics. \u201cOur vision of hope stands in stark contrast to my opponent\u2019s campaign of hate,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHillary Clinton has been running a hate-filled and negative campaign, with no policy, no solutions and no ideas. By contrast, I\u2019ve been going around the country offering very detailed plans for reform and change.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s statement was curious considering that his campaign has long focused on concerns about immigration and crime. He announced his campaign by saying Mexico was deliberately sending rapists to United States, accepted the Republican nomination by saying Americans were living in a \u201cmore dangerous environment than I have ever seen or anyone has ever seen\u201d, and has repeatedly suggested that if Clinton is elected, we will \u201cno longer have a country\u201d. Trump amplified this rhetoric on Monday by telling the crowd: \u201cYou can go to Afghanistan, you can go to war-torn countries and you will find that it is safer than some of our inner cities.\u201d</p> <p>Further, on most issues, Trump has been relatively light on policy. <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/4b32e354f90741f5bbe01cc605b73d0c/trumps-deportation-waffle-highlights-campaign-weaknesses\">According to an Associated Press report</a> in late August, the Republican nominee has only posted seven policy proposals totaling 9,000 words on his website. In contrast, Clinton had released 112,735 words of proposals in 65 different issue fact sheets at the time. </p> <p>The rally took place in North Carolina, a state won by Mitt Romney in 2012 where Clinton and Trump are <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nc/north_carolina_trump_vs_clinton-5538.html\">neck and neck in polls.</a> The increasingly diverse Tarheel State is considered Clinton\u2019s best opportunity to turn a red state blue. In contrast, Trump is hoping to play the offensive in blue-collar industrial states in the midwest. </p>"
