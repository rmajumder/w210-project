When asked: \u2018What do you think is the biggest threat to job security in Australia?\u2019 in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/progressives-can-attract-hanson-supporters-but-not-by-insulting-them\">an Essential poll last month</a>, 18% of those surveyed said it was the impact of technological change, while 31% said there was more to fear from free-trade deals that allow foreign workers into the labour market.</p> <p>Combined, it means almost half<em> </em>of Australians fear technology or foreigners are a threat to their jobs. This leads to some fundamental questions about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/series/fourth-industrial-revolution\">the impact the fourth industrial revolution</a> is going to have on migration and refugees. If jobs now routinely done by migrants (such as cleaning, fast food and other low-skilled, low-paid work) are increasingly automated, does it mean countries take fewer migrants? Does it mean they will only want well-educated migrants?<em> </em>And does this have implications for how refugees are valued by the wider community?<em> </em></p> <p>Pamela Curr, of the Asylum Seekers Resource Centre, says refugees have often filled jobs in rural areas. \u201cMost particularly during the mining boom, young Australian men would much rather go to the mines where they could earn $100,000 a year plus, than go out and work in the agricultural field. So for instance, in meat processing, chicken processing and a lot of the heavy agricultural work in isolated locations, they were desperate for workers,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Curr says Hazaras, who mainly come from central Afghanistan and have a background in agriculture, regularly filled regional jobs, often in very isolated locations, after coming out of immigration detention in Australia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/14/why-teaching-graduates-to-be-flexible-is-more-important-than-worrying-about-jobs-that-dont-yet-exist\">Why teaching graduates to be flexible is more important than worrying about jobs that don't yet exist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But those isolated locations have just become a little less isolated. As of 29 September, farmers are allowed to fly 25kg drones over their property without an unmanned aircraft operator\u2019s certificate. \u201cThat\u2019s a drone that can take a pretty good payload, could carry a fair bit of chemical around for crop-spraying, [and] could easily carry cameras and other gear to do visual inspections,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-01/new-drone-regulations-to-benefit-farmers/7293392\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peter Gibson of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority</a>. </p> <p>Not every job taken over by drones will be one previously done by a migrant, of course, and Sydney-based migration agent John McQuaid says Australia is <a href=\"http://migrationblog.border.gov.au/2016/09/12/new-entrepreneur-visa-and-changes-to-the-points-test/\" rel=\"nofollow\">looking at technology and innovation as a positive</a>. \u201cThe government looks at what ideas can be turned into employment opportunities for Australians.

Not all of this can be controlled by government. If people want to migrate, they figure out ways to migrate. They\u2019ll work through the channels that exist, and if they can\u2019t then they\u2019ll work through illegal channels to migrate.\u201d</p> <p>Jiyoung Song, director of migration and border policy at the Lowy Institute, says economic migrants normally fill gaps in the labour market, rather than replace people. \u201cThere will still be the need of skilled migrants who will work across different national boundaries. The future of work is already having an impact on our lives.\u201d She says advances in technology means national borders are increasingly no barrier to jobs \u2013 for instance, there is no reason a computer coder in India can\u2019t do work for companies in Australia, the US or anywhere.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/26/with-robots-is-a-life-without-work-one-wed-want-to-live\">With robots, is a life without work one we'd want to live?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While well-educated migrants are very much in global demand, people with fewer skills will still also be needed, Song says. \u201cThose with the wanted knowledge and skill sets are likely to have greater mobility than those without. However, countries need both skilled and low-skilled migrants to fill the jobs the locals can\u2019t do or don\u2019t want to do, in other words, either the most cutting-edge jobs or the most unwanted jobs in domestic markets.\u201d</p> <p>She says advances in technology are unlikely to affect how refugees are valued. \u201cRefugees are accepted for humanitarian grounds, not economic demand ... However, in recent years <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/refugee-crisis-rests-on-obama-summit-un-talks-fail\">and at the UN summit [in September]</a>, legal and complementary pathways were suggested as alternative ways to protect the rights of refugees and asylum seekers.</p> <p>\u201cWhat this means is that governments are considering the option to offer various other ways to settle temporarily and permanently for refugees and asylum seekers who have skills they want. This is a progressive solution not many governments are buying into at the moment, but it is the only viable way to solve the current refugee crisis,\u201d said Song.</p> <p>Matching refugees\u2019 skills to jobs in their new country benefits both the individual and the host nation. In Berlin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/18/syrian-refugees-jobs-berlin-technology-migranthire\">Syrian refugee and developer Hussein Shaker</a>, who struggled to find work using his IT skills due to his lack of German, co-founded MigrantHire. He soon found that tech companies in the city were so desperate for developers they didn\u2019t care whether employees could speak German. It was their knowledge of ones and zeroes that mattered most.</p> <p>Such innovation is happening locally too, with the Red Cross partnering with tech communities in Sydney and Melbourne for <a href=\"http://www.redcross.org.au/red-cross-partners-with-tech-community-for-refugee-hackathon.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u201cTechfugees hackathons\u201d</a> to find new ways that can help refugee families settle into Australian life. <a href=\"https://techfugees.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Techfugees</a> looks to address some of the issues faced by refugees and asylum seekers by connecting developers, designers, entrepreneurs and startups with non-profit and community organisations.</p> <p>Vicki Mau, manager of migration support programs at Red Cross, says the ideas that have come out of Techfugees, such as an app to help connect migrants with interpreters and another to help link individuals to friends, mentors, services and employment, have been very innovative. \u201cThese are great for Red Cross and invaluable for participants, such as refugees and asylum seekers looking for work and mentors,\u201d she said.</p>",

Obrist\u2019s evolving DIY art show Do It has been going strong since 1991 and this year will visit 50 locations including New Jersey and Croatia. </p> <p>\u201cI think something that runs through this list is that the power lies in ideas circulating rather than objects,\u201d said Basciano. \u201cHans Ulrich\u2019s ideas pass through the art world as well as through instagram and social media. He\u2019s quoted everywhere, he knows everyone and he has this vast network \u2013 his thoughts are going places that one single artist\u2019s work could never hope to end up.\u201d </p> <p>Also in the Top 10 is Polish curator Adam Szymczyk, who will be the artistic director of Documenta in 2017, the influential contemporary art show in Kassel, Germany, that only happens once every five years. </p> <p>Outgoing director of the Tate, Nicholas Serota, is tied at fifth place this year with Frances Morris who became director of the Tate Modern in January.</p> <p>As well as gallerists and directors, the Power 100 list includes several influential artists. An acclaimed Berlin-based video artist, Hito Steyerl, was the highest-ranking artist in the list this year, which Basciano said was a tribute to her work, her ideas and writings on subjects such as mass media and technology.</p> <p>\u201cHer work goes from video to writing to theory, and these ideas can travel faster than objects,\u201d he said. \u201cHer ideas are quoted all over the world and her theories have had quite an intense impact on art production, so she transcends her own work in some way.\u201d</p> <p>Other artists in the Top 10 were Wolfgang Tillmans and Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei.</p> <p>The newest, and also youngest, artist on the list was the British digital and video artist Ed Atkins, at No 50. Basciano said Atkins was included this year for his \u201csheer unbiquity \u2026 Ed Atkins he\u2019s been canonised by the European and American galleries and there are so many people supporting that \u2026 in 50 years\u2019 time people will still be referring to his work. There\u2019s almost an assured longevity there.\u201d</p> <p>The American feminist cultural theorist Donna Haraway also made her debut in the Power 100, a nod to how influential her ideas around feminism, technology and the breaking down of boundaries between gender identity have become over the past year.</p> <p>Similarly, the continuing rise of art as a powerful type of social activism was reflected in the inclusion of artists such as Theaster Gates, South African artist Zanele Muholi and Rick Lowe, who works with the social fabric of places in his art.</p> <p>Basciano said that in post-Brexit Britain, the international spread and influence of the figures in the Power 100 were proof of how resilient the art world still was in defying national borders and would continue to be so in the future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8feefa153717575081c66e0b70f37f6b88be5551\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8feefa153717575081c66e0b70f37f6b88be5551/0_73_2195_1316/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-Brexit posters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wolfgang Tillmans and Between Bridges: Anti-Brexit posters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wolfgang Tillmans/Between Bridges</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHans Ulrich personifies that globalist outlook but so does Wolfgang Tillmans, whose work \u2013 not just to mention his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/apr/26/anti-brexit-posters-wolfgang-tillmans-eu-referendum\">anti-Brexit posters</a> \u2013 very much is a documentation of that liberal internationalism,\u201d he said. \u201cContemporary art is, in its very DNA, internationalist and that\u2019s not going to change.\u201d </p> <h2>The 2016 Power100 Top 10</h2> <ol> <li>Hans Ulrich Obrist </li> <li> Adam Szymczyk</li> <li> Iwan &amp; Manuela Wirth</li> <li> David Zwirner </li> <li> Nicholas Serota &amp; Frances Morris </li> <li> Larry Gagosian </li> <li> Hito Steyerl </li> <li> Adam D.

Some of them made up to $15,000 per year from their handiwork. One of them used the money to take her husband on two cruises per year. Started with the help of some grants, including $10,000 from the Uniting Church, that business foundered for a number of reasons, including the fact that the bag-making was too labour intensive for realistic pricing (at $80 each).</p> <p>It was also before the rise of the online craft marketplace Etsy or Facebook, which would have made selling the bags much easier than having to attract people to a very basic website.</p> <p>\u201cI was pretty cynical and pretty burnt-out for a while from it all,\u201d Jockel says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if people are making it work better now but it has become more of a trendy thing and you have things like the <a href=\"https://thankyou.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thank You group</a> [aid through sales of consumer goods] and <a href=\"https://au.whogivesacrap.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Who Gives a Crap</a> [fundraising through toilet paper sales] and all of these other great companies that are really clever and are doing really well.\u201d</p> <p>Even though Biddy Bags closed, it was a launchpad for Jockel to become a social media entrepreneur: cofounding a social media agency, Good Funny Smart.</p> <p>Motherhood, however, puts her at a disadvantage when it comes to taking up opportunities. She now has three children, aged eight, six and two. \u201cI can\u2019t just show up for things,\u201d she says.

  "<p>Sir Philip Green is clearly desperate to keep his gong. The Topshop tycoon would not be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/oct/18/sir-philip-green-is-sad-and-very-very-sorry-to-bhs-workers-video\">telling ITV viewers</a> about his \u201chorrible, horrible, horrible\u201d summer, or recounting his heart trouble, if the knighthood didn\u2019t matter. We assumed as much, which is why the interview was mostly interesting for what Green, on the eve of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/18/sir-philip-green-criticises-mps-report-bhs-collapse\">parliamentary debate about BHS</a> and whether or not he should lose his knighthood, did not say about the mess at BHS.</p> <p>First, he did not indicate clearly when he thinks agreement will be reached with the Pensions Regulator. Instead he said: \u201cI am hopeful that we have some light in the tunnel to a solution,\u201d which has been his vague line for many months. The regulator\u2019s account was blunter: \u201cWe are yet to receive a comprehensive and credible written proposal and have made clear what we require.\u201d</p> <p>Second, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/philip-green\">Green</a> did not say if BHS pensioners will receive the pensions they expected. He said he wants to get to a position where the Pensions Protection Fund (PPF), the industry-wide rescue scheme, is not required. But since the PPF rules mean basic-level pensioners must suffer 10% haircuts, BHS retirees could still take a hit. If such an outcome is in Green\u2019s mind, it would be better if he was frank.</p> <p>Those MPs who have followed this saga closely may also have been annoyed by Green\u2019s insistence on quoting a figure of \u00a3600m for what his family \u201cput back\u201d into BHS after taking \u00a3300m in dividends in the early years of ownership. His \u201cput back\u201d number includes \u00a3350m of \u201cinvestment\u201d that may cover the everyday costs of running a chain of department stores. A more useful figure in this context is net investment after depreciation: it was negative in 10 out of 14 years of ownership by the Green family, the select committee\u2019s report showed, quoting BHS accounts.</p> <p>Add it all up, and one suspects Green\u2019s plea for mercy will achieve little. It is odds-on that MPs will recommend that the knighthood be annulled, assuming the speaker allows a vote.</p> <p>Yet the attempt to put pressure on the honours forfeiture committee feels as if it has come too soon. Yes, Green is an unsympathetic character, his answers can be slippery and his attempts to shift blame onto his advisers are irritating. Yes, the sale of BHS to a thrice bankrupt individual whose outfit was described as a \u201cshambles\u201d by the two select committees was legal but shocking \u2013 or, as Green now admits, a mistake. And, yes, the delay in \u201csorting\u201d the pension deficit, which is Green\u2019s declared ambition, has become tiresome. If he had acted firmly when he owned the business, the funding position might not have deteriorated so severely.</p> <p>Yet, at the end of the process with the Pensions Regulator, Green will be presented with a bill and be expected to pay. If he refuses, the knighthood should be removed \u2013 no question. But if he pays up, what are the grounds for degonging? Green, albeit after faffing around for ages, would have met the demands of a regulator that enjoys the support of parliament. It would be better if MPs set a deadline for Green to do the right thing for BHS pensioners and then returned to the question of the knighthood.</p> <h2>There\u2019s no need to kick the can any further down the runway</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"235d77c1c844542a33cbcf54da4c6ac72ae19025\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/235d77c1c844542a33cbcf54da4c6ac72ae19025/0_903_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Artist\u2019s impression of proposed Gatwick expansion by architect planner Sir Terry Farrell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Artist\u2019s impression of proposed Gatwick expansion by architect planner Sir Terry Farrell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gatwick Airport/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Change is coming, Theresa May told us many times a few weeks ago.

  "<p>David Cameron\u2019s No 10 policy chief warned him a year ago that he was \u201cexposed on Heathrow\u201d because the government did not have an answer to its impact on air quality, an internal Downing Street note has revealed.</p> <p>The memo was written by Camilla Cavendish, a former Downing Street adviser, who was scathing about the first draft of a government air quality plan from the department of the then environment secretary, Liz Truss.</p> <p>\u201cThere are three problems with Liz\u2019s clean air plan as currently written,\u201d the note from September 2015 says. \u201cFirst it is still very much a draft which quotes initiatives that are likely to be abolished \u2026 Second it both overclaims and underwhelms.</p> <p>\u201cIt says we want the cleanest air in the world but does not even begin to tackle the fundamental question of how we might help people to shift away from diesel cars. Third, it leaves us exposed on Heathrow where we don\u2019t yet have an answer on air quality.\u201d </p> <p>This week in the high court, ClientEarth, an environmental law group, has argued that the government\u2019s plan to clean up levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) fails to adhere to the law.</p> <p>Theresa May is preparing to make a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/19/theresa-may-accused-of-dither-and-delay-over-heathrow-airports-expansion\" draggable=\"true\">decision on airport expansion in the south-east</a>, with all the signs pointing to a choice of a third runway at Heathrow.

Instead they are getting dither and delay.\u201d</p> <p>Sources at No 10 rebutted the suggestion that there had been any delay to airport expansion plans, saying there was no change in the timetable and a decision on developing either Heathrow or Gatwick would be taken next week.</p> <p>Cameron put off the decision on Heathrow in early December last year, saying the government would undertake more work on the environmental impact of airport expansion. But the government published its national air quality plan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/17/illegal-air-pollution-will-blight-many-uk-cities-for-at-least-five-years\">later that month</a> with little reference to Heathrow and has not expanded on it publicly since then.</p> <p>Cavendish, who is now a Conservative peer, said on Wednesday night: \u201cNow this is in the public domain I have to say that I believe successive governments have failed the public on air quality. Too many people in Whitehall and parliament think they can play it down because it\u2019s invisible. </p> <p>\u201cBut the scientific evidence shows that air pollution, especially particulates from diesel vehicles, is a growing threat to health. I continue to believe that government policy underwhelms and overclaims, including on Heathrow where expansion will increase pollution.\u201d</p> <p>Air pollution causes 50,000 early deaths and \u00a327.5bn in costs every year, according to the government\u2019s own estimates, and was called a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/27/uk-air-pollution-public-health-emergency-crisis-diesel-cars\">public health emergency</a>\u201d by MPs in April.</p> <p>Observers said Cavendish\u2019s briefing to Cameron showed the government knew Heathrow expansion was problematic for compliance on air quality, and that the handful of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/13/electric-vehicles-could-go-first-at-traffic-lights-under-uk-clean-air-zone-plans\" draggable=\"true\">clean-air zones planned by ministers</a> were not enough to tackle pollution from diesel cars.</p> <p>Caroline Lucas, the co-leader of the Green party and MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: \u201cThis revelation confirms what many of us have been saying for months: Heathrow expansion cannot go ahead if we\u2019re serious about protecting the environment. Not only would expansion mean additional emissions from aircraft, but it\u2019s highly likely that there would be more fumes from road traffic blighting the local area too. The government has clearly buried this inconvenient memo in the hope of railroading this section through, irrespective of its legality and the impact on local people.\u201d</p> <p>Simon Birkett of the Clean Air in London campaign said: \u201cWhether it\u2019s a big or little impact, it doesn\u2019t matter if it makes it [compliance] worse. This briefing shows us what I call free-market anarchists like George Osborne \u2013 people who say the car is king, and want no regulation on anything \u2013 have a disregard for human health.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Davies commission on airport expansion said that a bigger Heathrow would mean extra traffic on Bath Road near the airport, leaving it with the highest concentrations of NO2 in the Greater London area. That \u201cwould delay compliance with the directive and hence would not be deliverable within the legal framework\u201d, the commission\u2019s final report said.</p> <p>A Heathrow source said: \u201cHeathrow accepted the conditions of the Davies commission in May this year. The airports commission were always clear there were no issues with air quality. However, if a judicial review or another legal case is brought, government has to have done its own research into everything the Davies commission has said. It\u2019s not enough to say the airports commission came to a particular conclusion. </p> <p>\u201cSo they have to look into the air quality plans themselves. However, if Theresa May approves Heathrow next week, it will have done those investigations by now. They will not go ahead with expansion, anywhere, if they had found air quality limits were going to be in breach, because it\u2019s a legal requirement.\u201d</p> <p>The airport\u2019s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/17/heathrow-third-runway-close-to-getting-government-green-light\">said this week</a> that a study by Cambridge University into air pollution had bolstered Heathrow\u2019s case.<br></p> <p>The university\u2019s Prof Rod Jones, who has been using sensors to monitor air pollution around the airport, said his research showed the air quality problem at Heathrow was due to road traffic, not planes, and that cleaner car engines being mandated by law would bring NO2 levels down below what they are now.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWe would expect \u2026 the traffic-related signature [of NO2 emissions] to drop below what it is today \u2026 even though there may be more traffic,\u201d said Jones, whose study is due to be published in about a month\u2019s time. </p> <p>A government spokesman said: \u201cThe government is firmly committed to improving the UK\u2019s air quality and cutting harmful emissions. That\u2019s why we have committed more than \u00a32bn since 2011 to increase the uptake of ultra-low-emissions vehicles, support greener transport schemes and set out a national plan to tackle pollution in our towns and cities.

  "<p>That Melanesian Pacific island economies are heavily reliant on the ocean is hardly a surprise. But <a href=\"http://ocean.panda.org.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Reviving_Melanesia's_Ocean_Economy_Full_Report-WWF-LowRes.pdf\">a new report by WWF </a>has quantified the annual economic output from the region\u2019s waters - what they term Gross Marine Product (GMP) - at $5.4 billion - a sum equivalent to the combined GDP of Fiji and the Solomon Islands. </p> <p>The Reviving Melanesia\u2019s Ocean Economy report was produced in partnership with the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and the Global Change Institute (GCI) at the University of Queensland.

Since most coastal fishing in Melanesia is subsistence based, there is the very real prospect of a nutritional shortfall that will affect millions of people. <br></p> <p> \u201cThere is no doubt the ocean has delivered the majority of food, livelihoods and economic activity for Melanesia for a very long time,\u201d says the report\u2019s lead author Ove Hoegh Guldberg of the Global Change Institute, University of Queensland. \u201cGiven some of the troubling trends in the status of the ecosystems that generate these benefits, however, the question is now: how long will these benefits last?\u201d</p> <p>The data on negative impacts is alarming.

Mangroves that provide a host of services including protection from storms, are being cleared to make way for coastal development. Rates of sea level rise are three to four times higher in Melanesia than the global average and already <a href=\"http://thecoraltriangle.com/stories/some-of-worlds-first-climate-refugees-soon-to-be-evacuated-from-island-home\">some populations are preparing to evacuate their island homes.<br></a></p> <p>By conflating ecosystem with economy, the report not only quantifies Melanesia\u2019s ocean assets (a \u2018shared wealth fund\u2019 worth half a trillion dollars based on what the authors describe as conservative estimates), but suggests those assets are being squandered. It also warns that future investments should be considered carefully. The authors single out seabed mining for example as a potentially lucrative emerging industry in the short term, but one that could threaten marine life while providing little benefit to local communities. <br></p> <p>\u201cWith this analysis, no one can be in any doubt about the importance of carefully managing the ocean assets that underpin so much of the Melanesian economy,\u201d says Marty Schmit of BCG. \u201cA prudent economic approach would see strong conservation actions rolled out across Melanesia to secure its natural assets.\u201d</p> <p>That means applying the principles of a blue economy -one that sustains the ocean\u2019s natural capital while providing long term social and economic benefits. Practical measures include establishing more marine protected areas, improving fisheries practices, slowing climate change and investing in education and gender equality.</p> <p>According to Kesaia Tabunakawai, WWF\u2019s Pacific Representative, the region\u2019s political leaders need to act urgently and comprehensively to prevent a crisis. \u201cWe have seen good commitments in the past but the objective analysis shows that we are running out of time and need action at a much greater scale and urgency if Melanesia is to have a healthy and prosperous future.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The Home Office is understood to be about to urgently speed up its operation to rescue unaccompanied migrant children stranded in Calais, with more than 100 expected to be bussed to Britain in the next four days.</p> <p>With bulldozers expected to arrive on the French site on Monday, the Home Office has come under fire from charities for not moving faster \u2013 while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/rightwing-tabloids-pour-scorn-appearance-child-refugees\">Sun and the Daily Mail made controversial claims</a> that not all of those who are arriving are children. </p> <p>A Home Office minister, Baroness Williams, confirmed that there were an estimated \u201c1,300 children in the camp\u201d and said that 39 of the several hundred estimated to be eligible to come to the UK had been brought into the country this week in the only government update on numbers accepted so far.</p> <p>In a House of Lords debate Williams insisted no date had been given by the French authorities for the destruction of the site even though the Foreign Office had an issued an advisory notice to travellers in Calais that they could expect congestion in coming days because of the French demolition. </p> <p>Williams told the House of Lords that 14 children arrived on Monday, 13 on Tuesday and 12 on Wednesday. She said those with approval under the so-called Dublin regulations will be given sanctuary first; these allow migrants under 18 to be reunited with relatives already in another country. </p> <p>\u201cWe will transfer as many as children who qualify under the Dublin regulation before the start of the clearance,\u201d said Williams, adding that about one third of the children qualified to come to the UK. </p> <p>However, one peer, Lord Roberts, said at the present rate of intervention there would be more than 1,000 children marooned when the demolition started. <br></p> <p>He said: \u201cI am sure we all welcome the 14 who were received here two or three days ago.

  "<p>Philip Hammond has sought to allay fears that the economy will be sacrificed in Brexit negotiations, with support for foreign high-skilled workers, the expectation of a favourable deal for the City and a staunch defence of the Bank of England\u2019s independence.</p> <p>The chancellor, burnishing his credentials as an opponent of a hard Brexit, was hopeful a deal was possible that allowed all European nationals to remain in the UK and for UK nationals to remain in the EU.</p> <p>He maintained the government must heed the call from voters to tighten border controls following the vote to quit the EU but restrictions would need to be relaxed to support jobs and growth.</p> <p>\u201cAs we approach the challenge of getting net migration figures down to the tens of thousands it is, in my view, essential that we look at how we do this in a way that protects our economy and protects the vital interests of our economy,\u201d he told a parliamentary committee. </p> <p>Hammond is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/18/theresa-may-given-stark-warning-about-leaving-customs-union\">understood to be battling inside cabinet</a> for a more emollient negotiating position with Brussels ahead of Theresa May invoking article 50 by March, which begins the two-year process of leaving the EU.</p> <p>Some ministers are known to favour pulling out of all EU agreements and exporting to the trading bloc under standard international rules. This stance, and a speech by the prime minister at the Conservative party conference that appeared to put migration controls before the safety of the economy, have sent the pound plunging almost 18%.</p> <p>May also appeared to question the Bank of England\u2019s low interest policy and its independence from the Treasury, which was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/18/william-hague-attacks-bank-of-england-over-ultra-low-interest-rates\">supported later by the former foreign secretary William Hague</a>, further undermining confidence in the City.</p> <p>Asked by MPs on the Treasury select committee about reports that the cabinet is split, Hammond appeared to take a swipe at his Tory rivals. \u201cThose that are undermining the effort are those that are seeking to close down that negotiating space, seeking to arrive at hard decisions that we don\u2019t need to make at this stage,\u201d he said. \u201cKeeping as many options open as possible is the key to the strongest possible negotiating hand.\u201d</p> <p>Hammond said negotiations were necessary to win the best deal for each industry.

Australia was marked as the most strident opponent of a ban treaty.</p> <p>But diplomatic cables obtained under freedom of information laws now show that Australia, despite its resolute opposition, is increasingly pessimistic about stopping ban treaty negotiations progressing.</p> <p>\u201cWe are concerned that the [open-ended working] group [on nuclear disarmament] is tracking towards recommendations supporting a nuclear weapons \u2018ban treaty\u2019 which we do not support,\u201d a cable sent to Canberra from Geneva in June this year said.</p> <p>\u201cThe increased momentum of the humanitarian consequences agenda this year has exacerbated differences on nuclear disarmament.\u201d</p> <p>Australia said an \u201cundercurrent of support for a ban treaty is not surprising\u201d, and that it went into meetings \u201copen-eyed\u201d about the direction of negotiations.</p> <p>A so-called \u201c<a href=\"http://www.icanw.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/HINW14vienna_Pledge_Document.pdf\">humanitarian pledge</a>\u201d to eliminate nuclear weapons has been signed by 127 states around the world. Australia is particularly isolated in the Asia-Pacific region \u2013 ASEAN nations, New Zealand, and almost all Pacific Island states, support a ban treaty.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Australia has a strong record on disarmament generally: during its term on the security council it helped shepherd into existence the Arms Trade Treaty, and has been one of the world\u2019s largest donors to the Office for Disarmament Affairs, contributing money for conventional disarmament and arms control, and also for abolition of biological and chemical weapons.</p> <p>But its posture on nuclear weapons, supporting the US stance that \u201cnuclear weapons continue to play a role in maintaining peace and stability\u201d, is leaving it increasingly isolated in international negotiations.</p> <p>The efficacy of a ban treaty is a matter of fierce debate. Without the participation of the states that actual possess nuclear weapons, critics argue it cannot succeed. But proponents argue a nuclear weapons ban will create a moral case \u2013 in the vein of the cluster and land mine conventions \u2013 for nuclear weapons states to disarm, and establish a new international norm prohibiting nuclear weapons\u2019 development, possession, and use. </p> <p>Non-nuclear states have expressed increasing frustration with the current nuclear regime and the sclerotic movement towards disarmament. </p> <p>With nuclear weapons states modernising and in some cases growing their arsenals, instead of discarding them, an increasing number of states are expressing disenchantment with the non-proliferation treaty, and lending their support for an outright ban.</p> <p>The Conference on Disarmament, the world\u2019s negotiating body on multilateral disarmament, has not negotiated a treaty since the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 1996, and it has regularly struggled to even agree on a program of works.</p> <p>Associate professor Tilman Ruff, co-president of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, said that with a ban treaty likely to be concluded next year, the world stood at an historic turning point.</p> <p>A ban would, he argued, \u201cfill the existing legal gap which currently makes the most heinously destructive of all weapons the last weapon of mass destruction not explicitly outlawed by international treaty\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFor other indiscriminate and inhumane weapons ... the world has first established a clear moral and legal norm of prohibition. For biological and chemical weapons, antipersonnel land-mines and cluster munitions, establishing an unequivocal norm of prohibition has ... been the basis for subsequent progress towards their elimination.</p> <p>\u201cProhibit, then eliminate. That is the proven, logical path. For nuclear weapons it is also the only feasible, practical option at this time.\u201d </p> <p>The Australian government\u2019s position, he said, was becoming increasingly untenable globally, and falling further out of step with Australian public opinion.</p> <p>Politically, support for Australian reliance on America\u2019s extended nuclear deterrence, is no longer bipartisan. At its national conference in 2015, Labor formally adopted a policy of \u201cfirm support\u201d for an outright ban on nuclear weapons.<br></p> <p>Lisa Singh spoke at a UN side event in New York last week \u2013 in her capacity as a Labor Senator, not as a representative of the Australian government \u2013 arguing the \u201cdoctrine of nuclear deterrence ... is based on a willingness to inflict violence indiscriminately and on a massive scale\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cLike most Australians, I\u2019m strongly of the belief that nuclear weapons should play no role in our defence. These are totally abhorrent, immoral weapons. As a nation, we should support all efforts to stigmatise, prohibit and eliminate nuclear weapons.<br></p> <p>But briefing cables from Australian diplomatic posts argue imposing a ban is naive, one of a number of \u201csimplistic approaches which ignore the security dimensions\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEffective disarmament can only be achieved by engaging all the nuclear-armed states; simply banning nuclear weapons would not lead to their elimination\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAs long as the threat of nuclear attack or coercion exists, and countries like the DPRK [North Korea] seek these weapons and threaten others, Australia and many other countries will continue to rely on US extended nuclear deterrence.\u201d</p> <p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade declined to comment publicly for this story, but foreign minister Julie Bishop has argued previously: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/comment/we-must-engage-not-enrage-nuclear-countries-20140213-32n1s.html\">We must engage, not enrage nuclear countries</a>\u201d. </p> <p>She said a ban treaty was \u201cemotionally appealing\u201d, but an approach that would only \u201cdivert attention from the sustained, practical steps needed for effective disarmament\u201d. <br></p>",

This is confirmed by both the radio telescope tracking from Earth and the Mars Express spacecraft, which was recording the descent from orbit.</p> <p>Although it would be a disappointment for the landing to fail at the last moment, the most important thing was that it happens now and not in 2020 when ESA send their life-detecting rover to the surface. </p> <p>So all in all, today was a success. A fantastic new science mission is now in orbit around Mars and the landing test returned invaluable data for the engineers to make the 2020 landing safer.</p> <p>And that seems like a good place to leave the blog.

To date they are the only space agency to successfully land and return science from Mars.</p> <p>The Soviets were the first to receive signals from the surface on Mars in December 1971. Their Mars 3 mission landed on the surface but worked for just 14.5 seconds, sending back a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_3#/media/File:Mars_3_Image.png\">static filled image</a> that defies analysis to this day.</p> <p>Worried that the spacecraft may have been swallowed by Martian quicksand, Nasa programmed their 1976 Viking mission to take an image of the landing pads as soon as they touched down. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Mars_Viking_12a001.png\">image of footpad 3</a> is therefore the first clear image to be taken from the surface of Mars.</p> <p>Since then, Nasa have successfully landed on Mars six more time.</p> <p>ESA\u2019s 2003 Beagle 2 lander never phoned home, and so was presumed to have crashed. However, in 2015 it was discovered to have <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/16/lost-beagle-2-spacecraft-found-mars\">landed successfully</a>, but not deployed its antenna.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T15:44:48.881Z\">at 4.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58078f52e4b0cd26ff71ec49\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T15:29:00.498Z\">4.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile high above Mars, the Trace Gas Orbiter is still firing its main engine to be captured by Mars\u2019s gravity.

Now people have had enough. Though there have been powerful women\u2019s movements in the region for a long time, the campaign against gender-based violence has gathered momentum, culminating in the #NiUnaMenos \u2013 \u201cnot one less\u201d \u2013 movement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jun/03/brazil-argentina-unite-protest-sexual-violence-gender\">Brazil and Argentina unite in protest against culture of sexual violence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The symbolic power of so many women standing together proves that focusing on victims does not mean portraying women as passive. These protests have given women a name and face and presence in death, when their killers and society more broadly objectified or ignored them. They&#xa0;have shown that violence is not only the result&#xa0;of&#xa0;inequality and discrimination but also a mechanism perpetuating such&#xa0;problems.</p> <p>While the concept of femicide \u2013 generally understood as the misogynistic or gender-related killing of women \u2013 has been particularly resonant in Latin America, it is employed worldwide. Last year, the United Nations special rapporteur on violence against women, Dubravka \u0160imonovi\u0107, urged all member states <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16796&amp;LangID=E\" title=\"\">to establish a \u201cfemicide watch\u201d </a>and publish the statistics each year. The UK already has such a project, the volunteer-run <a href=\"https://kareningalasmith.com/tag/femicidecensus/\" title=\"\">Femicide Census</a>, but only because <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/02/why-we-need-femicide-census\" title=\"\">Karen Ingala Smith</a> began tallying deaths independently.</p> <p>Focusing on femicide must be done with care: it is a way of forcing society to confront violence against women, not of allowing authorities to ignore anything short of murder \u2013 both because lower-level violence is more prevalent, and because men who murder their partners usually have a history of attacking them. Acknowledging the commonalities is not a reason to ignore social and cultural differences that result in very <a href=\"http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/77421/1/WHO_RHR_12.38_eng.pdf\" title=\"\">different patterns of crimes against women</a> in different places, such as dowry-related violence and so-called \u201chonour killings\u201d. And the success of Latin American movements in <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/07/bolivia-measures-counteract-gender-violence-160711135302912.html\" title=\"\">achieving legal change</a> must be set against the difficulties of enforcing those laws and effecting a shift in social attitudes: not just prosecuting and punishing gender-related crimes but preventing them.</p> <p>Perhaps the movement\u2019s greatest value has been in making connections that are often overlooked: challenging the lines drawn between categories such as domestic and stranger violence, and related judgments about the \u201cworthiness\u201d of victims or the importance of cases. The latest protest was sparked by the rape and murder of a schoolgirl. But in others, marchers have reacted explicitly to attempts to dismiss victims on the basis of factors such as their sexual behaviour. Not one less schoolgirl; but, equally, not one less sex worker, or gang member. Paradoxically, by focusing on the value of each and every woman\u2019s life, the movement turns our attention away from what they have or haven\u2019t done and towards the actions of violent men \u2013 which are, after all, what must change.</p>",

The prison service paid staff to leave \u2013 the years of experience, the mentoring, the sharing of their experiences, a lot of that has been lost, and it is showing. It\u2019s why we need an inquiry into this.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking outside the prison gates, Attard told the Guardian: \u201cWe called for an independent public inquiry a week ago.

What we would like to see is a regime that can be managed safely with the right number of staff.\u201d</p> <p>He said the prison was one of the most dangerous in the country and would be at maximum security while it was searched. \u201cPentonville is one of the busiest prisons and it will, by its very nature, be one of the most violent prisons as well,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>\u201cRight now it will be on lockdown.

No matter their age or what they have done, no one deserves to die in prison. It is supposed to be a place of safety.\u201d</p> <p>Another woman said: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be allowed to happen anywhere, let alone in prison. It\u2019s obviously not safe in there.\u201d</p> <p>Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, whose Islington South and Finsbury constituency includes Pentonville, gave her condolences to the family of the victim. The prison, she said, was completely inappropriate for modern needs and should be shut down.</p> <p>She told ITV News: <em>\u201c</em>It is unsafe, it is rat infested, it was built in 1842. It is an absolute shame on our country that we continue to put people into that prison. I believe that if you commit a crime, your liberty should be taken away. That is enough. You should not be subjected to the conditions in Pentonville today.<em>\u201d </em><em><br></em></p> <p>She added: \u201cDespite the efforts of staff to make the best of difficult circumstances, the prison is overcrowded, understaffed, and plain dangerous both for staff and prisoners. A prison built to house 900 inmates now holds 1,300, and there is scant provision for the most vulnerable amongst them.</p> <p>\u201cIt has the additional problem that \u2013 as a prison primarily used to hold inmates on remand and on short sentences \u2013 its high turnover makes for a naturally unstable and volatile environment, not helped by the easy availability of, and roaring trade in, drugs.\u201d</p> <p>Police were called to Pentonville prison at around 3.30pm on Tuesday. Officers and paramedics found three prisoners with stab wounds.<br></p> <p>Two men, aged 21 and 30, were taken to an east London hospital, where they remained in a critical condition, a Metropolitan police spokesman said on Wednesday.</p> <p>Two men, aged 34 and 26, have been arrested in connection with the incident.</p> <p>\u2022 The headline on this article was amended on 20 October 2016.

He did not say anything sensational or indiscreet in his evidence to the select committee, but for someone committed to giving \u201cno running commentary\u201d on Brexit, he was surprisingly candid. Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Hammond said the government should keep its Brexit options as open as possible and he appeared to criticise his Brexiteer colleague who are adopting a more hardline stance.</strong> He argued that keeping options open was a good negotiating strategy. </li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am trying not to rule anything out. Every possible combination should be considered, because I genuinely believe that every time we rule something out we hand a negotiating chip to the opposite side of the table. Keeping as many things on the table as possible is the best negotiating stance.</p> </blockquote> <p>And, in remarks that seemed aimed at colleagues like Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, he suggested that taking a firm stance against the single market or the customs union would be mistake.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Theresa May] needs the maximum possible space. My objective in supporting her is to ensure that she has the broadest range of options - properly costed and understood - and the maximum scope to deploy that broad range of options in what might be a wide-ranging negotiation. </p> <p>I would say that those that are undermining the effort are those that are seeking to close down that negotiating stance, seeking to arrive at hard decisions that we don\u2019t need at this stage. Keeping as many areas open, as many options open, as possible is the key to the strongest possible negotiating hand.</p> </blockquote> <p>When it was put to him that the very existence of the international trade department suggested the UK would leave the customs union (because if the UK remains in the customs union, it will not be able to negotiate separate trade deals), Hammond said that \u201cmany EU countries have trade ministries even though they are inside the customs union\u201d and that ministers in Fox\u2019s department were \u201cpromoting British trade\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He said he there were \u201cdeeply pragmatic\u201d at the top of the EU who would enable the UK and the EU to find a \u201cmutually beneficial\u201d solution to Brexit.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There has been quite a lot of position taking, as one would expect, at this stage of the negotiation. But I remain optimistic that there are, at very senior level across the European Union, some deeply pragmatic people who have shown by their actions time and again that they can find solutions when challenged with problems. And if we look at the history of the EU, how many times have people said there is no way through this problem or that problem? And yet the EU has been able to find a way through it. And I hope that pragmatism and engagement will deliver us a mutually beneficial solution. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He was criticised by MPs after saying he would not publish internal Treasury reports analysing the costs and benefits of Brexit. </strong>To do so would undermine the UK\u2019s negotiating position, he claimed. But Labour\u2019s <strong>Rachel Reeves</strong> said this stance was \u201cdisappointing\u201d. And <strong>Andrew Tyrie</strong>, the committee chair, said most members of the committee would probably agree with Reeves on this.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He ruled out Scotland being able to negotiate its own trade deal with the EU. </strong>It was for the UK as a whole to strike a trade deal, he said.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said other EU countries would not want a Brexit deal that damaged the City because that would be bad for Europe as a whole. </strong>Perceptions on the continent that other European financial centres were likely to gain if London lost access to EU markets were likely to \u201cmelt away\u201d as people realised that UK jobs were more likely to go to the US, or disappear, than to go to other European countries, he said. London was Europe\u2019s financial services centre as well as the UK\u2019s, he said.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Anything which broke up this deep and broad pool of capital and expertise in London would be hugely detrimental to the real economy across the EU as well as the UK.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said City firms were starting to be \u201crealistic\u201d about the likelihood of them not being able to retain the \u201cpassporting\u201d regime that allowed them to operate in other EU countries.</strong> He said it in such a way as to imply he thought they were right to be \u201crealistic\u201d and to start considering alternatives.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said the UK would not impose immigration controls that stopped banks hiring highly-skilled workers from abroad after Brexit.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said the predictions that Treasury made about the negative impact of Brexit before the referendum were partly based on assumptions that were no longer valid.</strong> The BBC\u2019s <strong>Kamal Ahmed</strong> has written more about this.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bbckamal/status/788760367811948545\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hammond sounds the death knell on &quot;Project Fear&quot; <a href=\"https://t.co/PmUMttLw1u\">https://t.co/PmUMttLw1u</a> My Economics Blog</p>&mdash; Kamal Ahmed (@bbckamal) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbckamal/status/788760367811948545\">October 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <ul> <li><strong>He said Britain might have to beef up border controls considerably after Brexit.</strong> Asked if it was true that an additional 5,000 customs officers would be needed were correct, Hammond replied: </li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It would be our choice, of course, but assuming that we wanted to operate an efficient at-the-border customs system under World Trade Organisation rules, we may need significantly more infrastructure at the border than we have now.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the government would not change the way the Bank of England decided monetary policy, despite Theresa May appearing to criticise its policy of quantitative easing in her Tory conference speech.</strong> He said</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My understanding is that what the prime inister was trying to say is that we recognise that monetary policy, which is an important tool of macroeconomic policy, has a distributional impact. And, to the extent the government believes that distributional impact needs to be addressed or corrected, we also have tools available to us to do that ..</p> <p>There will be no change in monetary policy. Monetary policy is independently determined, that will continue to be the case. The monetary policy committee will continue to make decisions on interest rates and recommendations on unconventional monetary policy.</p> </blockquote> <p>That\u2019s all from me for today.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T17:11:23.021Z\">at 6.11pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58079bdee4b005f21833b197\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T16:17:15.677Z\">5.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Leadsom says UK could strike trade deal with EU 'in very short order'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It will be \u201cperfectly possible\u201d to secure a free trade agreement with the European Union in a short period of time, environment secretary <strong>Andrea Leadsom</strong> told a select committee this afternoon. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have total regulatory equivalence with the EU. We are not Canada, where there were a few hundred years of different rules and regulations that needed to be sorted out in a free trade agreement. We\u2019re certainly not China, where there is different language barriers and so on.</p> <p>There is the economics and the politics, and I think the economics says it would be perfectly possible, perfectly realistic to get a free trade agreement in place in very short order. </p> <p>Don\u2019t forget the rest of the world takes an average of just over two years to negotiate a free trade agreement, and if I\u2019m not very much mistaken that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve got between now and when we leave the EU, and that\u2019s for a country that hasn\u2019t aligned its rules and regulations for 43 years. </p> <p>I\u2019m extremely optimistic. The economics says it\u2019s in all our interests to seek an agreement to continue to trade freely with each other. We have a strong hand because we import more than we export.

Most experts think the opposite, says Gardiner. In a statement he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Legal advice from the European Commission and confirmed by the House of Commons library suggests that the UK would have to renegotiate all those trade agreements concluded whilst we were members of the EU.</p> <p>If Dr. Fox has the private assurances he has claimed from non-EU trade partners, then these need to be made public and confirmed because the UK must increase its trade to these countries by 37% over the next 15 years just to stand still.</p> <p>A \u201ccross your fingers\u201d approach to what would constitute a 4.5% drop in GDP is simply not good enough.</p> <p>Today\u2019s reports again highlight just how dangerous this split in the government is. Policy decisions cannot be based upon private \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreements\u201d made off the record by foreign politicians who may or may not still be in office when we need to call them in. </p> <p>People need to know their jobs are being protected and businesses need clarity about the basis of future trade. This government is offering neither.</p> </blockquote> <p>Among those who have argued in the past that the UK would not just be able to inherit the trade deals the EU has with non-EU countries after Brexit is the Commons Treasury committee. <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmtreasy/122/122.pdf\">In a report earlier this year</a> it said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Were the UK to leave the EU, it is very uncertain whether it would be able to continue to participate in these agreements. The extent to which the UK would have to enter into negotiations to ensure its continued participation would probably depend on the attitude of the contracting parties, about which little is known.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"808213cc69b4ef737ab33f6478ee2415fbb98a6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/808213cc69b4ef737ab33f6478ee2415fbb98a6a/0_27_3581_2150/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barry Gardiner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barry Gardiner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart Wilson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><br></em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580773c9e4b055209adaf266\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T13:25:20.554Z\">2.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg has posted <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37685659\">an interesting blog</a> about <strong>Philip Hammond, </strong>ahead of his appearance before the Treasury committee, looking at why there have been reports questioning whether he will stay long as chancellor.

There are two reasons why this figure does not, in our view, accurately reflect the impact of the Spending Review on health expenditure. The first is that the \u00a310 billion figure is expressed in 2020\u201321 prices, rather than the current (2015\u201316, the time of the Spending Review) prices which would normally be expected to have been used in the calculation of such figures. At 2015\u201316 prices, NHS England\u2019s budget will rise by \u00a39.5 billion between 2014\u201315 and 2020\u201321. The second reason is that the \u00a310 billion figure refers to the additional sum allocated to NHS England, not to total health spending. Part of the increase in funding to NHS England is being funded by reductions in areas of health spending which fall outside NHS England\u2019s budget, such as the public health grant to local authorities, and education and training funded through Health Education England. Those reductions amount to \u00a33.5 billion in real terms, at 2015\u201316 prices, between 2014\u201315 and 2020\u201321. The overall impact is that total health spending\u2014the Department of Health\u2019s budget\u2014will increase in real terms, at 2015\u201316 prices, by \u00a36 billion between 2014\u201315 and 2020\u201321. If the spending review period is considered\u20142015\u201316 to 2020\u201321\u2014that increase is \u00a34.5 billion. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580766b5e4b005f21833b054\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T12:31:39.431Z\">1.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Following her question at PMQs (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/19/pmqs-may-corbyn-hammond-angela-eagle-was-subect-to-homophobic-abuse-after-challenging-corbyn-labour-inquiry-finds-politics-live?page=with:block-58075ec6e4b005f21833b01b#block-58075ec6e4b005f21833b01b\">1pm)</a> the Labour MP <strong>Lisa Nandy</strong> is now saying Theresa May must come clean about when she knew about the concerns about Dame Lowell Goddard\u2019s leadership of the child sexual abuse inquiry.

Corbyn started with two focused and very reasonable questions on mental health. It was noticeable how May seemed much more comfortable when she could talk about the police (her old portfolio) and the issue of mental health patients being held in cells, although Corbyn\u2019s \u2018this is still not good enough\u2019 argument was effective. When he turned to the NHS, he just kept highlighting the funding crisis. He was not proposing anything specific, and he effectively ruled out any A&amp;E closures (which is not a position many NHS managers would support), allowing May to outflank him by stressing the Tories\u2019 commitment to localism. But Corbyn was able to shoot down this point quite well with a jibe about the NHS Act, which may be four years old but at least is more relevant than something Andy Burnham said before the 2010 general election (increased spending being \u201cirresponsible\u201d), which was one of the lines May relied on.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T12:25:57.470Z\">at 1.25pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5807556be4b055209adaf19d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T11:18:41.567Z\">12.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn says they all want local government and the NHS to work together better. But council funding has been cut. There is bed blocking, because no care is available. The problem is caused by a funding crisis. The government had disguised the extent of the crisis through temporary bailouts. That is a good thing. But why are they in crisis in the first place. Next month sustainability plans will be published. Many are worried because of the threats to A&amp;E departments. Will there be no closures?</p> <p>May says the government will spend \u00a3500bn over the course of this parliament on the NHS. But there is a difference. She says she thinks decisions should be taken locally. The Labour party favours a top-down approach.</p> <p>Corbyn says top-down is what we got from the last government. It cost \u00a33bn. She says the government promised parity of esteem, but has just delivered parity of failure instead. Another winter crisis is looming. The Society of Acute Medicines has it right when it says the NHS is on its knees.</p> <p>May says more patients are being treated, and there are more doctors and nurses. A former health secretary said spending more on the NHS would be irrreponsible. Ed Miliband wanted to weaponise the NHS. Labour say at every election that the Tories will cut spending on the NHS. But the Tories spend more. There is only one party that has cut spending on the NHS, the Labour party in Wales. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58075490e4b0cd26ff71eaa7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T11:13:45.024Z\">12.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn says no one with a mental health condition should be taken to a police cell. He commends those police commissioners who have stopped this. But NHS trusts are in a crisis. NHS providers says it is the worst crisis in NHS history. In 2010 the NHS was in surplus. What has happened?</p> <p>May says the government asked the NHS to come up with a five-year plan. Simon Stevens, the NHS England chief executive, asked for \u00a38bn. The government promised him \u00a310bn.</p> <p>Corbyn says the NHS has gone into the worse crisis in its history. And yesterday Simon Stevens told the select committee he did not think the NHS was getting the money it needed. Will May address the reckless and counterproductive adult social care cuts.</p> <p>May says Stevens said last autumn the case for the NHS had been heard and supported. She says extra money has gone into the better care fund. But it is important that the health service and local authorities work together to provide social care. She wants to see more of that. Labour would not put the money in, she says.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58075395e4b005f21833afd5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T11:09:59.913Z\">12.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> also starts by remembering the Aberfan tragedy.

And she thought the Huw Edwards\u2019 documentary was poignant. It showed what happens when those in power do not take responsibility.</p> <p>On mental health, she says the government is investing more. And the number of children\u2019s beds is being increased. </p> <p>Corbyn quotes a letter from Colin. A family member of Colin\u2019s has a chronic mental health condition.

He ascribes their bond partly to the early death of their parents. \u201cI was about 25 and Bernard was about 19 when our mother died. We were orphans by the time I was 27. So I think we felt very close.\u201d It is doubtless also down to the fact that their politics are \u201cpretty nearly indivisible \u2013 99.9%. Our parents were very similar. They would not have known a 10th of what I know, or a&#xa0;100th of what Bernard knows. They just thought that Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal was the way to run a country. They had no doubts whatsoever. They weren\u2019t following the ins and outs. They thought that a&#xa0;government ought to be working for its people. They couldn\u2019t imagine why anybody would think otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>Larry Sanders came to Britain in the late 60s \u2013 his opinion varies as to whether it was 68 or 69 \u2013 following a woman who would become his wife.

Over here, he did a masters in social work at Oxford, and eventually \u2013 when the relaxing impartiality wore off \u2013 joined the Labour party, which initially refused him on the grounds that he was a Trotskyist (which he never was, although he says it wasn\u2019t a wild accusation: \u201cThere was quite a strong, numerically very small, but strong Trotskyist movement. There was WSL [Workers\u2019 Socialist League] \u2013 people used to call them the weasels \u2013 and I think a predecessor ... you\u2019re too young and I\u2019m too old to remember this stuff, but there were plenty of them about\u201d).</p> <p>While he was teaching social work in London and living in Oxford, in the 70s, his county council decided to close down all the nurseries (they were \u201cchildminding on the rates\u201d the Tory candidate said), and this was Sanders\u2019 first real entry into British politics, occupying \u2013 which functionally meant working in \u2013 one of the nurseries until the bailiffs came. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the hardest work I\u2019ve ever done in my life. Those children are so fierce. There was one little boy whose goal in life was to kick me in the balls. No matter how I&#xa0;manoeuvred, that kid was so flexible.\u201d</p> <p>He is \u2013 I say this without exaggeration \u2013 the first politician I have ever heard acknowledge that childcare is not just sentimentally but literally harder than all other jobs. The campaign was a success \u2013 they saved 80% of the provision \u2013 but it left him with no illusions about leftwing politics. \u201cAfterwards, we had a disastrous time, when the mothers of the children and the politicos who had moved into the campaign had a knockdown drag out.\u201d Talking to him is a bit like watching Marlon Brando: I get the gist, but subtitles would help. \u201cThe campaign split,\u201d he explains.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dab9f7a17d340e503f5fedd91258211a3c33d37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dab9f7a17d340e503f5fedd91258211a3c33d37/0_0_2052_1532/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Bernie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"747\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Bernie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Sanders/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Life intervened: tragically, his wife died when his daughter was 10 and his son, 14.

The way he tells his life chimes precisely with his politics \u2013 people before profits, adversity met with fellowship; it\u2019s sad that it sounds exotic.</p> <p>Anyway, through some abstruse tradition that, once you\u2019ve been accepted in Harvard, they will move heaven and earth to make sure you graduate, he finished his law degree in the 90s and came back to the UK with the qualifications to lodge legal challenges against cuts to disability provision that the new Labour government had made necessary.</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to be terribly sophisticated to see what Blair was doing. To tell the truth, I didn\u2019t get that bothered by Blair. Even in the 80s, members didn\u2019t really think the leadership thought what they thought. But Blair was certainly destructive, the way Bill Clinton was destructive.\u201d It was through the social justice, rather than climate change, that he came to the Green party, although environmentalism certainly grips him now. His main critique of Jeremy Corbyn is that \u201chis own specific knowledge seems thin. He does say many of the right things about climate change and I trust him more than many politicians.

Courts is an unpopular candidate anyway, an unabashed Brexiter in a&#xa0;staunchly remain area. The Lib Dems clearly have high hopes (Nick Clegg was everywhere you looked, on the train, on the high street, in a charity shop, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/dec/09/russell-brand-cast-rentaghost\" title=\"\">like Timothy Claypole</a>).</p> <p>It\u2019s still unclear whether this will deliver any votes to Sanders, but that\u2019s not really the point: \u201cIt\u2019s not an expectation of winning or getting a particular percentage. It\u2019s just an opportunity to say what\u2019s happening.\u201d He certainly doesn\u2019t see himself as bringing an unpopular message to hostile Conservative territory. \u201cThere are some underlying things that are the same everywhere. I talked in one stretch of an hour to a dozen young people, and all I&#xa0;have to say is \u2018housing\u2019. All 12 of them were living with their parents \u2013 they were either in education or working. That\u2019s not only where they were now \u2013 they didn\u2019t see any prospect of being able to move out. How do you defend a politics in which the majority of your young people can\u2019t look forward to a&#xa0;decent place to live? This is absolutely basic.\u201d What does he say to old people? \u201cOld people, I can strike up a conversation immediately about pavements. The county council has had 40% taken out of its budget. It means they have cut care, but they also can\u2019t afford to deal with potholes.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/06/bernie-sanders-us-healthcare-nhs-larry-sanders\">My brother, Bernie Sanders, has got it right on healthcare | Larry Sanders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His arguments are confident and coherent, but he\u2019s not optimistic about the Labour party getting itself into shape in time for the next election, nor about the possibility of a&#xa0;progressive alliance coagulating into an electoral force. The most he thinks that could achieve is a groundswell of parliamentary support for proportional representation, and after that, things might change. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to be a lot of suffering, and suffering is not really good for people politically, any more than it is personally.

However, he returns, finally, to his brother\u2019s success. \u201cBefore Bernard did it, nobody except him and me and his wife would have predicted it could happen.\u201d In the quagmire of the US presidential election, it\u2019s hard to remember much that was hopeful.

OK, so possibly you might have guessed that already from the dystopian short stories that make up the two series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/black-mirror\">Black Mirror</a>. In its brief life (six episodes and a Christmas special), the show managed to conjure bleak \u2013 and, quite often, hilarious \u2013 thought-experiments out of everything from screen addiction and downloadable memory to eerie artificial boyfriends brought back from the dead via their social media accounts. That\u2019s before we\u2019ve even mentioned the forthcoming series, which, judging by the feature-length Scandi-noir episode we\u2019ve seen in advance, doesn\u2019t score high on the cheeriness scale.</p> <p>But while technology can be terrifying, it also has its plus points. For instance, we can quickly gather questions for Charlie on the Guardian\u2019s website from our readers and some famous faces. This is especially helpful because Guardian readers have a tendency to ask things that are smarter, ruder and just plain weirder (\u201cHave you ever made bagels?\u201d) than anything we might have come up with. So, without further ado, here\u2019s what you wanted to know from the smartphone generation\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/may/07/twilight-zone-rod-serling\">Rod Serling</a> (copyright: Guardian reader Meestercat) \u2026</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea71e6967a83b2e86f96b7daeeb5cc43f96d6373\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea71e6967a83b2e86f96b7daeeb5cc43f96d6373/59_136_4016_2409/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bryce Dallas Howard Black Mirror Nosedive\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Future imperfect: Bryce Dallas Howard in Black Mirror series three, episode one Nosedive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Dettmann/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Bearing in mind the past, the present and the possible future \u2013 would it be better if I had never been born? <br></strong><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sara-pascoe\">Sara Pascoe</a><br></em></strong>What\u2019s depressing is that I wonder that myself. Now that I\u2019ve got kids, I can get quite fatalistic about thing like nuclear weapons. They\u2019re all primed, ready to go off at the drop of a hat and I think we\u2019ve been incredibly lucky that hasn\u2019t happened yet. And now we have the world getting more polarised and tense ... I remember, as a kid, when the reality of nuclear weapons dawned on me, I couldn\u2019t work out why everyone wasn\u2019t running around panicking rather than sitting in cafes having a coffee. Hopefully, some supervillain threat will come down and we will have to unite as a species and fire our nukes into the sun or something.

There\u2019s a large swath of people who are so fucking furious they feel that someone who represents a massive fuck-you to everything is a good idea. You have to address that because it ain\u2019t going away.</p> <p><strong>As a writer, do you ever look at Trump and think: \u201cI\u2019d never get away with that!\u201d?<br></strong>Oh, yeah. We did an episode of Black Mirror [The Waldo Moment] about a cartoon character who ran as an MP, and I remember thinking about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris\">Boris Johnson</a>, but I wasn\u2019t sure we had quite got it right. Some of the criticisms of that episode, which I thought were valid, were that they didn\u2019t think a character that crude and basic would ever catch on. Then you look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Trump</a> and you go: \u201cWell ...\u201d But you would never accept Donald Trump as a work of original fiction ... it would be panned as way too implausible. I have no idea where political satire goes after this.</p> <p><strong>Did you watch the presidential debates?<br></strong>Bits of them. I find it remarkable that anyone could support him based on his demeanour and the way he speaks. But then I thought that with George W Bush: \u201cHow can anyone watch him answering questions and not see what I\u2019m seeing?\u201d But is that just the way my brain is coloured that makes me see that? That\u2019s what I keep trying to work out. Is it just an optical illusion that some people see this, and some people see that, like that thing where you either see a young woman or an old lady?</p> <p><strong>If you hate devices so frigging much, why don\u2019t you throw them away or boil them?<br></strong><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/armandoiannucci\">Armando Iannucci</a><br></em></strong>I don\u2019t hate them!

If I do, I have porridge or Weetabix or Shreddies or Coco Pops. As for music, I\u2019ve always suffered from insomnia but I\u2019ve discovered these things called SleepPhones, which are like headphones that come in a headband, so you can sleep on them without it hurting. I\u2019ve listened to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/may/08/radiohead-a-moon-shaped-pool-review\">A Moon Shaped Pool by Radiohead</a> every night pretty much since it came out and I\u2019m out after 30 minutes. I also listen to music when I\u2019m running but I\u2019ll sound like a wanker if I try and describe that; it\u2019s literally everything from minimal techno to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/23/grandstand-countdown-ski-sunday-unsung-composers-tvs-greatest-theme-tunes\">KPM library music</a> to some fucking rap act that I shouldn\u2019t be listening to at my age.</p> <p><strong>Now, you\u2019re writing your own scripts, after years of reviewing them.

And how the process of writing never really ends because it carries on into the edit suite and beyond that ... you can change a lot in the edit. Now, I can spot moments in shows where they\u2019ve made a change and are wallpapering over the cracks; you add lines and just see the back of someone\u2019s head. That happens so often you wouldn\u2019t believe it. Actually, Russell gave me one of the best tips when I interviewed him once. He said that most conversations were just two monologues clashing, because people hardly ever listen to each other. And he\u2019s right: if you just have two people throwing their own monologues at one another it ends up sounding more realistic.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve listened to A Moon Shaped Pool by Radiohead every night since it came out and I\u2019m asleep after 30 minutes</p> <footer> <cite>Charlie Brooker</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>If the choice between the Tories and Ukip can be likened to one between a vampire and a zombie, which is which?</strong><br><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/paul-mason\">Paul Mason</a><br></em></strong>Is this a real question or just one somebody <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulmasonnews/status/786678986990620673\">recorded him asking in a cafe</a> and he\u2019s going to be really angry about it?

It was the sort of thing that could have been in a million different comedy books, but because it was on the internet it led me to doing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/charliebrooker\">stuff for the Guardian</a> and getting a comedy-writing job. Nowadays, there are a million billion talented people all doing stuff on the internet where they\u2019ve written, presented and edited these things, way beyond what I could have done, but now they\u2019re in competition with a million billion other people.

He\u2019s quite method you see, so he did actually do it. No, no, he didn\u2019t ... I was there that day on set with my wife and we were all hiding in a cupboard around the corner. It was quite funny because Otto the director didn\u2019t shout \u201ccut\u201d when we were shooting that scene.

I\u2019m a softy, really, in that respect. But I\u2019d like to see her have a complete change of heart. So, perhaps she could find a magic whistle that gives her a complete change of heart.

Once I wrote a thing in 2004 about George Bush [he wrote: \u201cJohn Wilkes-Booth, Lee Harvey Oswald, John Hinckley Jr, where are you now that we need you?\u201d] that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/oct/24/tvandradio.theguide\">the Guardian had to apologise for</a>. It was a joke that got taken the wrong way. And someone wrote to say that they were going to smuggle a sniper rifle through customs and kill me, so I had better walk close to buildings, stay under trees and move in a zig-zag. That one stayed with me. Does that count as reader feedback?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5ecc0671ec76fe6477cc852ea04005bd608aba38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ecc0671ec76fe6477cc852ea04005bd608aba38/0_0_2081_2048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Morris Brass Eye\" width=\"1000\" height=\"984\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Morris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>When you </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/feb/10/nathan-barley-charlie-brooker-east-london-comedy\"><strong>worked with Chris Morris on Nathan Barley</strong></a><strong>, how did you find navigating that kind of relationship with him? Did you feel intimidated by him, or did you just work as creative equals only concerned with doing a good job?</strong><br><strong><em>Dylan Curran<br></em></strong>I was definitely intimidated before I met him. I expected him to show up and be his Brass Eye persona. But instead he bounded in, long curly hair, quite goofy and animated ... laughing and jolly. It was so disarmingly not what I expected that in reality he wasn\u2019t intimidating. Having said that, I remember the first day we were shooting Nathan Barley \u2013 he was so laser-focused and serious I thought: \u201cWhat the fuck\u2019s happened? Has something bad happened?\u201d He was like a dog that had seen some meat: frozen and super-concentrating. And sometimes, if he\u2019s intellectually interested in something, he\u2019s straight on it and will bombard you with questions about it in a way that you feel any answer you give will be stupid. So I still can feel intimidated by him.</p> <p><strong>I run a charity that represents civilian victims of secret drone strikes, a topic that apparently helped inspire an episode in the new series of Black Mirror.

I think we will probably kill us. Maybe our best way out of it is to invent robots who can kill us in a really gentle way. If we ended up like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/keanureeves\">Keanu Reeves</a> at the start of The Matrix, where he\u2019s plugged into the dreambox or whatever, that wouldn\u2019t be so bad. The tragedy of that film is when he pulls the plug out. It\u2019s all downhill from there.</p> <p><strong>Is it true you were inspired by drone-strike victims?<br></strong>Loosely ... there\u2019s an episode in this season called Men Against Fire, which is to do with this book called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Killing\">On Killing [By Dave Grossman]</a>, about the psychological effect of distance on killing. It was pre-drones, but it talks about how the people who dropped firebombs on Dresden, even though they knew intellectually they were boiling women and children to death, didn\u2019t suffer the level of psychological trauma as someone who, say, had to stick a knife in someone\u2019s ribs. There\u2019s also another project I was working on that I might return to \u2013 it was like a long-form Black Mirror and that had drone animals walking around.</p> <p><strong>How posh are you? <br></strong><strong><em>HoG<br></em></strong>By background not very. People always assume I went to public school, which I didn\u2019t, so that immediately puts me somewhere. Then again I grew up in a leafy village in Oxfordshire and that\u2019s quite posh in itself. Also I\u2019m drinking a green tea right now in a fancy restaurant ... so I don\u2019t really know. I\u2019m definitely a lot posher than I used to be, but I don\u2019t like posh things, particularly. I don\u2019t eat in posh restaurants or drink posh wine because I don\u2019t really get it. But I make TV shows so I must be quite posh.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the poshest thing you\u2019ve ever bought?<br></strong>An upgrade on a flight. I got upgraded on a flight once and from that point on every time I\u2019ve flown economy I\u2019m just fucking angry the whole time. You end up balancing the urge to say \u201cHOW FUCKING MUCH?\u201d with the desire to just get some sleep.

The international <a href=\"https://www.movisie.com/news/international-cities-form-rainbow-cities-network\">Rainbow Cities</a> network shares and promotes LGBTQ policies in cities around the world, believing that municipal and regional authorities have an important and specific task in combatting discrimination.</p> <p>One city trying to join the Rainbow network is S\u00e3o Paulo. Felipe de Paula, S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s secretary for human rights and citizenship, agrees the LGBTQ agenda is missing at Habitat III. \u201cLGBTQ rights are part of the human rights agenda,\u201d he says. </p> <p>S\u00e3o Paulo, which has a Right to the City Coordination embedded in local government, has publicly funded centres of LGBTQ citizenship across the city that offer legal, health, social and psychological support.

All proceeds from the event go to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.jrsusa.org/campaigns_focus?TN=PROMO-20130815114542\">Jesuit Refugee Service\u2019s Global Educational Initiative</a>.</p> <p>Lampedusa, an Italian island in the Mediterranean sea, has been a prime entry point for refugees in Europe since 2000. It has also been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/22/lampedusa-boat-tragedy-migrants-africa\">a place of considerable peril</a>. Last year, nearly 1,600 migrants died en route there from Libya. </p> <p>While issues so dire gave the show its urgency, the mood of the night often stressed joy through cooperation. The setup helped. Rather than honoring a strict hierarchy of stars, the main artists remained onstage throughout the night, sitting in a semicircle on chairs, taking turns performing songs round-robin style. Along with the stately names at the top of the bill, the show included equal contributions from the gifted young duo <a href=\"http://themilkcartonkids.com/\">the Milk Carton Kids</a>, a cameo for the musical comedy of Will and Grace actress <a href=\"http://www.meganmullally.net/\">Megan Mullally</a>, as well as a special appearance at the end by the grande dame of politicized song, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/31/joan-baez-singer-activist-peacenik-lover-legend-royal-festival-hall\">Joan Baez</a>.</p> <p>Toward the start and finish of the two-and-a-half hour event, songs of displacement, alienation and wandering peppered the set. Miller emphatically delivered Shelter Me, whose narrator draws on faith to guide him to safety. The Milk Carton Kids offered Hope of a Lifetime, whose lyrics chart an equally treacherous journey. Earle contributed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvaEJzoaYZk\">Copperhead Road</a>, featuring characters who try to get by on the underground economy. </p> <p>Deep into the night, the theme grew more pointed. Earle sang City of Immigrants, while the Kids rendered The City of Our Lady, whose chorus declares: \u201cEverywhere we go / We\u2019re the child of where we came.\u201d Baez delivered Woody Guthrie\u2019s classic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrRak5-tCr8\">Deportee</a>, about the consequences of objectifying refugees. </p> <p>In the central part of the show, the subject turned to thwarted love. Harris offered Making Believe, a song she first recorded 40 years ago, whose narrator can only imagine romance. Plant went back farther to cover a sad ballad sung by Elvis Presley called Done. Here, as well as in his renditions of Little Maggie and Nothing, the Led Zeppelin yowler drew on his quietest voice, finding in its high, open tones nearly as much power as his classic shouts. In a snarky aside about his old band, Plant said he would not be performing \u201cHobbit songs\u201d. </p> <p>Throughout the night, Harris lent harmonies to other singers on the most tender points of their songs, Miller injected energy through his electric solos, while Kenneth Pattengale of the Milk Carton Kids ran rings around the tunes with his speedy and dexterous acoustic solos. </p> <p>The Kids brought to the night youth, humor and the dynamism of a duo in ideal sync. Their tandem vocals inescapably recall the most delicate interplay of Simon and Garfunkel, while their banter has the dry wit of the <a href=\"http://www.smothersbrothers.com/\">Smothers Brothers</a>. Their songs added prettiness to proceedings which more often emphasized the flinty and raw. Nearly the entire set list drew from America\u2019s greatest musical resources: blues, folk and country music. The result carried a potent subtext: it presented an empathic and inclusive view of America, in contrast to the fearful and exclusive one exploited by Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. Baez referred to the show as a \u201cpocket of sanity\u201d in the current world. To her point, when a Earle song introduced the line \u201cwe are all immigrants\u201d, the audience, as one, sang along. </p>",

EA draws player performance statistics from the real sporting season into its Fifa, NBA and Madden NFL titles, so your team in the game can mirror the week-by-week data of the real thing \u2013 including injuries. In Fifa 17\u2019s popular Ultimate Team mode \u2013 a cross between Fantasy Football and a Panini sticker album \u2013 players are more valuable if their real-life counterpart is performing well. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague/table\" title=\"\">So don\u2019t rely on any Sunderland players right now</a>.</p> <p>Plenty of games also use weather and day/night data, so that when you are playing, the conditions will mirror those in the genuine geographic location. Microsoft Flight Simulator uses real-time meteorological data to simulate conditions at airports around the world, so if it is foggy in Rio, it is also foggy in simulated Rio. Nintendo\u2019s cute village simulator <a href=\"http://www.animal-crossing.com/\" title=\"\">Animal Crossing</a> has a day night/cycle tied to the data in your handheld 3DS console, so if you are playing at night, the shops will be closed and your fellow villagers will be in bed. Insomniac players can still go fishing, though, as certain fish are only around after dark. The ingenious Gameboy Advance adventure Boktai: The Sun is in Your Hand came with a photometric light sensor that required players to \u2013 gasp \u2013 go outside to avoid the game\u2019s vampire enemies.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the game series that gets closest to Football Manager\u2019s appropriation of Brexit is the in-depth political simulation Democracy, from independent studio Positech Games. \u201cDemocracy 3 had a lot of changes because of political events,\u201d says designer Cliff Harris. \u201cMad cow disease became a thing, as did pension-fund scandals and global credit crunch events. Also, after <a href=\"http://positech.co.uk/democracy3/\" title=\"\">Democracy 3</a> was released, we had to update it with a bunch of new policies including the mansion tax. And we had to add police drones. And Tasers.\u201d</p> <p>Fans of the game have created their own modification for the sim, Trump Nation, which imagines a&nbsp;near-future America under president Donald Trump. When the magazine PC Gamer tried it, it&nbsp;implemented a range of the billionaire\u2019s favourite policies and then watched how the US would react: two senior members of his administration resigned almost immediately, there was a series of&nbsp;assassination attempts and, finally, the presidency toppled under an armed socialist insurrection.

The most striking thing about the Athenaeum is that it\u2019s almost always empty and quiet like the grave. I had plenty of books at home growing up, but as an adolescent girl I really appreciated the access to books about sex. It was a way of learning without having to involve my mother, or indeed have her see that I was reading about it! </p> <p>I do think libraries are important - especially for so-called \u201clatch-key children\u201d like myself. It was a place to go, out of the house, quiet and safe. I lived in cramped quarters with a single mother, and really needed some place to go. In cities they\u2019re usually quite accessible and it\u2019s unfortunate that suburban children often can\u2019t just walk to a library, especially now that more economically disadvantaged children live in the suburbs.\u2019 <strong><em>Leslie Molson</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78c6d8076fb60ccc0aa42c092c282b3911dc3ded\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78c6d8076fb60ccc0aa42c092c282b3911dc3ded/0_0_1200_800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Providence Athenaeum is the most beautiful library I\u2019ve ever been to, outside of New York City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Providence Athenaeum is the most beautiful library I\u2019ve ever been to, outside of New York City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leslie Molson/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><em><strong>\u2018</strong>An early advocator of modern US architecture\u2019</em> - <strong>Davenport Public Library, Iowa</strong></h2> <p>This public library dates back to 1839, but its current form is a 1960s building designed by American architect Edward Durell Stone.

This led to depression, anxiety and crippling poverty. One of my friends decided that some time in the sun would do me good and sent me a ticket to visit her in LA. My friend showed me her favourite buildings in LA. We ascended Bunker Hill via the Angel\u2019s Flight funicular railway right to the top where we had a lovely view of the city\u2019s Central Library. </p> <p>It was built in 1926 and its design is based on ancient Egyptian and Mediterranean Revival architecture. The library burned down twice in 1986 and as a result over 400,000 books were lost. A stunning and beautiful building both inside and out, they were selling badgeswith authors\u2019 names on them in the children\u2019s section when I visited. I got a Kurt Vonnegut badge and a Shel Silverstein badge. My favourite book I was introduced to by a library is Arthur Dogboy\u2019s Long Weekend by Graham McIver.

During my stay I have met a lot of people involved in research and academic studies. Some of my friends are from North Carolina and have studied at the North Carolina State University (NCSU) for their degrees. On one of my trips to North Carolina I decided to visit the NCSU Hunt library, as I\u2019d heard that it\u2019s one of the pioneering research libraries in US. </p> <p>The most striking thing about this building is the so called \u201cbookBot\u201d (robotic book delivery system). It can store up to two million volumes in a climate-controlled environment and deliver any of them within minutes of a click in the online catalog. In the bookBot all books and other documents are barcoded, sorted by size, and stored in over 18,000 bins. Each item is scanned whenever it is removed from and returned to the system, to maximise the available storage space and allowing the library\u2019s online catalog to track the location of all materials at all times. </p> <p>The photo is of the library\u2019s Rain Garden Reading Lounge - a colourful soft seating area arranged around curved book shelves containing new books in engineering, computer science and a science fiction collection.

There wouldn\u2019t have been any progress for the human race without books. All our knowledge, without exception, comes from a book, a volume, an article, a note written by remarkable authors and stored somewhere in a library. Students shouldn\u2019t feel intimidated by stepping inside a library. Here is where new ideas come to life. Here is where the greatest scientists, poets, doctors, engineers, physicists have turned their passion into discoveries and research paths that would change the world forever.

Like so many historic buildings in the mid-west the old city hall/library now stands empty and will likely be allowed to fall into gradual disrepair. Both facilities have been relocated to a larger, slightly more modern building just along the road.

Built in 1886 the library is the oldest in Florida operating in its original building. It serves the 5,000 citizens with a collection of 25,000 books.</p> <p>Public libraries are essential to a healthy democracy. It is the one place where all members of the community are welcomed to enter and make free use of all the resources available regardless of age or income. It\u2019s a place that protects access to information for everyone and preserves the community\u2019s memory. It\u2019s a safe harbor for children and a meeting place for seniors.

  "<p>Sir Howard Davies, chair of the Airports Commission, has called for a parliamentary vote on airport expansion to be held without delay and reiterated the commission\u2019s preference for a third runway at Heathrow.</p> <p>Speaking at the property conference MIPIM UK in London, Davies also said \u201cthe froth has gone off the London property market\u201d.</p> <p>He said he saw no reason why the House of Commons vote on airport expansion should not go ahead straight away. Theresa May has been accused of \u201cdither and delay\u201d by Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/18/airport-expansion-vote-put-on-hold-for-more-than-a-year-by-theresa-may\">after putting off the vote</a> for another year, amid worries about resignations of Conservative MPs.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very nervous about a situation which says: \u2018We can\u2019t do something because people will protest.\u2019 We have a democracy in this country,\u201d Davies told investors and developers gathered at the Olympia conference centre.</p> <p>\u201cWe should put it to the House of Commons and see what the vote is, and not take the view that we can\u2019t build an economically rational thing in an environmentally sensible way just because a few people will argue about it. That doesn\u2019t seem to be a sensible way of making policy.\u201d</p> <p>Davies added: \u201cThe arguments point very closely towards Heathrow and post Brexit even more so.\u201d </p> <p>About 70% of tourism at Gatwick airport is outbound while at Heathrow it is the opposite, with 70% of tourism inbound, he said, and Heathrow is the airport that links Britain to markets outside Europe.</p> <p>He was confident that the air pollution issue could be handled, and that the noise issue could be \u201csignificantly mitigated\u201d.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/01/airports-commission-case-for-heathrow-expansion-opaque\">Airports Commission</a> examined three options in a report published last year: a third runway at Heathrow, which was the preferred choice, the extension of an existing runway at Heathrow, or the building of a second runway at Gatwick.</p> <p>Davies, who also chairs Royal Bank of Scotland, said he had heard in his meetings with bankers that a number of banks were preparing to move operations elsewhere in Europe due to fears they could lose access to the single market. </p> <p>\u201cThe London property market may not be quite so buoyant if we had some downsizing of the City,\u201d he warned. Citing a recent report, he said: \u201cIf we have a messy compromise, we could have a 15% fall [in house prices] and in London rather more than that.\u201d</p> <p>The financier Guy Hands, the founder of buyout firm Terra Firma, challenged the notion that the eurozone could claim London\u2019s financial crown, saying US banks were more likely to relocate to New York than Frankfurt or Paris. \u201cIf the financial services business moves out of London, it will move out of Europe and it will affect Europe very negatively indeed,\u201d he said at the same event.</p> <p>Hands, who had favoured the UK remaining in the EU, said Britain now needed to accept hard Brexit and get on with it. Freedom from Brussels was an opportunity to cut taxation and regulation. \u201cIt\u2019s not the referendum that matters, it\u2019s how Britain chooses to go forward.\u201d</p> <p>Hands stressed that \u201cnobody has any real idea of what\u2019s going to happen\u201d to the property market. He did point to Britain\u2019s \u201cchronic housing shortage,\u201d estimated at about 1.2m homes. \u201cIt\u2019s the fundamental problem of social deprivation. Will Brexit change that housing shortage? I don\u2019t think it will.\u201d</p> <p>Addressing the wider economic impact of Brexit, Davies predicted a further rise in inflation, which <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/18/uk-inflation-rises-near-two-year-high-consumer-price-index\">hit 1% last month</a>, after the referendum sparked a sharp decline in the value of sterling. He also anticipated slower economic growth in the long term, but noted the degree of the slowdown depended on the nature of Brexit.</p> <p>He was doubtful that the weaker pound would boost British exports of goods, noting that \u201cour goods exports are not particularly price sensitive\u201d and that businesses would take a hit from the higher cost of imported materials.</p>",
  "<p>Maro Itoje has a confession to make. Contrary to the ever\u2011increasing body of evidence, England\u2019s brightest talent of his generation does not possess super powers. He says he cannot read minds and as he continues to be held up as the standard bearer of English rugby\u2019s revival \u2013 not to mention Saracens\u2019 all-conquering side \u2013 being invisible is no longer an option. That is, anywhere other than the classroom.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think a lot of [my classmates] know who I am to be honest,\u201d says Itoje, in his final year of a politics degree at London\u2019s School of Oriental and African Studies. \u201cI can be fairly discreet, some lecturers and some tutors know [who I am]. It makes life a little bit easier. It\u2019s quite nice to go incognito for a while. Politics is a little bit different to Premiership rugby.\u201d</p> <p>Anonymity is increasingly difficult for Itoje elsewhere, however. On the pitch he is an immense talent. He has remarkable athleticism for a second\u2011row: pace, power, lineout prowess and a rare ability to influence matches \u2013 his run of 31 consecutive wins when starting was ended <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/24/harlequins-saracens-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">by Harlequins last month</a> but he was to the fore in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/15/toulon-saracens-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Sarries\u2019 win in Toulon</a> on Saturday, despite 10 minutes in the sin-bin.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/oct/17/european-rugby-champions-cup-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action\">European Rugby Champions Cup: talking points from the weekend\u2019s action</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At 21 he has a bulging trophy cabinet, is the reigning European player of the year and the sponsorship deals are rolling in. Now he is being lined up by Eddie Jones to solve England\u2019s crisis at openside this autumn which, while disrupting Itoje\u2019s second-row partnership with George Kruis, makes obvious sense.</p> <p>He has played regularly at blindside and the appointment of the World Cup-winning flanker Richard Hill \u2013 his mentor when a teenager \u2013 as England\u2019s team manager is only likely to smooth the transition, even if the man himself is none the wiser as to where he will play.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately I can\u2019t really read the mind of the coaches,\u201d says Itoje. \u201cIf I could get some Marvel-style talents then I would, but unfortunately I can\u2019t. I\u2019m not really concerned about speculation. I\u2019ve played a number of positions for Saracens and when I was growing up, so I\u2019ll play wherever the coaches pick me.</p> <p>\u201cEddie is obviously a very intelligent guy and he is very successful at what he does \u2013 he is brilliant in getting the best out of teams he has been involved in. For me he has been great, he has given me what I have needed and provided an environment where I can learn and I can test myself and where I can grow.\u201d</p> <p>It has been lamented recently that England, who have won their past 10 matches, do not face New Zealand in an autumn campaign where four victories would equal their longest winning sequence, but that does raise the tantalising prospect of Itoje locking horns with the All Blacks for the first time on the British and Irish Lions tour next summer.</p> <p>Of all the players in contention for Warren Gatland\u2019s squad, none pricks New Zealand\u2019s ears as much as Itoje. Some former Lions have even touted him as a potential captain and while Gatland\u2019s choice is likely to be more conservative, the merits of making Itoje the tour\u2019s figurehead are clear.</p> <p>Itoje, however, is staying grounded: \u201cObviously [I want to be involved] but that is so far away. A week in sport is a long time and a season is a very, very long time. So my focus is here and now. By God\u2019s grace I\u2019ll be in the squad for the autumn then hopefully be doing well for England. Those two are my real goals, they are my focus and whatever happens after that happens.\u201d</p> <p>England have not beaten South Africa \u2013 their first autumn opponents on 12&#xa0;November \u2013 since 2006 but the Springboks arrive in disarray, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/08/south-africa-new-zealand-rugby-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">thumped 57-15 by New Zealand</a> this month.

And from an England point of view that\u2019s South Africa.\u201d</p> <p>It is easy to forget that just 12 months ago, with England\u2019s World Cup squad already back at their clubs, tails between legs, Itoje had not yet made his international debut. But Jones was always swimming against the tide when trying to keep a lid on the hype in February, describing Itoje as a Vauxhall Viva rather than a BMW and questioning the lack of scars he bears.</p> <p>\u201cI like to think I am getting better. My goal is just to get better,\u201d says Itoje. \u201cI\u2019m young. Hopefully I\u2019ll have a couple more years left in the game so my goal is just to improve year on year and wherever that takes me, we\u2019ll see.\u201d Much more improving and even his classmates will start paying attention.</p> <p><em>Maro Itoje was speaking as an ambassador of Vitality.

A pesar del empuje dado por Canad\u00e1 para que se incluyera una declaraci\u00f3n acerca de los derechos de ciudadanos LGBTI, otros pa\u00edses, incluyendo Ir\u00e1n y Rusia, no permitir\u00edan tal lenguaje en la agenda final \u2013lo que condujo a una en\u00e9rgica respuesta por parte de Julian Castro, el secretario de Vivienda y Desarrollo Urbano de Estados Unidos, quien dijo que EE.UU. estaba \u201cdecepcionado, francamente, de que algunos delegados hayan descarrilado completamente las negociaciones, en lugar de incluir protecciones LGBTI\u201d.</p> <p>Otra manzana de la discordia fue lo concerniente al \u201cderecho a la ciudad\u201d \u2013 el creciente movimiento pol\u00edtico que busca consagrar la igualdad de derechos de todos los ciudadanos como el coraz\u00f3n del gobierno de una ciudad. Ecuador, de hecho, fue un pionero en incorporar esta idea en su Constituci\u00f3n, pero otros estados miembros de la ONU, incluyendo Estados Unidos, estaban insatisfechos con cualquier cosa que fuera m\u00e1s que una referencia al paso.<br></p> <p>A pesar de estas diferencias, la palabra \u201cinclusivo\u201d aparece no menos de 36 veces en el documento final de la Nueva Agenda Urbana.<br></p> <p>\u201c<strong>Ciudad de protesta\u201d</strong><br></p> <p>Uno de los grupos clave del movimiento Resistencia H\u00e1bitat III es el comit\u00e9 de residentes del barrio Bola\u00f1os, el precario barrio en las escarpadas laderas de la quebrada del r\u00edo Mach\u00e1ngara.

Coronando el vecindario est\u00e1 la autopista Interoc\u00e9anica, que desemboca en el t\u00fanel Oswaldo Guayasam\u00edn, el cual la conecta con una zona central de la ciudad.

Para una ciudad en apariencia entusiasta de la sostenibilidad, el proyecto tiene sorprendentemente un enfoque del urbanismo muy de los a\u00f1os sesenta, basado en el coche.</p> <p>Con la nueva infraestructura, se ha considerado que es muy riesgoso para los residentes de Bola\u00f1os permanecer en el barrio (el puente pasar\u00eda sobre las casas). En consecuencia, el gobierno local los est\u00e1 alentando a abandonar sus hogares \u2013 y si no obedecen, desalojos forzados podr\u00edan tener lugar.<br></p> <p>\u201cEl barrio no est\u00e1 a la venta. Si ellos quieren que nos movamos, tendr\u00e1n que esperar a que estemos muertos\u201d, declara la residente del barrio Mar\u00eda Luisa Achig, quien lleva un sombrero para protegerse del sol intenso y est\u00e1 posada en un volado rocoso que se asoma sobre el valle. \u201cEste barrio fue fundado por nuestros ancestros.

El desplazamiento, la comunidad y los derechos a la vivienda son asuntos que nos afectan a todos en Quito. Tenemos que tomar una posici\u00f3n juntos\u201d.</p> <p>En un s\u00e1bado de mediados de octubre, los habitantes de Bola\u00f1os trabajan juntos para destapar lo que ellos creen que es un antiguo camino en la ladera junto a su comunidad. Cerca de donde est\u00e1n, explican, hab\u00eda dos fuertes militares incas \u2013 y ellos est\u00e1n convencidos de que las piedras que han encontrado bajo la vegetaci\u00f3n y la tierra son parte del camino que los conectaba. \u201cEsta era la entrada a Quito desde la Amazon\u00eda\u201d, explica uno de los vecinos.<br></p> <p>El camino es particularmente simb\u00f3lico para los residentes, ya que la ruta que los conectaba a comunidades vecinas fue destruida, en la d\u00e9cada de los setenta, con la construcci\u00f3n de la autopista Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, una de las principales v\u00edas que conecta el centro de la ciudad con sus alrededores. Ahora, ellos sienten nuevamente que un proyecto de infraestructura amenaza su barrio.<br></p> <p>Desde luego, si los residentes logran probar que est\u00e1n sobre una ruta inca genuina, eso ser\u00eda un argumento fuerte para impedir que el proyecto siga adelante. \u201cNo creo que vayan a encontrar ruinas antiguas\u201d, sugiere Izurieta, quien cree que el proyecto es innecesario y que solo empeorar\u00e1 la congesti\u00f3n vehicular, \u201cpero si lo hacen, lo cambiar\u00eda todo\u201d.<br></p> <p>La limpieza colectiva de estas supuestas rutas antiguas es un ejemplo de \u201cminga\u201d, una particular tradici\u00f3n andina en la que la comunidad se re\u00fane en un d\u00eda determinado para hacer mejoras a su vecindario \u2013 todo, desde limpiar y plantar flores hasta construir nueva infraestructura. \u201cYo lo llamo placemaking nativo ecuatoriano\u201d, dice Izurieta, quien est\u00e1 llevando la idea a un barrio m\u00e1s central de la capital.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c65b9636e9b253d1b540eb1ee35b3082e4d74df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c65b9636e9b253d1b540eb1ee35b3082e4d74df/0_230_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Los residentes de Bola\u00f1os retiran vegetaci\u00f3n como parte de la minga.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Los residentes de Bola\u00f1os retiran vegetaci\u00f3n como parte de la minga.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Perry</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aunque las mingas tradicionalmente se llevan a cabo en partes m\u00e1s pobres de las ciudades, Izurieta cree que es un modelo que puede transformar comunidades alrededor de Quito y en otras ciudades. Actualmente, \u00e9l es parte del proyecto OPUS La Mariscal, en uno de los barrios centrales de Quito, el cual est\u00e1 lleno de bares, restaurantes y vida nocturna. El \u00e1rea alguna vez fue considerada peligrosa, pero ahora es la \u201czona rosa\u201d de la ciudad. Como resultado de esto, no muchas personas viven ah\u00ed. </p> <p>\u201cQueremos hacer que La Mariscal vuelva a ser un distrito residencial\u201d, explica. El proyecto involucra trabajar con negocios locales y con algunos residentes para mejorar el \u00e1mbito p\u00fablico, arreglar el pavimento, plantar \u00e1rboles, restaurar casas e, incluso, crear granjas urbanas. \u201cTodo se hace mediante el proceso de \u2018minga\u2019\u201d, dice Izurieta. \u201cTodo el mundo es voluntario y ama estar involucrado, pero al Municipio no le gusta \u2013 lo ven como competencia\u201d.<br></p> <p>Sentirse amenazado por la \u201cminga\u201d se siente il\u00f3gico cuando las mejoras en los barrios populares tienen el potencial de quitar la presi\u00f3n a las autoridades municipales que ya est\u00e1n complicadas financieramente. Izurieta cree que la idea de la \u201cminga\u201d es un modelo urbano positivo que Quito deber\u00eda compartir con el mundo durante H\u00e1bitat III.<br></p> <p>\u201cEsto podr\u00eda ayudar a ciudades en todas partes\u201d, dice. \u201cFortalece las relaciones comunitarias y trae una transformaci\u00f3n positiva a los barrios.

  "<p>The EU may be agreed on its response to Britain\u2019s vote to leave, but on one key question it remains divided: is Brexit masculine or feminine?</p> <p>In French, Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union is known as <em>le Brexit, </em>either \u2013 although the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise has yet to rule on the question \u2013 because new words in French are almost invariably masculine, or because <a href=\"http://www.languageguide.org/french/grammar/gender/mep1.html\">nouns ending in \u201ct\u201d</a> mostly are (with a few exceptions: <em>la nuit, la for\u00eat, la plupart</em>).</p> <p>Germany, also, appears to have pretty much decided that <em>der </em><em>Brexit </em>is a male thing. This might seem odd <a href=\"https://jakubmarian.com/how-to-recognize-gender-in-german-using-endings/\">since several German nouns ending in \u201cit\u201d</a> (<em>das Fazit</em>, meaning conclusion, <em>das Dynamit</em>, dynamite) are neither masculine nor feminine, but neuter.</p> <p>But as any German learner knows, what makes a noun feminine, masculine or neuter in German is somewhat less clear than in Latin languages. <em>Der</em><em> Brexit </em>may be inspired \u2013 perhaps unwisely \u2013 by the equally masculine <em>der Profit, </em>or more likely by the fact that the German word for exit, <em>der Austritt</em>, is masculine.</p> <p>Spain, too, has plumped for <em>el Brexit, </em>like most English loan words that become masculine by default in Spanish. That\u2019s because they rarely end in \u201co\u201d (generally masculine) or \u201ca\u201d (generally feminine) like most Spanish nouns, and given the choice, Spain, being a Latin country, opts for male.</p> <p>Italy, for the time being at least, is resisting the trend \u2013 and its language police, the Accademia della Crusca, <a href=\"http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/it/lingua-italiana/consulenza-linguistica/domande-risposte/genere-brexit\">has published a fabulously lengthy explanation as to why</a>. Debating whether Italians should say plain <em>Brexit </em>(without a preceding article), <em>il Brexit</em> or <em>la Brexit, </em>the academy finds firmly in favour of the last.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems preferable to make <em>Brexit</em> feminine,\u201d it said, \u201csince etymologically, the component <em>exit</em> has a corresponding Italian noun, \u2018<em>uscita</em>\u2019\u201d, which is feminine. Moreover, it adds, use of a preceding article would be in line with other loan words describing \u201creal or hypothetical events ... indicating complex scenarios\u201d, such as <em>la perestrojka </em>and <em>il global warming.</em></p> <p>As with most things in Europe, France and Germany, once agreed, are likely to end up on the winning side in the Brexit gender war, as the former Labour Europe minister Denis MacShane observed in a tweet. Britain, for its part, will doubtless hope for more disunity once the real Brexit battle starts. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DenisMacShane/status/788664928429281280\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Breaking.

  "<p>When Theresa May was home secretary she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/10/immigration-bill-theresa-may-hostile-environment\" title=\"\">boasted proudly</a> about creating a hostile environment for migrants. As some of the unaccompanied children who have been living in the Calais refugee camp arrive in the UK this week that <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3850840/Third-batch-child-migrants-begin-journey-Calais-Jungle-UK-Home-Office-admit-two-thirds-past-children-lied-age-officials.html\" title=\"\">hostile environment</a> has been very much in evidence. Most notably, there have been claims that some of these children are \u201cfaking it\u201d. It\u2019s been strongly suggested that they are really adults posing as children to sneakily take advantage of the UK\u2019s gullibility, kindness and generosity towards outsiders, and should have to undergo dental checks to determine their age. The hostility has also spread to those who dare support these children publicly. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/37633342/lily-allens-been-trolled-after-visiting-a-migrant-camp-in-calais\" title=\"\">Lily Allen was heavily trolled</a> when she visited the Calais camp to show her support for those living there in appalling conditions. And now <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/gary-lineker-faces-torrent-abuse-9073112\" title=\"\">Gary Lineker has been deluged with abuse on Twitter</a> for expressing similar support for the children arriving from Calais this week.</p> <p>The Home Office is not known for being a soft touch when it comes to asylum seekers and it has stated clearly that any child brought to the UK must have provided clear and credible documentary evidence proving their claimed age.</p> <p>It\u2019s also worth noting that those who criticise the youngsters who have arrived so far this week \u2013 poring over their facial features for evidence of deceit regarding their age \u2013 have omitted to mention the scores of children who have been wrongly detained in adult immigration removal centres over the years.</p> <p>For children who have witnessed and sometimes experienced atrocities in their home countries and who leave family behind to embark on hazardous journeys to safety, being locked up with adults in conditions equivalent to a category B prison when they reach the UK really is the last straw. The experience compounds their trauma.</p> <p>The Refugee Council works closely with unaccompanied child asylum seekers and closely monitors these unlawful detentions. <a href=\"http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/assets/0002/5945/Not_a_minor_offence_2012.pdf\" title=\"\">Their records show</a> that from the start of October 2014 to the end of December 2015 they received 37 referrals of age-disputed young people who were being treated as adults and detained on the basis of the Home Office policy that their physical appearance and demeanour strongly suggested they were significantly over 18. Of these 37 referrals, the Refugee Council supported 25 of the young people. Of these 25 young people, 13 have been assessed and accepted as a child by a local authority. Seven have been released into the care of the local authority pending assessment, but absconded. Two were assessed to be adult. One was removed from the country before action was concluded. Two are being looked after as children pending the outcome of court proceedings.</p> <p>From the start of January to the end of March this year, the Refugee Council received seven referrals of age disputed young people in detention, and supported six of them. Five of these have already been accepted as children and are in the care of the local authority, while one young person is in the care of the local authority pending the outcome of further assessment.</p> <p>They received 11 such referrals between April and July this year, and of the 10 they supported, two have already been accepted as children, seven are in the care of the local authority being treated as a child pending assessment, and one is still in detention but is due to be released imminently.</p> <p>In 2012 it was reported that the Home Office had to pay out \u00a32m in the case of 40 child asylum seekers who were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/17/council-asylum-seeker-children-classed-adults\" title=\"\">wrongly detained as adults</a> - <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/feb/17/home-office-payout-child-asylum-seekers\" title=\"\">compensation of more than \u00a31m</a>, plus \u00a31m costs. Girls and boys \u2013 including 25 who were aged 14 to 16 \u2013 from countries including Afghanistan, Iran, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, Eritrea, Uganda, Somalia and China, were involved in the case.</p> <p>The youngest was a 14-year-old girl from Sri Lanka. Some were survivors of torture in their home countries and some of the girls were survivors of rape and other forms of sexual violence.</p> <p>Among the 40 were some who had already been assessed by social services and declared to be children.

Things happen, but things happen and you follow ... your heart is too dramatic, but you follow. I didn't become a commercially successful artist by design, and actually I think that commercially successful just means, if you analyse it, that a lot of people like you. It's become a dirty word, and I don't necessarily think it needs to be. I can sense that maybe this person feels that I sold out somewhere, and at no point in my life do I think I sold out. Because to me, if you're a songwriter, who says that writing a song like Against All Odds is not the thing you should do. To me, you write what comes out. My affair with Disney, I'm sure had people thinking: this is kids' music. It's not - it's a push when it comes to being a writer, to try and do this particular job, and I just figured if I'm going to call myself a songwriter throughout my life, then writing for most genres of music is something I should at least attempt.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88ZQCLMAuUY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/88ZQCLMAuUY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Fusion/jazz \u2026 listen to Brand X, with Phil Collins</figcaption> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T13:08:17.180Z\">at 2.08pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58076e18e4b005f21833b081\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T13:01:06.128Z\">2.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3255895\">StewGregg</a> says:</p> <p><em>As someone who\u2019s followed your career for decades I was always struck, that even at the height of your success, you seemed to find it difficult to accept the huge affection that so many people clearly had for you and your music, and instead seemed unduly concerned with winning over the people who didn\u2019t like what you did.

I would say that I always prided myself on playing whatever was right for the song. And as the songs got a little simpler, I think therefore so did my drumming. When you're young you want to show people what you can do, no matter what the cost. Whereas when you're older, and you realise that maybe a drum machine is better than you playing, then use the drum machine. As a composer I approached the drums differently than a non-composing drummer. I embraced drum machines. Drummers get bored. You tell them to play something simple, and it gets more complicated as they do it. If they're not a composer, if they don't have any kind of investment in the music, they'll just add a bit there and another bit there, and you think no! Don't do that. So you end up using a drum machine. There's no drummer I know that would play the first four or five minutes of In The Air Tonight without putting something in. It's a hypnotic thing a drum machine can create, an atmosphere; then you paint extra colours with live drums.</p> <p>Why did I like simpler songs? Just times change. This is one of the repeated things I hear: even though people will read different kinds of books, they don't read Lord of the Rings when they're 30 even though they did at 15. People don't wear the same kind of clothes. And yet we're supposed to play the same kind of music as we did in the 70s. It's not changing for commercial success, it's changing because that's the way we are as people.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58076bdbe4b0cd26ff71eb4b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T12:50:54.447Z\">1.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">American Psycho</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12383943\"><br>Jackman87</a> asks:</p> <p><em>How did you feel about your music being <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmTyizVfCng&amp;oref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DpmTyizVfCng&amp;has_verified=1\">referenced heavily in American Psycho</a>?</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/live/2016/oct/17/phil-collins-webchat-not-dead-yet-the-singles#comment-85770468\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16846292\" title=\"View Ph1lCollins\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/16846292\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Ph1lCollins\"> </a> <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16846292\" title=\"View Ph1lCollins\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Ph1lCollins</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/85770468\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">19 October 2016 1:47pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Flattered!

He was eventually allowed into the country, but his detention <a href=\"http://canadians.org/media/jose-bove-allowed-stay-canada\" title=\"\">prevented him speaking</a> at the event. It seems that for the architects of trade deals freedom of movement for goods and services comes ahead of freedom of expression.</p> <p>The politicians and corporations might feel they can silence voices but it is harder to ignore votes. And on this, a regional Belgian parliament has delivered a <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/belgian-regional-government-set-to-block-eu-canada-trade-deal/\" title=\"\">potentially fatal blow</a>. The federation of Wallonia-Brussels parliament, which focuses on the cultural and educational concerns of 4.5 million French-speakers in Belgium, recently voted to reject CETA because of worries about public services and agriculture. Under Belgium\u2019s constitution, all five regional governments must approve the trade deal before the federal government can give consent. And for CETA to be agreed, unanimous support is needed from all 28 EU countries.</p> <p>The centrist, grey politicians who have mindlessly repeated the mantra of growth-and-trade for decades have become aware that those whose votes they periodically require no longer see these deals as working for them. With tens of thousands of European citizens once again <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37396796\" title=\"\">taking to the streets in protest</a> against these trade deals, European negotiators are fighting a losing battle.</p> <p>All those who have campaigned against TTIP and CETA should take great credit. Despite the power of the corporations that were set to gain massively from the deals, the grassroots movement of people from across the EU, US and Canada have used their democratic rights to protest and to lobby to challenge their might.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>While we should celebrate a victory for people power, we must also recognise that this is just the start of the fight</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While we should celebrate a victory for people power, we must also recognise that this is just the start of the fight. For the UK, either inside or outside the EU, the potential for these damaging trade deals to proliferate remains. Some argued, particularly those \u201cleavers\u201d on the left, that exiting the EU would free us from having to sign up to damaging trade agreements. But actually, it looks as though it is Europe that could save us from these dodgy deals, while the Conservative government, fearing the risk of isolation and desperate for trade deals at any price, will lead us in a race to the bottom. The risk of isolation following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">Brexit vote </a>may encourage them to sign us up to even more damaging bilateral agreements than those on offer to the EU.</p> <p>Globalisation has brought us marvels including the internet and ease of international travel, but the power in this new paradigm has so far been held by corporations that exploit their ability to transcend national boundaries. Perhaps the rejection of the global trade treaties that we Greens have always dismissed as corporate power grabs might mark the beginning of the popular fight to unshackle ourselves from the chains of corporate power. With so much of the energy of the anti-TTIP fight coming from the UK, what a tragic irony it would be if we found ourselves leaping out of the TTIP and CETA frying-pan and into the fire of whatever pro-corporate trade deals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/30/liam-fox-cabinet-speeches-trade\" title=\"\">Liam Fox</a> has in mind for us.</p>",

The UK received a total of 3,695 applications from Eritreans in 2015, approximately one-third of which (1,319) were granted.</p> <p>In the judgment this month, the upper tribunal (immigration and asylum) issued a new country guidance case on Eritrea, which determined that Eritreans of or approaching the draft age of 18, who had evaded national service, deserted, or were likely to be suspected of doing so, faced a \u201creal risk of persecution or serious harm\u201d if sent back. The tribunal rejected the argument, set out in existing Home Office guidance, that Eritreans could return safely by signing a letter of apology and paying a \u201cdiaspora tax\u201d.</p> <p>The country guidance ruling, where the tribunal lays down the approach other judges should take, was welcomed by MPs, human rights groups and immigration lawyers.</p> <p>Stuart McDonald, a member of the home affairs select committee, said he hoped it would force the government to correct its guidance on Eritrean asylum seekers. The delay in doing so was \u201cinexcusable\u201d, he said.</p> <p>McDonald, the Scottish National party\u2019s spokesman on asylum and immigration, said: \u201cThe determination is a welcome one.

It\u2019s vital that the Home Office now focuses on protecting Eritreans who\u2019ve fled here in fear of their lives rather than putting them at further risk.\u201d</p> <p>Colin Yeo, a barrister at Garden Court chambers who specialises in immigration, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a massively wasteful and rather political decision by the Home Office. It is not only wasteful of Home Office funds but tribunal funds and legal aid funds as well as really stressful for applicants.\u201d</p> <p>Elizabeth Chyrum, director of Human Rights Concern Eritrea, said: \u201cIn short, the tribunal decided that it could not rely on Home Office policy \u2026 and that other evidence, including that provided by the UN commission of inquiry, provided a much more accurate assessment of political conditions in Eritrea.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/hundreds-of-eritrea-asylum-applications-still-incorrectly-refused\">Hundreds of Eritreans' asylum applications still 'incorrectly refused'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The upper tribunal case was brought on behalf of three Eritreans and centred around a heavily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/10/britain-refusing-asylum-eritreans-discredited-report\">criticised report by the Danish Immigration Service</a>, which was used to determine asylum applications in Denmark. The Home Office updated its country guidance for Eritrea in March 2015, based on the Danish report, advising that Eritreans are no longer at risk of persecution if they return home after leaving the country without official permission. The guidance is used by UK immigration officials to determine the legitimacy of asylum applications.</p> <p>In its ruling, the tribunal appeared to suggest that not only would a letter of apology not establish a safe return, but that it could expose individuals to potential danger. Such a letter amounted to \u201ca confession of guilt by the person who signs it\u201d, stated the ruling, exposing returnees to what the regime might deem \u201cappropriate punishment\u201d.</p> <p>The tribunal said: \u201cWe do not accept that the evidence goes anywhere close to establishing the payment of tax and the signing of the letter would enable draft evaders and deserters to reconcile with the Eritrean authorities.\u201d</p> <p>The case, brought by three Eritrean asylum seekers, centred on the Danish fact-finding mission on which the report was based, which has been criticised as misleading and inaccurate by the <a href=\"http://www.ft.dk/samling/20141/almdel/uui/bilag/41/1435206.pdf\">UN High Commissioner for Refugees</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/12/17/denmark-eritrea-immigration-report-deeply-flawed\">Human Rights Watch</a> and others.</p> <p>The ruling accepted that criticisms of the mission were \u201cwell made\u201d.</p> <p>Tasaddat Hussain, of Broadway House chambers, part of a legal team that represented two of the Eritreans in the case, said: \u201cIt appears that the outcome of the case is in line with what international opinion says: that nothing has changed in Eritrea.\u201d<br></p> <p>The ruling, which was seen by the Guardian, as well as those asked to comment on it, has now been removed from the upper tribunal\u2019s website without explanation.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe have noted the court\u2019s ruling and will be updating the country guidance accordingly.<br></p> <p>\u201cAll country information and guidance is based on a careful and objective assessment of available evidence from a range of sources including media outlets, local, national and international organisations, and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this month, the Home Office removed country guidance on Eritrea from its website. </p>",

Clinton has talked about installing half a billion solar panels, halting oil drilling in the Arctic and, in sobering evidence of this election\u2019s debasement, proudly told the Democratic national convention: \u201cI believe in science.\u201d </p> \n<p>While some liberal Democrats are suspicious of Clinton\u2019s climate credentials \u2013 fears were exacerbated by recent leaked emails <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/clinton-wikileaks-update-leaked-emails-show-hillary-told-climate-change-activists-get-2432359\">that show</a> she said those who wanted to shut down fossil fuels should \u201cget a life\u201d \u2013 the former secretary of state\u2019s plan cannot be compared meaningfully with Trump\u2019s.</p> \n<p>The Republican nominee has called climate change a Chinese hoax and \u201cbullshit\u201d. He has promised to withdraw the US from the Paris climate deal, revive the coal industry while also expanding oil and gas drilling. He has darkly hinted at scrapping the Environmental Protection Agency and resurrecting the controversial Keystone oil pipeline. </p> \n<p>\u201cI wish there was a proper battle of ideas that we could judge accordingly,\u201d said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. Green groups have supported Clinton almost as a default position because she\u2019s the only major party candidate who accepts climate science. </p> \n<p>While Clinton and Trump differ on issues such as police shootings, immigration and the economy, both candidates at least accept that these things actually exist. It\u2019s tricky to have a debate on a topic that a participant doesn\u2019t think is real. </p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s denial is shared by many members of Congress, who have been lavished with $29.6m in contributions from fossil fuel companies in the 2016 election cycle, according to figures <a href=\"http://nofossilfuelmoney.org/\">compiled by ClimateTruth.org Action</a>. </p> \n<p>Regardless, here are three germane, and pressing, climate change questions that Wallace could ask: <br></p> \n<p><strong>An overwhelming majority of climate scientists say that climate change is real, caused by humans and a growing threat to our way of life.

  "<h2>Three months and counting</h2> <p>The good news - according to the World Energy Council (WEC) - is that, per person, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/10/global-demand-for-energy-will-peak-in-2030-says-world-energy-council\">our energy demand is set to peak before 2030</a>. Of course, there will be more of us around by then too, so that total demand will only slow, rather than level out. A heady whiff of technological optimism accompanies the explanation that this will happen because of \u201cunprecedented efficiencies created by new technologies and more stringent energy policies\u201d. </p> <p>The bad news is that under the scenarios drawn up by the WEC, even keeping to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-key-points\">upper target agreed in Paris of global warming no greater than 2C</a> will require an \u201cexceptional and enduring effort\u201d that goes beyond any current commitments and needs a price for coal, oil and gas that is dramatically higher. </p> <p>To sweeten this pill, the WEC gives its scenarios names which must appear funky in the world of energy policy. \u201cModern jazz\u201d is about shiny, digitally driven markets, the slightly less enthusiastic \u201cUnfinished symphony\u201d is about emerging greener models for growth, while \u201cHard rock\u201d is a future of both low and grubby growth.</p> <p>The problem with these and many other scenarios that emerge in the mainstream, is the intellectual editing that occurs before they even begin. Most share two overwhelming, linked characteristics that strictly limit any subsequent room for manoeuvre. Firstly the demand for energy itself is seen as something innate, unchallengeable and unmanageable. It must be met, and the only question is how. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Secondly, the assumption remains that the principles and practices of the economic model that has dominated for the last 30 years will remain for at least the next 30 years. There is no sign yet of the ferocious challenge to neoliberal orthodoxy happening at the margins of economics shaping mainstream visions of our possible futures. The merest glance at the history of changing ideas suggests this is short-sighted.</p> <p>There are reasons why we need to get a move on with tackling energy demand. Extreme weather events abound. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-37625055\">Record flooding</a> in North Carolina in the United States follows record flooding in <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/news/usgs-records-historic-flooding-south-louisiana\">Louisiana</a> earlier in the year. While no individual event can be described a direct cause and effect relationship, increasingly heavy rainfall and flood events are <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/17/baton-rouge-floods-broke-a-record-many-thought-would-never-be-broken.html\">consistent with climate models</a> for a warming world.</p> <p>It\u2019s nearly a year on from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/05/december-2015-was-wettest-month-ever-recorded-in-uk\">wettest UK December</a> on record in 2015. Subsequently, work by the World Weather Attribution project estimated that the <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-how-scientists-link-extreme-weather-to-climate-change\">odds for that rainfall event</a> were increased by 50-75% by climate change. </p> <p>Now, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37565462\">insurers in the UK</a> complain that householders are failing to protect their properties from flooding, while the Environment Agency says that insurers preside over a system in which risk is simply rebuilt where flooding has already taken place. The Climate Change Committee says the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-37632620\">UK is off track</a> to meet its mid-century carbon reduction target, just as key decisions on aviation expansion and fracking look set to lock in emissions-intensive infrastructure. </p> <p>Scenarios for industrial transition are needed that tell a bolder and more convincing tale, not just of the UK meeting its international obligations that are written into treaties, but that go further and stand a genuine chance of limiting warming to 2C.</p> <p>What sort of scenarios should we be looking at then? We can learn from the impoverished Brexit debate that was marred by binary choices cloaked in wilful misinformation. For the whole population to fully understand our options, and the choices and challenges embedded in them, we should be thinking as openly and broadly as possible. We can look at how far techno-fixes will get us, and at the maximum speed and scale of change that market mechanisms and the pricing of carbon are likely to deliver. In both, the different impacts on rich and poor need assessing. </p> <p>But we should go further to assess the pros and cons of radical scenarios for changing how we live and work.</p> <p>Rarely considered but important variables come from new economics, including the shorter working week, the share economy, shifts in corporate ownership and governance, and intelligent but deliberate measures for economic localisation. Compare these to the \u201cstumble on\u201d, or business as usual scenario, in which we give up control of our future to a permanently destabilised climate change, but also assess seriously the consequences of the argument for planned so-called \u201cde-growth\u201d of the economy.</p> <p>At the height of the 2008 financial crisis, the UK government promised to <a href=\"http://www.ukpol.co.uk/2015/10/02/gordon-brown-2008-speech-on-the-global-economy-at-reuters/\">\u201cgo beyond the conventional thinking</a>\u201d to put things right. It never did, but with the climate crisis there is no choice. Conventional thinking is off-course and contradictory.</p> <p>Without a balanced, comparative assessment of strategies to align energy use and industry with inescapable climate action, we won\u2019t be able to choose the best possible future. I\u2019m glad to say that work like this is beginning to happen at places such as the University of Leeds\u2019 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://ciemap.leeds.ac.uk/\">centre for industrial energy, materials and products</a>. It\u2019s going to mean telling better stories of change, rewriting rules and breaking ideological chains all around, but hey, that\u2019s jazz \u2026</p>",

  "<h2>1 | Make sure that girls know the truth about their periods</h2> <p>The lack of accurate health education available to young girls perpetuates destructive myths about menstruation, such as being unclean and that they are unable to pray or cook food during their period. When girls understand how their bodies work, and why they menstruate, they can better understand how to keep themselves safe. <em>Sabrina Rubli, executive director, <a href=\"http://www.femmeinternational.org/\">Femme International</a>, Moshi, Tanzania, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sabrinarubli\">@sabrinarubli</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FemmeInt\">@FemmeInt</a></em></p> <h2>2 | Teach it right</h2> <p>Although menstruation may be included in school curriculum our experience shows that there are a number of challenges. One is that teachers are not confident to teach the topic and therefore sometimes tell the class just to read the section themselves. Also, the topic is often not taught early enough. So we also need to have age-appropriate teaching materials that can be shared with girls before they start menstruation. <em>Therese Mahon, regional programme manager South Asia, <a href=\"http://www.wateraid.org/uk\">WaterAid</a>, London, UK, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/WaterAidUK\">@WaterAidUK</a></em></p> <h2>3 | Fund sanitary supplies in school </h2> <p>Kenya had a successful large scale programme that offered grants to schools. The use of the grant was determined through surveys asking children what their most pressing needs were to help them stay in school. Many girls said access to sanitary pads was a major problem for them, and as a result some schools began to purchase and store these for girls, and other schools set up clubs to make reusable pads. The combination of the decisions being taken at the school level in response to what girls said their needs were, plus commitment from the ministry of education to scale up, is powerful. <em>Louise Banham, senior education adviser, <a href=\"http://www.globalpartnership.org/\">Global Partnership for Education</a>, Washington DC, US, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/GPforEducation\">@GPforEducation</a></em></p> <h2>4 | Engage religious leaders to challenge myths</h2> <p>We have noticed the positive role that faith leaders can make in challenging cultural taboos. As they are well versed in the written scriptures, they have helped counteract the conflation of cultural attitudes and religious practices. Islam is misused to promote misperceptions. We aim to clarify the Islamic perspective, and to help eradicate these cultural attitudes; allowing women to feel more comfortable during their cycle. <em>Terri Harris, Africa programmes officer, <a href=\"https://www.globalone.org.uk/\">Global One</a>, London, UK, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GlobalOne_NGO\">@GlobalOne_NGO</a></em></p> <h2>5 | Give girls their own space</h2> <p>WSSCC [UN\u2019s Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council] uses a tent to create a safe and private space for girls and women to talk about menstruation and learn about safe ways to manage it.

The entire programme is youth-led meaning young boys and girls deliver the programme. We use games, campaigns and audio visuals to deliver the message. We have found that our interventions have contributed significantly in de-stigmatising menstruation within families and girls have been allowed to worship and also do their routine work, which wasn\u2019t the case before. <em>Franklin Paul Anand, monitoring, evaluation and research manager, <a href=\"http://restlessdevelopment.org/\">Restless Development</a>, New Delhi, India, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/franklinpaul_\">@FranklinPaul_</a></em></p> <h2>7 | Sanitation and sanitary pads must be provided side-by-side</h2> <p>A shocking side effect the ministry of health has been experiencing in providing free sanitary pads in Kenya is the loss of their sanitation facilities. Many schools do not have access to proper waste disposal systems. Soon after disposable sanitary pads were introduced to schools, pit latrines of the girls toilets were filling up. This forced students to defecate in public, causing more harm than good. They are now looking into providing more sustainable solutions like reusable sanitary towels to overcome this problem. Disposing of sanitary towels is key in creating safe, hygienic and sustainable toilets for girls. <em>Sophia Grinvalds, founder, <a href=\"http://www.afripads.com/\">AfriPads</a>, Kampala, Uganda, <a href=\"http://www.afripads.com/blog/\">@afripads</a></em></p> <h2>8 | Use data to persuade governments to provide girls toilets</h2> <p>Sharing evidence with government or other stakeholders about the effects of poor menstrual health is vital. Data supported by personal stories and images of what it is like for a girl to attend school with inadequate sanitation facilities. Also, we learned from research we conducted on menstrual management and sanitation systems in South Africa and India how important, yet how often it\u2019s neglected, to involve girls\u2019 and women\u2019s voices in planning the sanitation facility. <em>Nancy Muller, senior programme officer, <a href=\"http://www.path.org/\">Path</a>, Seattle, US, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/PATHtweets\">@pathtweets</a></em></p> <h2>9 | Let girls design their own toilets </h2> <p>Girls should also be able to feed into the design of the toilets. Whether it\u2019s cubicle size, availability/placement of water, a private area for washing and drying pads. They know what the challenges of no, or badly designed, toilets are and what their specific needs are. <em>Mimi Coultas, adviser for programmes, <a href=\"https://plan-uk.org/\">Plan International UK</a>, London, UK<br></em></p> <h2>10 | Do more research on this neglected area</h2> <p>Research on this topic is new and quite sparse. We recently conducted a systematic review of trials across low and middle income countries testing the effectiveness of different interventions to address the barrier menstruation presents to school attendance. We found only eight trials that had been conducted with mixed evidence for the effectiveness of providing puberty education and different types of menstrual absorbents. <em>Julie Hennegan, doctoral candidate, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/julie_hennegan\">@julie_hennegan</a></em></p> <h2>11 | Get it right and there can be a positive effect throughout girls\u2019 lives</h2> <p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menarche\">Menarche</a> is an important window in a girl\u2019s life and the attitudes and information she encounters during this time will shape her understanding of her own body long term. Without the right support she is poorly equipped to make good choices about sex, relationships and reproductive health throughout her life.

  "<p>Scientists are investigating the mysterious deaths of at least 10,000 endangered frogs, in a river which leads into South America\u2019s most famous lake on Peru\u2019s border with Bolivia.<br></p> <p>The dead Titicaca water frogs were found along a 50km (30 mile) stretch of the Coata river, a tributary which flows into the 8,372 sq km Lake Titicaca, <a href=\"http://www.serfor.gob.pe/noticias/negocios-sostenibles/serfor-evalua-muerte-de-mas-de-10-mil-ranas-en-rio-coata-en-puno\">according to Peru\u2019s wildlife and forestry service Serfor</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Researchers are trying to find out what killed the amphibians in such numbers. The Titicaca water frog (<em>Telmatobius culeus</em>) is <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/57334/0\">listed as critically endangered</a> by the IUCN red list on threatened species, and is endemic to the lake.</p> <p>The world\u2019s largest aquatic frog, weighing up to two pounds, has large folds of skin, which give it a wrinkly appearance \u2013 it is jokingly referred to as the Titicaca scrotum frog. The skin increases its surface area so the amphibian can absorb more oxygen. </p> <p>Roberto Elias, Peru programme manager for US-based Denver Zoo, who has been studying the frog since 2010, said only toxins could have caused such \u201chigh mortality so quickly\u201d. </p> <p>Previous studies had shown high levels of heavy metals in the lake caused by mining tailings from both formal operations and illegal gold mining in surrounding rivers, he said. They include lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, iron and zinc.</p> <p>\u201cVillagers had been cleaning garbage from the river which may have disturbed the sediments,\u201d Elias added, although he stressed post-mortem studies on the frogs had not yet been completed.</p> <p>Other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/12/urban-population-boom-lake-titicaca\">pollution factors are raw sewage</a> due to a lack of sewage treatment plants and pesticides from agriculture surrounding the world\u2019s highest navigable lake, he said.</p> <p>Local anti-pollution campaigner Maruja Inquilla Sucasaca, took 100 dead frogs to the main square in the regional capital Puno, to draw the situation to the attention of the authorities.</p> <p>\u201cNo one took the pollution problem seriously until I showed them the dead frogs,\u201d she told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cLake Titicaca used to be a paradise, now we can\u2019t use the water and our livestock die if they drink it,\u201d said Inquilla, who is vice president of the local committee against the contamination of the Coata river. </p> <p>\u201cUntreated sewage is being pumped into the lake from the big towns and the authorities don\u2019t care,\u201d she said crying with frustration.</p> <p>Last October Inquilla accused the mayor of the Coata district of delaying a plant to treat the river water contaminated by sewage emitted by the region\u2019s most populous city, Juliaca. </p> <p>Pollution is not the only threat to the endangered frog. They are also hunted and eaten in regional dishes or transported to Lima and other cities as part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/28/wildlife-butchers-of-belen-peru-town-that-serves-up-rare-species-for-a-few-dollars\">Peru\u2019s illicit wildlife trade</a> because they are believed to have aphrodisiac properties.</p> <p>The IUCN red list says the frog has declined in numbers by more than 80% over the last three generations, due to over-exploitation, habitat degradation and invasive species. </p> <p>Trout, which is not native to the lake, have been introduced and eat the frog\u2019s eggs and tadpoles, says Elias.</p> <p>\u201cThe threat is much higher and the examples of the species we find are much smaller. If this trend continues they could disappear,\u201d he added. </p>",
  "<p>This week in Quito as many as 45,000 people have gathered for Habitat III, the global UN summit which, every 20 years, resets the world\u2019s urban agenda. </p> <p>Why should we care? Well, to start with, in the next 20 years, we will witness more than two billion more people moving to cities. Depending on what we do to accommodate them, this could be good \u2013 or very bad \u2013 news. </p> <p>It\u2019s good news because people are demonstrably better off in cities than outside them. For the poor, cities are efficient vehicles to satisfy basic needs. Having people in a concentrated space makes the implementation of public policies more effective (think of access to sanitation, and the consequences for reducing child mortality and epidemic disease).</p> <p>For the middle class, meanwhile, cities are a concentration of opportunities for jobs, education, healthcare and even recreation. They offer the promise of social mobility. And for a certain elite, cities are a powerful vehicle to create wealth; their critical mass generates the appropriate environment for knowledge creation and prosperity in the broadest sense of the word. </p> <p>In short, cities are like magnets, with the potential to take care of everything from the most basic needs to the most intangible desires.</p> <p>Now for the bad news, which we could call the \u201c3S menace\u201d. The scale and speed of this global urbanisation, and the scarcity of means with which we must respond to it, has no precedents in human history. </p> <p>Of the three billion urban dwellers today, one billion live below the poverty line. In two decades\u2019 time, five billion people will be in cities, with two billion of them below the poverty line. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"301b4af3d0a5d623f2ba809e127ebbee1af7e475\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/301b4af3d0a5d623f2ba809e127ebbee1af7e475/0_60_3000_1802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A \u2018half house\u2019 by Chilean architect Alejandro Aravena.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A \u2018half house\u2019 by Chilean architect Alejandro Aravena.

If we don\u2019t solve this equation, it\u2019s not that people will stop coming to cities; they will still come, but they will live in awful conditions.</p> <p>What\u2019s at stake here is not just poverty but inequality too. Cities express in a very concrete and direct way the distance between the haves and have-nots.</p> <p>Urban inequalities are often reflected in brutal ways \u2013 from the distance people must travel to work every day, to the lack of quality public spaces, urban amenities and civic services. No wonder so much anger and resentment is accumulated in the peripheries. </p> <p>Of course, this is problem is not exclusive to developing countries. Rich countries, despite having solved all their basic needs, experience a similar accumulation of social pressure as if it was a ticking time bomb.</p> <h2>A way to grow</h2> <p>To add one more level of complexity to the phenomenon of urbanisation, even if we do eventually find a way to build for that extra million people each week, we will go into environmental crisis, such is the carbon footprint of today\u2019s construction process. </p> <p>This would not only be a \u201cgreen\u201d problem, but a major security threat too. According to a report by the US defence department, the next conflicts, wars and terrorist threats will be triggered by climate change.</p> <p>There is a one-to-one correlation between zones of military conflict and a global map of water drought. This not only creates problems in the afflicted countries but also migrations towards less-affected areas, adding to the social pressure in the countries of destination too.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/video/2016/jun/16/built-my-own-social-housing-chile-half-houses-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4y4ey\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2542422\"            data-video-name=\"I built my own social housing: the rise of Chile's 'half-houses' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57602600e4b005ab05d20e91\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/06/15/150614HWLNChileNEW_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/06/15/150614HWLNChileNEW_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/06/15/150614HWLNChileNEW_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/06/15/150614HWLNChileNEW.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/06/15/150614HWLNChileNEW_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/video/2016/jun/16/built-my-own-social-housing-chile-half-houses-video\">I built my own social housing: the rise of Chile\u2019s \u2018half-houses\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>These are the kind of challenges that needed to be addressed at Habitat III. Fortunately, an appeal by Dr Joan Clos, the executive director of UN Habitat appointed by Ban Ki Moon to guide the event, already carries a promising approach. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/18/lost-science-building-cities-joan-clos-un-habitat\">Clos\u2019s framing of the problem</a> can be synthesised like this: we need to invert the way we view the relationship between economic development and good cities.</p> <p>The current approach is: first a country creates wealth. Once that is achieved, good cities will follow automatically, becoming a kind of passive outcome of economic development.</p> <p>Clos\u2019s task has instead been to convince the world\u2019s mayors (and development experts, and ministers of finance) that good cities can be a <em>source</em> of development, rather than the other way around. This reframing, and what results from it, can be summarised as follows \u2026</p> <p><em>Lesson 1: good cities may be the source, instead of the passive outcome, of economic development</em></p> <p>For this inversion of the paradigm to take place, however, you need three things: the right rule of law, the right financial plan and the right design. Imagine the mayor of City X in a rather poor country (which is, of course, where the majority of future urbanisation will take place). He or she may look out of their window and see an informal settlement growing by the hour.</p> <p>Regarding the rule of law: in this settlement, property rights are unclear, so the shacks that actually cost quite a bit of money cannot have a \u201cparallel life as capital\u201d, as the economist Hernando de Soto puts it. Regarding the financing: there is only one source \u2013 people\u2019s own resources. And regarding design: there is no access to sanitation, so no clean water nor sewerage system.</p> <p>There is no creation of value here, merely expense. The proportion between public and private space in such spontaneous urbanisation is invariably less than 1:10. Evidence shows that only when this ratio is close to 1:1 can one expect some value gain for residents (Manhattan is the ultimate example of this). . In such cases, each individual action not only gains individual value but also adds to the common good. In a slum, individual interventions, however well intentioned, cannot guarantee that.</p> <p><em>Lesson 2: the scarcest resource in cities is not money, but coordination</em></p> <p>There is one good side to the informality of the city growing outside the mayor\u2019s window. Since it is spontaneous, there is no <a href=\"http://www.useful-community-development.org/zoning-regulations.html\">zoning regulation</a> (a kind of fundamental truth of planning). Instead, we can expect a richly mixed fledgling city, where residential, businesses, retail services and productive activities all coexist together.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98c9eb23f1e4655eb863874dbcff163a2bf2e86b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98c9eb23f1e4655eb863874dbcff163a2bf2e86b/0_0_2362_2231/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The interior of a \u2018half house\u2019 by Aravena, before and after.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"945\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The interior of a \u2018half house\u2019 by Aravena, before and after.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tadeuz Jalocha</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Lesson 3: a certain urban intensity is desirable</em></p> <p>Now our mayor ponders: what can I do with an annual budget of just $6 per inhabitant to invest in this new city? Once again, this financial plan has only one source: a state with scarce resources. Such a limited budget may force our mayor to transform agricultural land into urban land, adding to the already underserved peripheries and expanding the sprawl.</p> <p> The mayor will likely devote only a very small area to public space (as little as 20%) so more land can be dedicated to accommodating the mass of people that are pressing to be given a house. Zoning regulations will very likely be applied, resulting in a separation of functions and a very low urban intensity. Finally, since the tight budget won\u2019t allow to build \u201cmiddle-class standard\u201d housing units, evidence shows that as much as 50% of the built environment will be self-built all the same (despite, not thanks to, the design of the units).</p> <p>Facing this adverse scenario, a private real-estate developer may approach the mayor of City X and request, say, 20 hectares of land to build a housing project. And the mayor, spotting the opportunity for someone else to take care of his housing headache, may make a counter-offer: that the project will only be approved on the condition the developer actually takes 40 hectares of land.</p> <p>Naturally the developer will agree, then proceed as usual: property rights will be secured and zoning regulations complied with, resulting in low urban intensity. The financing plan will still depend on one source \u2013 this time private capital, which will look for a two-digit return in a short period of time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The crucial point here is to secure the 'void' of the future city</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Such a miserly way of investing will dedicate as little area as possible to public space (again, as little as 20%) in order to maximise the area that can be sold. The developer may add some meandering streets to make the urban footprint more appealing, and some decoration to the tiny units. But design-wise, the contribution of the private market will be like putting lipstick on a gorilla. </p> <p>So, what to do? Perhaps the mayor of City X has come to Quito looking for clues, ideas and tips. And one could be to join up the forces of the (poor) state and the (mediocre) developer, without expecting either of them to change their nature. </p> <p>Rather than giving away a whole slab of land as a closed package, the mayor could instead partition the area the developer is asking for, then create reserves of public space between the lots: ecological corridors with a civic standard the developer would never be incentivised to deliver.</p> <p>The developer would then follow his usual model, adding a further 20% of public space \u2013 so that, overall, the project now possesses a much more liveable 40% of public space.</p> <p>For this scheme, the financial plan now has two sources: state funding, to take care of the public space and eventually some urban services too, and private funding, which looks after the urbanisation and some public space as well. Such a development will still have low urban intensity, but the higher ratio of public space may open it up to some value gain in future.</p> <p>The crucial point here is to secure the \u201cvoid\u201d of the future city. The quality of its residents\u2019 future mobility, for example, will depend on the quality of the space we reserve in between the buildings.</p> <p><em>Lesson 4: in a \u201cgood\u201d city, what is not built </em><em>is more important </em><em>than what is</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/nov/20/rethink-role-language-architecture-alejandro-aravena\">It's time to rethink the entire role and language of architecture</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An even greater disruption from the predictable, mediocre norm would be for the state and the market to join forces with people\u2019s own resources.</p> <p>To allow the inclusion of a third source in the financial plan, the design has to be an open one. The starting point would be the same as the previous one: public space reserved between the conventional real estate.

  "<p>Today, songbirds are the most successful group of birds on the planet. With more than 5000 species worldwide, they form half of the world\u2019s known bird species, and have colonised almost all corners of the world (with the exception of Antarctica). </p> <p>Songbirds, or Passeriformes, are often referred to as \u201cperching birds\u201d, which refers to the arrangement of their toes - with three toes pointing forward and one pointing backwards - which allows them to comfortably cling to trees and branches. But to the outside world, they are best known for their well-developed vocalisations. Who hasn\u2019t delighted in waking up in the middle of a summer night by birds enthusiastically welcoming the new day?</p> <p><a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/thoughts-on-the-passerine-tree-2016/\">Zoologists</a> divide modern songbirds in three groups. Oscines (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songbird\">Passeri</a>) constitute over 4000 species and can be found all over the world. Suboscines (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranni\">Tyranni</a>) are mostly found in the Neotropics, whereas the small New Zealand wrens (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_wren\">Acanthisitti</a>) are limited to, you guessed it, New Zealand.</p> <p>As abundant and widespread as songbirds are today, their fossil record is meager, especially the further we go back in time. The earliest known songbird as we know them comes from the early <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene\">Eocene</a> (approximately 54 million years ago) <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tingamarra_Fauna\">Tingamarra</a> fauna from Murgon in southeastern Queensland, Australia (Boles, 1997). The specimen consists of only two bones, a carpometacarpus and a tibiotarsus, but exhibits anatomical features that are also found within modern day songbirds. But how did this group rise from the isolated Australian continent to worldwide domination?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48d337bbfcf37a268d70a06b44fbb5d6e7bef359\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48d337bbfcf37a268d70a06b44fbb5d6e7bef359/0_0_648_459/500.jpg\" alt=\"The holotype of Wieslochia weissi, the earliest songbird of Europe, from the early Oligocene of Germany.

In the New World, passerines pop up only in the early/middle <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene\">Miocene</a> (23-15 million years ago) (Noriega &amp; Chiappe, 1994). Without further fossils, and with morphological features that vary little across the group as a whole, reconstructing how and when songbirds evolved and diversified proved daunting.</p> <p>The rise of DNA analysis provided new opportunities to study the bird evolutionary tree, and the first genetic studies with a focus on songbirds indicated a southern origin for the group, in line with the fossil evidence. Research by Ericson and colleagues (2002) showed that the endemic New Zealand wrens (Acanthisittidae) are the sister group to all other modern passerines (Oscines and Suboscines). Furthermore, they showed that Oscines that branched off relatively early, the basal Oscines, are limited to Australia and New Guinea. This would indicate that much of the early evolution of passerines took place in the southern hemisphere.</p> <p>Thus far, the available fossil and molecular evidence indicates that songbirds are indeed rooted down under, but the rest of the songbird family tree appeared to be a tangly bush. According to Ericson and colleagues, as well as others (Barker et al., 2004), the evolution of passerines was shaped by the break-up of the southern supercontinent Gondwana in the Cretaceous. Inferences based on DNA mutation rates put the split between Oscines and Suboscines around 77-80 million years ago (Van Tuinen &amp; Hedges, 2001; Ericson et al., 2002), right around the time when Australia (and possibly New Zealand as well) began to separate from Antarctica. </p> <p>Suboscines subsequently colonised the New World from western Gondwana, whereas Oscines and New Zealand wrens headed east. However, the Gondwanan scenario has been scrutinised. Although there is putative evidence for the presence of modern-type birds (Neornithes) in the late Cretaceous, there is no fossil evidence at all for songbirds over the dinosaurs\u2019 heads. (that\u2019s not to say that Cretaceous birds were quiet; scientists have found a 66 million year old specimen of <em tabindex=\"-1\">Vegavis iaai,</em> an early relative of ducks and geese, with a functional syrinx).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/12/oldest-fossil-of-birds-voicebox-gives-new-hint-at-soundscape-of-the-cretaceous-syrinx\">Oldest fossil of bird's voicebox gives new hint at soundscape of the Cretaceous</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More recent genetic analyses (for example J\u00f8nsson et al., 2011) identified several lineages of Oscines, including the Corvides (crows and allies), that underwent rapid diversification in the late Eocene/early Oligocene. J\u00f8nsson and his team linked these radiations to the emergence of \u201cproto-Papuan\u201d islands that facilitated dispersal and colonisation. Other studies (such as Fuchs et al., 2006) suggested that many African songbirds originated from an early Australian lineage that colonised Africa via long distance dispersal across the Indian Ocean.</p> <p>A new study on songbird diversification by Moyle and colleagues (2016) attempts to test some of the hypotheses about songbird evolution by sampling a large number of species (representing approximately 70% of songbird families) to reconstruct songbird relationships. Moreover, the family tree derived from these data was checked against fossil and geological evidence, to ensure that any phylogenetic hypothesis would be concordant with geological and fossil data.</p> <p>Moyle et al\u2019s analyses show that songbird evolution indeed began in Australia, but in contrast to earlier scenarios, this happened in the Oligocene, not during the break up of Gondwana in the late Cretaceous. As Australia was isolated from the rest of the world by large stretches of open sea during Oligocene times, songbirds evolved and diversified for millions of years in isolation. However, in the Miocene, their rate of diversification started to accelerate. The reason? Geology.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b760bc72c9a6e1b9dcd60623d7bc0160d8b262b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b760bc72c9a6e1b9dcd60623d7bc0160d8b262b/0_0_926_1157/800.jpg\" alt=\"Moyle et al\u2019s evolutionary tree of songbirds.

As Australia slowly drifted north, collisions between the Australian and Pacific plates created uplift of the area in between, which we now refer to as Wallacea, and dry land emerged.</p> <p>Wallacea is a geologically complex area, with volcanic activity, drifting plates, and subduction zones. Although the exact timing of the emergence of dry land is not easy to pinpoint exactly, there is consensus that New Guinea did not in any shape or form constitute dry land until the Miocene ~ 12 millions years ago. This renders the scenario put forward by J\u00f8nsson et al and others, in which \u201cproto-Papuan\u201d islands of New Guinea in the Eocene/Oligocene facilitated the diversification of certain groups of songbirds, including the Corvides, unlikely. </p> <p>The work by Moyle and colleagues shows that although the early diversification of songbirds began in the Oligocene, it was the emergence of Wallacea that triggered songbird radiations and dispersal. The emergence of Wallacean islands between Australia and Sundaland during and after the Miocene opened up dispersal routes out of Australia that enabled colonization into Asia and beyond. A dispersal route via Wallacea and southern Asia would have been a much more likely route for Passerides colonizing Africa than the transoceanic dispersal events suggested before. As this study shows, depending on only one line of evidence can lead to scenarios that are not in line with the earth\u2019s history.

Nevertheless, Ofcom stated structural separation remains an option if there is no resolution on legal separation/corporate governance of Openreach. Separately, the pension deficit for BT is large and growing.

While a widening of the deficit may seem counterintuitive given the recent rise in gilt yields, yields are still notably lower than June 2015 and inflation assumptions have moved higher recently too. In terms of sensitivities, and at current levels, every 10bp increase on gilt yields is a \u00a3800-900m reduction on the liability and every 10bp increase in the inflation assumption is a near \u00a3700m increase in the liability. After netting off tax at 20% (the tax rate falls to 17% post 2020), the net deficit value in our sum of the parts for BT rises to \u00a311.4bn versus \u00a38.0bn before and leads to a 34p reduction in our [target].

And you are going to let them know it.<br></p> <h2>Bargaining</h2> <p>This phase is filled with regret and nostalgia. You now wish that you had made a different choice and moved into the all-American compound as a permanent living arrangement because they have internet access. Imagine, you could even go get a drink (or a massage) without having to find a babysitter (another thing you still haven\u2019t managed to do). So you start mentally negotiating whether you can move there in a year\u2019s time, when the contract you literally just signed runs out.</p> <p>This is when your son declares that he wants to go back in a year \u2013 an option that was initially suggested by you on purely hypothetical grounds to make the idea of moving easier \u2013 and starts planning his next birthday party around that.<br></p> <h2>Depression</h2> <p>The beginning of this stage can be identified by how soon you start looking at the watch to assess if it is too soon to crack open a bottle of wine. If it\u2019s noon or earlier you\u2019ve moved into stage four. You look around at what is only just beginning to look like a home and realise there is no way you are going to talk anyone into doing this again in 11 months, yourself included. <br></p> <p>You realise that it is going to be months before you can go back to full time work because you left your entire support system behind and the kids still need you at pick up and drop off.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We still miss those who filled our old life with colour, but we reach out and begin to make new connections</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is the stage when you begin to meet other humans and realise that after a nice 30-minute chat, your face hurts from the effort to keep up a casual conversation with a complete stranger. It\u2019s when you promise a teary eyed child to stay the whole day in the school car park to ease his anxiety, and spend the entire day feeling like the worst parent ever because you never intended to keep that promise. It\u2019s when you look at Facebook and realise that, while your world has been turned upside down, everyone else\u2019s life carries on as normal without you. <br></p> <h2>Acceptance</h2> <p>And then, at last, a bit of light begins to creep in. You\u2019ll recognise this stage, because you start having more good days than bad ones. We still miss those who filled our old life with colour, but we reach out and begin to make new connections. In my case, in the form of flamenco lessons from a Venezuelan teacher \u2013 which is ironic given that I am originally from Spain. You start recognising faces at school pick up or at parties, and identify people you actually enjoy spending time with.</p> <p>Slowly you begin to accept your new reality and begin to reorganise your everyday activities around it. For example, here in Panama, a small country where everything is close, a key element is traffic. There are times of the day when a 10-minute trip can take more than an hour \u2013 we have learned this the hard way, so now at certain times of the day we just don\u2019t go anywhere unless we absolutely have to.</p> <p>The kids begin having play dates and referring to some of their classmates as friends. They begin using local expressions and complain about the canteen food \u2013 a clear sign of integration. Finally, looking very stern, the little one informs you that you no longer need to walk him to his classroom, and you can now drop him off down the street.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/feb/23/secret-aid-worker-is-humanitarian-work-a-career-for-escapists\">Secret aid worker: is humanitarian work a career for escapists?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A key part of this stage, and the reason that I personally love moving, is that it involves listening to your feelings and understanding your needs: recognising what is important to you, and what you need to move towards being happy again. As a result, we move, we change, we grow and evolve. We let go of what is not important. We become involved in other people\u2019s lives and invest in new friendships, slowly morphing into a new version of ourselves. As my 10-year-old put it, you get a second chance to define yourself.</p> <h2>Love and loss</h2> <p>And then, unbelievably, the time at your new duty station comes to an end. As a good planner you\u2019ve been working on identifying a good new duty station for the family, you\u2019re filled with anticipation for all the new things that you and the kids will get to experience, and grateful for all the everyday nuisances that you will no longer have to put up with. <br></p> <p>And then it hits you. All the friendships you\u2019ve made, many of them still flourishing, may never fulfil their full potential because you are about to walk out on them. Others you\u2019ve met are now part of your existential fabric. You know you will remain friends for life. Unfortunately, from now on that will mean meeting here or there, briefly, every few years. It starts to dawn on you that together with all the nuisances, there are many things that you have come to love about your new home and you will now miss. And that\u2019s when it hits you, the realisation that it takes a special kind of crazy to keep this lifestyle going. </p> <p>Rinse and repeat.</p> <p><em>Ang\u00e9lica Arbulu has been a humanitarian for over 13 years.

Plankton, the most abundant type of life found in the ocean, are microscopic marine plants that drift on or near the surface of the sea. They are sometimes referred to as \u201cthe grass of the sea\u201d because they are the basic food on which all other marine life depends. Plankton are able to convert inorganic compounds such as water, nitrogen and carbon into complex organic materials. With their ability to \u2018digest\u2019 these compounds, they are credited with removing as much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as their counterparts on land. As a result, the oceans have a profound influence on climate. </p> <p>Some algae species are toxic or harmful. If they surge out of control during optimal blooming conditions they can exhaust the water of oxygen and suffocate larger fish. This phenomenon has dramatically increased in recent decades, and is particularly dangerous to fish farms because the fish cannot flee affected areas. Early warning of harmful blooms from satellites can help to prevent fish deaths.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"70736deeb9cb01bd7316e529cb3db51070c6e11a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70736deeb9cb01bd7316e529cb3db51070c6e11a/0_0_2000_2600/769.jpg\" alt=\"Dust Libya\" width=\"769\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Plumes of dust pour across northern Libya and the Mediterranean Sea in early September.

Urban growth rates in recent years have been particularly pronounced in lower and middle-income countries. Africa depicts this global migration trend in high relief. Nairobi is a prime example, with its population pushing upward and its boundaries pushing outward.</p> <p>At the time of the last official government census in 2009, the population of Kenya numbered more than 38 million people, with 3.5 million housed in Nairobi \u2013 more than double the 1986 population. The images above, acquired in 1986 and 2016, show the expansion of Kenya\u2019s capital in the past three decades.</p> <p>While such migration often mirrors economic advancement, it also presents socioeconomic and environmental challenges. Rapid urban growth strains existing infrastructure. Conservationists also note that it discourages the preservation of natural habitat in favor of building more developments. In Nairobi, urbanisation has caused the city to encroach on former green spaces such as the nearby national parks and forests.</p> <p>Population density in Nairobi varies greatly, peaking in the city\u2019s slums, which house roughly 2.5 million people in about 200 settlements. Roughly 60% of Nairobi\u2019s population occupies just 6% of the land. The city\u2019s largest slum, Kibera (the light-coloured patch north of Nairobi national park) is made up of small, tightly packed structures.</p> <p>Although both of the images above were taken at a similar time of the year, the more recent one depicts greener vegetation, the result of a rainy El Ni\u00f1o cycle.</p>",

But so what? At last week\u2019s meeting of Infantino\u2019s expanded Fifa Council \u2013 the world\u2019s best attended displacement activity \u2013 there was instead much discussion of the proposal to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/13/gianni-infantino-world-cup-fifa-president\" title=\"\">bulk up football\u2019s flagship tournament to 40 or 48 teams</a>. Look, it may not be the Fifa reform you want, but for Infantino it\u2019s the Fifa reform you need.</p> <p>Of course, those who still feel that the World Cup\u2019s expansion from 16 to 32 teams between 1982 and 1998 denuded the competition of a certain high-end glamour may already be opening the pedal bin marked \u201cgenre killer\u201d. Others may wish for more information. Should Fifa go for the 48-team option, then, there is clearly much debate as to how the tournament would be constructed and located, but the idea of two concurrent group stages is fairly unavoidable. If only 16 progress to the knockout stages, as now, the tournament will comprise 88 games. If 32 go through, the World Cup will run to 104 games.</p> <p>If there is anyone bar an army of Swiss bank managers who honestly regards this as a plan that will improve the tournament, I am sure Infantino would love to hear from them. Meanwhile, he is forced to rely on his own justifications, and it is fair to say these tend toward the boggling.</p> <p>Indeed, to hear Gianni talk is to feel that in many ways the very notion of sport itself is holding the World Cup back. What is sport, if not exclusionary in the most outmoded sort of way? Infantino was at pains to stress that qualifying for a World Cup induced \u201cfootball euphoria\u201d in the countries that do, and to that end was obviously to be encouraged. Not qualifying, he said, was awful for a country, and turned its football clubs into \u201ca disaster\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2016/oct/14/desert-fire-the-world-cup-rebels-of-kurdistan-video\">Desert fire: the world cup rebels of Kurdistan \u2013 video</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mmm.

You may have seen the South Park episode where Steven Spielberg and George Lucas are ultimately arrested for raping their own creation in the unspeakable Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. (Furthermore, at the very moment the police apprehend him, Lucas is engaged in the metaphorical raping of Star Wars, via the actual rape of a Stormtrooper.) The pair protest loudly about how much money this stuff makes at the box office. Indeed, some of the smaller nations \u2013 forgive me \u2013 the smaller characters, such as Butters think there is nothing wrong with it. But as all right-thinking moviegoers know, there is something very wrong indeed with Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Though not quite as much \u2013 amazingly \u2013 as there is with a 48-team World Cup.</p> <h2><strong>Football Manager stays ahead of the game</strong></h2> <p>Further laurels for the creators of Football Manager, who are the latest entity in British public life to hint at more sophisticated Brexit thinking than Liam Fox.</p> <p>In a fascinating <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/10/18/brexit-is-simulated-in-football-manager-2017-and-its-going-to-ma/\" title=\"\">interview with the Daily Telegraph</a>, Sports Interactive\u2019s boss Miles Jacobson revealed that next year\u2019s 17th iteration of the game will include three Brexit scenarios and timetables, of which hard Brexit will obviously most affect gameplay. According to Jacobson, the creators \u201chave included every possible outcome in the game, using artificial intelligence and percentage chances to make every game different \u2026 If people think the outcome is bleak, this is what I believe will happen.\u201d As he points out: \u201cPreparing for the Brexit aspect of the new game has taken a lot of research, too: a lot of reading, a lot of talking to politicians and people in football.\u201d</p> <p>This feels confusing. As the victorious Brexiteers have spent much of the past three months telling us all, preparing for Brexit was the job of their Whitehall predecessors. Their failure to do it means that those now in charge of leading the process have to make terrifyingly empty speeches once a week, until some sort of clue is got. For a video game to appear ahead of them on this front is another one <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3833496/DAILY-MAIL-COMMENT-Whingeing-Contemptuous-Unpatriotic-Damn-Bremoaners-plot-subvert-British-people.htm\" title=\"\">for the notional committee on unpatriotic activities</a>, which we can only hope will be convened IRL without delay.</p>",
  "<p>The Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) is an anti-climate policy advocacy group in the UK that often releases <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/mar/10/global-warming-optimism-unjustified-high-sensitivity\">misleading scientific \u201creports.\u201d</a> The group also hosts annual lectures, and this year, they booked a room at the Royal Society. Many members of the Royal Society expressed concern that the GWPF would exploit the organization\u2019s credibility, and <a href=\"http://www.desmog.uk/2016/10/05/exclusive-royal-society-under-internal-pressure-cancel-venue-booking-global-warming-policy-foundation\">asked that the event be cancelled</a>. <br></p> <p>The Royal Society\u2019s governing council met and <a href=\"http://www.desmog.uk/2016/10/12/world-s-oldest-scientific-academy-royal-society-allow-climate-denying-gwpf-lecture-go-ahead-despite-internal\">decided to allow the event to proceed</a>, for fear that cancellation would give it \u201can unwarranted higher profile.\u201d As a spokesperson for the Royal Society told DeSmog UK:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>The evidence shows us that the earth is warming and that recent warming is largely caused by human activities. Once that is accepted, there is scope for debate on the policy responses and that is the area that the GWPF claims to be interested in. </em></p> <p><em>If the GWPF uses this opportunity to misrepresent the scientific evidence it would undermine the legitimacy of its views on policy responses to climate change.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.thegwpf.com/matt-ridley-global-warming-versus-global-greening/\">The lecture</a> was delivered by writer <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/Matt_Ridley_blog.htm\">Matt Ridley</a>, and predictably, as is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/jan/21/matt-ridley-wants-to-gamble-earths-future-because-wont-learn-from-past\">the norm for Ridley</a>, the first three-quarters of his talk indeed misrepresented the scientific evidence. While Ridley doesn\u2019t deny the most basic aspects of human-caused global warming, he is a self-prescribed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/may/13/lukewarmers-the-third-stage-of-climate-denial\">\u201clukewarmer;\u201d a group that falls into the category of Stage 3 climate denial</a>.</p> <p>Ridley\u2019s lecture is a 5,600-word <a href=\"http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish_Gallop\">Gish Gallop</a> that would require a novel to fully debunk. However, he condensed his main arguments into four key points that are easily refuted:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Why do I think the risk from global warming is being exaggerated? For four principal reasons.</em></p> <p><em>1. All environmental predictions of doom always are;<br> 2. the models have been consistently wrong for more than 30 years;<br> 3. the best evidence indicates that climate sensitivity is relatively low;<br> 4. the climate science establishment has a vested interest in alarm.</em></p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>We\u2019ve solved previous environmental problems, so let\u2019s not solve global warming?</strong></h2> <p>Ridley\u2019s first argument against the dangers of global warming is incredibly ironic. He claims that we have nothing to worry about because previous \u201cenvironmental predictions of gloom\u201d were wrong. But the reason his cited predictions of danger didn\u2019t come to fruition, in most cases, is because we took action to stop them.</p> <p>For example, Ridley lists acid rain and cancer-causing pesticides among his purported \u201cexaggerated\u201d environmental concerns. Many pesticides that were widely used in the 20<sup>th</sup> century are indeed carcinogenic, and their agricultural use was banned under the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_Convention_on_Persistent_Organic_Pollutants\">Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants</a>. Acid rain caused by sulfur pollution was also a widespread problem until it was similarly addressed, for example through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_Helsinki_Protocol_on_the_Reduction_of_Sulphur_Emissions\">the Helsinki Protocol</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_rain#Emissions_trading\">a cap and trade system in the US</a> whose <a href=\"https://www.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/heep/papers/SO2-Brief_digital_final.pdf\">economic benefits have outweighed its costs by a factor of roughly 100</a>.</p> <p>Proposed solutions to global warming involve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/dec/14/the-paris-agreement-signals-that-deniers-have-lost-the-climate-wars\">international agreements</a> and cap and trade or other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy\">pollution pricing systems</a> \u2013 the same mechanisms that successfully solved these previous environmental threats. Yet Ridley remarkably uses those threats as examples in his argument <em>against </em>taking similar steps to address the threats posed by climate change. It defies logic.</p> <h2><strong>Climate models have been remarkably accurate</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve written <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Climatology-Versus-Pseudoscience-Exposing-Predictions-ebook/dp/B00TIXVLZS/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=\">a book focused on the accuracy of climate model predictions</a>, and in December I\u2019ll be <a href=\"https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm16/meetingapp.cgi/Session/15993\">presenting a talk on the subject at the annual American Geophysical Union conference</a>. In fact, the most recent research shows that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jul/05/new-research-climate-may-be-more-sensitive-and-situation-more-dire\">climate models are even more accurate than previously thought</a>. So, were I not familiar with Ridley\u2019s long history of misrepresenting climate science, I would have been surprised that climate model accuracy is one of the main premises of his argument against climate concern.</p> <p>To make his case, Ridley relies on material from a few scientists like <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/John_Christy_blog.htm\">John Christy</a>, presented not in peer-reviewed journals, but instead for example <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/18/ted-cruz-fact-check-which-temperature-data-are-the-best\">in Congressional hearings</a>. Recently, as John Abraham wrote, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/14/climate-scientists-published-a-paper-debunking-ted-cruz\">climate scientists published a paper explaining the errors in those presentations</a>. Models have also accurately predicted other key climate changes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jul/27/climate-models-are-accurately-predicting-ocean-and-global-warming\">for example in ocean heat content</a>. There is simply no factual basis to Ridley\u2019s argument against climate model accuracy.</p> <h2><strong>Ridley\u2019s climate sensitivity cherry picking</strong></h2> <p>Joanna Haigh, Royal Society fellow and council member, <a href=\"http://www.desmog.uk/2016/10/18/scientists-reject-gwpf-climate-denial-lecture-delivered-royal-society-world-s-oldest-scientific-academy\">told DeSmog UK</a> of Ridley\u2019s of third key argument:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Ridley claims not to dispute the science, he then disputes climate sensitivity estimates with selective citations.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>This is a nice way of saying that Ridley cherry picks the evidence he prefers and ignores the rest. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/22/opinions/cook-techniques-climate-change-denial/\">Cherry picking is one of the five telltale techniques of science denial</a>. Being a self-described \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/may/13/lukewarmers-the-third-stage-of-climate-denial\">lukewarmer</a>\u201d like Ridley generally means believing that the climate is relatively insensitive to the increased greenhouse effect, and that climate change is therefore of little concern. In his talk, Ridley claimed:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>recent attempts to measure the sensitivity of the climate system to carbon dioxide using real data nearly all find that it is much lower than the models assume.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>This claim is nonsense. There have been a few papers suggesting a relatively low climate sensitivity, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/12/nasa-study-fixes-error-in-low-contrarian-climate-sensitivity-estimates\">several subsequent studies have found those papers to be flawed</a>. There have also been other studies \u201cusing real data\u201d \u2013 for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/apr/30/overlooked-evidence-global-warming-may-proceed-faster-than-expected\">measurements of cloud and humidity changes</a> \u2013 suggesting that the Earth\u2019s climate sensitivity to the increased greenhouse effect is relatively high. It\u2019s also important to note that were Ridley right about low climate sensitivity, <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23565-a-second-chance-to-save-the-climate/\">it would only buy us perhaps a decade or two</a> before the worst climate change consequences hit.</p> <p>In short, Ridley cherry picks the few papers that support his preferred position, neglects to mention that subsequent research has identified flaws in those studies, and ignores the vast body of research contradicting his beliefs.</p> <h2><strong>Conspiracy theories</strong></h2> <p>Ridley\u2019s fourth key argument, and a theme throughout his talk, exemplifies another telltale sign of science denial \u2013 conspiratorial thinking. He accuses climate scientists of having \u201cvested interests,\u201d of delaying publication of their results (<a href=\"http://sites.bu.edu/cliveg/mynenis-response-to-lord-ridleys-gwpf-talk/\">refuted by the accused scientists here</a>), of deleting and \u201cmysteriously\u2026adjusting\u201d inconvenient data, and so on. The easiest way to reject inconvenient data and expert conclusions is to declare that they\u2019re somehow biased. It\u2019s not unlike <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/12/donald-trump-climate-change-science-sierra-club\">fellow climate contrarian</a> Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/17/man-who-cried-rigged-problem-with-trump-election-claims\">claims that the presidential election is rigged against him</a>. Whether it be an election or an argument, if the other side cheated and conspired, then you didn\u2019t really lose.</p> <p>But there is no conspiracy. Ridley and GWPF want to risk humanity\u2019s future on their belief that climate change isn\u2019t dangerous. The problem is that their belief is premised on misleading, cherry picked, faulty, and conspiratorial arguments. As the Royal Society noted, by misrepresenting the scientific evidence, GWPF undermined the legitimacy of its policy views. </p> <p>We should be have a climate debate about the best policies to solve the problem. Groups that deny the problem by misrepresenting science only serve to distract from that much-needed debate, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/oct/05/the-republican-party-stands-alone-in-climate-denial\">outside of Donald Trump\u2019s Republican Party, they\u2019re no longer being listened to</a>.<br></p>",

Real total pay of \u00a3364 a week was still 7.7% below the level seen in February 2007, when it stood at \u00a3386, said Blanchflower.</p> <p>Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Global Insight, struck a similar tone, saying: \u201c[Business] surveys have also indicated a waning in the hiring trend, and suggest that we\u2019re likely to see a more severe weakening of the official labour market data in coming months.</p> <p>\u201cThe REC <a href=\"http://www.markit.com/Commentary/Get/07102016-Economics-UK-recruitment-activity-rebound-continues\">recruitment industry survey</a> shows the number of people placed in permanent jobs by agencies has slowed markedly in recent months, down to levels that are consistent with unemployment rising, albeit rebounding somewhat in September from the low seen in July.</p> <p>\u201cSimilarly, <a href=\"http://www.markit.com/Commentary/Get/05102016-Economics-UK-all-sector-PMI-signals-fastest-growth-since-January\">PMI [purchasing managers\u2019 index] survey data</a> indicate that employment growth remains stunted compared with earlier in the year, amid widespread anxiety about committing to new hires, given the uncertain political and economic outlook,\u201d he said.</p>",

  "<p>Most horror movies start cheerily. There will be often be scenes in which the lead characters demonstrate the optimism, innocence and playfulness of youth \u2013 and a thoroughly misplaced sense of security. On 29 March 1994, the England team boarded their coach to the Queen\u2019s Park Oval in Trinidad knowing that, all things being equal, they would return that evening drunk on victory and Tetley. Alec Stewart was asked by a Sky reporter how the team would get on. \u201cDon\u2019t worry\u201d, he said, sticking his thumbs up. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine today.\u201d Ten hours later, after his off stump was detonated by the final ball of the day, Graham Thorpe\u2019s blank face told the story of an horrific trauma. England had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/feb/04/andy-bull-rob-smyth-on-england-and-the-west-indies-for-the-joy-of-six\">sliced and diced by Sir Curtly Ambrose</a>, reduced to 40 for eight in a manner that would have shattered even Kipling\u2019s equilibrium. This wasn\u2019t a case of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory; they\u2019d had glory snatched from them in exchange for humiliation. They never ever saw it coming at all. For a young team starting out under a new captain, it was a terrifying insight into just how tough it can be to win a Test match \u2013 especially when you are up against perhaps the greatest match winner of all.</p> <p>England were given little chance when they travelled to the Caribbean in January 1994. West Indies had not lost a Test series since 1979-80, even if their victories were becoming less comfortable, and had lost only three home Tests in 16 years. England lost more than that in 1993 alone: they were walloped 4-1 at home by Australia, a miserable follow-up to a shambolic tour of India and Sri Lanka in which they lost all four Tests.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/22/curtley-ambrose-small-talk\">Curtly Ambrose: \u2018You\u2019re asking me questions I\u2019ve never been asked before\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A stirring dead-rubber win over Australia at The Oval, in their second Test under the captaincy of Atherton, provided an important injection of hope. Atherton, 25, wanted to follow the template of that Australia side by investing in young players of character and class and sticking with them through thick and thin. For the first time in 17 years, an England touring party included none of Graham Gooch, Sir Ian Botham, David Gower or Mike Gatting. The oldest player was Devon Malcolm, who turned 31 during the first Test. England lost the first two Tests emphatically, by eight wickets and then an innings. But they knew they would have to go through many hard times first, just like Australia in the mid-to-late 1980s, and there was plenty of hope in the batting of Alec Stewart, Graeme Hick and particularly Atherton, who bravely stood up to a fearsome, calculated barrage from Courtney Walsh in the first Test.</p> <p>In the third match at Trinidad, they played excellently. Chris Lewis, Ian Salisbury and Angus Fraser reduced West Indies from 158 for one to 252 all out on the first day, before Graham Thorpe\u2019s 86 and some useful tail-end batting \u2013 the last two wickets added 47 \u2013 helped England to 328.</p> <p>When Jimmy Adams fell to Salisbury off the last ball of the third day, West Indies were 143 for five, a lead of 67. With only Shivnarine Chanderpaul remaining among the recognised batsmen. England were 4-11 with the bookies, having started the match at 12-1. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to go into the rest day as favourites,\u201d said their manager, Keith Fletcher. \u201cI might get some sleep.\u201d</p> <p>The first sign the match might not have a happy ending for England came when Chanderpaul, on four, was put down by Hick at slip on the fourth morning. He was reprieved again by Hick on 29, another relatively straightforward chance for such a brilliant slipper.</p> <p>Chanderpaul, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/apr/28/the-spin-shivnarine-chanderpaul-west-indies\">playing only his second Test at the age of 19</a>, frustrated England with a three-hour 50 and added 60 for the seventh wicket with Winston Benjamin.

During a rain break, Fraser decided to nick his Middlesex team-mate Mark Ramprakash\u2019s seat by telling him there was somebody outside the dressing-room waiting to see him \u2013 \u201ca silly prank of the kind you often do to pass the time in these situations\u201d, as Fraser put it. Ramprakash returned unamused and threw Fraser\u2019s England cap in some water. Fraser booted a bin across the dressing-room and the two squared up to each other.</p> <p>England eventually dismissed West Indies for 269, with Andy Caddick taking a Test-best six for 65. That included the wicket of Ambrose, bowled for 12 as he failed to connect with an enormous yahoo. Ambrose had been told to play for his partner Chanderpaul but was so affronted by Caddick copying the great Sir Richard Hadlee\u2019s action that he wanted to \u201cbeat his bowling\u201d. He received and accepted a rare reprimand from his team-mates for the manner of his dismissal.</p> <p>Caddick, without trying or realising, had awoken the beast. Pride was one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/22/curtley-ambrose-small-talk\">Ambrose\u2019s greatest weapons</a>; pride in himself and also the West Indies. He never liked cricket as a teenager \u2013 he wanted to play basketball in the NBA \u2013 but once it became a career, the highest standards were non-negotiable for someone of his nature. He had let the team down, and they faced the prospect of a rare defeat at home. There had also been some criticism earlier in the series after a subdued performance in Jamaica; some even suggested that, at 30, Ambrose was past it and considering retirement.</p> <p>All of this fuelled his ire. \u201cI was at my best when something was on the line,\u201d said Ambrose in his autobiography, Time to Talk, \u201cwhether it was a match, a series or even my reputation.\u201d If it was more than one, as at Trinidad, woe betide those in his way. In the last hour and a half, he struck down upon England with great vengeance and furious anger.</p> <p>England\u2019s target was a tricky 194, when it should have been nearer 100 or 110. The extra runs also took more time out of the day; this, along with the rain break, meant only 15 overs remained on the fourth day when they started batting. Had it not rained there would have been around 40 overs left and Ambrose would have needed to keep something in the tank for a second spell. Instead he was able to throw everything at the batsmen.</p> <p>England\u2019s top six \u2013 Atherton, Stewart, Ramprakash, Robin Smith, Hick and Thorpe \u2013 looks a bit stronger on paper now than it did then. It\u2019s easy to forget careers are always in flux and even great batsmen have periods of famine. All four of England\u2019s middle order had been dropped or omitted at some stage during the previous summer\u2019s Ashes and were trying to establish \u2013 or in Smith\u2019s case re-establish \u2013 themselves at Test level.</p> <p>Atherton had also been left out during the tour of India a year earlier, but now he was England\u2019s captain and most important batsman. He sensed that, if England were one down at the close, they would be in with a great chance of victory. Instead, they were two down by the end of the first over.</p> <p>\u201cQuality bowlers essentially need two of three things: pace, movement and accuracy,\u201d wrote Atherton in Wisden Cricketers\u2019 Almanack 2001. \u201cAmbrose had all three.\u201d Even from the first ball of the innings. Ambrose didn\u2019t really believe in the concept of the loosener, and his opening delivery to Atherton was a jaffa. It was full, kept a bit low and seamed back to hit him on the pad in line with off and middle. It seemed to take everyone by surprise \u2013 even Ambrose, who had almost completed his follow-through when he suddenly threw his hands up and down in one movement and snapped round to point demandingly at the umpire Steve Bucknor.</p> <p>As he was doing so, Atherton\u2019s momentum took him outside the line of off stump. He had both arms outstretched, like a suspect surrendering to police, and held the pose as he awaited the decision. He is not sure why he did so but it made for a glorious image as both men stared at Bucknor. He was a leisurely umpire at the best of times and, although the wait only lasted two or three seconds, it seemed to go on forever \u2013 a moment of tension in which, perhaps, both players instinctively realised the game would probably be decided. Bucknor raised the finger and Ambrose \u2013 whose primal celebrations in this spell were almost as memorable as the wickets \u2013 started punching an imaginary speedbag with both hands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9184e24c1e7ef1f8588083b84759941df8b52d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9184e24c1e7ef1f8588083b84759941df8b52d7/0_0_2411_3623/665.jpg\" alt=\"Curtly Ambrose celebrates as England captain Michael Atherton is left stranded by his opening ball, Atherton was out LBW and the target of 194 looked an awfully long way off.\" width=\"665\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Curtly Ambrose celebrates as England captain Michael Atherton is left stranded by his opening ball, Atherton was out LBW and the target of 194 looked an awfully long way off.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Radford/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a few years, before he was dragged down by his injured back and his team\u2019s lack of spine, Atherton was England\u2019s rock. They developed an alarming tendency to collapse when he was dismissed. That was problematic at the best of times, never mind when he got a golden duck.</p> <p>The new batsman was Ramprakash, who had started his Test career splendidly against West Indies in 1991, with a series of patient 20-something innings that were far better than the bald statistics suggested. Yet in the two-and-a-half years since then he had been dropped three times; now he found himself batting at three in the England team for the first time, on the toughest tour of all. In what would become a theme of his career, runs in the final Test of an Ashes summer had got him on the winter tour. When he turned the last ball of Ambrose\u2019s first over towards long-leg, the England fans cheered loudly: one run down, 193 to go.</p> <p>Ramprakash turned for a second but was then paralysed by indecision and started skidding back and forth. By the time Walsh\u2019s throw came to the wicket-keeper Junior Murray, Stewart had run past him at the non-striker\u2019s end. It was a shambolic run-out that would be used in evidence against Ramprakash, apparent proof of a man who found Test cricket too much to handle mentally. Yet Ramprakash says there was a far simpler explanation for the confusion: he lost sight of Walsh and had no idea whether the ball was in his hand or not, and therefore whether a second run was viable.</p> <p>It looked like a moment of blind panic, however, and as such had a huge impact on the morale of both sides. Angus Fraser recalls Atherton burying his head in a towel shouting \u201cNo, no, no\u201d as Ramprakash was run out. After that Atherton retreated to the shower, with the crowd generously providing a wicket-update service for him.</p> <p>The arrival of Robin Smith at No4 would ordinarily have been comforting for England. He was a magnificent player of quick bowling, surely the bravest player of his generation. But he was in the middle of the worst period of his Test career and was struggling to forge a working relationship with the coach Keith Fletcher; Smith later described Fletcher and Ray Illingworth as \u2018the most appalling man managers, the most appalling coaches and the most appalling people that I\u2019ve met\u2019.</p> <p>This was by far the worst of his four full series against West Indies, despite a Test-best 175 in the final game. In Trinidad he survived his first ball and willed himself to get forward to his second. \u201cI played a beautiful forward-defensive\u201d, he says. \u201cThe only problem was that I was about two minutes too late!\u201d Just as Smith was completing the stroke, he heard the distinctive clink of disturbed furniture. The ball from Ambrose was so fast that it had already gone through the gate to remove his middle stump. Ambrose punched the air wildly \u2013 \u201cas if whipping a lasso\u201d, to use Will Luke\u2019s great description in The Cricketer \u2013 and England were five for three in the third over.</p> <p>A recurring feature of Ambrose\u2019s great spells was his<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/sep/13/curtly-ambrose-hall-of-fame\"> ability to read both the pitch and the match situation</a>. He was a far more intelligent bowler than some recognised. With Trinidad getting lower and offering a little sideways movement, he bowled fast, full and straight. Both Atherton and Smith fell to off cutters that were pitched up, and in the whole mini-session he bowled only five short balls in 7.5 overs. \u2018It was entirely different in its intent from Walsh\u2019s spell in Jamaica\u2019, wrote Atherton in his autobiography, Opening Up. \u201cWalsh\u2019s main aim was to intimidate while Ambrose, sensing a match to win and a wearing pitch to exploit, was only interested in wickets. Of course there was the occasional bouncer \u2026 but Ambrose\u2019s general length was full and the effect was dramatic.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/sep/13/curtly-ambrose-hall-of-fame\">How Curtly Ambrose, West Indies' silent assassin, became a big noise | Rob Bagchi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It made for a different type of intimidation. There was less threat to a batsman\u2019s safety but far more to his sanity, such was the extent to which Ambrose overwhelmed England. They knew there would be knocks on their journey, they knew Test cricket was bloody hard. But this, this was unimaginable. They had innocently taken a wrong turn and ended up on the meanest streets of Test cricket.</p> <p>The cacophony of joy at the Queen\u2019s Park Oval was such that England suffered a sensory overload. \u201cThere was all the excitement, the sea of faces and the noise,\u201d said Fraser. \u201cThe banging as Ambrose ran up to bowl. The sound just got louder and louder as each of our wickets fell \u2026 The conditions were good for Ambrose but he just worked everything into a fever pitch. We were trapped in a very intimidating environment with nowhere to go.\u201d</p> <p>The only person not making any noise was Ambrose. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/mar/20/cricket-west-indies-curtly-ambrose-richard-hadlee-sledging-mike-selvey\">\u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything\u201d</a>, says Hick. \u201cNot many of the great bowlers do.\u201d Ambrose had a silent charisma that was irresistible to West Indies fans, England batsmen \u2013 even England fans. Geoffrey Boycott, commentating for Sky, said it was \u201cpossibly the most exciting period of Test cricket I can remember in all my years of playing and watching\u201d. In Antigua, Ambrose\u2019s mother Hillie ran into the street to ring a handbell every time he took a wicket; in Trinidad, the unofficial cheerleader, nicknamed Blue Food, a former policeman who had been going to the ground since 1948, blew his conch-smell triumphantly. Banners such as BOYCOTT PAD UP NOW! and TOO MUCH TETLEY OLD CHAP! rubbed it in.</p> <p>It was a struggle to think straight, never mind play straight. The noise and the sheer speed with which things spiralled out of control meant there was no time to take stock. There was barely time to do anything. Nasser Hussain, the 12th man, sensed the dressing-room tension before the start of the innings and decided to walk around the ground to get a chicken roti. By the time he got there, England were four down. Fraser and Lewis had a similar idea and followed Hussain at the fall of the second wicket. They only made it as far as the KFC, by which time England were five down and Lewis had to run back to pad up.</p> <p>The dressing-room was a hive of chaos. \u201cI batted at six\u201d, says Thorpe. \u201cNormally batting there I wouldn\u2019t have put any kit on at all, but here I was padded up within three overs. The dressing-room was basically a load of blokes walking around getting their kit on.\u201d</p> <p>Or off. Wickets fell at such regular intervals that, although he lasted only 17 minutes, Hick\u2019s innings was England\u2019s fourth longest stay. \u201cIt\u2019s all happening so fast that you don\u2019t really gather yourself and maybe get in the right mental state\u201d, says Hick:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s not much to say about my innings: I played a little half-hearted shot outside off stump and nicked off. I\u2019d had a reasonable start to the tour having got 96 in Jamaica, and I was disappointed not to kick on from there for the rest of the trip. It was just a quality spell of bowling. There were a few average shots but that\u2019s the pressure he builds. I would put Ambrose and Glenn McGrath in the same bracket. They gave you very little to feed off. Ambrose and Walsh had days when they would alternate \u2013 one would be a bit slower, and the next day the other one would do the hard yards. Ambrose was quick. He had enough pace. He wasn\u2019t maybe as quick as Waqar Younis or Allan Donald but he wasn\u2019t far below.</p> </blockquote> <p>On that particular day he was even quicker than usual. There was no speedgun back then but the pace \u2013 and force \u2013 of Ambrose was such that all three batsmen who were bowled had a stump knocked out of the ground. The second of those was Stewart, who lost his off stump to leave England 26 for five. His 18 was comfortably the highest score of the innings. The rest of the top six made double figures \u2013 but only between them, with a total of 10 runs. Ambrose gave high-class batsmen an insight into what it\u2019s like to be a tailender: intimidated, overwhelmed and with a legitimate fear that every ball might be the last.</p> <p>The panic in the England dressing-room was such that, with the score 26 for five, they sent in Ian Salisbury at No7 as a nightwatchman for Jack Russell. Salisbury\u2019s excellent first-innings 36 was one of the reasons England got into a winning position. Here he lasted three balls before edging Walsh to slip. When Russell fended a rare Ambrose short ball to second slip, England were 37 for seven.</p> <p>Thorpe was the last of the remaining batsmen. \u201cI was out there for a little bit of time\u201d, he says, \u201cbut I just did a lot of fending off.\u201d He lasted 28 balls, the longest stay of the innings, yet only managed three runs. Thorpe was just starting to change his approach, a move that was inspired by watching Brian Lara, and would became one of the great initiative-seizers of the 1990s. \u201cI just tried to stay in the game. A few years later I would have tried to counterattack but my tactics weren\u2019t very advanced at that stage.\u201d</p> <p>From the penultimate ball of the final over, he was torpedoed by a delivery from Ambrose that kept low and removed his off stump. Without even turning round to look at the stumps, an expressionless Thorpe shuffled off. His gazillion-yard stare is the defining image of England\u2019s humiliation. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it a few times on TV\u201d, he laughs. \u201cI think there was a bit of shock. I was probably just thinking, \u2018Crikey, Test cricket is a pretty brutal game.</p> <p>\u2018You play well for three days and you\u2019re in the game all the time and then \u2013 bang! \u2013 game over\u2019.\u201d At that stage Thorpe was still waiting for his first Test victory. Ambrose and Walsh had more Test wins than the whole England team combined.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f1b2cd8e188106c50ce4e0141ea9a516836cb8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f1b2cd8e188106c50ce4e0141ea9a516836cb8d/0_0_4096_2731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robin Smith is out for a duck, beaten by Curtly Ambrose\u2019s pace. \u2018I played a beautiful forward-defensive\u2019, he said. \u2018The only problem was that I was about two minutes too late.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robin Smith is out for a duck, beaten by Curtly Ambrose\u2019s pace. \u2018I played a beautiful forward-defensive\u2019, he said. \u2018The only problem was that I was about two minutes too late.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Naden/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thorpe, like Stewart and a few of the others, could theoretically have got forward to Ambrose, even on an uneven pitch. But in theory there\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t shoot the devil in the back. It was matter over mind. \u201cI know Boycs said we should try to get forward\u201d, says Thorpe, \u201cbut it\u2019s never that easy. He didn\u2019t give too many drive balls anyway. I think I drove him twice in my whole career, once in Barbados and once at The Oval.\u201d</p> <p>The match was wrapped up the following morning. Walsh took the last two wickets and England limped past their lowest-ever total, 45 all out against Australia in 1887, by one run. Ambrose ended with figures of 10-1-24-6. He had done his work the previous night. \u201cIt is unlikely,\u201d wrote Matthew Engel in The Guardian, \u201cthat anyone in history has been quite such a certainty to produce a performance of such magnitude when it actually matters.\u201d</p> <p>In 44 Test victories Ambrose took 229 wickets at 16.86 and was Man of the Match 14 times. Among those who have played in at least five Test wins, only Muttiah Muralitharan has a better percentage of Man of the Match awards. The timing and the manner of Ambrose\u2019s work makes him arguably the greatest matchwinner of all.</p> <p>\u201cPeople ask me to explain how I can inflict these devastating, match-winning spells and I believe the simple answer is about having the strength of character to overcome adversity as all my best spells came in situations when the team was against it,\u201d he said in Time to Talk. \u201cIt is about having sheer determination that we are not going to lose. I thrive on challenges, negative comments or anything where people doubt my ability. More often than not when I have been faced with these challenges I have come out triumphant.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/nov/04/joy-of-six-great-fast-bowling-spells\">The Joy of Six:  great fast-bowling spells | Russell Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With many bowlers, control and aggression are almost mutually exclusive, but Ambrose was able to summon one without compromising the other. He was a raging metronome. Despite his obvious greatness, England were slaughtered in the press. Such shockingly low totals were unusual in those days. They have become a much more regular occurrence since the turn of the century, and we realise that it can happen to anyone \u2013 even Australia. It feels a little harsh that the 46 all out is still used as shorthand for England\u2019s struggles in the 1990s as there were far worse performances with bat and ball. They failed, palpably, but only in the most exacting circumstances. \u201cWhen a great bowler is in the zone, I don\u2019t care how good a player you are, the bowler will win,\u201d said Stewart. \u201cAmbrose was awesome.\u201d</p> <p>A 5-0 defeat seemed inevitable after that, but no side bounced back from rock bottom as effectively as England in the 1990s. They won astonishingly in the next Test at Barbados, West Indies\u2019 first defeat there for 59 years, and a 3-1 series score was probably a slight overachievement. But the young team did not stick together: Illingworth took over as chairman of selectors later that month and started picking players in their forties, never mind their thirties. Atherton\u2019s far-sighted vision did not become reality until Duncan Fletcher became coach in 1999.</p> <p>Many of the players had fine careers nonetheless and of the team beaten in Trinidad, Atherton, Stewart, Ramprakash, Thorpe, Hick and Caddick took part in 2000 when England finally won a series against West Indies for the first time since 1968. They did so despite exceptional bowling from Ambrose and Walsh, who had a combined age of 73 and essentially spent the summer bowling 78mph off-spin. They had a doosra too.</p> <p>Ambrose had already announced he would retire after the series and received a guard of honour from the England players in the final Test at The Oval. There is also a lovely picture of him walking off the field for the final time with Walsh. \u201cIt was one of the most touching moments I have seen on a field, when The Oval crowd rose to Ambrose and his great mate, Courtney Walsh, to applaud them off the field for an assumed last time,\u201d wrote Atherton in Wisden. \u201cThey left, arm-in-arm, one sensed close to tears, and halfway up the pavilion steps Ambrose symbolically removed his famous white armbands, safe in the knowledge that his legs would have to do no more pounding.\u201d</p> <p>This was not Stockholm Syndrome; everybody loved Curtly and Courtney, even the England batsmen who they had terrorised for so long. For this generation of outstanding players who did not win the Ashes, regaining the Wisden Trophy was the crowning glory. They had survived the most brutal rite of passage to get there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"165a41d8867be7dd4a1eaefa4add9ae7e010ce9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/165a41d8867be7dd4a1eaefa4add9ae7e010ce9b/0_0_1869_2798/668.jpg\" alt=\"Supreme Bowling is out now\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supreme Bowling is out now</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>\u2022 Supreme Bowling: 100 Great Test Performances </em><a href=\"http://vonkrummpublishing.co.uk/\"><em>is published by Von Krumm</em></a><em> and is out now </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Supreme-Bowling-Great-Test-Performances/dp/0956732151\"><em>and available here</em></a><em>.

Asked how many ministers have threatened to resign over the decision on aviation strategy, she said: \u201cI\u2019m not keeping a tally.\u201d</p> <p>Downing Street sources said May had not categorically ruled out holding a preliminary vote before winter of next year, but pointed out the only legal requirement was for a vote in the final stages, when a national policy statement needed for planning purposes is put to parliament for approval.</p> <p>The decision suggests she is not strong enough to whip her cabinet in favour of a pro-Heathrow decision, although her official spokeswoman rejected the idea that partially suspending collective responsibility on this issue was a sign of weakness.</p> <p>May allowed a discussion of airport capacity at cabinet on Tuesday morning, but the final decision on whether to back expansion at Heathrow or Gatwick will be taken by a smaller subcommittee by the end of this month.</p> <p>They will choose between three options examined by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/01/airports-commission-case-for-heathrow-expansion-opaque\">Airports Commission</a>, led by Sir Howard Davies: a third runway at Heathrow, which was the preferred choice, the extension of an existing runway at Heathrow, or the building of a second runway at Gatwick.</p> <p>The commission, established under the coalition government more than four years ago, gave a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/01/heathrow-third-runway-recommended-in-davies-report-on-airport-capacity\">\u201cclear and unanimous\u201d verdict in July 2015 in favour</a> of building a third runway at Heathrow, costing an estimated \u00a317.6bn.

She said: \u201cThis is the expected and appropriate political process; there is no delay. Government announces its preferred option, consults on that position and publishes a national policy statement, which parliament then approves. Heathrow then applies for planning permission with support of government policy.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cHeathrow expansion has the support of the majority of MPs. In recent polling, 71% of Conservative MPs and 73% of Labour MPs back a new runway at Heathrow.\u201d</p> <p>Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, told the transport select committee on Monday that parliament would eventually have to vote on a national policy statement, which could be published only following a period of public consultation, to allow a new runway to be built.</p> <p>Opponents of expansion said that the legislative timetable was \u201cnormal procedure\u201d. John Stewart of Hacan, who chaired the campaign against Heathrow\u2019s third runway last time it was approved by the government, said: \u201cYou could argue that they have given themselves a fair bit of time to publish the statement and hold the consultation, but the letter appears to be setting out what would be normal procedure, not any real delay.\u201d</p> <p>The winning airport would expect to secure planning permission by 2021 and not open a new runway before 2025. </p>",
  "<p>Like many young players across the country, Rodolfo Ram\u00edrez\u2019s dream is to make it as a professional soccer player. \u201cEventually, I see myself playing in Europe,\u201d says the 15-year-old Mexican American from De Pere, Wisconsin, a suburb of Green Bay. \u201cBut I want to start in Mexico, just like Osvaldo.\u201d</p> <p>Ramirez is talking about his older brother, a member of Chiapas FC in Liga MX, who moved to Mexico from De Pere after showcasing his talents last year at a tryout event hosted by Alianza de Futbol Hispano, an organization which focuses on the development of Hispanic amateur soccer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/06/indi-cowie-freestyle-football\">The wonderful football freestyling world of Indi Cowie</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cNever give up: there will be many people who will tell you they\u2019re crazy, but you must ignore them,\u201d said the 19-year-old Osvaldo, <a href=\"http://www.alianzadefutbol.com/nota.php?id=647&amp;lang=en\">shortly after getting picked up</a> by Chiapas. \u201cYou can achieve your goals, with hard work, discipline and the support of your family. All you need is an opportunity, like I had with Alianza.\u201d</p> <p>Officially founded in 2004, Alianza de Futbol has become the biggest amateur program for Hispanics in the US, and offers what are probably the largest scouting events in the nation. Alianza organizes sponsored tournaments, tryouts and clinics for thousands of young Hispanic soccer players across 12 different cities. In addition, players who wish to follow a collegiate career have a chance to receive academic and financial aid thanks to the non-profit group Alianza U, whose aim is to mentor and guide those who aspire to play soccer in college. Other events include Alianza Femenil, for female players, and the Coca Cola Cup \u2013 a national tournament for girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 teams under the age of 15.</p> <p>Inspired by his brother\u2019s journey, Rodolfo Ram\u00edrez decided to attend one of Alianza\u2019s events this year, hoping to get noticed. He and his family traveled all the way from Wisconsin to Florida, with the hope the hard work would pay off. Rodolfo did so well he was selected to take part in Sue\u00f1o Alianza, a national showcase taking place this week in Miami. This year, more than 9,500 athletes registered to take part, and 54 of the best were chosen to attend the organization\u2019s biggest event, where 30 scouts and coaches from MLS, Liga MX, USL, national youth teams and US colleges get a chance to analyze potential talent.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very thankful to his organization,\u201d said Ramirez. \u201cThey have done so much for me, my brother and really, my whole family.

Players come from all over the globe to join in \u2013 and they don\u2019t need to speak or come from a Spanish-speaking family.</p> <p>One thing that makes this the tournament unique is that, by contrast with the well-respected Sue\u00f1o MLS, where only two winners (outfield player and goalkeeper) receive an invitation to join an MLS academy team, Alianza\u2019s tournaments have no limit or exclusivity on who gets chosen. Since its inception, more than 500 players have been invited to try out for a club or an academy, and 50 have signed a professional contract including Mexican Under-20 star Edwin Lara and Dennis Flores, who plays for Le\u00f3n in Liga MX and has represented the United States Under-23 team.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1EU5cTicRI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A1EU5cTicRI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Rodolfo Ram\u00edrez and his family are a glowing example of a community who benefit from an organization that not only pays attention to young Latino soccer players who simply can\u2019t afford academy fees, but make them their absolute priority. \u201cPaying for soccer was just never going to happen with us,\u201d says Ramirez. \u201cThe fact that that Alianza is free make it so great.\u201d</p> <p>But money is not the only reason why these players and their families choose these events. Perhaps the biggest factor is Alianza\u2019s active presence in the Hispanic community.</p> <p>These programs go to where these kids are, promoting heavily on social media and forming alliances with networks such as Telemundo to really pay attention to the people they are trying to reach. Their local managers and staff who work in the 12 cities are all Hispanic and are members of the community so they already understand the type of player who is trying out on any given day. This, in essence, is very much a grassroots project with a national outreach whose main goal is to give an opportunity to kids who are mostly ignored by bigger soccer institutions in America. </p>",

  "<p>Whether you\u2019re making a quinoa tabbouleh or mixing a cassis cocktail, sourcing international ingredients has become easy in the UK. But for many items that were once a speciality of other nations, British-grown versions are springing up. So why are farmers tussling with tradition? </p> <p>David Hughes, emeritus professor of food marketing at Imperial College London, says a drive to diversify makes sense when profit margins on fresh produce are shrinking. The market is dominated by a few, large growers, he says. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t in that bunch, how on earth can you survive? It\u2019s a case of looking for something a little bit different.\u201d</p> <p>According to the Food and Drink Federation\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.fdf.org.uk/priorities-eu-manifesto.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">EU manifesto</a>, which sets out the priorities for a new relationship between the UK and the EU, a weaker pound could make UK producers more competitive in export markets, although many will also face rising costs of importing raw materials.<br></p> <p>On Tuesday, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department for International Trade launched a food and drink <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/560786/food-drink-export-action-plan-2016-2020.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">export action plan</a> (pdf). It aims to increase the UK\u2019s food and drinks exports by a third by 2020 by providing business support, mentoring and training and focuses on demand for traditional British produce including beef, cheese and preserves.</p> <p>In the first half of 2016, the EU accounted for <a href=\"https://www.fdf.org.uk/exports/ukexports.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">71.5%</a> of the UK\u2019s exports of food and non-alcoholic drink. The export initiative therefore seeks to explore new markets. </p> <p>While the plan focuses on traditional British products, however, experimental producers across the UK are ahead of the curve. From wasabi to grappa, five business owners explain how they are finding success at home and abroad with a UK version of another country\u2019s speciality.<br></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.britishquinoa.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The British Quinoa Company,</a> Shropshire</h2> <p>Stephen Jones wanted to branch out from traditional crops, so in 2006 decided to grow quinoa. Traditionally from South America, the bulk of the world\u2019s production is in Peru and Bolivia. Since then the UK market for the grain has exploded. Jones, the first large-scale UK grower of the grain, is behind most of the UK production from his farm in Shropshire and he now grows quinoa crop across the country from Lincoln to Kent.<br></p> <p>From big corporations to smaller customers, many buyers\u2019 interest in a UK-grown product stems from a growing push to source more ethically, Jones says. \u201cThey want to know where it\u2019s come from, it\u2019s that traceability. They can come and see the crop in the field, see where it\u2019s processed.\u201d<br></p> <p>The Brexit vote has brought its own short-term bonus, says Jones, making his product more competitive to customers who previously imported as import costs have increased. But the UK\u2019s exit from the EU could throw up obstacles if the company wants to expand into Europe, with the main potential issue being tariffs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9de4dc80c5c344da381e6a849cce1f233d10c09d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9de4dc80c5c344da381e6a849cce1f233d10c09d/0_318_3039_3797/800.jpg\" alt=\"dappa bottle\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bottle of Dappa, Cosmo Caddy\u2019s Devon version of the Italian spitit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"http://devondistillery.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u2018Dappa\u2019, Devon Distillery</a>, Devon</h2> <p>Devon Distillery\u2019s founder Cosmo Caddy decided to use the discarded grape skins of his grandfather\u2019s vineyard to make his own version of the Italian spirit grappa, calling it \u201cDappa\u201d. The drink hit the market in May 2014 and can be found in restaurants from Devon to London. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a growing trend to try and have things made locally or within the UK and that pushes people to think what else can be made that we get in from outside,\u201d says Caddy. </p> <p>For him, the effect of the referendum vote on the pound has brought a rise in prices for some of the specialist equipment he buys from Italy. But it could could also bring benefits. \u201cI think there will be a growing trend towards all things British and local so hopefully demand will rise as imports get more expensive.\u201d</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.thewasabicompany.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Wasabi Company</a>, Hampshire</h2> <p>When watercress grower Jon Old decided to grow wasabi in the UK, a major motivation was the challenge. \u201cThe general opinion was that wasabi couldn\u2019t be grown in Europe and nobody had done it before in Europe,\u201d he says. </p> <p>Six years later, a client list that started with Raymond Blanc\u2019s Le Manoir aux Quat\u2019Saisons now includes at least a hundred English and Japanese restaurants in the UK and Europe. Old admits that, at first, some Japanese chefs were resistant to English wasabi.<br></p> <p>While other UK producers may have tried to grow wasabi, nobody had brought it to market so Old felt he had a head start. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through some punishing times.

  "<p>Of all the things we vegans avoid, honey categorically invites the most eye rolls. For some reason people can wrap their heads around the \u201cno meat, no dairy and no egg\u201d thing, but when it comes to this divisive little sweetener the mind apparently boggles.</p> <p>But let\u2019s look at the definition of veganism, which put simply is \u201ca person who doesn\u2019t eat or use animal products\u201d. That includes everything that we put both into our bodies and on them \u2013 even the surprisingly delicious secretions of a stripy insect. While it may seem unnecessarily dogmatic to eschew something so seemingly innocent, there are a few uncomfortable truths about honey.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/01/bees-added-to-us-endangered-species-list-for-the-first-time\">Bees added to US endangered species list for the first time</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Honey, as we all know, is a wondrous natural substance that not only tastes fantastic but has a multitude of health benefits too. It has been used as a medicine for millennia. What\u2019s the problem then? Well let\u2019s look at the very first thing I learned about honey harvesting. Commercial extraction means that the honey the bees have worked so damned hard to produce for their winter food store from the nectar they collect from flowering trees and plants is being replaced with <a href=\"http://beethechangeproject.org/useful-resources/\" title=\"\">a sugar water solution</a>. This is a well-known (and somewhat controversial) large-scale beekeeping practice that could be avoided if enough honey were left for the bees to consume over the winter period. But the beekeepers needs to make a profit, right?</p> <p>Because sugar water is devoid of any crucial protective properties, it\u2019s trickery on an insect level. Without the essential antibiotic/antioxidant shield the honey provides the honey bee is ultimately <a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/028055_honeybees_colony_collapse_disorder.html\" title=\"\">left more susceptible to disease</a> \u2013 something that might account for some of our current <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/01/bees-added-to-us-endangered-species-list-for-the-first-time\" title=\"\">\u201cbee decline\u201d crisis</a> and what scientists are referring to as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/ethicalreports/honey/beewelfareandhoney.aspx\" title=\"\">colony collapse disorder</a>\u201d. That, coupled with exposure to pesticides means they (and ultimately we), are on a hiding to nothing. It\u2019s a scary prospect to envisage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/31/animalwelfare.environment\" title=\"\">a world without bees</a> and buying honey (or beeswax, propolis and royal jelly for that matter) sadly isn\u2019t going to save us.</p> <p>But we need the honey bees to pollinate our crops, don\u2019t we? Well, yes and no. Honey bees can and do pollinate our crops but they are not necessarily the best for the job. Wild bees are also effective pollinators, but don\u2019t produce honey we can harvest so it\u2019s not worth our time and energy investing in them for honey. On the surface, it appears that honey is merely a by-product of the pollination process, and yet once you dig a little deeper you soon realise that the coveted golden nectar (and the retrieval thereof) is a major concern for commercial beekeepers, along with the lucrative contracts they get from farmers to pollinate their crops.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9cf2852159324531cf03758997b5d7a46d6def7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cf2852159324531cf03758997b5d7a46d6def7c/0_0_3413_5120/667.jpg\" alt=\"Jars of English blossom honey and lavender honey\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018 I can wholly understand why some self-proclaimed vegans have no issue in purchasing local, raw honey.\u2019 Jars of English blossom honey and lavender honey for sale in Burford in the Cotswolds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Graham/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No bees get harmed in the process of honey production though, right? Not exactly. Industrial bee farming has been known to \u201ccull\u201d hives after harvesting because it\u2019s cheaper than feeding the bees throughout the winter. Those farmers who do choose to keep the hives in operation feed the bees that insipid sugar water, which in turn weakens their immune systems and leaves them vulnerable to infection. In the wild, of course, these bees would be using the honey they diligently harvested to keep themselves going throughout the winter months, arming themselves with all the nourishment they need to see them through. Another tactic implemented by large-scale beekeepers is to clip the wings of the queen bee to prevent swarming, thus ensuring there is no decline in honey production. For the same reason the queen is sometimes killed and replaced with a younger model. Comforting to know we humans don\u2019t apply ageism just to our own species, eh?</p> <p>But what about locally produced honey from small-scale beekeepers? Urban beekeeping is a hugely popular pastime at present and with it come many welcome positives. I tend to think of it as a bit of a grey area \u2013 and my approach to veganism fully acknowledges the reality of these \u201cgrey areas\u201d in our complex, modern society. Even within this growing movement there are several varieties of small-scale beekeeping, a few of which include \u201cbalanced beekeeping\u201d (taking the honey only when it\u2019s in abundance), \u201cnatural beekeeping\u201d (little or no interference with the hive) and \u201cconservation beekeeping\u201d (no honey is taken, the bees are left to their own devices), all of which can help restore the relationship we currently have with the honey bee to a more natural balance.</p> <p>While I personally don\u2019t consume honey and haven\u2019t done for many years, I can wholly understand why some self-proclaimed vegans have no issue in purchasing local, raw honey. Of course, this is a hugely contentious issue that evokes strong emotions but for me this is about making a personal, informed decision not driven simply by the definition of a word.</p> <p>Are you a significantly lesser vegan if you consume a small amount of honey given to you by a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.naturalbeekeepingtrust.org/bee-centred-vs-conventional\" title=\"\">balanced beekeeper</a>\u201d? I don\u2019t yet have the answer to that. But if you\u2019d rather not risk your hard-won vegan credentials, thankfully there is an array of plant-based sweeteners (maple syrup, date syrup and coconut nectar to name but a few) that will keep you satiated and the honey bee safe. And, more importantly, don\u2019t forget you can keep Britain buzzing by planting a <a href=\"https://bumblebeeconservation.org/get-involved/gardening-for-bees\" title=\"\">bee-friendly garden</a> yourself to help encourage all bees to thrive. To use a very un-vegan phrase: there\u2019s more than one way to skin a cat \u2013 or in this case, more than one way to save the bees.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85a2e055b35965f473b894395a1097f207288c8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85a2e055b35965f473b894395a1097f207288c8f/0_315_3052_1832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A buff-tailed bumble bee on an azalea flower\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A buff-tailed bumble bee on an azalea flower.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amelia Collins/Friends of the Ea/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

Not that Joyce has disagreed with Turnbull\u2019s messages. But his National MPs have tried to remind everyone that this is a matter of categorisation of the gun - not the import. Because a number of the shotguns are already in the country. It looks like a Lib-Nat split.</p> <p><strong>Tony Abbott\u2019s </strong>revelation that the sunset clause on the import ban was a result of internal pressure from the National party and presumably some Libs, rather than Leyonhjelm, reinforces the \u201csplit\u201d story for the PM. Nationals have confirmed they did push back on Abbott. Whether Keenan plus Dutton independently used the agreed sunset clause to barter with Leyonhjelm (given it was going to happen anyway) or whether Abbott gave permission to do so, we don\u2019t know.</p> <p>So if the import ban is lifted \u2013 as at least some of the Nats would like \u2013 it will be painted as a watering down of the gun laws. Even though strictly speaking, it is not. It will also be painted as a win for the Nats over Turnbull.</p> <p><strong>Enter WA premier Colin Barnett</strong>. He has said this:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m far from being an expert on guns, but as a matter of policy, I do not support that gun. I saw some footage on television of it being fired; it\u2019s obviously got a rapid-fire capacity. Australia has put in policies to contain gun ownership and use, and I do not support allowing a weapon like that into this state.</p> </blockquote> <p>If Barnett is going to be a hold-out on the Adler, it may be the best political outcome for Turnbull. It could both fix the wider political issue and his issue with the Nats.</p> <p>If the states cannot decide on the category \u2013 as they are required to do under the National Firearms Agreement \u2013 the import ban stays for the time being. This would solve the wider political problem by kicking it off into the long grass. The PM can tell the Nats his hands are tied by the states indecision \u2013 that is the condition of the Howard laws. </p> <p>As an aside, shooters who favour the import of the Adler are privately pretty ropable with Leyonjhelm. He has put the Adler squarely in the middle of a wider political debate, ensuring it will not be discussed in any sort of rational way. But Leyonjhelm wins either way. If the shotgun is permanently banned, he fought the good fight for shooters.

However, the country has announced intentions of clearing up some of these issues by the time of the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.</p> <p>The fruits of humanity\u2019s now seemingly constant technological revolutions and the living patterns of our urban population currently integrate nowhere better than they do in Seoul.

  "<p>In a small operating theatre underneath Hammersmith hospital, a team of cardiologists are in a race against time. They\u2019re performing an angioplasty, a delicate and dextrous procedure where tiny wires are inserted into the heart to widen coronary arteries narrowed by plaque buildup. Things have gone badly wrong.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>One of the wires has perforated the artery walls, causing a rapid leakage of blood. With fluid building up around the heart, the team must act quickly.

This has to be done in less than five minutes to prevent the patient going into cardiac arrest.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>While the mood is one of grim urgency, this time it isn\u2019t quite life and death on the line.

Owing to greater patient awareness and involvement in healthcare, operations are increasingly being led and performed by senior consultants. Trainee surgeons can assist and observe but hands-on experience is harder to come by. \u201cThere\u2019s more pressure from patients to have access to the best trained person available,\u201d says Dr Fernando Bello, a researcher in the department of surgery and cancer at Imperial College, London. \u201cOf course this is positive in many ways but, along with reduction in working hours, it makes it harder for trainees to get the exposure they need.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Over the past four years, hospitals across the UK have increasingly been turning to simulation and the virtual world for answers.

The sights, sounds and lighting are exactly the same as the real thing, along with the staff. To increase the sense of immersion, trainee surgeons take part in the simulations along with anaesthetists, nurses and various technological and visual effects. For cardiologists performing angioplasty, the robot they\u2019re operating on is draped with an actor sitting underneath it at the head end, to look like a patient lying down. The robot and operating tool are embedded with the latest haptic technology, so it feels exactly as if the tiny wires are being pushed through a real person.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you push a wire through a diseased artery it\u2019s not smooth,\u201d Ako says. \u201cThere\u2019s some resistance. And that\u2019s programmed into the system, as is the slight resistance you feel when you make the initial puncture. In front of you they have real life x-rays to navigate, as you would use on an actual person, so you\u2019re getting not only a visual feel, but also the tactile and haptic feel of the equipment. It\u2019s very realistic, very high definition.\u201d</p> <p>To test the ability to react in real time to challenges, trainees can face any of a range of pre-programmed scenarios. For trainee cardiologists there are 52, ranging from the wrong drug being accidentally injected, to an artery perforation, to the patient having an allergic reaction to various dyes used to look at their arteries. In the latter case, monitors around the operating table start showing that blood pressure and heart rate are going down, and those running the simulation will instruct the actor via headphones to display difficulties in breathing.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In future there are plans to combine the existing robotics and haptic technology with Occulus Rift from the gaming world. Surgeons will conduct the simulated operation while wearing goggles, transporting them into a virtual environment containing larger, more complex equipment such as x-ray scanners.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a052f3e98d3a61b83e7c19a00c6281f21f9f6f2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a052f3e98d3a61b83e7c19a00c6281f21f9f6f2b/150_0_4444_2668/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An AngioSuite at Imperial\u2019s specialist centre for engagement and simulation science\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hospitals across the UK are increasingly turning to simulation and the virtual world for answers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: University College London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere have been studies of surgeons during these immersive simulation and you see that they get a physical response,\u201d Ako says. \u201cSo the heart rate\u2019s racing, the adrenaline is up, it\u2019s like an emergency is actually happening.

  "<p>Today is a big day for the European Space Agency (ESA). It will attempt to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2016/aug/12/european-space-agency-targets-mars-for-october-landing-schiaparelli\">land the Schiaparelli spacecraft on Mars</a> and collect data from the surface.</p> <p>\u201cThe way to see this landing is ESA gaining its spurs. This is ESA\u2019s first controlled landing on a planet. So this is a key moment really,\u201d says David Parker, ESA\u2019s director of human spaceflight and robotic exploration.</p> <p>So far, only Nasa has been successful in performing science on the surface on Mars, unless you count the 14.5 seconds that Russia\u2019s Mars 3 spacecraft spent working after touchdown in 1971 before falling silent. Although even that is one up on the previous ESA Mars landing, when the UK-led Beagle 2 landed safely in 2004 but failed to transmit anything at all.</p> <p>Since then, lessons have been learnt at ESA. For example, the Schiaparelli lander will stay in contact with Earth all the way to the ground this afternoon. So even if a failure takes place, the reason for it can be more easily analysed.</p> <p>That\u2019s really what this afternoon is all about: Europe learning to land on Mars in order to send a highly capable rover there in 2020.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2016/aug/12/european-space-agency-targets-mars-for-october-landing-schiaparelli\">European Space Agency targets Mars for October landing of Schiaparelli module</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get lots of spectacular images back from this landing.

The real science is on the 2020 rover mission,\u201d says Parker.</p> <p>The 2020 mission, known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2016/apr/29/tim-peake-takes-mars-rover-for-a-test-drive-in-stevenage\">the ExoMars rover</a>, is indeed ambitious. It is a rover, built in the UK by <a href=\"http://www.space-airbusds.com/en/programmes/exomars-l95.html\">Airbus Defence and Space</a>, that will look for evidence of past or present life on the surface of Mars.

It is an enormous challenge to build that laboratory on Earth and then take it to Mars,\u201d says Parker.</p> <p>Partly as a result of the immense technical challenges, the mission slipped from its original 2018 launch to 2020 \u2013 and is proving more costly than originally budgeted. ESA currently need \u00a3300 million more from their national backers to finish and launch.</p> <p>\u201cWe asked the member states back in June, \u2018given the missing cost do you want to continue?\u2019 They unanimously voted \u2018yes\u2019 but the decision point to actually commit the money is the Ministerial Conference in December. All the indications are positive, but it is of course up to the individual decisions of the member states. I don\u2019t want to sound as if we are taking them for granted in any way,\u201d says Parker.</p> <p>A successful landing today would certainly increase confidence in ESA to safely deliver the 2020 lander to Mars.</p> <p>But while most eyes will be on the landing, ESA will attempt today to put its \u201cmothership\u201d, the Trace Gas Orbiter, into orbit around Mars. </p> <p>Although you might be hard pressed to realise it from the name of the spacecraft, Mars missions do not come more exciting than this.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2016/mar/11/is-there-life-on-mars-exomars-trace-gas-orbiter-takes-up-the-search\">Is there life on Mars?

  "<p>There is plenty of focus on deficits and government debt in the Australian political debate. This is fair enough. But I am glad that our levels of private debt have been getting more attention lately. Ballooning leverage and foreign debt undermines our financial stability and provides for dangers in the event of a global downturn. </p> <p>It\u2019s not the government\u2019s responsibility to dictate to households and businesses whether they should borrow money and how they spend it. But it is a government\u2019s responsibility to ensure that policy settings are appropriate and do not distort economic decision making. On this, the government simply remains asleep at the wheel, or worse, is knowingly failing on its duty to ensure the economy remains financially stable and continues to grow.</p> <p>With rapidly increasing debt levels in Australia, policies such as negative gearing and capital gains concessions, which encourage leverage and excessive debt, should be curtailed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/10/australias-1tr-foreign-debt-rated-extreme-by-sp\">Australia's $1tr foreign debt rated 'extreme' by S&amp;P</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Warnings have been coming thick and fast recently regarding the rapid build-up of Australia\u2019s foreign debt. The amount of money Australia owes the rest of the world has swelled to new record levels and now sits above $1trillion. While several advanced economies deleveraged after the global financial crisis, household debt in Australia has surged to more than 180% of disposable income, one of the highest household debt-to-income ratios in the developed world.</p> <p>Australia received a special mention in the International Monetary Fund\u2019s most recent Fiscal Monitor, which named us as one of just three economies where private debt has continued to accumulate at a \u201cfast pace\u201d. As recently as this week, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s said Australia\u2019s foreign debt had reached \u201cextreme\u201d levels.</p> <p>But given much of this debt is private, is it really a problem? The International Monetary Fund thinks so. Soaring debt levels limit the future ability of households to go out and spend on goods and services in the economy. As the IMF states, \u201chigh private debt not only increases the likelihood of a financial crisis but can also hamper growth even in its absence, as highly indebted borrowers eventually decrease their consumption and investment\u201d.</p> <p>We may be starting to see some early indications that record household debt is constraining the spending capacity of families around Australia. The most recent national accounts released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show the contribution to growth from household consumption halved between the March and June quarters, the lowest contribution in more than three years. Given spending by households makes up more than half of all activity in Australia, when it falters, the economy falters. It\u2019s no doubt one of the reasons why, despite interest rates at record lows, it hasn\u2019t been enough to sway non-mining businesses to invest. They are worried where their future sales will come from.</p> <p>Despite several warnings from its own advisers and eminent organisations that negative gearing and capital gains concessions distort investment choices and encourage excessive borrowing and leverage, the government continues to sit on its hands.</p> <p>In his financial systems inquiry, David Murray put up in flashing red lights that negative gearing and capital gains concessions are \u201cmajor tax distortions\u201d that \u201cencourage leveraged and speculative investment\u201d. He\u2019s not alone. The Grattan Institute has also pointed out repeatedly that \u201cthe greater leverage encouraged by negative gearing arrangements also reduces the stability of the Australian financial system\u201d. And most recently, the IMF got in on the act, saying \u201ctax distortions favouring debt over equity should be gradually eliminated\u201d.</p> <p>What part of this advice does the government not understand?</p> <p>Rising debt levels not only hamper economic growth but leave Australia more vulnerable if another globally induced crisis hit our shores. As Ken Henry has put it, if foreigners lost confidence and decided to stop lending to Australia, </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>unemployment would obviously go into double-digit figures, businesses would fail, banks would be unable to continue to provide credit to homeowners, to businesses, small and large, [and] infrastructure financing would stop dead in its tracks</em>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Labor\u2019s policies on negative gearing and capital gains tax are good for the budget. They are good for housing affordability. And they reduce the distortions in our tax system which encourage the leverage and debt levels that are worrying well-qualified observers of the Australian economy. When policies achieve multiple outcomes like this, the government\u2019s unwillingness to pursue them is deeply disappointing. And the day may well come when they look back and regret not taking them up.<br></p>",
  "<p>Many of the world\u2019s biggest shipowners and charterers have called on heads of state to take swift action to force carbon emission cuts on their industry which is the only sector in the world not now bound by climate change targets.</p> <p> Maersk, Cargill, the Global Shippers\u2019 Forum and 45 other shipping organisations including the Danish Shipowners\u2019 Association said \u201cambitious\u201d action is needed at a key UN meeting in London next week to bring shipping into line with the world\u2019s 195 countries, all of which have signed up to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-key-points\">the Paris climate agreement</a> to curb emissions. </p> <p>\u201cIt is time to recognise the important role which the global shipping industry must play in holding global temperatures well below 2C,\u201d the coalition told the UN\u2019s International Maritime Organisation (IMO).</p> <p>\u201cShipping\u2019s emissions are expected to substantially increase over the coming years. To curb this trajectory, IMO countries must demonstrate that they can match the ambition and pace of the UN climate body, the UNFCCC [which oversaw the Paris deal],\u201d say the \u201cprogressive\u201d shippers in a letter.</p> <p>Shipping\u2019s emissions, which stand at around round 1,000m tonnes of CO2 a year, compared to about 781m from aviation, are forecast to rise to nearly 17% of the world\u2019s total over the next 30 years if left unregulated. </p> <p>But the industry, which carries much of the world\u2019s goods, is the only economic sector not now subject to any treaty on climate change, country-by-country emissions controls or reduction targets of any kind \u2013 even though it emits around 3-4% of global gas emissions and has a carbon footprint the size of Germany\u2019s. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/aviation-emissions-agreement-united-nations\">Aviation agreed a weak emissions-reduction scheme last month in Montreal</a>, leaving shipping and the IMO exposed and appearing to drag its heels. </p> <p>\u201cThe IMO and the industry needs to act fast.

The IMO sticks out like a sore thumb,\u201d said a spokesman for Transport &amp; Environment, a Brussels-based NGO </p> <p>To secure an agreement, the IMO and the progressive shippers will have to overcome strong opposition from some developing countries with major shipping interests as well as lobbying by powerful fossil fuel groups and trade associations. These argue for a global CO2 monitoring scheme to be set up before any agreement is made on reductions. </p> <p>Led by China, Brazil and some small island states like the Cook Islands, one group has argued in IMO meetings that because shipping is a truly international industry, it cannot be regulated in the same way as countries, and must not be rushed into cuts.

They have traditionally been able to pressure some shipping-dependent countries who operate flags of convenience and ship registration schemes to water down, delay or dismiss action on reducing pollution or emissions. </p> <p>Leaked documents seen by the Guardian show that the Pacific Cook Islands this year reversed the progressive position it took on climate change in Paris last year, to lead opposition in the IMO to emissions cuts being imposed.

Any notion on imposing a system that would increase transport cost and availability of freight even further would be extremely detrimental to [least developed countries] and SIDS [small island developing states] and severely impact on our economic security while inhibiting growth and development potential\u201d, the Cook Islands negotiator said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/07/delay-to-curbs-on-toxic-shipping-emissions-would-cause-200000-extra-premature-deaths\">Delay to curbs on toxic shipping emissions 'would cause 200,000 extra premature deaths'</a> </p> </aside>  <p> He would not even countenance the setting up a working group to talk about cuts. \u201cTo be honest I am staggered that this was even suggested,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The meeting will also decide whether to impose a global cap on SOx emissions from 2020 or 2025.

All eight species of pangolins - scaly anteaters - are threatened and these species <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/28/pangolins-thrown-a-lifeline-at-global-wildlife-summit-with-total-trade-ban\">won top-level protection at the recent summit</a> of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a plenty of bad things affecting wildlife around the world and habitat loss and degradation are clearly at the forefront, but among the other things is the seemingly colossal impact of bushmeat hunting,\u201d said Prof David Macdonald, at the University of Oxford and part of the international team that produced the research. \u201cYou might rejoice at having some habitat remaining, say a pristine forest, but if is hunted out to become an empty larder, it is a pyrrhic victory.\u201d</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe number of hunters involved has gone up, and the penetration of road networks into the remotest places is such that there is no refuge left. So it becomes commercially possible to make a trade out of something that was once just a rabbit for the pot. In places like Cameroon, where I have worked, you see flotillas of taxis early in the morning going out to very remote areas and being loaded up with the [bushmeat] catch and taken back to towns.\u201d</p> <p>The scale of the global bushmeat trade is difficult to measure but, in 2011, the Center for International Forestry Research estimated <a href=\"http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/articles/ANasi1101.pdf\">6m tonnes of animals were taken each year</a>. Another estimate indicates 89,000 tonnes of meat, worth $200m, is taken every year from the Brazilian Amazon. The meat is also smuggled abroad, with 260 tonnes of wild meat per year estimated to be hidden in personal baggage at just one European airport, Paris Charles de Gaulle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"663d438ff179048926c85cf4ae1a5da94cba9659\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/663d438ff179048926c85cf4ae1a5da94cba9659/0_173_4800_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A truck loaded with passengers stops outside a restaurant serving bush meat, in the town of Epulu, Democratic Republic of Congo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A truck loaded with passengers stops outside a restaurant serving bush meat, in the town of Epulu, Democratic Republic of Congo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Blackwell/APN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bushmeat is often caught using long lines of snares, which trap animals indiscriminately.

For example, they include predators that keep rodents in check, species vital for dispersing seeds and others such as bats that pollinate flowers.</p> <p>\u201cWith this [hunting] trend, the loss of mammal populations thus affects the livelihoods and food security for hundreds of millions of rural people across the globe,\u201d the scientists warned.</p> <p>Macdonald said: \u201cYou have got to distinguish between those people who have no choice but to eat bushmeat, and what is to be done for them, and people now living in towns who have a nostalgic memory for the time when they lived on bushmeat, but no longer need to, so it is a luxury.\u201d</p> <p>The researchers said solving the problem of over-hunting will require greater legal protection for the species, empowering local communities to benefit from wildlife conservation, providing alternative foods and better education and family planning to curb population growth.</p>",

  "<p>On 17 March 2016, the watch manufacturer Breitling opened a lavish new stall at Baselworld, the world\u2019s biggest watch fair, to show off its latest marvels. There was the Avenger Hurricane, a beefy black and yellow extravaganza in a special polymer case<strong> </strong>made specifically to survive all extremes of superhuman adventure (\u00a36,500). There was the Superocean Chronograph M2000 Blacksteel, with full functionality at a depth of 2,000 metres (\u00a33,850). And there were at least 60 other items, each out-glistening the other in an attempt to demonstrate a new and expensive way to tell the time.</p> <p>And then there were the fish. Above the entrance to the temporary shop \u2013 which, at 10 metres high, was really more of a pavilion \u2013 was a huge tank holding 650 jellyfish. The tank \u2013 really more of an aquarium \u2013 was the size of a new London Routemaster bus sliced down the middle.<strong> </strong>Empty, it weighed 12 tonnes; its 16,113 litres of water added another 16.5 tonnes. Because it contained so many fish and so much water, the tank\u2019s sides were made from a 13cm-thick layer of methacrylate, a transparent material similar to plexiglass.</p> <p>Precisely what the jellyfish had to do with selling watches was a mystery, and it would remain a mystery until they were removed from the tank when the pavillion closed. Perhaps they represented freedom; perhaps they were a reminder of the sort of thing you could see if you purchased a Breitling diving chronometer. But the strangest thing about the tank was that most people who saw it just glanced up and swiftly moved on. Considering where it was, it didn\u2019t seem unusual at all.</p> <p>For eight days each year, <a href=\"http://www.baselworld.com/\">Basel becomes the centre of the watch universe</a>. The fair\u2019s organisers claimed 150,000 paying visitors and 1,800 brands spread over 141,000 square metres of exhibition space. Admission cost 60 Swiss francs a day (almost \u00a350), for which one could have bought a nice Timex. Near the Breitling pavilion was an obelisk for Omega, and a palace for Rolex. TAG Heuer adorned its booth with a TAG Heuer-sponsored Formula 1 racing car. One could spend many hours walking the plush carpets here, and encounter many very handsome men and women<strong> </strong>promoting Breguet, Hublot, and Longines, and very many handsome men and women buying their wares, too. Some booths were also selling jewellery \u2013 including Chanel, Gucci and Chopard \u2013 and some brands were selling watches covered in jewels:<strong> </strong>symphonies of the unnecessary, such as the Harry Winston Premier Moon Phase 36mm, with mother of pearl and 104 brilliant-cut diamonds.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/nov/21/still-ticking-the-improbable-survival-of-the-luxury-watch-business-podcast\">Still ticking: The improbable survival of the luxury watch business \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The show was a celebration of our mastery of timekeeping, and of the refinement and years of training that go into making objects of beauty and accuracy. But it was also a celebration of excess and superfluousness, of watches that exist merely because they can, like animal acts at a circus. Many worked on the most intricate levels to perform functions almost beyond usefulness: there were watches with a calendar that lasts 1,000 years; there were watches showing the phase of the moon in a different time zone. And then there were items such as the Aeternitas Mega 4 from Franck Muller, assembled from 1,483 components. This would announce the hours and quarter-hours with the same chime sequence as Big Ben. At its launch, it was heralded by its makers as the most complex wristwatch ever made, and a grandiose work of art.<strong> </strong>In addition to its 36 \u201ccomplications\u201d \u2013 a complication is essentially a nice gimmick \u2013 was the ability to tell the time. Another complication was that it cost \u00a32.2m.</p> <p>And therein lies the mystery of the modern timepiece. These days, no one requires a Swiss watch to tell the time \u2013 or a watch from any country. The time displayed on our mobile phones and other digital devices will always be more accurate than the time displayed on even the most skilfully engineered mechanical watch, yet the industry has a visual presence in our lives like few others. The storefronts of the world\u2019s big-money boulevards glow with the lustre of Rolex and Omega; newspapers and magazines appear to be kept in business largely by watch adverts; airports would be empty shells without them. The export value of the Swiss watch trade fell by 3.3% last year, due primarily to a downfall in demand from the east Asia. But it is up 62.9% compared with six years ago. In 2015 the world bought 28.1m Swiss watches valued at 21.5 billion Swiss francs.</p> <p>We live in uncertain economic times, but watch prices at Baselworld show no signs of making a cut-price concession to the unstable yen or rouble, or even the recent competition from the Apple Watch. Indeed, the opposite seems to be true: the higher the asking price, the greater the appeal, for cheapness may suggest a reduction in quality.</p> <p>So the Rolex Oyster Perpetual Day-Date 40 in platinum (\u201cThe watch par excellence of influential people\u201d) is on sale for \u00a341,700, while the platinum Patek Philippe Split-Seconds Chronograph with the alligator strap (\u201cFor men who take accuracy seriously\u201d) is \u00a3162,970. For some collectors, this would be considered entry-level: the most complicated limited-edition watches sell for \u00a31m or more. These watches have a waiting list, as the world only contains so many squinting master craftsmen who can make them, and even they haven\u2019t found a way to extend the day beyond 24 hours.</p> <p>But why do we continue to buy these over-engineered and redundant machines? Why do so many people pay so much for an item whose principal function may be bought for so little? And how does the watch industry not only survive in the digital age, but survive well enough to erect a 16,000-litre salt\u2011water shrine to its continued mastery of an outmoded art? Far beyond the telling of time, watches tell us something about ourselves. And so the answers to these questions lie within our propensity for extreme fantasy, our consumption of dazzling marketing, our unbridled and shameless capacity for ostentation, and our renewed reverence for craftsmanship in a digital world.</p> <p>And perhaps there is something else ticking away at us \u2013 a feeling that the acceleration of our daily lives may soon prove overwhelming. When watchmaking began, we had no concept of packed calendars and unbreakable deadlines, much less of \u201cquality time\u201d or \u201cme time\u201d. Our days were not ruled by the clock. These days, having brought this ungovernable storm of rush upon ourselves, we may be grateful for anything \u2013 not least a beautiful windable timepiece \u2013 that reinstates at least an illusion of control.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The Patek Philippe showroom at 18 New Bond Street has been done up in a sophisticated palette of sycamore, brass and alabaster. Here we may find the revered Swiss company\u2019s entire current Patek collection, stretching from the relatively modest Calatrava and Aquanaut models (beginning at around \u00a35,000) to the ludicrous Grandmaster Chime Ref 6300 in white gold, fat as a fist, which costs in the region of \u00a31.7m.</p> <p>One enters the salon through a double-door airlock, ensuring that no one gets in who may not appreciate exquisite artistry, and no one leaves who has not settled their account. The showroom \u2013 at 400 square metres, the largest single-brand watch emporium in the UK \u2013 was not sufficiently large to host its own opening party in December 2014. The event was held in a glass pavilion in the courtyard of Somerset House, decorated for the night in a style that would not have looked out of place in the heyday of Versailles, albeit a Versailles lit by LED lights on fake cherry trees.</p> <p>The London salon is the most modern of Patek\u2019s three flagship stores, but they all share a similar retail psychology. The others, in Paris and at the company\u2019s home in Geneva, envelop the clientele in an identical citrus scent, and in all three, the piped music is as suave and alluring as 1950s Monaco. \u201cThere are a few subtle differences,\u201d the company\u2019s PR chief tells me. \u201cIn London you get biscuits with your coffee, whereas in Geneva you get chocolates.\u201d</p> <p>In all three stores an imminent purchase is made more pleasurable, and more likely, with the arrival of champagne. The London outlet has a lower-ground area resembling a library, and a twinkling, softly lit \u201ccelestial room\u201d where prospective buyers may examine watches with ultimate discretion. The entire showroom has purposely banished all facets of the digital world: there are no iPads or electronic tills, and the staff have undergone a course in calligraphy to enable the careful inking of customer receipts and guarantees.</p> <p>\u201cMy expertise is making people happy and to create an environment my customers enjoy,\u201d said Ed Butland, the store\u2019s director. \u201cWe will show you any item suited to your needs and circumstance. Money is the last thing we want to talk about.\u201d On the day I visited, Butland was not wearing his usual watch, a manually wound platinum Calatrava with a two-tone dial, but conducting a wear-test on a stainless-steel ultra-thin movement porthole Nautilus that had just been serviced.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s nearly the only jewellery we can have as a man.  It\u2019s not only a watch, it\u2019s a piece of art</p> <footer> <cite>Ed Butland</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAn iPhone has no soul,\u201d he said. \u201cWith most electronic devices there\u2019s just a screen and a back, and nothing that connects you with what\u2019s actually going on to make it work, and nothing\u2019s moving. There\u2019s no human element and no human emotional connection.\u201d This partly explains the longstanding appeal of a mechanical timepiece of any make.<strong> </strong>A few weeks before my tour of the showroom, I had visited Patek Philippe\u2019s headquarters in the Geneva suburb of Plan-les-Ouates, where I talked to Thierry Stern, the company\u2019s president. He had his own thoughts on why the watch endures.</p> <p>\u201cWe should never forget that it\u2019s nearly the only jewellery we can have as a man,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s something nice! We should never forget that. It\u2019s not only a watch, it\u2019s a piece of art. If they [our customers] want to keep it as something of value, fine. I would prefer to see them wearing it. It\u2019s also a reward I think. Yes, you could give a quartz or digital watch to your son for his wedding, but I do not think those types of items today will last. They will change every year, like phones, so should I engrave a [digital] watch like this and say \u2018Happy Birthday from your dad\u2019, and then what are you going to do the next year?\u201d</p> <p>Patek Philippe prides itself on being the last independently owned watchmaker in Geneva. The company has been in the hands of the Stern family since 1932. Thierry Stern, who is 46, took over from his father Philippe six years ago. He is gently unassuming and comfortably portly, and quite lacking in the hauteur one may expect from the head of such a distinctive brand.<strong> </strong>He speaks softly and laughs easily \u2013 one has no trouble picturing him selling ties, or with a pot of fondue in front of him. He recalled a meeting he had recently in New York with industry leaders from Silicon Valley, and he was surprised to see how many of them wore Patek. When he asked them why, he told me, \u201cThey all said the same: \u2018It brings us down to earth, and it\u2019s nice to have something mechanical when you\u2019ve been working in the digital world for so long.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Jay Z has rapped about owning a Hublot and the 'big-face' Rolex ('I got two of those') he boasts in a duet with Kanye</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the last six years Stern has increased annual production from about 40,000 watches to 60,000, which is still a minuscule output compared to a Swiss giant like Rolex, which produces more than 700,000 watches a year. Exclusivity is a key to desirability. Stern maintained that he was not worried by a difficult start to the year and the impact of Brexit on sales; he had just approved the designs for the collection for 2028. When you\u2019re dealing with time, he suggested, it helps to take the long view.</p> <p>Patek Philippe, which sold its first watch in the 1850s, has never been at the vulgar end of the market, and doesn\u2019t look for endorsements from star footballers and rappers the way other brands do. Jay Z, for example, who has rapped about owning a Hublot and the \u201cbig-face\u201d Rolex (\u201cI got two of those!\u201d he boasts in a duet with Kanye West on their album Watch the Throne) might not seem the most likely customer of the more subtle Patek brand. But he is: he has been spotted at basketball games wearing a \u00a3120,000 Grand Complications model in white gold. Perhaps he likes the elegance and (relative) restraint of it, a 21st-century billionaire hankering for an updated 19th-century masterpiece. Either way, he is certainly an avid consumer of the brand\u2019s brilliant marketing.</p> <p>Patek has run virtually the same advert for the last 20 years, and it contains a tagline that is both enduringly effective and highly annoying: \u201cYou never actually own a Patek Philippe. You merely look after it for the next generation.\u201d The line is accompanied by images of models in various stages of self-satisfaction: a father seated at a piano with his son, a mother laughing with her daughter over life\u2019s little luxuries. The photographs, taken by Herb Ritts, Ellen von Unwerth, Mary Ellen Mark and other artists whose work hangs in museums, are designed to stir a sense of responsibility and family obligation, of dynasty and heritage. They may appeal primarily to someone with new money aspiring to be someone with old money. Buy an expensive watch, they seem to be saying, and you will belong.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"050a3b07139501763de3db95af6ec2eb9951439a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/050a3b07139501763de3db95af6ec2eb9951439a/34_0_508_744/341.jpg\" alt=\"the Aeternitas Mega 4 from Franck Muller\" width=\"341\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Aeternitas Mega 4 from Franck Muller.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: www.thewatchquote.com/mesIMG/imgStd/28276</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tim Delaney, the chairman of Leagas Delaney, the English advertising company responsible for the \u201cGenerations\u201d campaign, told me that the adverts arose out of a desire to reflect Patek Philippe\u2019s own sense of longevity and belonging \u2013 the fact that, unlike most watch brands, which are owned by large conglomerates, the company is independent.</p> <p>I asked him why his campaign had lasted so long. \u201cI think it\u2019s a universal insight,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not pushy \u2013 the thought doesn\u2019t run down, it doesn\u2019t become less intelligent the more you see it.\u201d The photographs are an attempt \u201cto show humanity and warmth. Truth \u2026 It\u2019s idealised. Everyone knows it\u2019s advertising. You have a strong sense that it\u2019s a natural bond between the two people, the father and the son, mother and daughter, so it\u2019s palatable, but it\u2019s not a photograph of a guy with his real son.\u201d I asked Delaney whether there were any other watch campaigns he admired, and he thought for less than a second before he said \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In the last century we have experienced the breaking of the sound barrier, the invention of the atomic clock, radio-controlled timekeeping, the internet, and pixelated clocks pulsing inexorably on our computers and phones. And yet none of these developments has threatened the dominance of the Swiss watchmaking industry. Exports soared even during the second world war \u2013 with the rest of Europe in turmoil, the temporal reliability of neutral Switzerland assumed even greater significance. For example, the International Watch Company \u2013 a leading manufacturer based on the banks of the Rhine, in the northern Swiss city of Schaffhausen \u2013 sold its Big Pilot\u2019s Watch to both the RAF and the Luftwaffe. Both sides were grateful for its massive dial, its huge glove-operable crown and its protection against sudden drops in air pressure as they tried to shoot each other out of the sky.</p> <p>In 2014, the Swiss exported 29m watches. This was only 1.7% of all watches bought globally, but 58% of their value. This raises a string of questions. Why Switzerland in the first place?<strong> </strong>How did this unassuming, landlocked country come to dominate the industry?<strong> </strong>And how did it master the art of charging tens of thousands for an object that often kept time less accurately than an object costing \u00a310?</p> <p>The first mechanical watches were not Swiss. The earliest \u2013 first round and then oval-shaped, and worn as large necklaces \u2013 appeared around 1510 in Germany, the Netherlands, France and Italy. A small trade developed in Geneva a few decades later, thanks largely to artisans employed as goldsmiths; filigree and enamel work, and experience with intricate engraving tools, enabled craftsmen to turn their attention to miniature mechanics. There were 176 goldsmiths working in Geneva in the 16th century, and their emergent watchmaking skills were almost certainly aided by the arrival of Huguenot refugees from France.</p> <p>None of this quite explains why it was Switzerland, rather than Germany or France, that gained the pre-eminent reputation for precision and beauty. But this is because that reputation emerged primarily in the 20th century. Prior to this, companies such as Breguet, Cartier and Lip in Paris, and many small firms<strong> </strong>based in Glassh\u00fctte, in the German state of Saxony, all produced prized specimens. (These regions still produce fine watches, they just struggle to compete with the cachet of being made in Switzerland.)</p> <p>In England, which could justifiably claim to be the innovative centre of clock and watchmaking in the 17th and 18th centuries, the roster of premier craftsmen included names still celebrated at the Greenwich Royal Observatory and the British Museum: Thomas Mudge, John Harrison and Thomas Tompion. With the exception of Harrison, whose clocks enabled the calculation of longitude at sea, the names are now all but forgotten, owing to the habitual British practice of neglecting the concerns in which it once led the world.</p> <p>But the Swiss just kept on going, occasionally buying up the most prominent firms elsewhere in Europe, and forming trade bodies and certification targets that increased the industry\u2019s reputation for quality and honesty. In the 19th century, the Swiss became masters of the increasingly flat mechanisms that enabled traditional pocket watches to evolve into wristwatches; a watch worn as a bracelet was particularly useful when riding on horseback.</p> <p>The Swiss also made full use of new innovations, enthusiastically replacing the old method of winding a watch by key in favour of the modern stem-and-crown mechanism. In the early 20th century, they combined the new American-originated system of conveyor-belt mechanisation with the finest methods of local hand-crafting.</p> <p>Today, the particular qualities that make a watch Swiss are the subject of strict legal definition, and are as closely regulated as champagne or parmesan cheese (the description on watches is always \u201cSwiss made\u201d or just \u201cSwiss\u201d rather than \u201cMade in Switzerland\u201d, a tradition dating back to 1890). To qualify, a watch must meet certain strict criteria (or, according to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de l\u2019Industrie Horlog\u00e8re Suisse FH, where this classification originates, a watch must adhere to \u201cThe new requirements stipulated by Swissness\u201d). To classify as Swiss Made, a watch must a) have a Swiss movement (that is, the basic mechanism consisting of cogs and springs that make the watch tick) b) have this movement incorporated in a case that is made within Switzerland and c) be checked and certified in Switzerland.</p> <p>All was going well until the 1970s, when something hit the hand-made mechanical watch trade like a mallet. As the decade progressed it seemed that the Swiss would not, after all, be telling the world\u2019s time for ever. In September 1975, The Horological Journal \u2013 a well regarded trade publication founded in 1858 \u2013 announced \u201ca milestone in the history of horology\u201d. On its cover was a picture of a Timex, a watch that ran on quartz. It contained a tiny piece of crystal that resonated at a high and fixed frequency when powered by a battery. This steady signal was then transmitted to an oscillator, an electronic circuit that regulated the gears that turned the watch hands. The old mechanism of winding and power storage in a coiled spring was dismissed at a stroke.</p> <p>The quartz movement had been around since the 1920s, but its miniaturisation had only been achieved in prototype by Seiko and Casio in Japan in the late 1960s. Its price had previously taken it beyond the general consumer, but now, through mass production at Timex and its main American rival Bulova, the electronic watch represented a change of philosophy \u2013 a piece of disruptive technology long before the phrase existed. It was solid state, with no ticking, and the new watch heralded the dawn of mass tech-based consumerism. Split-second timing, once the exclusive domain of physicists and technicians, was now available to all, and there was no better symbol of the seismic shift from the mechanical to the electronic world. Time itself was now flashing at us everywhere. No theatre visit was complete without half-hourly beeping from watches in the audience, alarms were now rushing us to every appointment.</p> <p>The Swiss reacted to the digital disruption with a combination of denial and mild panic. Between 1970 and 1983, the Swiss share of the watch market fell from 50% to 15%, and the industry shed more than half its workforce. As one of Tom Stoppard\u2019s characters put it in his 1982 play The Real Thing, \u201cIt looked all over for the 15-jewel movement. Men ran through the marketplace shouting \u2018the cog is dead!\u2019\u201d But the days of the Japanese digital watch were numbered. In the early 1980s, with doom on the horizon, the Swiss fought back with a new philosophy of their own, and something plastic, cheaper and powered by quartz and battery: the Swatch.</p> <p>The Swatch \u2013 from its name onwards \u2013 injected colour, youth and fun into Swiss watches (God knows, the fusty industry needed it). The watches were sold in the company\u2019s own shops and advertised on MTV, while artists and film directors, including Keith Haring and Akira Kurosawa, designed limited editions and made watches hip and desirable again for a new generation. With the panic over, the Swiss could once more concentrate on numbering their bank accounts. In 2014, gross sales of the Swatch watch amounted to more than 9bn Swiss francs. Today, the Swatch Group is the world\u2019s largest watchmaking company, consisting of brands \u2013 including Longines, Blancpain and Rado \u2013 that once would have shuddered at the thought of being owned by an empire with such garish foundations. Swatch even owns Breguet, the company that claims to have made the first wristwatch in 1810.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Earlier this year, in an interview with the New York Times, Brad Pitt recalled his time on the set of the second world war movie Fury. Pitt, who is a brand ambassador for TAG Heuer, remembered that Logan Lerman, the youngest actor in the cast, was given a watch to keep track of various activities during the film\u2019s rehearsals. \u201cOne day he came to me and said the watch has stopped, and I said, \u2018You\u2019ve just got to wind it.\u2019 He came back literally 15 minutes later and said, \u2018Wait, how do you wind it?\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For those born into the digital age, making a watch start may seem as distant and implausible as crank-starting a car</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For those born into the digital age, the prospect of making a watch start may seem as distant and implausible as crank-starting a car or changing the ribbon on a typewriter. But it is precisely this process \u2013 the end of a feat of infinitely intricate human engineering \u2013 that appeals to the watch connoisseur. It also explains why a fine watch costs so much.</p> <p>Making anything really small by hand tends to be extremely expensive. In the watch industry, the precision of the tiny parts is one reason for the great cost (even the tiniest screw costs eight Swiss francs, precisely because it is such a tiny screw). But the major contributory factors are human and old-fashioned \u2013 the wisdom, handed down through centuries, required to make something beautiful and functional from an otherwise inanimate assemblage of metal and stones. In each of the magnificent Grande Complication watches made by the International Watch Company (IWC) there are 659 parts \u2013 453 more than there are bones in the human body.</p> <p>But this is nothing compared with the Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime, which holds 1,366 parts within a 16.1mm-thick case. This is the one with the \u00a31.7m price tag, and I handled one for a brief minute when I visited the Geneva headquarters (how time flies when you\u2019re enjoying something you know will soon be taken away from you). The watch did actually feel expensive. It had a dual-face, a power mechanism running at 25,200 semi-oscillations per hour, a perpetual calendar, a strikework isolator display, a moon phase, and a Grande and Petite Sonnerie (internal chimes and alarms with tiny hammers striking polished gongs when activated by a side lever to let the wearer know the time in the dark).</p> <p>It was as heavy as any wrist would bear, and was without question a masterpiece of horological art. But the thing I liked most about it was that after nine years on the drawing board, and as many at the manufacturer\u2019s workbench, you still had to wind the damn beautiful thing by hand.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s the God complex, or the Frankenstein complex. You have the white overcoat, and you\u2019re creating life.\u201d</p> <footer> <cite>Watchmaker Christian Bresser</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The greatest wonder of all is that this watch has a mechanical movement, much of it adapted from pocket watches created in the 17th century. The precision tooling and some of the fitting may be done by machine now, but the design and final assembly \u2013 the tiny screws, springs, plates, wheels and jewels, the weights on the edge of the balance wheel, the ratchets that mediate the power supply, the interconnected barrels that create an energy reserve, and the pallet fork attached to the escapement wheel that causes the ticking sound \u2013 are done by brain and hand.</p> <p>A master watchmaker at IWC Schaffhausen named Christian Bresser once told me that making a watch made him feel omnipotent. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst thing to say, but it\u2019s the God complex, or the Frankenstein complex. You have the white overcoat, and you\u2019re creating life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"03d9668ac543155edcb3291b81c6f898a194942b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03d9668ac543155edcb3291b81c6f898a194942b/0_0_3283_5185/633.jpg\" alt=\"The Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime.\" width=\"633\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Daniel Meyer/Patek Philippe/JD Meyer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Creating life from pinions and pivots and tiny screws may be the easy part. One then has to sell the thing. With so many watch companies producing only slight variations of the same product, how should the well-heeled buyer make a choice in this<strong> </strong>crowded market? Should we rely, as we increasingly do in our modern world, on guidance from celebrities?</p> <p>At Baselworld in 2015 I squeezed my way into a launch of a new watch at a pavilion designed for Hublot. A flashy newcomer on the scene, Hublot was set up by an Italian in 1980, based itself in Nyon, a town in south-western Switzerland, and was owned by the French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH. Hublot prides itself on its timekeeping for leading sporting events, and its recent brand ambassador was Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, manager of Manchester United and a keen watch collector.</p> <p>Brand ambassadors are a key element of watch salesmanship, and the fact that they do not usually wear a watch at all while achieving their greatest feats is not a major consideration. Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have signed for Audemars Piguet and Jacob &amp; Co. Alongside Mourinho, Hublot also has Usain Bolt. Breitling has John Travolta and David Beckham, Montblanc Hugh Jackman, Rolex Roger Federer, IWC Ewan McGregor, and Longines Kate Winslet. Patek Philippe has shied away from celebrity endorsements, but it did once boast that its clients included Queen Victoria.<strong> </strong></p> <p>When Mourinho appeared at Baselworld in 2015 he was still manager of Chelsea. He was wearing a grey raincoat over grey cashmere, and he accepted his watch with light applause and a short speech about how he has been part of the \u201cHublot family\u201d for a long time as a fan, but now it had all been made official (ie he had received his bank transfer). His watch was called the King Power Special One, almost the size of a hockey puck, 18-carat \u201cking gold\u201d with blue carbon, a self-winding Unico manufacture Flyback Chronograph with 300 components, an immense 48mm case, all the mechanics exposed on the dial side, blue alligator strap, a skeleton dial, a power reserve of 72 hours, an edition of 100 and a price in the region of \u00a332,000. The promotional blurb claimed that the item was just like Mourinho himself: \u201cThe watch is provocative \u2026 the robust exterior hides the genius below.\u201d It was both stunning and hideous at the same time.</p> <p>But the most remarkable thing about the Hublot King Power was not that it looked like an armoured tank, but that it did not keep very accurate time. When the popular American magazine WatchTime conducted tests on an earlier model, it found it gained between 1.6 to 4.3 seconds a day. Extra time: yet another thing for Mourinho to dispute with the referee.</p> <p>But accurate timekeeping has long ago ceased to be the point. And this, with deep irony, is another reason why the global watch industry survives. Once you can afford to spend even entry-level prices for a Patek Philippe or a Hublot, your watch has begun to represent status and one-upmanship. A watch is a statement of achievement, and also of intent. (It is also one of the easiest ways to export money from one country to another.) Something glittery on your wrist says something about your earning power and your taste, much as an expensive car can do; it is not always an attractive trait. It\u2019s a delusion, of course, but the fatter and more complicated and expensive the watch, the more the wearer may assume control of the universe, the still centre of a spinning wheel.</p> <p>Baselworld 2017 has already announced itself as \u201ca fairground for the senses\u201d. Next March, the show will feature an expanding array of smart watches, items that suggest the leading brands are not prepared to suffer another debacle comparable to the quartz crisis. Many companies initially dismissed the potential impact of the Apple Watch and similar devices that act as a synced companion to the mobile phone, but they have been forced to reconsider; when Apple began offering a watch in a gold case for several thousand pounds more than the standard model, and Herm\u00e8s began making \u00a31,550 straps for it, the luxury market began to feel a little uneasy.</p> <p>So Breitling will be offering its Exospace B55, enabling its chronograph to engage with any smartphone. And TAG Heuer will have its Connected Smart Watch, promising audio streaming over WiFi and all manner of fitness tracking. It claims it marks \u201ca completely new era \u2026 the world\u2019s first wrist-worn computer\u201d.</p> <p>But the watch has always been a computer; the difference now is what it computes. A dial that once etched out our lives in hours and minutes, its accuracy dependent on our capacity to set it in motion and wind it, may now keep us connected with the rest of the earth, via GPS and overnight wireless charging. Yet the remarkable thing is not the emergence of texts and emails on the wrists \u2013 that was always going to come at some point \u2013 but how robust the traditional and mechanical wristwatch has proven itself alongside the new technologies. Alongside the absurd complications of the fattest new timepiece comes something we are evidently keen to hang on to \u2013 a belief that beauty and refinement are ends in themselves, and that the workbench of the skilled engineer is still revered more than the production line. A beautiful ticking timepiece gives us something back \u2013 transporting us, perhaps, to an imagined time when time was still our friend.</p> <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/timekeepers-429760.html\">Timekeepers: How the World Became Obsessed With Time</a>, by Simon Garfield, is published by Canongate at \u00a316.99.

It has impacts on why people are saving in their older years to fund their children\u2019s housing needs, not just to purchase but often rents, and it\u2019s a concern.\u201d</p> <p>He said the problem was a global one, not unique to Australia, but the problem was extreme in global financial centres.</p> <p>\u201cI was in London recently, at the pub, and the issue\u2019s the same.

  "<p>Jane Harper\u2019s The Dry opens with a quintessentially Australian scene: blowflies swarming around wet wounds in a hot, rural, remote town.</p> <p>The flies are not feeding on animal carcasses, however. They are feasting on the bloodied remains of a mother and young son, butchered in their own homes. It is, apparently, an open-shut case of murder-suicide: Luke Hadler, driven mad by years of punishing drought, turned a gun on his loved ones first, then on himself.</p> <p>Kiewarra is suffering the worst conditions of a century, a tiny outpost shimmering under \u201cday after day of burning blue sky\u201d. Farmers tell themselves \u201cit\u2019ll break\u201d, repeating the words \u201cout loud to each other like a mantra, and under their breath \u2026 like a prayer\u201d.

When policeman and former Kiewarra resident Aaron Falk returns home for his childhood friend\u2019s funeral he starts to ask questions. Did Luke really kill his wife and son in cold blood? Or is foul play at hand?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.panmacmillan.com.au/9781743548059\">Harper\u2019s debut novel</a>, published in May, portrays the outback at its most cruel: a force that gives and takes life, as unforgiving and fierce as the bleak Nordic snowscapes that have become synonymous with great crime and horror writing.</p> <p> In the wake of The Dry\u2019s success (it has already been sold to more than 20 publishers worldwide and Reese Witherspoon\u2019s production company has <a href=\"http://variety.com/2015/film/news/reese-witherspoon-the-dry-movie-1201618092/\">optioned the film rights</a>) \u2013 it is worth asking the question: how has Australian crime writing carved itself a niche using the landscape as a canvas for fear? </p> <h2>From ice and snow to the desert sun</h2> <p>There is a parallel to be drawn here with Scandinavian noir. Both regions, for example, are among the safest in the world: indeed, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-31329220\">Australian murder rates are at record lows</a>. Yet their relative peace seems to make homicide and butchery \u2013 when committed to the page \u2013 all the more alarming.</p> <p>In Scandinavia the landscape goes a long way towards creating a sense of dread, as does a bloody past and history of dark folklore. \u201cPlace matters more than ever in a globalised world,\u201d noted a 2012 <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21561109\">Economist piece titled Those Bloody Scandinavians</a>. \u201cNordic crime writers understand that the more interconnected the world is, the more people crave a sense of place \u2013 the more distinctive and unusual the better.\u201d</p> <p>A number of Australian crime and horror writers have embraced the singularity of the local landscape over the last decade. Garry Disher\u2019s Bitter Wash Road (2013) is set in the bare, brittle \u201chardscrabble country\u201d of South Australia\u2019s wheatbelt. Adrian Hyland\u2019s two crime novels Diamond Dove (2006) and Gunshot Road (2010) take place in rural towns where mangy dogs swarm. As seen by Hyland\u2019s Aboriginal protagonist \u2013 amateur detective Emily Tempest \u2013 the desert in central Australia is alive and animate; to the mining companies, however, it is a resource to be exploited. </p> <p>Charlotte Wood\u2019s feminist horror novel The Natural Way of Things, published last year and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/08/charlotte-woods-novel-the-natural-way-of-things-optioned-for-a-film\">also optioned for a film</a>, sees 10 women drugged, abducted and held against their will in the outback. The remoteness of the bush drums home the savagery of their imprisonment, and their very survival depends on their embracement of that same harsh environment. </p> <p>In The Dry, Falk wanders down gloomy country roads. Nocturnal insects rattle \u201clike white noise\u201d. Birds shriek. The community is mired in poverty. And where the river should be carving its way through the fields, there is only \u201can eerie nothingness\u201d a \u201cdusty scar in the land\u201d.</p> <p>Disher, Harper, Hyland and Wood all tap into a long tradition: one in which landscape is both a trigger for psychological change, a marker for pathetic fallacy, and a mirror that draws on deep-seated fears and cultural clashes about what it means to be Australian.<br></p> <h2>Exploration and exploitation</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/aug/25/dont-stop-there-its-a-hellhole-matthew-abbott-captures-the-murderous-majestic-australian-outback\">\u2018Don\u2019t stop there, it\u2019s a hellhole\u2019: Matthew Abbott captures the murderous, majestic Australian outback</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Early fiction in Australia saw the bush as land to be conquered. Late 19th century bush ballads \u2013 used as a tool to encourage exploration, exploitation and European settlement \u2013 lionised settlers able to tame the wild country. Like the cowboys of America\u2019s wild west, poems such as Banjo Paterson\u2019s The Man from Snowy River romanticised the brave and the brawny.</p> <p>Meanwhile, historical figures, most notably bushranger Ned Kelly, have gained legendary status for carving out a uniquely Australian identity, one enmeshed with the outback. Enduring hardship was celebrated. \u201cI am proud that I am Australian, a daughter of the Southern Cross, a child of the mighty bush,\u201d says Sybylla in (Stella) Miles Franklin\u2019s 1901 novel My Brilliant Career. \u201cA part of the bone and muscle of my nation.\u201d</p> <p>But if Australia views itself as a bush nation, today it is squarely suburban: nearly 90% of the population live in urban areas hugging the coast. That goes some way to explaining why portrayals of the bush have shifted from a terrain to be vanquished and conquered, to an entity that is \u201cother\u201d, far away and frightening.</p> <p>Early writers such as Henry Lawson recognised Australia as ripe for suspense: with the \u201ceverlasting, maddening sameness of the stunted trees\u201d, the suffocating loneliness and the danger of wild beasts all portrayed in his short story The Drover\u2019s Wife, there was no need to resort to the supernatural.</p> <p>True-life tales have bolstered rural Australia\u2019s reputation as a menacing place, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/08/we-know-who-did-this-how-solving-peter-falconios-changed-a-detectives-life\">disappearance of Peter Falconio in 2001</a>; the murders pinned on former abattoir worker <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/national/the-remote-australian-highways-where-murderers-have-hunted-their-victims/news-story/817aeb3e7ae69a374cf9c4a645e6a665\">Andy Albury on the \u201chighway of death</a>\u201d; and the fates of the Page family of five who <a href=\"http://www.simpsondesert.fl.net.au/perisha/\">perished from thirst</a> in 1963 on the Birdsville Track, their corpses discovered days later near Deadmans Sandhill.</p> <p>Literature and movies in the latter half of the 20th century revelled in the bush as a setting for horror, playing on gender roles for maximum impact. The 1970s saw the creation of two masterpieces of cinema: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/feb/14/wake-in-fright-rewatching-australian-films\">Wake in Fright</a>, directed by Ted Kotcheff and based on the 1961 novel of the same name by Kenneth Cook; and Peter Weir\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/jan/23/picnic-hanging-rock-rewatching-australian-films\">Picnic at Hanging Rock</a>, modelled on the 1967 book by Joan Lindsay. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/feb/14/wake-in-fright-rewatching-australian-films\">Wake in Fright: rewatching classic Australian films</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The former played on the isolation, pent-up violence and rampant masculinity of white outback Australia. In the latter, by contrast, schoolgirls vanish on an outing to the bush. It is noted that Hanging Rock has stood there for \u201ca million years\u201d, an ancient part of the landscape that the British could never dominate, no matter how hard they try. The girls\u2019 disappearance shatters a carefully cultivated Victorian veneer, revealing repressed sexuality and simmering madness. The landscape, quite literally, consumes them.</p> <p>Bushfires, too, are fodder to show both a combustible society \u2013 with its raw tensions between Indigenous people and settlers, between \u201crespectable\u201d femaleness and the virile, ready thump of rugged manliness \u2013 and an explosive topography. The Dry uses fire \u2013 which \u201csurged and jumped and gorged itself \u2026 like an animal\u201d \u2013 to nail-biting effect, a weapon far more deadly and devastating than any knife or gun.</p> <p>Above all else, Australian horror and crime excels in showing what can go wrong on long, lonely roads, as portrayed in the 2005 surprise-hit film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/feb/18/wolf-creek-classic-australian-films\">Wolf Creek</a>. In The Dry the most frightening part of the outback is the \u201ccrushing vastness of the open land.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe space was the thing that hit them first. There was so much of it. There was enough to drown in,\u201d writes Harper, adding: \u201cTo look out and see not another soul between you and the horizon could be a strange and disturbing sight.\u201d</p>",

But I do sympathise with his frustration, and I don\u2019t begrudge him his tactics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/oct/19/nationals-call-for-import-of-rapid-fire-adler-with-restrictions-politics-live\">Nationals call for import of rapid-fire Adler with restrictions \u2013 politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2015, Leyonhjelm was given \u2013 in writing \u2013 a <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/gun-laws-in-sights-of-senate-negotiations/news-story/9b2ecfd1c012f7a9460ba0b0fd5a5963\">commitment</a> by the Coalition government that it would allow the Adler ban to expire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/aug/28/after-20-years-australias-gun-control-debate-is-igniting-once-again\">\u201cin exchange\u201d for his vote against the Labor amendments</a> to the migration amendment (strengthening biometric integrity) bill.</p> <p>Leyonhjelm voted accordingly, yet the Adler ban is still in place.</p> <p>Leyonhjelm told Sky News that he raised directly with Turnbull his frustration that the government welched on its deal with him. Leyonhjelm says Turnbull acknowledged the situation and \u201cwas sympathetic that I had been dudded by it\u201d.</p> <p>Leyonhjelm said that he made clear to the Turnbull government that his support for the legislation to establish the Australian Building Construction Commission (ABCC) was contingent on the government living up to its commitment to lift the Adler ban. Leyonhjelm claims that the government was considering his position.</p> <p>When this proposition was put to the prime minister in question time on Tuesday \u2013 that is, that Turnbull was ready to horse-trade on gun laws in order to secure Leyonhjelm\u2019s vote for the ABCC bills \u2013 <a href=\"http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db=CHAMBER;id=chamber%2Fhansardr%2Fdc58b6e4-9f62-4cac-8b47-8eedf2e5c75d%2F0071;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2Fdc58b6e4-9f62-4cac-8b47-8eedf2e5c75d%2F0000%22\">Turnbull didn\u2019t deny it</a>.</p> <p>John Howard\u2019s gun laws are the holiest of all the sacred cows in Australian politics. It is extraordinary that justice minister Michael Keenan offered to remove the Adler ban once. And it is even more breathtaking that Turnbull appears to have contemplated doing so again.</p> <p>Why would Turnbull even consider a horse-trade on gun laws to gain support for the ABCC? Why did Turnbull take several hours to rule it out on Tuesday morning? Is his political radar really that poor?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Turnbull has form with this style of negotiation.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Consider this: maybe Turnbull never really expected to offer a horse-trade. Perhaps he had been stringing Leyonhjelm along, hoping to keep the senator in the tent as a likely \u201cyes\u201d on the ABCC legislation until the government had swung the three NXT senators and the four One Nation senators to its side. With seven votes plus the likely support of the new Family First senator, maybe Turnbull thought Leyonhjelm would get drop his gun demands and get with the momentum rather than stand in its way.</p> <p>Turnbull has form with this style of negotiation. Former prime minister <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-29/rudd-releases-letters-to-turnbull-on-un-secretary-general-bid/7674038\">Kevin Rudd\u2019s letters</a> paint a picture of Turnbull stringing Rudd along on the question of whether the government would support Rudd\u2019s UN secretary general nomination, letting him believe that support was likely forthcoming but never really committing. As Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor, Katharine Murphy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/29/hurt-feelings-why-did-malcolm-turnbull-send-kevin-rudd-mixed-messages\">pointed out</a>, it seems Turnbull thought he could \u201cwalk both sides of the street\u201d on Rudd\u2019s nomination until after the election \u2013 when Turnbull thought he would be better able to finesse a complex situation off the back of a bigger personal mandate.</p> <p>As the Rudd saga showed, stringing someone along in political negotiations can have dire consequences. Leyonhjelm made the most of his opportunity and extracted more than a pound of Turnbull\u2019s political flesh. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/19/adler-shotgun-new-south-wales-deputy-premier-backs-lifting-ban-on-imports\">Adler shotgun: New South Wales deputy premier backs lifting ban on imports</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Leyonhjelm waited until his vote was most needed by the government. Not bound by cabinet confidentiality or party-room discipline, he adroitly used the media to his advantage. He produced written confirmation of his horse-trade. He made the government look, at best, opportunistic, and at worst, without core convictions. </p> <p>He exposed faultlines in the Coalition: Tony Abbott <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TonyAbbottMHR/status/788185131261362176\">tweeted</a> barely veiled criticism of Turnbull for considering the Leyonjhelm deal (never mind it was the Abbott regime that offered the deal in the first place), while <a href=\"http://www.portstephensexaminer.com.au/story/4236979/coalition-mps-back-calls-to-allow-adler-gun-imports-hours-after-malcolm-turnbull-says-ban-is-permanent/?cs=12\">some Nationals MPs are still supporting</a> the lifting of the ban.</p> <p>Leyonhjelm created a media maelstrom that engulfed the government, making it abundantly clear to everyone that his vote on the ABCC legislation could not be taken for granted.</p> <p>Leyonhjelm isn\u2019t the first upper house crossbench parliamentarian to hold a government\u2019s economic reforms hostage to pro-gun ultimatums. In 2009, the Shooters party demanded the NSW government allow hunting in national parks in exchange for supporting the sale of NSW Lotteries.</p> <p>At the time the premier Nathan Rees didn\u2019t acquiesce but the standoff ground his government to a near halt. Rees <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/environment/conservation/cull-offer-puts-shooters-in-sights-20090625-cy9i.html\">had to shut down the NSW Legislative Council</a> in order to avoid not just a loss on the lotteries legislation, but also other politically messy problems the Shooters could have created: calls for papers, instituting inquiries or blocking other bills. The upper house shutdown was a drastic last step to avert political disaster. But the shutdown became a foul political problem in and of itself: the closed legislative council symbolised a government unable to function.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/18/malcolm-turnbull-gun-control-david-leyonhjelm-labor-unions-senate\">Malcolm Turnbull is too busy explaining to actually tell anyone what he thinks | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A crossbench MP on a single-issue mission can exact a lot of damage, especially when they perceive that the government fails to deal honestly, fairly and openly with him or her.</p> <p>The Coalition government should have figured this out by now. Don\u2019t tell me it can\u2019t be done. My government kept the upper house open and got all our major legislation passed. Julia Gillard\u2019s government, without a majority in either chamber, was incredibly successful in implementing its legislative agenda, with Anthony Albanese playing a key role in negotiating with the crossbench MPs.</p> <p>It\u2019s not rocket science. It starts with respecting that crossbenchers are duly elected MPs with their own mandates and constituencies. It helps to create one direct line of communication between the crossbench MPs and someone with authority to speak on the government\u2019s behalf. The government should be clear on what it will and won\u2019t do, and it should only make deals on which it can deliver.</p> <p>It is somewhat staggering that, after three years in office, the Coalition still hasn\u2019t figured this out. As senator David Leyonhjelm told Sky News yesterday, \u201cIf I am going to deal with the government, I need to be able to trust them. In this situation, you know, I\u2019ve been dudded. How can I trust them in the future, and how can the crossbench in general deal with the government, if you can\u2019t rely on their word?\u201d</p>"
