  "<p>Cosmetics companies must be banned from using plastic microbeads in scrubs, toothpaste and beauty products because of the marine pollution they are causing, say a group of MPs.</p> <p>Members of the environmental audit committee have called for a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/14/nment-backs-microbeads-ban-george-eustice\">ban</a> within 18 months after hearing that trillions of tiny pieces of plastic are accumulating in the world\u2019s oceans, lakes and estuaries, harming marine life and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/20/microfibers-plastic-pollution-oceans-patagonia-synthetic-clothes-microbeads\">entering the food chain</a>. About 86 tonnes of microplastics are released into the environment every year in the UK from facial exfoliants alone, they were told. </p> <p>Microplastic pollution comes from the fragmentation of larger pieces of plastic waste, small synthetic fibres from clothing and the microbeads used in cosmetics and other products. The microbeads in scrubs, shower gels and toothpastes are an avoidable part of this plastic pollution problem. A single shower could result in 100,000 plastic particles entering the ocean, said the committee chair, Mary Creagh.</p> <p>\u201cWe need a full, legal ban, preferably at an international level as pollution does not respect borders,\u201d she added. \u201cIf this isn\u2019t possible after our vote to leave the EU, then the government should introduce a national ban. The best way to reduce this pollution is to prevent plastic being flushed into the sea in the first place.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8791a932b573c0bc5609730e06383f56423c76aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8791a932b573c0bc5609730e06383f56423c76aa/0_0_5344_3207/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Closeup of plastic microbeads on the tip of a finger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plastic microbeads.

But the committee said a national ban, preferably starting within 18 months, would have advantages for consumers and the industry in terms of consistency, universality and confidence. It is a significant and avoidable environmental problem. Addressing it would show commitment to reducing the wider problem of microplastics.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/08/mps-attack-loopholes-in-cosmetic-industrys-microbead-phase-out\">Microbeads</a> are part of the wider issue of microplastics. Their small size means that they can be ingested by marine life and have the potential to transfer chemicals to and from the marine environment. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/20/microfibers-plastic-pollution-oceans-patagonia-synthetic-clothes-microbeads\">How your clothes are poisoning our oceans and food supply</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Between 80,000 and 219,000 tonnes of microplastics enter the European marine environment a year. Opportunities to capture microplastics through enhanced washing-machine filtration systems and improved waste and water sewage treatment processes must also be explored.</p> <p>The committee called for urgent research, saying: \u201cIf someone eats six oysters, it is likely they will have eaten 50 particles of microplastics. Relatively little research has been done on potential impacts to human health or the marine ecology.\u201d</p> <p>Most of the world\u2019s ocean plastics by weight are large pieces of debris (eg fishing equipment, bottles and plastic bags). However, the dominant type of debris by quantity is microplastics. It is estimated that 15-51tn microplastic particles have accumulated in the ocean, with microplastics reported at the sea surface and on shorelines worldwide. They are also present in remote locations including deep sea sediments and arctic sea ice.</p> <p>Richard Thompson, director of the international marine litter research unit at Plymouth University, said: \u201cMicrobeads in cosmetics are an avoidable source of microplastic to the environment and so legislation would be a welcome step.\u201d </p> <p>Tamara Galloway, at the University of Exeter, agreed. \u201cPollution from microbeads is a truly global problem,\u201d she said. \u201cTides and currents can carry pollution across oceans to countries a long distance from where they were originally released. Ideally, any legislation to control them should be on an international level.\u201d </p>",

With the second fixture rained off, the electric Test pairing of the left-armer Wahab Riaz and the leg-spinner Yasir Shah did not have a run-out but are expected to feature on the south coast.</p> <p>Azhar, a captain wrestling to produce some Misbah magic, views the England tour as vital preparation for the 2017 Champions Trophy and the World Cup that follows two years later \u2013 automatic qualification for the latter is not guaranteed as it stands \u2013 and hopes that some of the magic from the Test side will rub off.</p> <p>\u201cWe are all very confident, no one rated us very highly and there were doubts if we could win the Test matches here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe boys really believed in the Test series, so here also we believe we can do it.

From the outset, residents raised concerns that the new water source was causing a spate of rashes and hair loss.</p> <p>\u201cThe rashes Flint residents have reported are of great concern to the community and to all of us who are working to improve health in the city,\u201d said Dr Nicole Lurie, the federal department of health and human services assistant secretary for preparedness and response, in a statement on Tuesday.</p> <p>The results could inflame tensions among residents who have been rankled by the city\u2019s two-year water crisis. The decision to switch to the Flint river, made when the city was operated by a state-appointed emergency manager, led to significant public health issues, after officials confirmed last fall that state environmental regulators failed to require the city to treat the river water with corrosion-control chemicals.</p> <p>The oversight has been linked to widespread lead contamination in the city, and, potentially, an outbreak of legionnaires\u2019 disease, which led to 12 deaths in and around Flint.</p> <p>For months, state health officials told Flint residents that it was safe to bathe in the city\u2019s water and that <a href=\"http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/michigan/flint-water-crisis/2016/01/27/bathing-flint-water-rash-uptick/79422326/\">\u201cno scientific link\u201d</a> existed to connect the Flint river to rashes.

Dr Walter Barkey, a local dermatologist who volunteered to assist with the investigation, said those residents had a \u201cvery heightened level of concern\u201d about the city\u2019s current water quality. </p> <p>More than 77% of respondents reported that symptoms began when they noticed changes in water quality from their faucet. Half of the respondents reported rash aggravation from the water or through bathing.</p> <p>Researchers cautioned in a presentation that water samples from homes of the 390 participants in the investigation were not available for the period in which Flint\u2019s river was the city\u2019s main water source. Still, the study reviewed data from Flint\u2019s water treatment plant when the local river was used and found fluctuations in the river water\u2019s pH, chlorine and hardness were, at times, \u201chigher during that period and might have led to rashes\u201d, a news release about the study stated.</p> <p>Since Flint returned to its previous water source in October 2015, 44% of participants experienced an onset of rashes.

While businesses are not yet signalling a weaker economic environment, consumers are clearly less confident after the Brexit-vote. This is the third decline in a row of confidence and it marks uncertainty over the current geopolitical and economic climate, but also about the personal economic situation as July\u2019s decline in confidence indicated. With indications from this morning\u2019s PMI that hiring might be slowing, that concern could be valid. If this were to be the case, that would likely slow down domestic demand in the Eurozone, which has been driving the recovery over recent quarters.</p> <p>The picture remains that optimism post-Brexit is premature. Although the PMI reached a 7-month high this morning, consumer confidence declines indicate that uncertainty does linger and that growth is likely to be affected by Brexit uncertainty as the process of the British exit drags along. Because of that, we remain of the opinion that growth rates are likely to decline in the second half of the year and that the ECB will announce further stimulus to counter the weakening growth environment shortly.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bc5ce6e4b048662988f5fd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-23T14:26:57.525Z\">3.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The mixed signals from the eurozone should not trouble the European Central Bank too much, according to Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com.

But these calls, like Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-calls-complete-shutdown-clinton-foundation-n636051\">demand</a> on Monday that it close, are missing an essential point about the foundation\u2019s work: if it disappeared, those helped by the work it supports could fall through the widening cracks of our unequal global society.</p> <p>Worldwide, the foundation, which <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-inside-story-of-how-the-clintons-built-a-2-billion-global-empire/2015/06/02/b6eab638-0957-11e5-a7ad-b430fc1d3f5c_story.html\">has raised</a> over $2bn, employs more than 2,000 people and had a 2015 budget of over $223m, focuses on initiatives that cut the costs of Aids and malaria drugs, supply pediatric drugs for Aids and for diarrhea (a more important initiative than people may know), test and distribute mosquito nets, help women and girls become entrepreneurs, provide seeds and equipment to farmers, replant trees and, in the United States, partner businesses with local government to help create health and wellness initiatives.</p> <p>What makes the foundation different from other charities is that, as a public foundation and not a private charity, they do the work themselves rather than funneling money to others, dividing their efforts between development, health access, health matters and climate change. The Clinton Foundation also implements programming for foundations that donate to them because they are able to do the work the other foundations don\u2019t have the infrastructure or international influence to do themselves.</p> <p>Whatever questions may be raised about the extent to which Clinton Foundation fundraising would become a conflict of interest should Hillary Clinton win the presidency, charity watchdog groups have put the operational finances consistently in the <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2015/06/where-does-clinton-foundation-money-go\">80 to 89% range</a> for charity spending versus overhead, which is a highly rated percentage in the field. </p> <p>Does that mean the foundation shouldn\u2019t change anything it does if Hillary Clinton becomes president? It has been announced that it will stop accepting foreign or questionable donations, that Bill Clinton would cease to fundraise and resign from the board, and that there would be a firewall erected between family and foundation. These are all sound decisions.</p> <p>They may affect the foundation\u2019s finances anyway. The foundation has essentially leveraged the Clintons\u2019 popularity into a fundraising powerhouse for initiatives that span the globe. It\u2019s easy, therefore, in this environment of hyper-partisan politics, where often absurd and baseless accusations are thrown against the wall to see if they will stick, for Secretary Clinton\u2019s supporters to become concerned about an appearance of impropriety and call for change.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It\u2019s important they remember, however, that real lives could be affected. If supporters call for the initiatives to be turned over to other NGOs, which ones should pick up the mantle? Which ones are working successfully on health, development, equality <em tabindex=\"-1\">and</em> climate change? What other groups can absorb and finance the programs, support the health workers, the educators, the partners on the ground, or show up to challenge drug companies as the Clintons, often through sheer force of will, have been able to do when they <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-inside-story-of-how-the-clintons-built-a-2-billion-global-empire/2015/06/02/b6eab638-0957-11e5-a7ad-b430fc1d3f5c_story.html\">make the companies</a> drop prices to what someone in Africa can afford? </p> <p>Other presidents have had conflicts of interest. They\u2019ve managed them with blind trusts and financial firewalls. If the Clinton Foundation can do the same, there\u2019s no reason why it can\u2019t continue its work. If it cannot continue, however, whether due to political perception or more serious factors, time must be given for the diverse initiatives to find a home so that the vulnerable are not harmed in the interest of politics over the greater good. </p>",

  "<p>The ethnobotanist Paul House, who has died of cancer aged 55, was fascinated by the interaction of human societies with their surrounding ecosystems, and always coupled social and environmental advocacy with scientific inquiry. He spent nearly 30 years in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/honduras\">Honduras</a>, working to understand and protect the country\u2019s ecosystems and inspiring a generation of young Honduran biologists.</p> <p>He carried out fieldwork in areas ranging from the cloud forests of the country\u2019s highest mountains to the dry thorn scrub of the interior valleys. It highlighted the need for active conservation, given the high levels of endemism \u2013 when a species is unique to a particular place \u2013 in Honduras\u2019s vulnerable ecosystems, and the pressures from expanding agriculture, urban sprawl and infrastructure projects. He identified several new plant and tree species and was a member of an international panel of experts on threatened flora in the Central American isthmus.</p> <p>In the 1990s he carried out groundbreaking work on the <a href=\"http://tawahka.org/\">Tawahka tribe</a>, a dwindling group of fewer than 3,000 people living in the lower basin of the Patuca river in La Mosquitia, which he published in his book Farmers of the Forest (1997). He lived with the Tawahka and learned their language, one of the few outsiders to do so, and demonstrated how their livelihoods and culture are intimately linked to their forests and to the Patuca River, which is now threatened by hydroelectric development.</p> <p>Paul also showed that the Tawahka people understood that interdependence, and that they taught their children to use the forest without destroying it. He helped develop the management plan of the <a href=\"http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/adopt/projects/honduras\">Tawahka Asangni Biosphere Reserve</a>, an important link in the chain of protected areas running between Honduras and Nicaragua.</p> <p>He recognised the need for pragmatism and adaptation in conservation, and showed that the Tawakha knew that they could not remain isolated from the outside world. In the aftermath of the devastation caused by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/1998/nov/07/weather.climatechange\">Hurricane Mitch</a> in 1998, he worked to mobilise aid for the Tawahka.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cc4845fa54c0bb07eb9e7baacab91c8be7c5e64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cc4845fa54c0bb07eb9e7baacab91c8be7c5e64/0_0_5315_3537/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A member of the Tawahka tribe of La Mosquitia, Honduras, the dwindling group that was the subject of Paul House\u2019s 1997 book Farmers of the Forest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A member of the Tawahka tribe of La Mosquitia, Honduras, the dwindling group that was the subject of Paul House\u2019s 1997 book Farmers of the Forest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although a quarter of Honduras is designated as protected areas, the institutional framework is weak and funding is scarce. There is no national service of forest guards and the management of protected areas is often delegated by the government\u2019s Forest Conservation Institute (ICF) to under-resourced NGOs, with little accountability.</p> <p>Paul took part in a landmark <a href=\"http://www.nationalparks-worldwide.info/cam/honduras/hn_parks_study1.htm\">2002 study</a> on the rationalisation of the Honduran protected-area system, which identified 39 high-priority sites, and he later worked on an ecosystems map of the country. In 1991-92 he spearheaded collaboration between the <a href=\"https://www.unah.edu.hn/\">National Autonomous University of Honduras </a> (UNAH) and the UK-funded Honduran forest conservation project CONSERFORH, exploring and collecting in the country\u2019s threatened cloud forests, whose isolation has resulted in particularly high levels of endemism. The collection gathered on <a href=\"http://www.honduras.com/celaque-national-park/\">Celaque</a>, the country\u2019s highest mountain, was sent to the <a href=\"http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/\">Missouri Botanical Garden</a>, whose experts identified 745 \u201cPaul House specimens\u201d.</p> <p>Paul\u2019s work also highlighted the importance of the dry lowland thorn scrub, a neglected ecosystem under pressure from agricultural clearance, road development and urbanisation. In the <a href=\"http://www.carnegiecouncil.org/publications/ethics_online/0093\">Agu\u00e1n Valley</a>, the thorn scrub is the habitat of the threatened <a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=1934\">Honduran Emerald</a>, the country\u2019s only endemic hummingbird. He lobbied the development banks to block the building of a road into the valley until the government had agreed to set aside tracts of thorn scrub to protect the Emerald\u2019s habitat.</p> <p>Born in Rochford, Essex, Paul was the second child of Raymond, a motor mechanic, and his wife, Margaret (nee Payne). He attended <a href=\"http://www.greenswardacademy.org/\">Greensward Lane comprehensive school</a> in Hockley and South East Essex sixth form college in Benfleet. He read biochemistry at the <a href=\"http://www.sussex.ac.uk/\">University of Sussex</a> and held an MSc in taxonomy and a PhD in ethnobotany, based on hiswork with the Tawahka, from the <a href=\"http://www.reading.ac.uk/\">University of Reading</a>.</p> <p>His first visit to Honduras came in 1986 as a volunteer with the <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/partners/ngodirectory/4ea918f926/progressio-formerly-catholic-institute-international-relations.html\">Catholic Institute for International Relations</a>. He was assigned to the biology department of UNAH, where he helped establish the country\u2019s first collection of native medicinal plants, later publishing a book on the subject with his wife and collaborator, Margarita Rivas, a fellow ethnobotanist whom he met at the university. A talented amateur musician, he would play his flute and piccolo to entertain CIIR get-togethers.</p> <p>Paul stayed in Honduras for nearly 30 years, apart from a couple of years in the mid-90s spent at Reading University and the Natural History Museum in London while he was finishing his PhD. He worked mostly in the UNAH biology faculty, helping establish the postgraduate programme in botany and conservation biology and setting up the university\u2019s botanical garden; he eventually became director of the National Herbarium.</p> <p>At the time of his death, he was working on a book about Honduran orchids. He had a passion for orchids and cacti, maintaining an impressive collection at his home in Tegucigalpa. His passion for orchids once saved his life: after climbing a tree to collect an orchid in a national park he missed a flight in a small aircraft which crashed, killing all on board.</p> <p>Paul returned to the UK for cancer treatment in 2012.

Rivera-Garc\u00eda is the state epidemiologist in Puerto Rico, a woman tasked with tracking every single Zika-infected pregnant woman in the US territory. </p> <p>Less than two weeks after the US health and human services administration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/12/zika-virus-epidemic-puerto-rico-state-of-emergency-mosquito\">declared the spread of Zika on the island an epidemic</a>, Rivera-Garc\u00eda said it\u2019s not frustration or anger that overtakes her when she adds a new woman\u2019s name to a list of roughly 700 confirmed to be infected with the disease. </p> <p>It\u2019s sadness. </p> <p>\u201cEvery time I have to add a pregnant woman to that list, I just think of what\u2019s going to be of this pregnancy,\u201d she said, her eyes visibly wet. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to be of this child later on, and, it\u2019s, it\u2019s \u2013 it breaks my heart.\u201d</p> <p>As much as <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2016/06/17/zika-virus-spreading-rapidly-across-puerto-rico/\">25% of the island\u2019s population</a> could have the disease by the end of mosquito season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates, and up to 50 pregnant women each day are infected on the island.</p> <p>A recent study projected as many as <a href=\"http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2545827\">270 babies</a> could be born with the debilitating birth defect microcephaly, between now and mid-2017. In a normal year, doctors expect 16.</p> <p>The defect causes infants of mothers infected with the virus to be born with abnormally small heads, and suffer lifelong developmental disorders. Some will have trouble walking. Others may have hearing or vision loss, trouble swallowing or seizures. Many are likely to have <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/t0414-zika-update.html\">shortened life expectancy</a>.</p> <p>But health officials have had difficulty translating those projections into urgency among many Puerto Rico residents, who have been dogged in the past by tropical diseases with more apparent symptoms, such as dengue and chikungunya. Indeed, the government\u2019s efforts to control the virus seem hampered at every turn, thwarted by apathy, lack of trust, misinformation, insecticide resistance and even architecture. </p> <p>\u201cThe system doesn\u2019t work so of course people are going to be skeptical,\u201d said Joe Torra, 40, a professional driver in San Juan. </p> <p>Referencing colonialism, Torra said: \u201cThe best way to control minds is to control bodies.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cf0b52a386138671cd79cced63972a908e5ab08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cf0b52a386138671cd79cced63972a908e5ab08/0_123_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A health worker prepares insecticide before fumigating a neighborhood in San Juan on 27 January 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A health worker prepares insecticide before fumigating a neighborhood in San Juan in January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alvin Baez/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018False alarms\u2019</h2> <p>Denisse Vel\u00e1zquez, 36, stood under the shade of a tree in Old San Juan, <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/p0729-zika-infections-puerto-rico.html\">one of the hardest-hit municipalities</a>, as she said that the government \u201ccreated false alarms\u201d.</p> <p>Juan Mart\u00ednez, 43, said that with \u201call these diseases we have seen, it\u2019s something normal\u201d, referring to periodic outbreaks of dengue the island has struggled with since the 1980s, and the recent chikungunya outbreak. \u201cIn the Caribbean there has always been mosquitoes.\u201d</p> <p>Even tourism officials have reinforced the view that the Zika risk has been overblown. </p> <p>\u201cFrom the very beginning the numbers that were given were based on projections. The reality is that as of today, less than half of 1% of the population has the virus,\u201d Clarisa Jim\u00e9nez, CEO of the Puerto Rico Hotel and Tourism Association, told <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/18/puerto-rico-tourism-chief-pushes-back-on-zika-virus-warnings.html\">CNBC\u2019s Squawkbox</a>. \u201cThe only issue here is if you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d<br></p> <p>Jim\u00e9nez focused on the roughly 10,600 Puerto Ricans who had, at the time, been diagnosed with Zika by the CDC. The figure is an underestimate, because four out five infected people have no symptoms and probably do not know they have the virus.</p> <p>Now, near the end of August, the health department of Puerto Rico and the CDC have diagnosed 12,800 Zika infections, including more than 670 in pregnant women, believed to represent only a fraction of actual cases. </p> <p>So far, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/14/health/puerto-rico-reports-first-microcephaly-case-linked-to-zika.html\">only one child</a> has been born with microcephaly. But experts expect that number to increase dramatically in coming months, particularly from September to December.</p> <p>Health professionals believe the most dangerous time for a pregnant woman to be infected is in her first trimester, though more research is needed. Those pregnancies are expected to begin coming to term this fall.</p> <p>\u201cRight now, most of the births we have seen are among second and third trimester infections,\u201d said Rivera-Garc\u00eda. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s not just a number. There\u2019s a family behind that number.\u201d Doctors suspect that even these cases, which are less dramatic in appearance, could result in problems that won\u2019t manifest until much later. </p> <p>The island\u2019s timetable of epidemic infection is about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/25/zika-virus-mosquitoes-countries-affected-pregnant-women-children-microcephaly\">one year behind Brazil\u2019s</a>. In December 2015, as cases of microcephaly began to surge in Brazil, cases of <a href=\"http://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/seregistraprimercasodelviruszikaenpuertorico-2145583/\">locally acquired infections</a> were just beginning to show up in Puerto Rico. </p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re involved in major epidemics, and particularly this one for some reason, I\u2019ve been unable to disconnect,\u201d said Dr Francisco Alvarado-Ramy, a senior CDC official and native Puerto Rican who helps lead the federal government\u2019s response to the epidemic. He is stationed at the Dengue Branch, an outpost in San Juan established to combat another virus spread by the same mosquito as Zika, the aggressive <em>Aedes aegypti</em>.</p> <p>\u201cThe moment that I go to sleep to the moment that I wake up, my mind seems to be around Zika all the time, trying to think if there\u2019s any other thing we can do,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cWhen something goes wrong, it\u2019s also a very fast way down, downstairs in terms of your emotional wellbeing. We\u2019re trying to prepare our staff, as well, if we start seeing a lot of people with bad outcomes how to handle that emotionally.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83d3777970d734ecd2e5d2267ae0ccf569114526\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83d3777970d734ecd2e5d2267ae0ccf569114526/0_0_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Employees with the municipal government collect used tires on 7 August 2016 in the Rio Piedras section of San Juan, Puerto Rico.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Employees with the municipal government collect used tires on 7 August 2016 in the R\u00edo Piedras section of San Juan, Puerto Rico.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angel Valentin/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Cat, dog, mosquito<br></h2> <p>\u201cWe have in Puerto Rico a dog, a cat and a mosquito,\u201d said Carmen Deseda, the former state epidemiologist who battled several epidemics of dengue, a hemorrhagic fever that can incapacitate a person for weeks. \u201cThe problem is not the mosquito, it\u2019s the virus.\u201d</p> <p>Deseda expressed a view common among Puerto Ricans: the mosquito is here to stay, fumigating won\u2019t work, so the government better find some other way to deal with this. </p> <p>She was among many prominent opponents of fumigating the island with an insecticide called Naled, a solution proposed by the CDC and used on about 6m acres of land each year in Florida. Many residents were outraged that the federal government would, in their view without permission, spray chemicals over the island. </p> <p>\u201cWhen they said that I was very upset,\u201d said Miguel Pellot, 48, the owner of a smoothie stand called Fruta Fruit in San Juan. \u201c<em>\u00bfC\u00f3mo se dice, una falta de respeto?</em>\u201d he said, asking how to express lack of respect in English. </p> <p>\u201cFor people here, this is nothing new. We\u2019ve had mosquitoes here since we were born,\u201d Deseda said. \u201cThey don\u2019t feel threatened by the mosquito, because it\u2019s been always with them.\u201d</p> <p>Deseda said government fumigation encourages apathy among the population. \u201cThe government is doing something so they don\u2019t have to anything.\u201d </p> <p>Ceda V\u00e9lez, a 36-year-old woman working a juice stand near San Juan\u2019s cruise ship ports said she was in favor of government fumigation. </p> <p>\u201cWe use repellent, but at least it would help with where the mosquitoes breed, to kill the mosquitoes,\u201d she said in Spanish. \u201cI worry.\u201d</p> <p>Puerto Rico won\u2019t fumigate with Naled from planes, as Florida does. And even if Puerto Rican authorities decided to fumigate street-side from trucks, only <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-zika-mosquitoes-idUSKCN0WY47T\">about 12</a> vehicles on the island are outfitted to spray for mosquitoes. Regional resistance to insecticides has also confounded eradication efforts. </p> <p>Some residents believe the island was a guinea pig for <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2775139/\">past federal government experiments</a>, that Zika was mild and posed no risk, that they weren\u2019t going to stop \u201cliving\u201d, or were simply misinformed about how to prevent exposure.</p> <p>\u201cI had, yes, but I drink Tylenol, <em>y ya</em>,\u201d said Naara Nieves, 39, who stood outside at noon in San Juan proselytizing, a gregarious evangelist for Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. \u201cI think the women who are pregnant, is bad, but for me, no.\u201d</p> <p>Marylin Vigo, who was visiting her sister on the island from Brooklyn, New York, said her relatives called her \u201cparanoid\u201d for even slathering on mosquito repellent.</p> <p>\u201cShe goes, \u2018Ugh! That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to get Zika, because of mosquito bites,\u2019\u201d Vigo said, describing her sister\u2019s reaction. This is despite her sister\u2019s belief that Vigo\u2019s 29-year-old nephew just contracted the virus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/24/puerto-rico-condom-prices-zika-virus\">Puerto Rico to hold firm on condom prices to fight Zika virus</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>A cultural gulf</h2> <p>One of the most cited differences between Puerto Rico and the mainland is the lack of screened windows and <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2873752/\">air conditioning</a>, which hamper the spread of mosquito-borne diseases in places like Texas.</p> <p>Tropical breezes course uninhibited through flung-open doors, patios and unscreened louvre window shades.

We need to understand what will be that one driver, or the drivers, to effect behavior change.\u201d</p> <p>Even for those who might want screens, it could be a real burden.</p> <p>Nearly half the population, 46%, lives in poverty. The average per-capita income is just $19,600, meaning an air-conditioned bedroom may be unattainable.</p> <p>A raft of other science conducted on the island is looking at other solutions. Children of Zika-infected mothers will be followed until they are three years old. Alvarado and his team collect blood and placenta samples from Zika-infected women who give birth and miscarry. </p> <p>Traps are being re-engineered at the Dengue Branch, including the promising, pesticide-free innovation of a bucket that uses fermenting hay and water to trap mosquitoes. </p> <p>\u201cIt drives me to keep trying and see where can we improve, what else can we do,\u201d said Rivera-Garc\u00eda. \u201cI think for all the responders both local and stateside with many Puerto Ricans in various areas of expertise \u2013 they\u2019re coming back, donating their time, or asking for deployments in Puerto Rico.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p> </p>",
  "<p>What\u2019s been the fallout from the EU referendum so far? One unexpected consequence is a rise in interest in moving to the land of the long white cloud. <a href=\"https://www.newzealandnow.govt.nz/\"> The New Zealand immigration website</a> \u2013 a guide to living and working in the country \u2013 recorded a huge spike in queries from British nationals. So much so that the New Zealand Herald <a href=\"http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11698368\">playfully declared it a \u201cBritish invasion\u201d</a>. <br></p> <p>But what should Brits expect if they relocate? And why is the country so appealing?

It\u2019s a great idea \u2013 they have a great sense of humour. The only advice I have is come with loads of money, because New Zealand is really expensive. The one word I would use to describe New Zealand is easy \u2013 everything is so straightforward here. It\u2019s also stunningly beautiful, with great schools, great healthcare, good weather and great food. The negatives are our prime minister and his conservative government. Housing is also ridiculously expensive in Auckland. We have dreadful traffic and an expensive (and pretty hopeless) public transport system. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/new-zealand-the-tonic-for-brits-seeking-to-escape-brexit-blues\">More spacious without the Brexit: why Britons are flocking to New Zealand</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Robin, 40, from Wellington: \u2018Flights and beer are expensive\u2019<br></h2> <p>I welcome Brits \u2013 the more the merrier, I say. New Zealand is a wonderful place, but it does need more people here (from the UK or anywhere else). Be prepared for things to cost a fair bit more than the UK, especially travel and beer.</p> <p>The \u201cshort hop\u201d to Australia is nearly a four-hour flight, too, and there isn\u2019t the choice of going via Easyjet or Ryanair to keep the cost down. Beer in the city (I live in Wellington) is NZ$10 a glass (\u00a35.50), which is often annoyingly called a pint yet is more likely to be 350-425ml. Similarly, at the local nationwide chain supermarket nearby I recently paid NZ$28/kg (\u00a316/kg) for green beans and NZ$6.50 (\u00a33.60) for a cucumber.</p> <p>The weather, house prices, salaries and traffic vary massively up and down New Zealand, so your experience will depend on where you choose to live. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08b1b8939278a3d366157eaac458b5844bc72777\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08b1b8939278a3d366157eaac458b5844bc72777/0_0_2448_3264/750.jpg\" alt=\"Mount Ruapehu\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The picture I\u2019ve shared above is one of Mount Ruapehu, which you\u2019ll see when flying between Wellington and Auckland. It makes me smile and certainly beats driving up and down the M1. </p> <h2>Graeme Horne, 36, from Auckland: \u2018People here get up early and leave work early\u2019</h2> <p>It\u2019s great for Brits to come over here, as it will be pretty easy for them to feel immediately at home. For the locals, the society is not perfect. Poverty and hungry kids are a problem. The rate of immigration is causing some trouble \u2013 such as crazy house prices and pressure on jobs and services \u2013 and it\u2019s not inconceivable that immigrants will be blamed, as they have been in the UK. <br></p> <p>Make sure you understand what the job market is like before you move. Even Auckland \u2013 the biggest city \u2013 is relatively small, and the jobs that are in demand here are quite different from back home. There simply aren\u2019t a large number of well-paid office jobs, because the local market is so small and the country is very focused on the export of commodities rather than the local consumer. </p> <p>If you want to enjoy nature, sports, or simply a slower pace of life than the UK, then this is definitely the place for you. </p> <p>People here get up early, go to work around 8am, and leave work early compared to the UK. This makes it a really good place to have a more family-focused life as they tend to be heading home from work at 4-5pm. </p> <p>The worst thing by far is of course the isolation from friends and family. New Zealand really is as far away as you can possibly get! I\u2019ve heard of people starting a family and having to move back home because they needed to be closer to their support network. <br></p> <h2>Bob George, from Maungautoroto: \u2018Consider New Zealand if you want to add adventure to your life\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"926a6966d2963be4620dad7fb02c979e5db677eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/926a6966d2963be4620dad7fb02c979e5db677eb/0_0_2663_1600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Zealand road\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I am British. I moved to New Zealand in 2008; I rather wish I had moved here earlier. People are welcoming, both at the national level and on a personal level \u2013 you go into a shop and people chat. <br></p> <p>If you are thinking of moving to New Zealand, do it for positive reasons \u2013 forget what bugs you about Britain. Consider New Zealand if you want to add adventure to your life, if you get thrilled by stunning vistas, like an outdoor life, enjoy people and activities and want to develop as a person. <br></p> <p>New Zealand, like Britain, has a very mixed culture: I run a tennis group and get people from 20 different countries coming along (Auckland has a bigger mix of nationalities than most UK cities). Maori represent about 10% of the population and have impressive spiritual and social values. <br></p> <p>The worst parts of living here include the poor infrastructure. Earthquakes and volcanoes might be a challenge too. It\u2019s also very cut off \u2013 there are advantages in being 2,000km from the next nearest countries, but also a sense of isolation from the world.</p> <h2>Andy, from Auckland: \u2018House prices have spiralled out of control\u2019<br></h2> <p>I moved to New Zealand from the UK almost 20 years ago. In that time I\u2019ve seen house prices spiral out of reach for almost anyone but cash-rich investors. If you are serious about putting down roots here you will need to come to terms with house prices in the urban centres of around NZ$1m (\u00a3555,600). If you have children, a house in a desirable catchment area will set you back a fair bit more.</p> <p>There are undoubtedly benefits to relocating, however. For example, the weather is generally much more reliable in summer. Auckland in particular is an ethnically diverse and exciting city with many beautiful parks and beaches, which are never packed in the way an English beach such as Bournemouth is.</p> <p>There is crime here, and terrible congestion at times. The health service is also under the same strain as the NHS, although it is still largely free at point of use. As a tip for anyone thinking to make the move, remember that if someone says \u201cbring a plate\u201d on an invitation, be sure to put some food on it too. I got caught out by that one a couple of times early on. </p> <h2>Steve, 68, from Puhoi: \u2018Respect the local environment\u2019<br></h2> <p>I\u2019m not keen on New Zealand becoming overpopulated. I know that may sound very nimbyish but the fragile environment can only take so much. I worry about people coming here with little regard for how they might damage the surrounding area, so if you do come please find out about our original ecosystems and how some are in danger of total extinction. Learn to love what is unique to the country. <br></p> <h2>Hayley Ray, 27, from Auckland: \u2018I was shocked at the culture difference\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b293208df1501f0802a38aef3948328b6d2643d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b293208df1501f0802a38aef3948328b6d2643d/0_259_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Hayley Ray\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As a Brit working and living in New Zealand, I think it\u2019s amazing news that more British people are deciding to move here. New Zealand is still growing and developing. It\u2019s a fantastic opportunity for people who want to contribute to the growth of this wonderful country. You won\u2019t regret making the move. </p> <p>Raglan, a small seaside town 50km west of Hamilton, is so stunning when summer kicks in. However, I have fallen in love with Auckland. There is so much to do and see. Every suburb has its own unique personality, which makes Auckland a fantastic city to live in. </p> <p>When I first moved to New Zealand I was shocked at the culture difference. However, when you look for it the country has much to offer. Sure, you may not have the same music scene and high-street fashion shops, or the same access to watching the Olympics without having to pay for Sky. But you have amazing companies that manufacture goods by hand. In Britain this is becoming very rare. <br></p> <h2>Mick, 32, from Wellington: \u2018Leave bigotry behind\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ba2bbae820629be3b5f10e6cf9e48d34dc39be3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ba2bbae820629be3b5f10e6cf9e48d34dc39be3/0_0_1659_996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"view in New Zealand\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Our country is populated by immigrants, so naturally they are most welcome here. My father\u2019s family immigrated here in the 1970s from Scotland, and they never looked back. When he\u2019s travelled overseas since he\u2019s told anyone who will listen to follow suit. Immigrants fit right in here, and there are many different ethnic community centres, newspapers and other assorted organisations.</p> <p>New Zealanders are prepared for all seasons. The further south you go, the colder it gets. In Auckland you can expect humidity and the occasional tornado; in Dunedin there are very cold winters, including snow. Everywhere has beautiful summers, though, and as the local saying goes: \u201cYou can\u2019t beat Wellington on a good day.\u201d</p> <p>Leave bigotry behind. Displays of racism, sexism, misogyny or any other forms of abuse are met swiftly with social justice, and even prosecution. We are a progressive nation: we have had openly gay and transsexual MPs, prostitution is legal here, and we legalised gay marriage long ago. </p> <p>We are a nation that proudly welcomes refugees, and often protests occur to increase the number we annually allow. Many different religions and ethnicities are represented by peaceful communities, and any harassment of them is quickly met with prosecution by an unforgiving justice system. </p> <h2>Kim, 56, from Wellington: \u2018Be prepared to slow down and say hi in the street\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"579d978dd99803aeb07e33a1418ccf7ddc35fba3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/579d978dd99803aeb07e33a1418ccf7ddc35fba3/0_0_2816_2112/1000.jpg\" alt=\"leaves\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Aotearoa, the north part of New Zealand, is full of migrants.

  "<p>All that signifies the legacy of a house once occupied by the poet laureate of Harlem is a small bronze plaque, partially covered by a cedar tree\u2019s branches and the green ivy that envelops much of the building.<br></p> <p>The onetime home of Langston Hughes has sat largely unoccupied for years, but a new movement is trying to reclaim, for a next generation of artists, the space of a man who is forever intertwined with the Harlem Renaissance.</p> <p>Spearheaded by writer, performer and educator Ren\u00e9e Watson, the collective effort is busily trying to raise the necessary funds to purchase a lease and make needed renovations to the house.</p> <p>\u201cIn a place like Harlem, I believe it\u2019s important to hold on to the tangible places where black artists lived and created,\u201d said Watson. \u201cBeyond the symbolism of Langston\u2019s home, I think it\u2019s important to hold on to our collective story.\u201d</p> <p>Located on East 127th Street in East Harlem, the elegant brownstone was originally built in 1869 in a classical architectural style similar to many Harlem rowhouses built after the civil war. Hughes worked out of its top floor from 1947 until he died, 20 years later. The house was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.</p> <p>Watson plans to make the Hughes house the home of the <a href=\"http://www.reneewatson.net/itoo/\">I Too, Arts Collective</a> that she launched alongside the effort, which aims to, in her words, have \u201cprogramming that nurtures, amplifies, and honors work by and about people of color and people from other marginalized communities\u201d.</p> <p>Watson hopes the collective will be a home for emerging and established artists as a way to showcase their work, and to connect with fellow artists in the community.</p> <p>\u201cSo often stories about people from underrepresented communities get told but not stories by the people from that community,\u201d Watson said.</p> <p>\u201cMy own writing centers on the lives of Latino children and families,\u201d said Meg Medina, a children\u2019s author based in Virginia who is an honorary board member of I, Too Arts Collective. \u201cFrom that vantage point, I feel the same urgency to give our kids a sense of their own community heroes.\u201d</p> <p>The collective gets its name from one of Hughes\u2019s most famous poems \u2013 I, Too \u2013 in which his narrator concludes by intoning:</p> <p><em>They\u2019ll see how beautiful I am </em></p> <p><em>And be ashamed\u2014 </em></p> <p><em>I, too, am America.</em></p> <p>Watson is using the <a href=\"https://www.generosity.com/community-fundraising/i-too-arts-collective\">crowdfunding website Indiegogo</a> to solicit donations for the project, for which they\u2019re hoping to raise at least $150,000 to cover a lease and begin the renovation process. By the time of publication, they had raised more than $54,000, already exceeding the $40,000 Watson says would cover at least a six-month lease.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Langston Hughes video\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/177971407&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere has been an outpouring of support and encouragement from both the local community as well as the larger community of poets and writers,\u201d said Watson.</p> <p>The privately owned building, which is currently listed at $1.2m, has failed to sell on several occasions in recent years, with many prospective buyers losing interest because of necessary extensive repairs. The property has been held by the same owner since 1999, and despite a short-lived effort by a trio of local artists in 2008 to restore the building and turn it into a public cultural institution, it has been largely empty.</p> <p>For more than a century, Harlem has been inextricably linked to black life and culture in America; the birthplace of the aforementioned Harlem Renaissance, which fostered a wide array pre-eminent black artists and writers, from Zora Neale Hurston to Claude McKay and Duke Ellington.</p> <p>But the face of black Harlem has slowly but unmistakably changed, a byproduct in part of the rising rents and gentrification which has priced many people out of their own neighborhood and seen local faces take on a steadily whiter hue.</p> <p>\u201cThe erasure of black Harlem may come despite our best efforts,\u201d said Tracey Baptiste, a local children\u2019s author who is involved with Watson\u2019s collective. \u201c\u2026 But this project is about making sure that gentrification doesn\u2019t also happen in the hearts and minds of our artists.\u201d</p> <p>The rapid changes wrought by economic and social upheaval have claimed a fair share of historic markers of African American life in Harlem. Lenox Lounge, the famous haunt frequented by jazz greats Billie Holiday, Miles Davis and John Coltrane, as well as Hughes himself, shuttered its doors in 2012; while the Childs Memorial Temple Church of God in Christ, where the actor Ossie Davis famously eulogized over the coffin of Malcolm X, announced its closure in March this year.</p> <p>Watson and company hope the Hughes House will not be among the many markers of dislocation. </p> <p>The I, Too, Art Collective is far from the only movement in Harlem advocating for the preservation of art associated with black Harlem and the legacy of the Harlem Renaissance.<br></p> <p>The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture operates as a research library of the New York public library, devoted to preserving cultural materials related to the global African diaspora, while the National Jazz Museum, which operates as a partner institution of the Smithsonian, aims to preserve the historical legacy of jazz and keep it as a prevalent musical idiom.</p> <p>But Watson and her supporters hope to both add to those places and the many others that remain vibrant in Harlem, while at the same time keeping intact an important physical marker of those values.</p> <p>Born in Missouri in 1902, Hughes first set foot in New York in 1921 when he went to attend Columbia University. Although he didn\u2019t graduate (he finished his studies at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania), he began there a lifelong love affair with the city, and Harlem in particular, which was to influence so much of his artistry and in turn leave a lasting imprint on the neighborhood\u2019s vibrant culture. </p> <p>It was while living at the now iconic house that Hughes composed a number of his greatest works, including Montage of a Dream Deferred, a book-length group of poems, and his autobiography, I Wonder as I Wander.</p> <p>But for Watson and her fellow artists, the specter of Langston Hughes is not a mere nostalgia trip, but a way of using history and symbolism to anchor Harlem\u2019s black legacy for all communities in the here, now, and future.</p> <p>\u201cHughes\u2019s collaborations with other writers, artists, musicians, and composers have an infinite creative legacy that we cannot lose,\u201d said Olugbemisola Rhuday-Perkovich, a local writer and playwright who has supported the project. \u201cIn a very real sense, it brings hope for preserving the legacy of all of New York City as an artistic hub.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur vision is for young people to have a space where they can process what is happening in our world, a place to learn how writers respond to injustice, how artists see beauty in ordinary things,\u201d said Watson. </p> <p>\u201cThis is about building on the legacy Langston left us.\u201d<br></p>",

  "<p>It\u2019s a great time to be in the virtual-reality business. While Facebook, Microsoft, Samsung and Google are investing billions in hardware, we\u2019re experiencing a content gold rush. </p> <p>But many people making VR content today seem to think the endgame is creating an experience that fully conveys a place \u2013 a trip to Mars or the Grand Canyon. \u201cWhat if you could travel to faraway lands in a heartbeat?\u201d asks an introductory video produced by the makers of Oculus Rift \u2013 a VR headset \u2013 as the camera flits from a stilt house in south-east Asia to an African safari. </p> <p>Such experiences are impressive, but they will never truly feel real until they can be shared, because reality is about more than places. It\u2019s about people.</p> <p>A story: I once met a young man in VR named Eric. I spotted him standing alone at the edge of a digitally generated cliff. \u201cAdmiring the view?\u201d I asked, being goofy. He looked me over wordlessly. We stood beside one another in charged silence before I tried again: \u201cIs this as far as you can go?\u201d Before he could answer, I nosed closer to the cliff, then slid down its face. I found the edge of the world, where the textured ground ended and a yawning polygon void began. He followed.</p> <p>We were in AltspaceVR, a Second Life-like virtual world that is one of several social platforms available to early adopters of VR with Oculus Rifts or competing headsets HTC Vives and Samsung Gear VRs. As rendered clouds slid past, he told me about Oklahoma City, where he lives. He was 15. I was wearing the body of a robot: a metal spiral with a featureless head, like the dot of an \u201ci\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m probably the first person in Oklahoma to get virtual reality,\u201d he told me, in a tone that conveyed both pride and great, inconsolable loneliness. </p> <p>After I peeled off my headset, I was alone in my living room, but the conversation hung onto me for days. Talking to Eric, my body had reacted as though I was having a conversation with a lonely teen, all sympathetic nerves, because I was having a conversation with a lonely teen. I felt something, and I felt for him. AltspaceVR isn\u2019t a particularly convincing environment \u2013 the avatars are blocky, the scenes roughly sketched \u2013 but Eric\u2019s crushing adolescent awkwardness made virtual reality feel truly real.</p> <p>That human presence is key is not a new observation. Back in the dial-up days, when \u201ccyberspace\u201d was a neologism borrowed from science fiction, a group of academics descended on the University of Texas at Austin for the First International Conference on Cyberspace. Opinions on the subject, in 1990, were colorful. One attendee described cyberspace as \u201cpoetry inhabited\u201d, saying that to \u201cnavigate through it is to become a leaf on the wind of a dream\u201d.</p> <p>This made it all the more surprising when two programmers from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasfilm\">Lucasfilm</a> \u2013 Chip Morningstar and F Randall Farmer \u2013 took their turn to speak. The pair had built a game called Habitat, a primitive version of the VR hangout where I met Eric: a cartoon environment where networked players chatted in real time, their words popping up as comic-book speech bubbles above the heads of their avatars.</p> <p>Habitat ran on computers hardly more powerful than pocket calculators, but its players waged wars, fell in love, made political moves \u2013 even started religions. It became a real community; half of the players of Habitat considered their avatars to be representations of themselves rather than puppets they controlled. Morningstar and Farmer could only draw one conclusion from the experience: virtual reality is made of people. </p> <p> Twenty-six years later, the logic holds. We\u2019re still a long way from virtual worlds that can interact with players with anything near the unpredictability and candor of another human being. Interacting with people is still more visceral than anything graphics, stories or gameplay can achieve alone. There\u2019s no sense in trying to work against this. Working with it, as a design strategy, by making space for real social interactions within virtual environments, is extraordinarily effective. Forget real-looking; let\u2019s try for real-feeling. Morningstar and Farmer wrote that \u201cCyberspace may indeed change humanity, but only if it begins with humanity as it really is.\u201d I\u2019d argue the same for virtual reality.</p> <p>I may never find Eric again, but I think of him every time I head into a VR world. His awkwardness charged the air: when I stood next to him, I felt aware of our closeness, despite the 1,300 miles separating our physical bodies. For the length of our conversation, the electric strangeness of human proximity made everything else irrelevant. I was immersed.</p> <ul> <li><em>This piece was published in coordination with <a href=\"http://creativetimereports.org/\">Creative Time Reports</a></em></li> </ul>",

  "<p>A Russian journalist who reports on female genital mutilation says introducing prison sentences for perpetrators will not bring about an end to the practice, after a report released last week said that FGM was taking place in remote villages in the republic of Dagestan.</p> <p>Marina Akhmedova, based in Moscow, has recently returned from the North Caucasus region, where she interviewed survivors of FGM. She is calling for a programme of on-the-ground advocacy.<br></p> <p>Responding to a draft bill introduced by MP Maria Maksakova-Igenbergs last week that called for the criminalisation of FGM, with sentences of up to 10 years, Akhmedova said such strict measures would only be seen as religious persecution and could drive the practice underground.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian, she said: \u201cIt is really difficult to help these women as they don\u2019t consider themselves victims. First you need to persuade them that they are victims. Targeting them will only drive them to do this in secret. If religious leaders say it is right for a girl to undergo circumcision, people will do it.\u201d</p> <p>She suggested that Russia needed to adopt an \u201caccurate and moderate\u201d approach and work with religious leaders as well as doctors and teachers to persuade them to abandon FGM. </p> <p>A report published by the human rights group Russian Justice Initiative (RJI) said there was evidence that FGM of girls under the age of three was happening in remote, mainly-Muslim villages in Dagestan. It came to wider attention when two religious leaders responded with comments in support of the practice.</p> <p>Ismail Berdiyev, the mufti and chairman of the North Caucasus Muslim Coordination Centre, said FGM does not contradict Islam and is a \u201cpurely Dagestani ritual\u201d that is necessary \u201cto limit the unnecessary energy\u201d of women. He also suggested in a radio interview that all women should undergo FGM to curb their sexual feelings, later retracting some of his comments. </p> <p>Vsevolod Chaplin, an Orthodox Christian leader, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/prot.v.chaplin/posts/286377295072116\">posted on Facebook</a> in support of Berdiyev, saying that traditional practices should be allowed to continue without interference.</p> <p>Maria Baronova, an opposition activist, responded to the report by standing outside Moscow\u2019s main mosque with a sign saying \u201ccut sheep not women\u201d.<br></p> <p> </p> <p>Akhmedova said Baronova\u2019s protest amounted to an \u201cincitement of ethnic hatred\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe mosque she stood outside belongs to Moscow Muftiyat, which has officially rejected FGM,\u201d Akhmedova said. \u201cNot all Muslims practise circumcision, and there was nothing in her actions that showed a desire to help the women of Dagestan. </p> <p>\u201cThe opinion of religious leaders on the case in Dagestan is divided. The media made it out that this is a wholly Islamic problem, but this is not the case. Some of the women I spoke to themselves felt ashamed for not having a clitoris, but others suggested that it is a practice that they have done for years and will continue to do.\u201d </p> <p>RJI found that FGM is carried out predominantly in five mountainous areas, where the procedure is usually performed on girls under the age of three, but also on some up to the age of 12. <br></p> <p>Vanessa Kogan, the group\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cThe report would not have received nearly as much coverage if it hadn\u2019t been for the outrageous statements made by Berdiyev and Chaplin. Their statements did not really contribute anything concrete to the questions surrounding the practice of FGM, but they spoke volumes about both Islamic and Christian religious leaders\u2019 intentions to control women\u2019s bodies and their sexuality.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to give the impression that FGM is a religious practice, and we want to keep the focus on the fact that the procedure is a gross violation of women and children\u2019s rights. These communities are among the last to have converted to Islam in the region, and many experts interviewed expressed the view that the practice is rooted in pre-Islamic tradition <em>adat</em> or customary law.</p> <p>\u201cAt the same time, we acknowledge that the support of religious leaders may be a key component in working to eradicate the problem.\u201d </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2016/feb/05/facts-you-should-know-about-fgm-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4genx\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2451520\"            data-video-name=\"The facts you should know about female genital mutilation \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/2/5/1454687602596/KP_1735363_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56b4c582e4b00a8a9e2a8c3e\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/2/5/1454687602596/KP_1735363_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/02/05/160205FGManimation_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/02/05/160205FGManimation_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/02/05/160205FGManimation.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/02/05/160205FGManimation_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/02/05/160205FGManimation_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2016/feb/05/facts-you-should-know-about-fgm-video\">It can kill: the facts you should know about female genital mutilation</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Kogan added no further research was planned, saying: \u201cThere is no evidence that FGM is being practised anywhere else in Russia on a systematic scale.

We need further investigation.<br></p> <p> \u201cFGM can no longer be seen as a supposedly \u2018African\u2019 issue. It is a human rights violation which affects hundreds of millions of women and girls around the world.

FGM has no health benefits and is recognised as a violation of the human rights of girls and women.</p>",
  "<p>The image that will stay with me long after the last competitor leaves Rio this week is a decidedly un-Olympic one. Caster Semenya, the women\u2019s 800m gold medallist, extends her arms to fellow competitors Melissa Bishop of Canada and Lynsey Sharp of Great Britain. Sharp, who came in sixth, holds a tearful Bishop, who took fourth, in a tight embrace. Rather than respond to Semenya they remain in their embrace ignoring her. The photo was a sad endnote to one of the most vitriolic media and social media uproars I can recall, one in which the athletes were the casualties. And the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) did nothing to quell it.</p> <p>In the month leading up the to the race, a cacophonous and spurious alarm sounded unfairly on Semenya\u2019s right to compete. She endured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/17/caster-semenya-800m-heat-gender-controversy-rio-olympics\">relentless hostility</a> and a deluge of cruel harassment from both the traditional and online media, something she has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/oct/15/caster-semenya-gender-row-exams-university\">been withstanding for the seven years</a> since the IAAF <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/aug/23/caster-semanya-lamine-diack\">confirmed it was investigating her</a>. It was reported she was even provided with a security team in Rio due to concerns the hostility might turn violent.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/caster-semenya-is-the-one-at-a-disadvantage\">Caster Semenya is the one at a disadvantage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Semenya\u2019s athleticism was attributed to a single molecule \u2013 testosterone \u2013 as though it alone earned her the gold, undermining at once her skill, preparation and achievement. South Africa as a nation has pushed back with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23handsoffcaster&amp;src=typd\">#handsoffcaster</a>, coming to the defence of one of the world\u2019s most scrutinised athletes despite her having done nothing wrong and competing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/29/what-is-an-intersex-athlete-explaining-the-case-of-caster-semenya\">with the support</a> of the court of arbitration for sport (Cas).</p> <p>It didn\u2019t have to be this way. Instead of quashing the media storm, the IAAF aggravated it, continuing to fail in its articulation and management of the issue. On the eve of the Olympics, IAAF president Sebastian Coe said they would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/11/caster-semenya-sebastian-coe-iaaf-cas-testosterone-olympics\">challenge</a> the currently suspended policy that places a limit on a female athlete\u2019s natural testosterone levels.</p> <p>He then issued an additional <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/21/caster-semenya-wins-gold-but-faces-scrutiny\">11th-hour avowal</a> just before the 800m finals, which seemed to be timed specifically to cast doubt on Semenya\u2019s right to compete. He immediately followed this statement with a halfhearted and telling reminder that \u201cthese are human beings,\u201d knowing full well that his comments would throw into question not only Semenya\u2019s participation but others\u2019 too. A tinderbox was left smouldering, one breath of accusation was all that was needed to ignite the \u201cdebate\u201d once more. Coe fomented an atmosphere that divided women athletes from their peers and even pitted them against each other.</p> <p>So it\u2019s no surprise that athletes such as Sharp, who have worked just as hard and sacrificed just as much, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/21/lynsey-sharp-caster-semenya-rio-2016-olympics\">may feel frustrated</a> and denied even though they weren\u2019t, and how, in anger, grace failed them. In an outsized display of entitlement, the women made comments that called into question and eclipsed the entire podium, such as Poland\u2019s Joanna Jozwik, who finished fifth between Bishop and Sharp, saying: \u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m the first European, the second white\u201d to cross the line. It\u2019s unsporting behaviour they will hopefully look back on and think better of.</p> <p>It\u2019s impossible not to note the optics of this controversy \u2013 the three black women from sub-Saharan Africa ebullient on the podium and the three white global north women feeling they should be there instead \u2013 because they signify a great deal. Their polarised perspectives stem from the policy regarding hyperandrogenism and the asymmetry regarding who it burdens and who it benefits.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/29/the-return-of-caster-semenya-olympic-favourite-and-ticking-timebomb\">The return of Caster Semenya: Olympic favourite and ticking timebomb</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To be clear: the policy harms all women athletes. But it\u2019s no secret that it disproportionately harms black and brown women from the global south. Women from the global north benefit from a policy in which the prevailing notion of fairness doesn\u2019t target them. Sharp\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/21/lynsey-sharp-caster-semenya-rio-2016-olympics\">comment</a> about relying on \u201cthe people at the top sorting it out\u201d further divulged as much.</p> <p>The \u201cwe\u201d here is key. For Semenya and others, the \u201cpeople at the top\u201d are not initiating policies that reflect their interests. It\u2019s a familiar pattern where those with power write policies benefiting the more powerful. Likewise when Sharp said, \u201cWe know how each other feel,\u201d it\u2019s easy to see how the Europeans\u2019 awareness of each other\u2019s views can reinforce feelings of injustice. The problem is that they don\u2019t know how the athletes being scrutinised feel and what seems unfair to them.</p> <p>It is also clear the increased scrutiny is reserved for women perceived as not feminine enough, which is the bedrock of what is in the policies. For example, it is stated that: \u201cThe individuals concerned often display masculine traits and have an uncommon athletic capacity in relation to their fellow female competitors.\u201d Gender variance has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/14/olympics-2012-measuring-athletes-femaleness-acceptable\">always incited scrutiny</a>, and this scrutiny is often racialised. Living outside of these normative racialised gendered expectations means coming under scrutiny and probing in ways invisible to the institutions and individuals doing the looking.</p> <p>This was not lost on many observers, including Semenya, who said: \u201cIt is not about discriminating people and looking at people in terms of how they look, how they speak and how they have run \u2026 It\u2019s not about being masculine. It\u2019s about sports.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/21/caster-semenya-wins-gold-but-faces-scrutiny\">Caster Semenya wins gold but faces more scrutiny as IAAF press case | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If this were a simple case of sour grapes it would fade with few caring.

That benefits no one.</p>",

When I asked her why she didn\u2019t flee the room, she explained: \u201cI was in shock.\u201d Staying was strangely easier than leaving, she said, because the latter would have required her to turn her body toward the couple, climb out of her bunk, gather her stuff, and find the door, all with her eyes open. So, she waited it out, focusing on a television show played on her laptop in front of her, and catching reflected glimpses of Declan\u2019s bobbing buttocks on her screen. That was the first time Cassidy had sex in front of her. By the third, she\u2019d learned to read the signs and get out before it was too late.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'What is happening!?' Jimena cried. 'Sex is happening!' Cassidy said.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cassidy and Jimena give us an idea of just how diverse college students\u2019 attitudes toward sex can be. Jimena, a conservative, deeply religious child, was raised by her Nicaraguan immigrant parents to value modesty. Her parents told her, and she strongly believed, that \u201csex is a serious matter\u201d and that bodies should be \u201crespected, exalted, prized\u201d. Though she didn\u2019t intend to save her virginity for her wedding night, she couldn\u2019t imagine anyone having sex in the absence of love.</p> <p>Cassidy, an extroverted blond, grew up in a stuffy, mostly white, suburban neighborhood. She was eager to grasp the new freedoms that college offered and didn\u2019t hesitate. On the day that she moved into their dorm, she narrated her Tinder chats aloud to Jimena as she looked to find a fellow student to hook up with. Later that evening she had sex with a match in his room, then went home and told Jimena everything. Jimena was \u201castounded\u201d but, as would soon become clear, Cassidy was just warming up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ab641f944e77fff5342a4524410eda0421be9e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ab641f944e77fff5342a4524410eda0421be9e3/0_195_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Students can opt out of hooking up, and many do... but they can\u2019t opt out of hookup culture.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Students can opt out of hooking up, and many do... but they can\u2019t opt out of hookup culture.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eduardo Munoz/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Students like Cassidy have been hypervisible in <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/09/boys-on-the-side/309062/\">news</a> <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/feature/millennial-sexual-revolution-relationships-marriage\">coverage</a> of <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/08/tinder-hook-up-culture-end-of-dating\">hookup</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/fashion/sex-on-campus-she-can-play-that-game-too.html?pagewanted=all\">culture</a>, giving the impression that most college students are sexually adventurous. For years we\u2019ve debated whether this is good or bad, only to discover, much to our surprise, that students aren\u2019t having as much sex as we thought. In fact, they report the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24750070\">same number of sexual partners</a> as their parents did at their age and are even more likely than previous generations to be what one set of scholars grimly refers to as \u201c<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-016-0798-z\">sexually inactive</a>\u201d.</p> <p>One conclusion is to think that campus hookup culture is a myth, a tantalizing, panic-inducing, ultimately untrue story. But to think this is to fundamentally misunderstand what hookup culture really is. It can\u2019t be measured in sexual activity \u2013 whether high or low \u2013 because it\u2019s not a behavior, it\u2019s an ethos, an atmosphere, a milieu. A hookup culture is an environment that idealizes and promotes casual sexual encounters over other kinds, regardless of what students actually want or are doing. And it isn\u2019t a myth at all.</p> <p>I followed 101 students as part of the research for my book <a href=\"https://lisa-wade.com/american-hookup/\">American Hookup: The New Culture of Sex on Campus</a>. I invited students at two liberal arts schools to submit journals each week for a full semester, in which they wrote as much or as little as they liked about sex and romance on campus. The documents they submitted \u2013 varyingly rants, whispered gossip, critical analyses, protracted tales or simple streams of consciousness \u2013 came to over 1,500 single-spaced pages and exceeded a million words. To protect students\u2019 confidentiality, I don\u2019t use their real names or reveal the colleges they attend.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hookup culture can\u2019t be measured in sexual activity because it\u2019s not a behavior \u2013 it\u2019s an ethos, an atmosphere, a milieu</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My read of these journals revealed four main categories of students. Cassidy and Declan were \u201centhusiasts\u201d, students who enjoyed casual sex unequivocally. This 14% genuinely enjoyed hooking up and <a href=\"http://spp.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/06/03/1948550614537308.abstract\">research</a> suggests that they thrive. Jimena was as \u201cabstainer\u201d, one of the 34% who voluntary opted out in their first year. Another 8% abstained because they were in monogamous relationships. The remaining 45% were \u201cdabblers\u201d, students who were ambivalent about casual sex but succumbed to temptation, peer pressure or a sense of inevitability. Other more systematic <a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/projects/england/ocsls/\">quantitative</a> <a href=\"http://scu.sagepub.com/content/2/2/163.abstract\">research</a> produces similar percentages.</p> <p>These numbers show that students can opt out of hooking up, and many do. But my research makes clear that they can\u2019t opt out of hookup culture. Whatever choice they make, it\u2019s made meaningful in relationship to the culture. To participate gleefully, for example, is to be its standard bearer, even while being a numerical minority. To voluntarily abstain or commit to a monogamous relationship is to accept marginalization, to be seen as socially irrelevant and possibly sexually repressed. And to dabble is a way for students to bargain with hookup culture, accepting its terms in the hopes that it will deliver something they want.</p> <p>Burke, for example, was a dabbler. He was strongly relationship-oriented, but his peers seemed to shun traditional dating. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to ask someone out than it is to ask someone to go back to your room after fifteen minutes of chatting,\u201d he observed wryly. He resisted hooking up, but \u201cclose quarters\u201d made it \u201cextremely easy\u201d to occasionally fall into bed with people, especially when drunk. He always hoped his hookups would turn into something more \u2013 which is how most relationships form in hookup culture \u2013 but they never did.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2b5b50ae6092c061887b86db28c9063edcd21d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2b5b50ae6092c061887b86db28c9063edcd21d2/0_134_3872_2324/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Finnish university students partying on a Silja Line cruise in the Baltic Sea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018To think that campus hookup culture is a myth \u2026 is to fundamentally misunderstand what hookup culture really is.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wren dabbled, too. She identified as pansexual and had been hoping for a \u201cqueer haven\u201d in college, but instead found it to be \u201cquietly oppressive\u201d. Her peers weren\u2019t overtly homophobic and in classrooms they eagerly theorized queer sex, but at parties they \u201creverted back into gendered codes\u201d and \u201cmasculine bullshit\u201d. So she hooked up a little, but not as much as she would have liked.</p> <p>My abstainers simply decided not to hook up at all. Some of these, like Jimena, were opposed to casual sex no matter the context, but most just weren\u2019t interested in \u201chot\u201d, \u201cmeaningless\u201d sexual encounters. Sex in hookup culture isn\u2019t just casual, it\u2019s aggressively slapdash, excluding not just love, but also fondness and sometimes even basic courtesy.</p> <p>Hookup culture prevails, even though it serves only a minority of students, because cultures don\u2019t reflect what is, but a specific group\u2019s vision of what should be. The students who are most likely to qualify as enthusiasts are also <a href=\"http://spx.sagepub.com/content/57/1/102.abstract\">more</a> <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02732173.2012.694799\">likely</a> <a href=\"https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-228436056/sexuality-in-black-and-white-data-from-783-undergraduates\">than</a> <a href=\"http://fincham.info/papers/2010-ASB-hook-up.pdf\">other</a> kinds of students to be affluent, able-bodied, white, conventionally attractive, heterosexual and male. These students know \u2013 whether consciously or not \u2013 that they can afford to take risks, protected by everything from social status to their parents\u2019 pocketbooks.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hookup culture is the privileging of the lifestyle most strongly endorsed by those with the most power on campus</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Students who don\u2019t carry these privileges, especially when they are disadvantaged in many different ways at once, are often pushed or pulled out of hooking up. One of my African American students, Jaslene, stated bluntly that hooking up isn\u2019t \u201cfor black people\u201d, referring specifically to a white standard of beauty for women that disadvantaged women like her in the erotic marketplace. She felt pushed out. Others pulled away. \u201cSome of us with serious financial aid and grants,\u201d said one of my students with an athletic scholarship, \u201ctend to avoid high-risk situations\u201d.</p> <p>Hookup culture, then, isn\u2019t what the majority of students want, it\u2019s the privileging of the sexual lifestyle most strongly endorsed by those with the most power on campus, the same people we see privileged in every other part of American life. These students, as one Latina observed, \u201cexude dominance\u201d. On the quad, they\u2019re boisterous and engage in loud greetings. They sunbathe and play catch on the green at the first sign of spring. At games, they paint their faces and sing fight songs. They use the campus as their playground. Their bodies \u2013 most often slim, athletic and well-dressed \u2013 convey an assured calm; they move among their peers with confidence and authority. Online, social media is saturated with their chatter and late night snapshots.</p> <p>On big party nights, they fill residence halls with activity. Students who don\u2019t party, who have no interest in hooking up, can\u2019t help but know they\u2019re there. \u201cYou can hear every conversation occurring in the hallway even with your door closed,\u201d one of my abstainers reported. For hours she would listen to the \u201cclick-clacking of high heels\u201d and exchanged reassurances of \u201cShut up! You look hot!\u201d Eventually there would be a reprieve, but revelers always return drunker and louder.</p> <p>The morning after, college cafeterias ring with a ritual retelling of the night before. Students who have nothing to contribute to these conversations are excluded just by virtue of having nothing to say. They perhaps eat at other tables, but the raised voices that come with excitement carry. At the gym, in classes, and at the library, flirtations lay the groundwork for the coming weekend. Hookup culture reaches into every corner of campus.</p> <p>The conspicuousness of hookup culture\u2019s most enthusiastic proponents makes it seem as if everyone is hooking up all the time. In one <a href=\"http://nyupress.org/books/9780814799697/\">study</a> students guessed that their peers were doing it 50 times a year, 25 times what the numbers actually show. In <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Guyland-Perilous-World-Where-Become/dp/0060831359\">another</a>, young men figured that 80% of college guys were having sex any given weekend. They would have been closer to the truth if they were guessing the percentage of men who\u2019d <em>ever</em> had sex.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022</p> <p>College students aren\u2019t living up to their reputation and hookup culture is part of why. It offers only one kind of sexual experiment, a sexually hot, emotionally cold encounter that suits only a minority of students well. Those who dabble in it often find that their experiences are as mixed as their feelings. One-in-three students <a href=\"http://www.acha-ncha.org/docs/ACHA-NCHA-II_ReferenceGroup_ExecutiveSUmmary_Spring2013.pdf.\">say</a> that their sexual encounters have been \u201ctraumatic\u201d or \u201cvery difficult to handle\u201d. Almost two dozen studies have documented <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17599248\">feelings</a> of <a href=\"http://spr.sagepub.com/content/19/5/639.abstract\">sexual</a> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21796484\">regret</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/End-Sex-Generation-Sexually-Unfulfilled/dp/0465002153\">frustration</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13691058.2011.619579\">disappointment</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18476484\">distress</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224499.2013.772088?journalCode=hjsr20\">inadequacy</a>. Many students decide, if hookups are their only option, they\u2019d rather not have sex at all.</p> <p>We\u2019ve discovered that hookup culture isn\u2019t the cause for concern that some once felt it was, but neither is it the utopia that others hoped. If the goal is to enable young people to learn about and share their sexualities in ways that help them grow to be healthy adults (if they want to explore at all), we\u2019re not there yet. But the more we understand about hookup culture, the closer we\u2019ll be able to get.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Escaping to New Zealand</strong><br></h2> <p>Eleanor Ainge Roy asserts that care should be taken before deciding to emigrate to New Zealand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/05/trump-brexit-is-new-zealand-your-escape-route-too\" title=\"\">(12 August)</a>. Confusingly she says that New Zealand needs more people but urges them not to come. However, the real flaw in her commentary is the belief that discretionary migration is informed by the social merit of a particular country, when in reality it is more often based on a migrant\u2019s desire for change.</p> <p>She is correct in pointing out the darker social features of New Zealand. There are plenty more to add to her list. The real tragedy of these adversities is a nonchalance from central government about how such pressing issues should be addressed.</p> <p>We are different but we are not necessarily worse, and you should be entirely clear about that difference before you take such a big step. When you are sure, please come and you will be most welcome, but please keep your dog on a lead when walking in the bush. Our native species are under threat from canines. <br><strong>Patrick Alley</strong><br>Auckland, New Zealand</p> <p>\u2022 I didn\u2019t choose to live in New Zealand. The majority of my fellow citizens didn\u2019t either. Our forebears inadvertently made the choice for us. Unlike Eleanor Ainge Roy we know that those who made this choice were not convicts. Her other fact-free assertion \u2013 that we Kiwis habitually keep asking if we\u2019re good enough due to our supposed ancestry \u2013 is double nonsense.</p> <p>When Roy has taken the trouble to learn some New Zealand history I hope she will also come to regret her colossal cheek in declaring New Zealand \u201cunderpopulated\u201d, and issuing an open invitation to the rest of the world to add to what is in ecological terms an overpopulation crisis. New Zealand has an ecological footprint of 7.7 hectares per person \u2013 the sixth-highest rate in the world. Intensive agriculture is a significant contributor to this sorry statistic, and probably to one of its latest manifestations \u2013 the awful outbreak of water-borne gastric illness that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/18/nz-town-gastro-outbreak-sent-e-coli-infected-water-council\" title=\"\">recently made over 4,000 people in one Hawkes Bay town very ill</a>.</p> <p>Anyone who emigrates to New Zealand as a lifestyle choice is likely to add to the problems of overconsumption and unsustainable production, and also to property price escalation that has taken home ownership beyond the reach of low- to medium-income earners. Those of us who didn\u2019t choose to live here have got enough trouble on our hands trying to engage others in working on solving these problems, instead of making them worse. We welcome new fellow workers, but freeloaders \u2013 please stay away.<br><strong>Christine Dann</strong><br>Christchurch, New Zealand</p> <p>\u2022 Eleanor Ainge Roy talks a lot of sense in her article about why moving to New Zealand is not a panacea and, more important, should not be thought of as an escape. My family came to live here 18 years ago with very young children. It was a kind of safe adventure, not exactly a journey into the unknown. Maybe a bit like going to live in a second cousin\u2019s house: you recognise some of the furniture but it is in different places.</p> <p>It is a small place in terms of population but as big geographically as the UK. People tend to be friendly because there aren\u2019t so many people to go round: there is, while acknowledging casual and unpleasant racism \u2013 especially towards Maori \u2013 a greater respect toward other people, though society\u2019s blights \u2013 poverty and youth suicide among them \u2013 are apparent. It would, however, be impossible to imagine New Zealand doing a Brexit and voting to leave its economic ties with Australia or China because of a xenophobic resentment about the numbers of Australians or Chinese who come here to live and work.</p> <p>Most important, New Zealand even has a gentler Tory party: the likes of the not very lamented David Cameron or his awful successors vanished 20-odd years ago here. The&#xa0;electoral system is light years more advanced and democratic than&#xa0;the sclerotic British system.<br><strong>David Townsend</strong><br>Wellington, New Zealand</p> <h2><strong>Leaders must learn to listen</strong><br></h2> <p>I find it hard to discern the underlying message of Anne McElvoy\u2019s 12 August piece, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/06/elites-listen-to-noises-on-street\" title=\"\">Elites must start listening to the people</a>. Is it simply a plea for centrists or moderates to heed the voice of the neglected masses? But what should her amorphous \u201ccentre-ground liberals\u201d be embracing as their guiding philosophy in an era when nothing is certain, whether due to the cumulative effects of rapid climate change, the loyalties of voters to established parties or, the elephant in the room, the demonstrated inherent instability of the global economic system?</p> <p>As a senior editor of The Economist, and judging by her evident support for Hillary Clinton, may we assume that McElvoy relies on the received wisdom of the power of market forces, that a steady hand at the helm is all that is needed to steer the vessel of most major economies into safer waters? If so, she stands accused of the same fault that she levels at the elites: failing to heed the voice of reality.</p> <p>In addition, her predicated new left is in fact just the remnant of the old left, exemplified by Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn, a plaintive cry to return to the certainties of a bygone age. McElvoy\u2019s oversimplification of the phenomenon she calls the rebellious right is equally blinkered, and ignores the very different social and economic crises being experienced in countries such as France, Germany, Austria, Spain, Greece, Italy, the US and the UK.</p> <p>The one really hopeful prospect comes out of Austria, where the dispute for the presidency between a flexible and forward-looking Green candidate and a representative of the extreme rightwing, scared isolationists has yet to be resolved.

  "<h2>\u2018Showing the world we are good at something made us very proud\u2019<br></h2> <p>The Games have been really successful. Brazilians have been in the spotlight, and culturally we like that. We are so passionate about everything we do that some of our actions may have impressed and shocked people from other countries. </p> <p>Many other manifestations revealed Brazilian humour - like cheering for a Brazilian referee when the competitors were from different nationalities, singing to a competitor that had the name of a famous Brazilian song, and even repeating the cheer of other team supporters with words in Portuguese that sounded similar to what they were saying. It\u2019s also good to see the Brazilian football team win the gold. We have been criticizing the team for a long time now and they deserved their success. Being in the spotlight for a positive thing and showing the world we are good at something has made us Brazilians very proud. <strong><em>Jo\u00e3o Paulo</em></strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ec0f1fb0c73d5d9ba2f5c0ce35814599760f78b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ec0f1fb0c73d5d9ba2f5c0ce35814599760f78b/0_0_3840_2560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brazil\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spectators watch Brazil beat Germany in the men\u2019s football gold medal match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Every Brazilian athlete is a hero\u2019</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/22/rio-2016-olympics-brazil-artist-andre-gola\">Rio 2016: the Olympics as seen by Brazilian graphic artist Andr\u00e9 Gola</a> </p> </aside>  <p> I\u2019m not a sports fan but I enjoyed the Games quite a lot since the opening ceremony. We have been so worried lately about our country, especially the city of Rio de Janeiro, but the opening ceremony was beautiful. It displayed so many nice features of our culture. It got the Olympics off to a great start. </p> <p>Considering the lack of investment we have in education and sports, I believe every Brazilian athlete is a hero. I especially enjoyed watching our boxing champion Robson Conceicao who is a kid from a poor community in my hometown of Salvador. To think of all the all the adversity he\u2019s had to endure to get on to the big stage, I\u2019m so glad he made it. <strong><em>Martha Schaer</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d834ea1f880f865fe355a0569d7e52b67c45660b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d834ea1f880f865fe355a0569d7e52b67c45660b/0_0_4149_2759/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robson Conceicao\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robson Conceicao celebrates after winning gold.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Petersen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018I hope our success brings more people into sports\u2019</h2> <p>The fact the only major problem during the Games was a green swimming pool is something we can live with. Most of the problems the media portrayed were minor and expected from a place like Rio, and many media outlets just blew them out of proportion. As a Brazilian I feel very proud of what we have done. Just like me, many people did not want our government to spend money on the Olympics, but are happy with the results of this event.<br><br>Unfortunately I feel that the sports incentive will be hit hard with Brazil facing a big recession. For example, the handball team has not had any investment since 2014, despite us reaching the Olympics quarter-finals for the first time ever. Many medals Brazil won have come from unexpected sports. I hope our success brings more people into sports, as it is one of the best ways to change and give opportunity for the poor.

We are more than 202m people and deserved the chance to show the world how great we are. I\u2019m a volleyball spectator and was very emotional when Brazil reached the men\u2019s volleyball final.

The security and hospitality of locals and volunteers was spot on, and there were no problems with the transport system we were so worried about. </p> <p>I don\u2019t think the opinion around the world has been negative. I think the world became enchanted by the beauty of Rio and the sports facilities of the Olympic Village, and all the spaces where competitions took place. I hope more young Brazilians will be interested in sports. The Rio mayor, Eduardo Paes, has already said that arenas will be reused after the Games. I\u2019m happy about this as sport can be a tool for social inclusion and to fight poverty. I really hope that will be Rio 2016\u2019s legacy. <strong><em>Daniela Giacobbo</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48852dd0ee7b767ecc33d56f9ae1b287995639ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48852dd0ee7b767ecc33d56f9ae1b287995639ff/0_0_4096_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rio\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rio mayor Eduardo Paes at the closing ceremony.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergei Ilnitsky/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Brazilians are sure to have fond memories\u2019</h2> <p>I believe the Games have been a success.

  "<p>The situation facing internally displaced people in the north-east of Nigeria is fast becoming a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/14/un-accused-of-failing-as-nigerian-food-crisis-threatens-hundreds-of-thousands\">full-scale humanitarian crisis</a> and Nigerian authorities and the international community have been accused of not acting quickly enough to avert disaster. The UN has estimated that 4.4 million people in the Lake Chad region are severely food insecure, but international donors have <a href=\"https://fts.unocha.org/pageloader.aspx?page=emerg-emergencyDetails&amp;appealID=1113\">not funded UN relief efforts</a> to the necessary extent.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/mar/26/nigeria-food-crisis-short-rainy-season\">Nigeria braced for potential food crisis as forecasters predict short rainy season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lone voices have warned of catastrophe for some time, but efforts to address the suffering of internally displaced people and prevent humanitarian disaster have been ineffectively coordinated. Nigeria is acting to alleviate the adversity facing its people. Emergency workers are operating on the frontline of the crisis, and the senate is leading a much improved coordination effort to overcome institutional and logistical hindrances to getting aid to the neediest. We are urgently seeking to pass a motion to secure an additional \u00a3215m in aid to tackle the emergency, and we are engaging with humanitarian organisations and the international community to ensure food reaches those who most need it as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Yet while Nigeria must do far more to coordinate relief efforts, we cannot tackle the crisis alone, just as we cannot tackle its root causes \u2013 poverty, insecurity and instability \u2013 without a concerted effort from, and renewed partnership with, the international community. We need far greater support from overseas to ensure that, first, people are able to leave the camps and live their lives safely and securely, and, second, those who have suffered so much are effectively rehabilitated.</p> <p>This crisis will not simply go away, and neither will its instigators. The UN has rightly identified the Lake Chad region <a href=\"http://news.trust.org/item/20160524181019-53nxy/\">as the world\u2019s most neglected humanitarian crisis</a>.</p> <p>It is not a coincidence that this situation has developed in Borno and north-east Nigeria. The north-east has the highest poverty rate in Nigeria, and in 2013 a state of emergency was declared in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states due to the deteriorating security situation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>An international conference should be convened focusing on the crisis in \u200bnorth-east Nigeria and the Boko Haram threat</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While progress has been made in improving security, this is at risk of being undermined by the humanitarian situation. Poverty, malnourishment and isolation form a perfect breeding ground for Boko Haram to recruit desperate individuals and turn them into their latest weapon against humanity.</p> <p>Islamic State is reportedly recruiting members from European refugee camps. Kenya has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/11/kenya-close-worlds-biggest-refugee-camp-dadaab\">announced plans to close Dadaab</a>, the world\u2019s largest refugee complex, due to fears that al-Shabaab is recruiting on an unprecedented scale.</p> <p>This is more than just an immediate humanitarian challenge for Nigeria. A failure to act and mobilise the full resources of the international community in relieving the pain and suffering of internally displaced people will have implications that are likely to be felt across the globe.</p> <p>The international community must come together and focus its collective attention and resources. An international conference focusing on the situation in north-east Nigeria and the lingering threat of Boko Haram should be convened, similar to those held recently in London to address the crises in Somalia and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/feb/04/syrians-donor-london-conference-aid\">Syria</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"53cd7e3a2872b1d37ff74a707a26170317ddd397\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53cd7e3a2872b1d37ff74a707a26170317ddd397/0_0_3600_2395/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A boy stands behind an emaciated cow in the Muna informal settlement, in Borno state, north-east Nigeria\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A boy stands behind an emaciated cow in the Muna informal settlement, in Borno state, north-east Nigeria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Heunis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The recovery effort is underway, and aid is beginning to reach some of the most vulnerable. But improving the living conditions for Nigerians is vital. That means tackling the country\u2019s immediate economic challenges, stabilising the currency, and getting money flowing around Nigeria again. But it also means diversifying the economy to attract greater foreign investment to develop Nigeria\u2019s fledgling but hugely promising industries. Ultimately, it means sharing the proceeds of future growth more evenly throughout the country, not least in the north-east.</p> <p>Nigeria will act to address the causes of the catastrophe. The senate has advanced plans for a development commission that will initially focus on the crisis, and it has made facilitating economic growth and attracting greater investment its chief priorities.</p> <p>All legislative efforts will be geared towards encouraging investment for social development. Only through deeper partnership with the international community can we facilitate the necessary economic reforms to secure Nigeria\u2019s future prosperity and only through sharing the proceeds of economic growth can we ensure such a crisis never takes root in Nigeria again.</p> <ul> <li><em>Bukola Saraki is president of the Nigerian senate</em></li> </ul>",

There is virtually nowhere in the park in which its 600,000 annual visitors cannot see a drilling rig, an oil pump, a highway or a cellphone tower in what was once a sleepy rural area. </p> <p>Ross said she is bombarded by letters and messages on Facebook from tourists over these eyesores. She frets that the park\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nature.nps.gov/air/maps/docs/nps_class_i.pdf\">special status for clean air</a> will be ruined by pollution and that a new oil refinery, planned for an area just two miles east of the protected area, will heighten this clash between nature and mining.</p> <p>\u201cThe visitor experience is impacted by this type of structure,\u201d Ross said. \u201cThese proposals all add up, they have a cumulative impact. There\u2019s a perception that we are trying to shut down the energy industry but we just want responsible placement of these things.\u201d</p> <p>The challenges facing Theodore Roosevelt national park are emblematic of a fresh struggle for the soul of national parks. The parks, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/americasbestidea/\">America\u2019s best idea</a>\u201d, have to define what they are for and whom they serve.

I didn\u2019t find this general tenor of discussion that was anti-federal land and certainly not sentiments that were anti-national parks.\u201d</p> <p>There is a new crusade by some lawmakers, dubbed the \u201canti-parks caucus\u201d, to unlock more public land to drilling and other development. This is a sharp divergence from the broad consensus forged since Roosevelt, a Republican, spurred the expansion of America\u2019s network of national parks almost 110 years ago. This network now spans 412 federally protected places, including 59 national parks such as Yellowstone and Yosemite as well as hundreds of battlefields, monuments and historical trails.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"248aa205b6eed11481468545bd712e4652f83349\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/248aa205b6eed11481468545bd712e4652f83349/30_0_2497_3122/800.jpg\" alt=\"Theodore Roosevelt stands with naturalist John Muir on Glacier Point, above Yosemite Valley in California.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theodore Roosevelt stands with naturalist John Muir on Glacier Point, above Yosemite Valley in California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Roosevelt enthused over the \u201cmajestic beauty\u201d of nature, created five national parks and signed the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/anti1906.htm\">Antiquities Act</a>, which allows a president to unilaterally declare a national monument.

It\u2019s almost impossible to find an issue that 95% Americans agree on, but polling suggests <a href=\"https://www.npca.org/articles/693-new-poll-of-likely-voters-finds-unity-in-public-support-for-national-parks\">this is the level of support</a> for federal government protection of national parks. </p> <p>Separate polls show a hefty majority of voters would be unhappy if their representatives stripped protections from public land. A record number of visitors \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/news/release.htm?id=1775\">almost 305 million</a> \u2013 gazed at the vistas of Yosemite, Yellowstone, Gettysburg and other NPS properties last year.</p> <p>While the NPS could be enjoying a triumphant centennial in 2016, it has to cajole funds from a recalcitrant Congress to deal with crumbling visitor centres, trails, campgrounds and education programs. </p> <p>An overdue maintenance backlog has grown from a headache under George W Bush to a weeping sore under Obama. It will cost nearly $12bn to patch up all of the creaking infrastructure in national parks, at a time when <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/americans-think-national-parks-are-worth-us-92-billion-but-we-dont-fund-them-accordingly-57617\">a recent study</a> found Congress has trimmed the budget of the NPS about 15% over the past 15 years.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not placing a high enough priority on conservation,\u201d said Linda Bilmes, a co-author of the research who sits on the NPS advisory board. \u201cWe have been underinvesting in the long-term work that supports the mission statement of national parks.\u201d </p> <p>The value the American public places on national parks dwarfs the NPS\u2019s $3bn budget, the study found. Eight in 10 voters would be prepared to pay more in taxes to preserve national parks. That could equate to an enormous $92bn annual value of national parks, monuments and historic areas. </p> <p>An unhappy confluence of events has squeezed national parks. Since 2001, a major focus has been put upon national security, overseas wars and economic crisis. The rise of the Tea Party has placed major scrutiny upon new government spending. And while the public has an ongoing love affair with national parks, outdoor spaces aren\u2019t in enough visible distress for an outcry. </p> <p>The result is a feeling of gloom among many who work to protect America\u2019s natural treasures. \u201cPeople who work for NPS have a sense of mission, they are some of the most professional, best-trained civil servants in the US,\u201d said Bilmes. </p> <p>\u201cWhen you speak to the rangers, they\u2019ll say \u2018I used to have six people and now I have one.\u2019 They are feeling overworked and concerned about the challenges they face.\u201d</p> <p>The funding impasse could be alleviated by private philanthropy. Tin-shaking by the NPS has raised $23m in the past year, with Congress matching $10m. </p> <p>Wealthy individuals usually want their name attached to something more grandiose than a repaired walkway. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to attract private funds for repair work,\u201d acknowledged NPS spokesman Jeff Olson. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have people out beating the bushes for deferred maintenance.\u201d</p> <p>What is needed is a high-profile, modern appraisal of the majesty of national parks and the risks of gradual decline.</p> <p> The economic benefit is a key part of the case. Income from pristine parks is far more resilient than the cyclical revenues from mining. There is also a broader, more complex argument about how to maintain a network of protected spaces to nurture threatened species and cleanse the air and water we rely on. Parks surrounded by oil drilling, in North Dakota or elsewhere, risk creating the isolated fragments Sally Jewell fears.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that healthy, intact ecosystems are fundamental to the health of our wildlife \u2013 and our nation,\u201d Jewell said.</p> <p>\u201cBut if their integrity is undermined by a haphazard web of transmission lines, pipelines and roads, where does that leave us 50 years from now? Or 500?</p> <p>\u201cWhat we need is smart planning, on a landscape-level, irrespective of manmade lines on a map. We need to take a holistic look at an ecosystem \u2013 on land or in the ocean \u2013 to determine where it makes sense to develop, where it makes sense to protect the natural resources, and where we can accomplish both.\u201d</p> <p>Long-term planning to save species and tackle climate change seems counter-intuitive to the short-termism gripping American politics. In its 101st year, the NPS will again be in the trenches, deflecting threats, making each dollar stretch, slowly trying to inch its way back to spirit of Roosevelt and his Yosemite camping buddy <a href=\"http://vault.sierraclub.org/john_muir_exhibit/life/muir_biography.aspx\">John Muir</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a strong 100 years-plus reason why we have national parks,\u201d said Scarlett. \u201cThey reflect who we are as Americans. They are places of incredible historical, natural and geological renown.</p> <p>\u201cPlaces like Yellowstone attract people from around the world because it is mind-boggling. It isn\u2019t just valuable to Wyoming and Montana, but to the nation and to the world. National parks inspire us and give us identity. If you see them just as states versus the federal government, you are missing the point.</p> <p>\u201cI remain reasonably confident that when push comes to shove, efforts to intrude upon national parks for energy development will be precluded. The strong support of the public will prevail. I just don\u2019t think they will allow it.\u201d</p> <h2>Big Cypress national preserve </h2> <p>There are 12 parks in the NPS system allowing for minerals to be dug up within the park boundaries. Big Cypress national preserve in southern Florida is to be the subject of seismic testing for oil and gas, a scenario worrying some conservationists.</p> <p>\u201cDriving big trucks though the park will disrupt the ecosystem,\u201d said Mark Wenzler, of the National Parks Conservation Association. \u201cCompanies don\u2019t have an absolute right to destroy everything. The last thing you want in a vulnerable ecosystem in Florida is this sort of thing.\u201d</p> <h2>Mojave national preserve</h2> <p>Earlier this year, the federal government gave its blessing to the Ivanpah project, the world\u2019s largest solar development. Situated in the Mojave national preserve, deep in the California desert, the project will provide power for 140,000 homes throughout the west. But there are concerns it will disturb a fragile desert ecosystem, which includes ancient mesquite trees and the endangered desert tortoise.</p> <h2>Theodore Roosevelt national park</h2> <p>During the day, visitors to Theodore Roosevelt national park can see drilling and flaring from sites on all sides of the park. At night, the light from these constructions can hinder stargazing. While fracking has brought new economic activity to North Dakota, some worry development has gone too far, too fast.<br></p> <p>\u201cDestroying the areas directly around national parks is probably not the best idea,\u201d said Winthrop Roosevelt, Teddy\u2019s great-great-grandson. \u201cJust like people don\u2019t want to live right next to chemical plants, national parks next to industrial sites might cause ecological damage.\u201d</p> <h2>National historic trails</h2> <p>The Keystone XL pipeline, which would bring oil from Alberta in Canada to refineries in Illinois and Texas, was seemingly killed off by Barack Obama following vociferous opposition from climate campaigners.</p> <p>But Donald Trump has said he would allow the pipeline to go ahead should he win the presidency. The pipeline would cut across a number of valued hiking routes, including the Pony Express trail and the Lewis and Clark national historic trail.</p>",

While the Cas panel revealed that the RPC did not provide any evidence contradicting the facts put forward by the IPC, the Russian sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, called the decision to uphold the ban unlawful and politically motivated.</p> <p>Craven launched a scathing attack on Vladimir Putin\u2019s government when the IPC first took action against the RPC because of its inability to fulfil its IPC membership responsibilities and obligations, hitting out at a culture that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/08/russia-blanket-paralympic-ban-medals-over-morals-rio-2016\" title=\"\">prioritised \u201cmedals over morals\u201d</a>.</p> <p>McLaren\u2019s report, written on behalf of Wada, offered a staggering insight into the extent of Russia\u2019s state-run doping programme. The Canadian revealed that 11 positive drugs tests from Russian Paralympic athletes were covered up by the Moscow anti-doping laboratory on orders from Russia\u2019s ministry of sport between 2012 and 2015. He also confirmed that 18 samples from Russian athletes were swapped for clean ones during the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi.</p> <p>Russia won nearly half of the gold medals on offer in Sochi but the IPC\u2019s hardline response to Russia was at odds with the approach taken by much of the rest of the international sporting community before the Olympics. The IOC compromised by letting each federation that runs an Olympic sport decide on the eligibility of Russian athletes for Rio.</p> <p>Only the International Association of Athletics Federations and International Weightlifting Federation took such a strong stance against Russia and the world\u2019s largest country ended up fielding a 278-strong team at the 2016 Olympics, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2016/aug/05/rio-olympics-2016-medal-table-and-results-in-full\" title=\"\">finishing fourth in the medals table by winning 56 medals</a>. The World Olympians Association, the umbrella group that represents national associations of former Olympians, called the IPC stance \u201cinconsistent and unfair\u201d and said global responsibility could not be achieved without examining all individual cases.</p> <p>Yet Craven held out an olive branch for the RPC. \u201cAlthough we are pleased with the decision, it is not a day for celebration and we have enormous sympathy for the Russian athletes who will now miss out on the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a sad day for the Paralympic movement but we hope also a new beginning. We hope this decision acts as a catalyst for change in Russia and we can welcome the Russian Paralympic Committee back as a member safe in the knowledge that it is fulfilling its obligations to ensure fair competition for all.</p> <p>\u201cThe IPC Governing Board\u2019s decision was taken with the best interests of the Paralympic movement at heart, as was the IOC\u2019s ruling for the Olympic movement, which I supported as an IOC member during the IOC Session.</p> <p>\u201cAs an autonomous organisation with a different governance structure to the IOC, the IPC\u2019s decision was based on the fact that there is one sole IPC member in Russia responsible for both winter and summer Para sport. We found that member \u2013 the Russian Paralympic Committee \u2013 not to be fulfilling its obligations in regards to the IPC anti-doping code and world anti-doping code and therefore decided to take the best course of action for the Paralympic movement. Following this decision, our full focus is on sport and working with our partners to deliver a successful Rio 2016 Paralympic Games.</p> <p>\u201cBeyond Rio 2016, we will work with the World Anti-Doping Agency to establish the criteria the Russian Paralympic Committee needs to meet in order to fulfil all its membership obligations and have its suspension lifted. We will also continue to work closely with the IPC anti-doping committee and Wada on the measures to be taken to address the athletes implicated as part of the McLaren Report, including advice on results management.\u201d</p> <p>With the Paralympics due to begin on 7 September, the IPC will work with International Federations to redistribute the 267 slots vacated by the Russians.</p>",

  "<p>Protesters against the badger cull in England have said they plan to change tactics by undertaking direct action to drive up policing costs, after reports of an expansion of culling to new areas. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-37158418\">The BBC has reported</a> that the cull will be extended to five new areas in south-west England \u2013 south Devon, north Devon, north Cornwall, west Dorset and south Herefordshire \u2013 where badger shooting will begin in early September as part of government efforts to eradicate bovine TB.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said no decision had yet been made on where culls might take place, but confirmed that officials were considering new applications. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The shooting of badgers would continue in the areas where it was already taking place, she added. The cull is in its fourth year in Gloucestershire and Somerset and in its second year in Dorset. </p> <p>Jay Tiernan of the protest group Stop the Cull said: \u201cWe have spent the last three years just in the fields ... We haven\u2019t ever once stood outside a farm with a banner or blockaded a road or put locks on to a business\u2019s gates to stop their business from working.\u201d</p> <p>To date, the campaign has focused on disrupting the killing of badgers by discovering where the shooting would take place and by breaking traps. Tiernan said: \u201cWe are going to change that to specifically look at policing costs ... We are going to start looking at making the culls expensive.\u201d</p> <p>The group has previously been criticised for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/23/badger-cull-animal-rights-group-names-farmers\">publishing a list of farmers involved in the cull</a>. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-35121632\">Almost 1,500 badgers were killed</a> during last year\u2019s badger cull, according to Defra. The government described the effort as a success.</p> <p>The continuation of the cull under Theresa May\u2019s government will disappoint campaigners and scientific experts who had hoped that the policy would be dropped under the new prime minister.</p> <p>Within days of May entering No 10, a group of scientists, including some of those behind a \u00a350m trial conducted in 2007 that showed culling was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/11/badger-culling-ineffective-krebs\">not effective at reducing TB</a> in cattle, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/13/badger-cull-expansion-flies-in-face-of-scientific-evidence\">called on her to end the \u201cfailed\u201d policy</a>.</p> <p>At the time Defra was reported to be considering up to 29 applications across nine counties including Cheshire, Cornwall and Herefordshire. </p> <p>Bovine TB reportedly led to the slaughter of <a href=\"https://www.fginsight.com/news/tb-toll-on-the-rise-as-36000-cattle-slaughtered-in-2015-10767\">36,000 infected cattle in 2015</a>, an increase of about 10% on the year before and costing taxpayers about \u00a3100m. But the scientists say the cull has had little effect on the spread of the disease and may even have increased infections. </p> <p>Professors John Bourne, Rosie Woodroffe and Ranald Munro wrote to May: \u201cWe urge you to review the considerable evidence that culling badgers is a risky, costly, and inhumane tool in the fight against bovine TB. We submit to you that expanding this unpromising programme would fly in the face of scientific evidence. We publicly call on you at this time to halt \u2013 not expand \u2013 the failed badger cull.\u201d<br></p> <p>The cull has received the backing of some farmers\u2019 groups. Ross Murray, president of the CLA, which represents farmers and landowners, said: \u201cThe badger cull is one important part of a comprehensive strategy which also includes pre- and post-movement testing of cattle, the removal and slaughter of infected animals and vaccination.</p> <p>\u201cBovine TB is a devastating disease that is causing misery for dairy and livestock farmers across the countryside. It is vital that all those involved in the cull have the support of local people and law enforcement as they carry out this important task.\u201d </p> <p>An RSPCA spokesman described the prospect of an extended cull as \u201calarming\u201d. David Bowles, head of public affairs, said the charity had concerns about the humaneness of shooting badgers, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe an extension of the badger cull will solve the problem of bovine TB in cattle. It ignores all the scientific evidence that indicates a cull will not achieve this.\u201d</p> <p>A Defra spokeswoman said: \u201cNatural England is currently considering applications for further badger control licences as part of the usual licensing process. England has the highest incidence of TB in Europe and that is why we are taking strong action to deliver our 25-year strategy to eradicate the disease and protect the future of our dairy and beef industries.</p> <p>\u201cBadger control in areas where TB is rife is one part of our long-term plan, which also includes strengthening cattle testing and movement controls and improving biosecurity on farms and when trading.\u201d</p> <p>Dominic Dyer, the chief executive of the Badger Trust, said: \u201cAfter four years of badger culling, no one can now doubt that the policy has been a disastrous failure on scientific, cost and humaneness grounds. </p> <p>\u201cFor the new Defra secretary of state, Andrea Leadsom, to ignore the facts and extend this policy into five new areas of the country defies belief.\u201d</p> <p>Defra has not said when its decision on new applications will be announced.</p>",

The government\u2019s words will ring hollow for Turkey\u2019s 15-20 million Kurds, many of whom blame the government for either acquiescing to or providing direct support for Isis and others like it, which have repeatedly targeted Kurdish crowds and celebrations over the past year, such as this weekend\u2019s wedding.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/aug/21/at-least-30-killed-nearly-100-injured-in-blast-at-wedding-in-turkey-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5vkx3\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2671815\"            data-video-name=\"\u2018They were all in pieces\u2019: eyewitness on the Turkey wedding bombing \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57b8fd89e4b0377cf11189f0\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400104&amp;format=video/mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400104&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400104&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400104&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400104&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/aug/21/at-least-30-killed-nearly-100-injured-in-blast-at-wedding-in-turkey-video\">\u2018They were all in pieces\u2019: eyewitness describes Turkey wedding bombing horror \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Isis is one part of the problem.

The group, which has fought the state for political and human rights for Turkey\u2019s Kurds, has risen to international acclaim in recent years for its battlefield success against Isis. In Syria, its sister-group the Democratic Union party (PYD) and its armed wing, the Peoples\u2019 Protection Unit (YPG), have captured numerous Isis strongholds in partnership with US special forces, including the key town of Manbij last week.</p> <p>Isis will continue to focus its attention on Turkey and invest its resources there as it makes losses in Syria and Iraq, but Erdo\u011fan\u2019s energy is heavily invested in securing his authority in Turkey\u2019s post-coup environment. Reconciling with the Kurds and going after Isis within and outside of Turkey will not be his immediate priority, particularly if targeting Isis emboldens the Kurds.</p> <p>Turkey may be unwilling or incapable of uprooting jihadi networks on its soil. But that does not mean Europe and the US cannot attempt to mediate the conflict between the government and the Kurds or, alternatively, pressure Turkey into accepting the emerging political and security framework in the region, of which the Kurds are now a major component.</p>",

Doing that would also allow emissions in transport and other sectors to be cut by electrifying them.</p> <p>For the world to achieve the more ambitious 1.5C goal, the strategies would be the same but would just need to occur faster.

On the one hand, absolute control and exultation in what a human body can achieve in the water; on the other, the appalling tragedy that can result when we lose control \u2013 all the more awful because it can happen so quickly \u2013 in the act of having fun.</p> <p>I never learned to swim until I was in my late 20s.

Some people who decline to take part in competitive sport \u2013 often because they were put off it for life by experiences at school \u2013 look to swimming not for exercise, but for a kind of meditation or release.

I dislike swimming \u201cbetween the flags\u201d on public beaches. I feel as though I\u2019m under surveillance, even in the wilderness offered by a wide open Cornish strand. But I know I\u2019d thank God for the presence of a lifeguard if anything went wrong.</p> <p>I swim in the sea, every day. I sometimes swim in the dark, if that\u2019s when the tide falls. People tell me to be careful, to tell others where I\u2019m going, to take a phone with me. What would be the point? Even if I did own a phone, you can\u2019t put it in your trunks (which I don\u2019t wear either). I was once caught in a rip tide off Brighton beach. I remember thinking, as I realised I may not make it back, how banal it would be to drown within sight of a dual carriageway and a row of fish\u2019n\u2019chip shops.</p> <p>In winter storms we are warned not to go near the sea, for fear it might engulf us, as if its tentacles might reach out and drag us in.

Meanwhile, millions of pounds were spent, the parents say, on creating three new free schools, which hastened that closure, when Woodlands could have been saved for much less money.</p> <p>Woodlands effectively closed last month, after a decision to move its boys \u2013 the school was the city\u2019s only all-boys state school \u2013 to be educated alongside girls at the neighbouring Tile Hill Wood school from September. It will cease altogether as an entity in September 2017, with a new Coventry West academy combining boys and girls on the Tile Hill Wood site.</p> <p>Woodlands, one of England\u2019s first 20 comprehensives when founded in 1954, enjoys a place in a noted history of education. The late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/jan/22/guardianobituaries.highereducation\" title=\"\">Brian Simon</a>\u2019s book Education and the Social Order: British Education since 1944 says that by 1965 it was making national waves as its headmaster tried replacing academic streaming for younger pupils with mixed-ability teaching.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1522496146b5715f4273184f8b29b4c5b7b47701\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1522496146b5715f4273184f8b29b4c5b7b47701/63_768_3362_4200/800.jpg\" alt=\"Black and white photo of two boys in school uniform wearing caps\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">First-year boys at the start of a new school term at Woodlands in September 1981.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNo one could accuse this school of embracing a sloppy \u2026 progressivism\u201d as \u201cgowns were worn, discipline stressed, hard work, class teaching and homework were the rule\u201d, wrote Simon.</p> <p>Indeed, aspects of a traditionalist, almost private-school ethos survived to 2016. The school had a house system with head boys and deputies, prefects and pupils acting as \u201cmentors\u201d to younger peers. Departing students and&#xa0;parents say these practices lent valuable experience and CV points to their beneficiaries.</p> <p>The school was known for performing arts but particularly sport, and above all, rugby.

The school became an academy in 2011. Its last annual accounts reveal it faced a \u201cshort-term financial crisis\u201d based on a city-wide pupil population slump, teachers\u2019 pay increases, which were unfunded by the government, and the opening of several new schools.</p> <p>Although Woodlands is fiercely defended by parents, it was rated \u201crequires improvement\u201d by Ofsted in 2013. Last summer, GCSE results also fell below government floor targets. Pupil intake dropped to just over half of&#xa0;the school\u2019s capacity last September.</p> <p>Parents say the handling of Woodlands\u2019 proposed closure, with the news seeping out on social media in March on the evening after new pupils had been given their places at the school from September, exacerbated their anguish.</p> <p>But it is the issue of the free schools that is most contentious. In 2014, a Sikh-ethos school called Seva opened, along with Eden girls\u2019 school, a Muslim secondary.

Although production could be allowed, it would be unlikely given the size of the potential project and the further government approvals a coal mine would need.</p> <p>The mines and energy department rejected the suggestion there was any special treatment or deal for Tri-Star, and said the process was continuing despite the start of the caretaker period \u201cas it is considered part of the operational work of the department\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThese applications have not been approved,\u201d said the department head, Ron Kelly. \u201cThe department will ensure that mineral authority applications must follow the well-established assessment process as with all other mineral title applications.\u201d </p> <p>He said there was no reduction in rent obligations or costs to the company.

Ultimately the whole thing has been secretive. </p> <p>\u201cWhatever the motive, and no matter the explanation, it\u2019s a bad look for information about this potentially major development to come to light in this way.\u201d</p> <p>The NT chief minister, Adam Giles, dismissed accusations the arrangement was made in secret, and said the entire process had been \u201copen and transparent\u201d, despite only becoming aware of it himself on Tuesday.</p> <p>Giles told ABC radio in Alice Springs the Australian\u2019s report was \u201ca slur on the good officials who work in a government agency\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt was about a renewal of a lease that has been there for a long period of time,\u201d Giles said. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be publicly advertised. It has been publicly advertised as far as I understand it, and it\u2019s good to see the process is being followed.</p> <p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t publicly advertised, and it didn\u2019t go through that process, that would be be when it\u2019s sought to have been hidden, but it\u2019s been open and transparent as far as I\u2019m aware.\u201d</p> <p>Jimmy Cocking, spokesman for the Arid Lands Environment Centre, said the decision was reprehensible.</p> <p>\u201cThe CLP has outdone itself,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world is moving away from coal and here we have the [mines and energy department] reserving land for a coalmine in the middle of the Great Artesian Basin.</p> <p>\u201cThis decision sets the NT up for legal liability where the company may push for compensation if it is not allowed to proceed down the track.\u201d</p> <p>Cocking called for Labor to commit to reverse the decision if it won government.</p> <p>Tim Buckley, a financial analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics &amp; Financial Analysis, said if a large thermal coal mine was developed in the area, it would be a stranded asset before it was even finished.</p> <p>The only way a mine that far from a port could ever be profitable was with huge subsidies from the taxpayer.</p> <p>Existing coalmines were already struggling, so developing a new one from scratch was unlikely to be profitable even in the most favourable circumstances. </p> <p>Buckley said rail costs for coal can be about about 4c a tonne for each kilometre. If Tri-Star could get the coal to a port just 1,000km away, that would add $40 to a tonne of coal, which currently fetches about $65 a tonne.</p> <p>\u201cSo if you\u2019re talking about moving it from south of Alice Springs to Darwin, you\u2019re talking a prohibitive cost of rail transport,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThen you need to build and operate a dedicated coal port.\u201d</p> <p>The cost of building a port, even in Queensland<strong> </strong>where there are massive economies of scale, would add $5 to $6 to a tonne of coal, he said.</p> <p>\u201cSo you could be looking at a cost of $50 a tonne, before you\u2019ve even mined the coal,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On top of that, Buckley said thermal coal was in structural decline, with prices unlikely to recover as the world moved towards cleaner forms of energy.</p> <p>\u201cIt will be a stranded asset before it\u2019s even finished construction would be my guess,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way it could survive would be with taxpayer subsidies of the railway and all the other essential infrastructure.\u201d</p> <p>The Central Land Council, which acts for Indigenous landholder groups in the region, said it was concerned the NT lacked sufficient regulatory regimes or experience in regulating the coal industry. </p> <p>\u201cWe will discuss these developments with traditional owners and seek their instructions,\u201d CLC\u2019s director, David Ross, said.</p> <p>\u201cWe expect whoever wins the NT election to exercise a high degree of transparency where extraordinary arrangements are to be put in place for particular exploration projects, particularly for fossil-fuel projects with major environmental impacts.\u201d</p> <p>The NT minister for mines and energy, David Tollner, referred questions to the department.</p> <p>Tri-Star has been contacted for comment.</p>",

Others have known for longer. UNHCR released a report more than a month ago after they observed children fainting due to hunger from their difficult journey. Many of them then had to wait five days until they were taken to camps with appropriate services. Border point staff tell me they haven\u2019t had food there since November. </p> <p>Once we found out, we organised a meeting with numerous organisations and attempted to lay out an emergency response to begin the next day. Our plan had multiple levels \u2013 the emergency delivery of food immediately, followed by the installation of cooking pots and a place to store food to facilitate more regular feeding services.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this never happened, due to UNHCR\u2019s insistence on holding a joint assessment three days later. This was followed by another meeting four days after that. We complied, holding our tongues to jump through the humanitarian hoops we know all too well. But when that meeting looked like it would require another follow up, we had had enough. We announced that we would mobilise food, a car, fuel and were ready to give it to anyone at the border who was willing to receive it. No monitoring, no reporting, not even a signature would be required. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>So I am stuck here, looking at my car, full of food. And those people are waiting for us, hungry</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Everyone agreed, initially. UNHCR said they would coordinate with other organisations who have staff placed at the border points, to receive and distribute our aid. \u201cThank you,\u201d they said. Phone calls were made and the plans were set.</p> <p>The next morning, the receiving agency pulled out. They required specific protocols for distributing to be followed, and had not received the official permission to accept the aid. When we discussed what exactly they needed, they responded: \u201ca discussion\u201d. I called UNHCR, and got vague answers but they promised to \u201cfollow up immediately\u201d. I called the agency back multiple times and eventually the phone just kept ringing. UNHCR told me to call different people, who never answered their phones, or responded to the text messages I sent. </p> <p>So I am stuck here, looking at my car, full of food, the driver smoking cigarette after cigarette. And those people are waiting for us, hungry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jan/19/secret-aid-worker-ngos-abusing-power-costly-evaluations\">Secret aid worker: by not measuring impact, NGOs are abusing their power</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I think back on this process, and realise the full extent of the bureaucracy we are dealing with. At first, many of us were motivated and willing to discuss protocols, identify gaps and play out theoretical scenarios \u2013 of 100 people crossing, 500 people crossing, 1,000 people crossing and so on. We would collaborate and identify challenges, finding ways to mitigate them where we could. But after countless meetings and joint assessments, where questions about sustainable food distribution, medicine and infrastructure weren\u2019t answered but were just pushed down the agenda each week, our enthusiasm to play by the rules wavered.</p> <p>Food is a basic need. Providing it should not be a problem.</p> <p>I have a car. I have food that doesn\u2019t need a signature. I have fuel and someone to bring it there. People are hungry, and I have food. But I have to wait. The receiving agency wants to discuss protocols, but not now. UNHCR cannot be reached. Should I send it anyway? Would our relations sour? Would it delay further action? I hope the people waiting never find out I have a car full of food, right here, but cannot reach them. </p> <p>My work within the humanitarian sphere is new, I am certainly not widely experienced and I am not pretending to fully understand the complicated questions that define a response. I get the ins and outs of identifying needs, ensuring beneficiaries are taken care of responsibly, thinking broadly about systems and ensuring sustainability. I get it. However, what I witnessed on that day brought up debilitating, existential crisis questions for me. If we can\u2019t give food to hungry people quickly, then what the hell are we doing? </p> <p>The hardest part is, where to lay the blame? Probably everywhere is the answer. Partially, I think it lies with poor leadership, poor action points, and poorly conducted meetings. Certainly our own egos are to blame. Definitely the bureaucracy within our own organisations, and our blind commitment to defend those we work for and ourselves, regardless of circumstances. </p> <p>Eventually the food we had collected made it to those border points \u2013 or some of them at least. Mission accomplished? It was still weeks later and that isn\u2019t a timeframe many of us are comfortable with.</p> <p><em>Do you have a secret aid worker story you\u2019d like to tell?

  "<p>There are a lot of people in this world who are keen to talk down Australia at every opportunity.</p> <p>We always focus on the negatives of the catastrophic failures in governance that have become a regular feature of the nightly news. But we never focus on the positives of these failures.</p> <p>For example, there is a genuine chance that the failure of our census will ultimately lead to the end of the boat turnbacks policy, simply because refugees won\u2019t want to flee to a country that can\u2019t run a simple internet poll. But will Philip Adams ever tweet that point? I wouldn\u2019t be holding my breath.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just the Guardian and the Conversation that are constantly spinning our failures as negatives. If you read the gutter research reports from the Australian Human Rights Commission (not to mention those nutters at the CSIRO), you might think that Australia\u2019s record on human rights and the environment leaves a lot to be desired.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/commentisfree/2016/aug/23/experience-my-attempt-to-go-21-days-without-a-whinge-took-me-six-months\">Experience: my attempt to go 21 days without a whinge ended up taking six months | Michael Dawson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But nothing could be further from the truth. There are plenty of internationally recognised measures in which Australia consistently ranks near the top.</p> <p>Take, for instance, Australia\u2019s human rights record when it comes to its treatment of Indigenous people. Last year, Australia was ranked in Amnesty International\u2019s top three worst developed countries. And that was <em>before</em> the Don Dale revelations. Imagine what our rankings will be by this time next year!</p> <p>This is why \u2013 after spending a lot of time with Donald Trump supporters this year \u2013 I have developed a special five-step process for Making Australia Great Again.</p> <h2>One: Learn from the masters at papering over government cuts</h2> <p>First up: to make Australia great we have to learn from the greats. And there is no greater country than the US, when it comes to papering over government cuts. What did the US government do when Congress refused to fund its statistics agency to conduct a census every five years? Simple: they decided to only conduct one every 10 years. Sure, this means that planning for hospitals, schools and roads remains 10 years behind the curve, but think of all that money that can instead be used on useful things like drone attacks on Arabs.</p> <h2>Two: Tone down the scrutiny</h2> <p>Secondly, when Australia does stuff up, there is often way too much scrutiny. The way Malcolm Turnbull jumped on the opportunity to establish a royal commission into the Northern Territory\u2019s detention system shows how our politicians have been trained to react with knee-jerk accountability whenever something terrible happens to people who aren\u2019t donors to your party.</p> <p>A better model is to look at how Turnbull is treating calls for a royal commission into banks. Here he understands something that we should apply to everything in Australia: that perception matters more than reality. What we don\u2019t know, can\u2019t make us feel bad about ourselves.</p> <h2>Three: Shift the blame</h2> <p>Thirdly, when something terrible happens, always blame something else. This is something that Donald Trump is masterful at, but with which we struggle. Take for instance: refugee policy. The mortar-board-set keep trying to blame the government for our treatment of people fleeing for their lives. But what about the governments back in their homelands trying to kill them? Nobody ever blames them. It\u2019s like blaming your neighbour for locking their door and not letting you into their house to escape a fleeing axe-murderer, rather than blaming the axe-murderer.</p> <p>The point is, on many issues, from human rights to climate change, Australia shouldn\u2019t be blamed for our bad behaviour when it\u2019s often simply a consequence of the bad behaviour of others.</p> <p>For example, when it comes to the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia should point the finger overseas at the nations burning the coal we\u2019ve exported to them, not at our patriotic coal miners who haven\u2019t burnt a piece of coal in their life.</p> <h2>Four: Watch more renovation shows</h2> <p>Fourth, to make Australia great again, people should watch more renovation shows on television. Programs like Four Corners and Q&amp;A give you an unrealistically grim view of Australia, whereas Renovation Rumble makes you feel good. It\u2019s all about improving Australia \u2013 not critiquing the institutions that run it.</p> <p>According to my research, Four Corners has never once explained how to build a patio out from your dining room area to create both light and space. And it\u2019s been on air for 55 years. What a disgrace.</p> <h2>Five: Build a wall</h2> <p>Finally, if we learn anything from Trump, it\u2019s that Australia needs to build a wall around itself. Obviously, not a real wall. I tried that, but it kept on sinking into the ocean. Instead, it\u2019s about building a metaphorical wall.</p> <p> Instead of listening to the UN agencies who despise our way of treating fellow human beings, and the international climate organisations that point to our emissions as being among the highest per capita in the world, we should stop listening to them, blow up some balloons, have a giant party and celebrate. If we try really hard, we can ignore the fact that we\u2019re part of the rest of the world.</p> <p><em>Charles Firth is the editor-in-chief of The Chaser Quarterly.

That, David Cameron claimed on his last day at No 10, was one of his proudest achievements.</p> <p>Even then, Cameron heard a constant hum of discontent from the Brexit brigade: taxpayer-funded blimps such as Peter Bone and Philip Davies (he of the recent attacks on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/12/tory-mp-philip-davies-claims-uk-legal-system-favours-women-at-mens-rights-event\" title=\"\">\u201cfeminist zealots\u201d </a>. Their line never changed: development money funds corrupt Africans and charity begins at home. Penned in for years on the fringes of politics, the Brexit brigade took a big stride on 24 June towards the mainstream of their party. And now one of their number controls spending on aid and development.</p> <p>In all the hilarity over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/23/chevening-house-share-rules-liam-fox-boris-johnson-david-davis\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson sharing Chevening with Liam Fox and David Davis</a>, one of the most remarkable of May\u2019s appointments went almost unnoticed.

In correspondence unearthed by the Observer, a senior BAT executive complained at the time: \u201cWe have felt a sense that Shandwick does not actually feel comfortable or happy working for BAT.\u201d He made an exception for Patel: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/30/priti-patel-worked-as-spin-doctor-tobacco-firm-burma-scandal\" title=\"\">\u201cPriti [and another employee] seem quite relaxed working with us.\u201d</a> So relaxed, in fact, that as an MP, Patel <a href=\"http://www.rmif.co.uk/press-room/press-releases/retailers-join-mps-fight-to-oppose-plain-packaging-02-05-14/?y=2014&amp;m=5\" title=\"\">campaigned against plain packaging on cigarettes. </a></p> <p>As for development, our new secretary of state <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3690578/Meet-minister-low-priorities-New-international-aid-secretary-Priti-Patel-previously-demanded-ABOLITION-department-wastes-money.html\" title=\"\">has called it \u201clow priority\u201d</a>.

As campaigns director for the pressure group, Oxley spent years vilifying government spending \u2013 with a special assault on development. The TPA provided the Mail on Sunday with a good chunk of its knocking copy for its campaign against aid \u2013 which made claims so ludicrous that government officials <a href=\"https://www.bond.org.uk/news/2016/03/dfid-hits-back-at-unfounded-allegations-on-aid-spending\" title=\"\">were forced to declare them as \u201csimply incorrect\u201d. </a></p> <p>Doubts may have been voiced about the commitment of Patel\u2019s predecessor, Justine Greening. Visitors may have noted that her office at the Department for International Development was festooned with model planes and other memorabilia from her stint at the Department for Transport. But Patel and Oxley have been actively hostile to the jobs they are now being paid handsomely to do. As Stephen Doughty, on the Commons international development committee, says: \u201cThese are two of the most ideological critics of aid. They\u2019ve got an agenda to pursue \u2013 against the very department they\u2019re in.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Cash earmarked to help people in poor countries will instead be offered to middle-income giants like India and China</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As much as Patel and Oxley detest the aid-spending target, I cannot see them junking it \u2013 not when it was in the Tories\u2019 last election manifesto. Much more likely is that they will erode it. Cash earmarked to help people in poor countries will instead be offered to leaders of middle-income giants such as India, China and South Africa, to get them to buy British exports. Look at Patel\u2019s announcement last week of a new \u201cpartnership\u201d with India, which promised \u201csupport for India to boost economic growth, jobs and trade, which will also benefit Britain\u201d. It contained blah about \u201csmart cities\u201d and equity funds, even a rupee-denominated bond. Only in the very final sentence was there any clue that this document had come not from the former minister for hi-vis jackets, with the casual, dubious claim that \u201cinvesting in India\u2019s private sector benefits India\u2019s poorest people\u201d.</p> <p>Looming over this is the shadow of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/dec/23/hamiltonvalfayed.comment\" title=\"\">Malaysia\u2019s Pergau Dam</a>, that milkiest of white elephants funded by Thatcher over official objections, in return, it was alleged, for Kuala Lumpur buying British arms. While the first Tory development secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/andrew-mitchell\" title=\"\">Andrew Mitchell</a>, says people \u201cshould wait and see what Patel says and does\u201d, insiders have already seen enough. As one former senior DfID employee says: \u201cIt\u2019s a choice between a fast death for the department \u2013 and a slow death.\u201d That demise will not be prevented by the NGOs, who have gone quiet while awaiting their government grant settlements. Nor will it be mourned by a largely hostile press.</p> <p>One of the tragedies of this is that over two decades, Britain has led the world in both its commitment to development and its thinking on the subject. And the need for money going to the poorest and most vulnerable people, whether hit by climate change or by war or by decades of underinvestment \u2013 often linked to empires such as Britain\u2019s \u2013 hasn\u2019t gone away. A couple of weeks ago, I was talking to a Syrian violinist who played at this summer\u2019s Proms. He told me about his home of Damascus, about his aunts and uncles still there. About his neighbours who would sometimes get maimed or killed by a stray bomb. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a European heaven while you have a Middle Eastern hell,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>Twisting high above Shanghai\u2019s financial district, China\u2019s tallest tower \u2013 and the second tallest in the world \u2013 is preparing to officially open its substantial doors to the public next month. The Shanghai Tower, <a href=\"http://www.dezeen.com/2016/01/11/shanghai-tower-gensler-world-second-tallest-building/\">reaching 632 metres</a>, is the third \u201csupertall\u201d tower on the city\u2019s iconic skyline. Looking out from the 119th floor, the city lies below like a toy model, a densely packed mass of streets and high-rise buildings. </p> <p>China loves a world record, and its new building boasts plenty, including the world\u2019s fastest elevators, highest hotel and restaurant, and tallest viewing platform. Reassuringly, it also required the largest ever cement pouring for the foundations. But most importantly, the 128-storey tower also claims to be the world\u2019s greenest skyscraper. Awarded the top green rating, LEED Platinum, the government is hailing the tower as a sign of China\u2019s growing green credentials.</p> <p> China\u2019s sustainability record in the past has been abysmal. The country burns <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jan/30/china-burns-half-coal-worldwide\">47% of the world\u2019s coal</a>, according to the US Energy Information Administration, and is facing the impact of decades of rapid deforestation and water pollution. With some of the most polluted air on the planet, <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0135749\">killing as many as 4,000 people a day</a>, an increasingly restive population is demanding more government action. </p> <p>Nervous of the impact that smog-filled days and clogged roads could have on social stability, the government has begun tree planting programmes, ordered thousands of cars off the roads in cities such as Beijing, and is investing in green technology in a big way. China is now the biggest renewables market in the world, more than double than in the US, and home to almost one of every three wind turbines globally.</p> <p> Green buildings, however, make up a woefully small part of the green industry, with most work focused on quick construction and quicker sales. Estimates put the number of green buildings on the mainland at less than 1%, though a 2014 target by the State Council wants <a href=\"http://2016.export.gov/china/build/groups/public/@eg_cn/documents/webcontent/eg_cn_088721.pdf\">30% of new construction projects to be green by 2020</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"27a6fbcbe6d7d4477cbdb06b12c3d43967624751\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27a6fbcbe6d7d4477cbdb06b12c3d43967624751/0_128_2998_2122/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Shanghai Tower\" width=\"1000\" height=\"708\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Shanghai Tower (right) has been awarded the highest sustainability rating.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Connie Zhou/Gensler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> In Shanghai, engineer Shunfu Cha points to 200 wind turbines spinning at the top of the tower \u2013 the world\u2019s tallest turbines, naturally \u2013 which generate around 10% of the building\u2019s electricity. \u201cThese are one of the most obvious green technologies,\u201d he says, gesturing upwards into the clouds. \u201cBut only one part of bringing down the energy use.\u201d</p> <p> The building collects rainwater and re-uses waste water, has a combined cooling and heating power system and uses 40 other energy-saving measures that developers claim cut 34,000 metric tonnes from its annual carbon footprint. The building is wrapped in two layers of glass for natural cooling and ventilation, and in total developers say a third of the site is \u201cgreen space\u201d, including 24 sky gardens sitting between the two skins.</p> <p> \u201cAt the moment, everyone is trying to achieve top green certification criteria,\u201d says Xiaomei Lee, managing director of Gensler Shanghai, the building\u2019s architect. \u201cBut nobody yet has achieved LEED Platinum for a supertall building. People assumed that a building of this size can\u2019t achieve such a high sustainability rating.\u201d</p> <p> Shanghai Tower might be the only supertall tower to achieve LEED Platinum, but it is part of an increasing movement for towers to market green credentials as the demand for more sustainable urban development is felt.<strong> </strong></p> <p> The world\u2019s first <a href=\"http://www.passivhaus.org.uk/\">Passivhaus</a>-certified office tower \u2013 a certification rating that considers ongoing annual energy use, considered more stringent than other energy codes \u2013 was opened in Vienna two years ago, using 80% less heating and cooling energy than an equivalent tower through efficient power systems. London\u2019s tallest building, the Shard, also has a raft of sustainability features which enable it to use 30% less energy than a conventionally designed skyscraper of the same height. Globally, 75 skyscrapers are LEED rated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82be685d7560e8b6e2c3145c8aba22c3cf65b01e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82be685d7560e8b6e2c3145c8aba22c3cf65b01e/410_741_6950_4171/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bosco verticale in Milan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bosco verticale in Milan, with more than 1,000 different species of tree.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> More buildings are also turning green, literally.

Buildings are the largest contributor to climate change through carbon emissions, and critics point out that logically, taller towers will need more resources both to run and to construct. So are we just seeing the latest version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/20/greenwashing-environmentalism-lies-companies\">\u201cgreenwashing\u201d</a>?</p> <p> Environmental concerns include the fact that clusters of towers can make the streets below dark, trapping hot air and pollution at ground level. There is a knock-on impact in terms of carbon emissions, blocking light to surrounding properties, forcing the need for more electric lighting and eradicating the possibility of solar energy.</p> <p> Tall towers also face charges of elitism. News that London has 260 new skyscrapers in the pipeline <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/mar/29/campaigners-fight-save-london-skyline\">met with bitter opposition<strong> </strong>from campaigners earlier this year</a>, largely on the grounds that these towers will mostly offer luxury apartments that do little to help problems of affordable housing.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLDYtH1RH-U\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gLDYtH1RH-U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>In 2014, two Russian free climbers reached the top of the Shanghai Tower in just two hours. </figcaption> </figure>   <p> And money is certainly to be made in green development. Investors and companies are increasingly looking to benefit from cost efficiencies, with maintenance bills around 20% less than typical commercial buildings. While they cost more to build, the USGBC estimates most green projects pay for themselves in around seven years, especially as property agents say rents in LEED-certified buildings can be up to 30% higher.</p> <p>The UN expects two-thirds of the world to live in cities by 2050 \u2013 the Chinese government\u2019s target is 60% by 2020 \u2013 presenting challenges over how to provide sustainable buildings in space-starved cities. Research has suggested that high-rise buildings are the most sustainable form of urban development. A <a href=\"http://www.terrapinbrightgreen.com/report/midcentury-unmodern/\">2013 report by Terrapin Bright Green</a>, commissioned by the New York government, recommended knocking down Manhattan towers that were too inefficient and replacing them with even bigger skyscrapers. Modern replacements could be 44% larger and still use 5% less energy, the study claimed. </p> <p>While Terrapin acknowledged that demolishing and rebuilding wouldn\u2019t be appropriate \u2013 or affordable \u2013 in every case, they found that even where buildings were knocked down and replaced, the energy needed to dismantle the existing building and construct a new one would still be offset within 15 and 28 years.</p> <p> \u201cSome people have opposed taller buildings on the premise that they use more energy, but they have failed to consider the larger spillover effects of urban sustainability that come from a dense urban fabric,\u201d claims Sarene Marshall, executive director for the Center for Sustainability at the Urban Land Institute. \u201cWhile buildings are the largest contributor to climate change through carbon emissions, transportation is a very close second. When you have a denser urban population, people are more likely to walk, bike or use public transportation to get to work. So if you build taller buildings, you have a denser urban fabric.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"05944a68f398acefc2c930e90548930b02e04b0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05944a68f398acefc2c930e90548930b02e04b0e/0_282_4648_2789/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manhattan buildings\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 2013 report suggested knocking down \u2018inefficient\u2019 skyscrapers in Manhattan and replacing them with taller ones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> \u201cIf you build lower buildings and spread them out over a longer distance, what often happens is a much higher footprint in automobile transportation.\u201d</p> <p> A study by the <a href=\"http://newclimateeconomy.report/2014/cities/\">New Climate Economy</a> backs this up. Comparing the cities of Barcelona and Atlanta, with similar populations, Atlanta was found to have a much larger carbon footprint because people used cars to get around a large, sprawling urban area. The thinktank concluded that taller, denser buildings can dramatically reduce a city\u2019s carbon impact. </p> <p> However, green credentials and promises don\u2019t always stack up. Critics say that LEED criteria focuses too much on the development of the building, and not enough on how it is used afterwards. A <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/113942/bank-america-tower-and-leed-ratings-racket\">New Republic report</a> claimed that The Bank of America tower in New York, hailed as the world\u2019s most \u201cenvironmentally responsible\u201d office building when it opened in 2010, actually produces more greenhouse gases and uses more energy per square foot than any comparably sized office building in Manhattan. In relying too much on LEED ratings, critics argue, developers and governments can get additional publicity without necessarily being energy efficient in the long run.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/feb/13/shanghai-tower-climb-in-pictures\">Shanghai tower climb - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p> In many US states, there are also tax breaks for energy-efficient buildings, leading to claims that building designers target the easiest and cheapest green points in order to qualify as LEED rated and gain tax exemptions.</p> <p> And there are cases where the new technology disappoints. In London, the Strata Tower in Elephant and Castle, met criticism by residents when it opened as its in-built wind turbines \u2013 designed for helping heat and cool the building properly \u2013 weren\u2019t turning. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in an eco experiment that has gone wrong at the design stage\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/residents-hit-boiling-point-at-the-eco-tower-where-turbines-don-t-turn-6503753.html\">one resident said</a>. The promised new public garden at the Walkie Talkie tower in London also <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-30709757\">attracted criticism</a> for being neither particularly green nor public enough. </p> <p> For advocates of high-rise buildings, vertical development seems to be the future, and they remain convinced that green skyscrapers like the Shanghai Tower are the only sustainable way to do it.

In addition, a local outlet of DIY retailer B&amp;Q donated \u00a31,000-worth of stock, while outdoor brands Berghaus and Patagonia gave backpacks, travel duffle bags and other goods. </p> <p>\u201cWe wanted the items to be firstly of good quality, so not previously used where possible, and we had to know that they were safe, particularly where they were electrical,\u201d says Travalyan. </p> <p>In addition to borrowing fees, the founders hope to generate revenues through the sale of branded merchandise and ancillary products, such as screws and cleaning fluids. They have also won a <a href=\"https://www.thersa.org/fellowship/project-support\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scaling Catalyst Award</a> from the Royal Society of Arts to fund an explanatory toolkit for other organisations looking to copy the model.

The so-called sharing economy is set to be worth <a href=\"http://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/megatrends/collisions/sharingeconomy/the-sharing-economy-sizing-the-revenue-opportunity.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">$335bn per year globally by 2025</a> \u2013 equal to the projected value of the traditional rental sector.</p> <p>The sector\u2019s big brand stars \u2013 including Uber, ZipCar, TaskRabbit \u2013 are quick to use the word \u201cdisruptive\u201d. And they are creating a radical shake-up in their respective sectors. That\u2019s why the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/jul/08/airbnb-legal-troubles-what-are-the-issues\">global hotel industry has opposed</a> accommodation site Airbnb, for example. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/31/consumerism-reached-peak-stuff-search-for-happiness\">If having more no longer satisfies us, perhaps we\u2019ve reached \u2018peak stuff\u2019 | Will Hutton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The aspirations of the Library of Things however are different and potentially far more radical. \u201cWe\u2019re interested in how we can make the organisation accountable to the community and for our members to be on a genuinely peer-to-peer level,\u201d says Trevalyan. That\u2019s very different from an Uber-style model, where the sharing platform is privately-owned and operated. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://economyofhours.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Economy of Hours</a> (or Echo for short), a job-share platform based in London, has a similar philosophy. Its network of more than 3,000 users trade their time and skills equally among themselves. An hour of one person\u2019s time is worth an hour of someone else\u2019s, regardless of whether it\u2019s a logo-design they\u2019re offering or a haircut. Unlike much larger equivalents, such as <a href=\"https://www.taskrabbit.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">TaskRabbit</a>, <a href=\"https://uk.fiverr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fiverr</a> or <a href=\"https://www.peopleperhour.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PeoplePerHour</a>, no money changes hands. </p> <p>\u201cThe idea of democratisation, of creating something that everyone can take part in, where everyone can be valued equally and hopefully participate on an equal footing, that\u2019s very much our core philosophy,\u201d says Sarah Henderson, director of operations at London-based Echo, which is registered as a community interest company.</p> <p>The limiting factor, she admits, is money. Without any profits, Echo relies primarily on grants, volunteers and general goodwill. This covers the wages of three paid staff - which is three more than the Library of Things at present. </p> <p>Scaling up such models is always a challenge, says Ben Kellard, head of sustainable business at the specialist advisory organisation, Forum for the Future. What social entrepreneurs have in terms of great ideas and innovation, they lack in capital and reach, he says. Big business, in contrast, lacks the first but has plenty of the second. \u201cIt should be a perfect marriage between the two in theory,\u201d he says, \u201cbut you rarely see that in practice.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/10/accounting-drugs-prostitution-uk-economy-gdp-eu-rules\">Accounting for drugs and prostitution to help push UK economy up by \u00a365bn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet the sharing economy is an \u201cirreversible trend\u201d and corporations ignore up-and-coming innovators in the space at their peril, Kellard says. Opportunities to network and experiment might be more realistic at this stage than full-on partnerships. He cites innovation hubs such as <a href=\"https://foundry.unilever.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Unilever Foundry</a> and Telefonica-backed <a href=\"http://wayra.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wayra</a> by way of example.</p> <p>Another hurdle is low public demand. At present, it\u2019s just too easy to click online and \u201cblindly buy more stuff\u201d, says Sam Stephens, founder of the neighbourhood-based sharing platform <a href=\"http://www.streetbank.com/splash?locale=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">Streetbank</a> (also supported by B&amp;Q). In his darker moments, Stephens fears it will need a cataclysmic economic shock to make the average consumer think seriously about sharing over buying. </p> <p>He hopes, however, that democratically-run, community-owned sharing enterprises can turn the tables on consumer capitalism. If everyone shared everything, GDP would collapse, he admits. But, he says, \u201cwe\u2019d still have a perfectly healthy economy. It\u2019s just our resources would be used much more efficiently.\u201d </p> <ul> <li>This piece was amended on 23 August to specify that Echo has three staff</li> </ul>",

The killing of strangers is very much a male preserve. In the classic Hollywood gangster film White Heat, Cody (James Cagney) cries out \u201cOn top of the world Ma!\u201d as he exits in a blaze of glory by blowing himself up atop a gas storage tank while shooting at the police below; nowadays referred to as \u201csuicide by cop\u201d. </p> <p>The term is used most often to describe a youngish man who decides to end his life by staging a siege situation hoping to be shot, occasionally with hostages and a desire that others also die with him. Typically he will have a history of criminal behaviour and the final act is often fuelled by intoxication and triggered by a significant loss, often that of an intimate relationship. Commonly these men are narcissistic and the more they feel neglected, rejected or opposed, the greater their desire for attention. </p> <p>What better way to sear one\u2019s presence into the mind of others than by the dramatic violent taking of lives, especially if it can be emblazoned in the news? News that now has global reach.</p> <p>These events often happen at a particular time of life \u2013 early adulthood, which <a href=\"http://www.simplypsychology.org/Erik-Erikson.html#identity\">coincides with transitioning from dependence on the family to a stable interdependence with the wider society.</a> During the transition period identifications are intense, fluid and formed by associations to like-minded peers.</p> <p><a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.410340113/full\">Neuroscience</a> has also shown that the brain of a young adult continues developing well into the twenties and higher mental functions responsible for impulse control and long term consequential judgment are the last to mature. Delayed maturation is particularly evident in men, and correlated with egocentricity and antisocial attitudes.</p> <p>Not surprisingly then, disaffected and confused young males will see detailed, graphic and protracted global reporting of others with whom they identify and find justification for emulation alongside an opportunity for attachment to a group that would amplify the significance of their behaviour. There may even be a wish to \u201cbetter\u201d the latest atrocity in a perverse competition to be the biggest badass. Indeed what may initially have otherwise been a more limited and impulsive intention may be elaborated into something grander.</p> <p>Contrary to sensationalist headlines <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318286/\">severe mental illness is uncommon</a>. Hence the astonishment displayed at the attackers behaviour by family and neighbours.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/28/french-media-terrorists-identities-le-monde-social\">Counter opinions</a> from others in the media to restrictions on reporting have argued that for such men, it is social media that matters and so news outlets have little impact on their decisions. This is to miss the point that their wish is be noticed not so much by their fellow fringe dwellers but by the mainstream they feel is responsible for not seeing their true worth. Having the law-abiding and the powerful cringe and quake in response to reports in which their personal details are endlessly pored over is the Holy Grail. Besides, even social media relies heavily on news reports.</p> <p>Research from the 1960s onwards established a link between detailed personal reports of suicide and subsequent suicide by others who found misjudged validation from the publicised account. It was dubbed the Werther effect (named after copycat suicides by young men following the publication in 1774 of Goethe\u2019s The Sorrows of Young Werther). Acceptance by responsible media organisations of the findings has led to a <a href=\"https://www.iasp.info/media_guidelines.php\">growth in guidelines</a> in many countries curbing detailed accounts of a personal nature regarding suicide.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/10/violence-is-contagious/309459/\">Similar findings are now emerging in relation to acts of public violence</a>. The right for the public to read lurid details of little direct relevance and with a potential to cause loss of life is hard to justify.</p> <p>None of this is to discount that social, economic and ideological influences are important and must be vigorously confronted. However our most potent influence are others and our relationships with them, perhaps even more so when it is imagined rather than real and lends itself to a romantic idealised experience. They shape our identity and our state of mind. In the end any act is the product of that mind.</p> <p>The male brain in early adulthood has yet to attain full maturation and struggles to curb impulses, delay gratification and exercise judgment over the emotions. Allied to the brain\u2019s deficient self-control is the major psychological challenge of developing a satisfactory self-identity that allows, as Freud said, the goals of a mature person in society to love and to work; to feel a sense of meaning, purpose and belonging. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/28/french-media-terrorists-identities-le-monde-social\">French media\u2019s blackout on terrorists\u2019 identities is missing the point | Jason Burke</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before this final stage is realised, the identity is in flux and inclined towards its need to discover itself.

And unlike a lot of women, conservative and otherwise, she\u2019s been willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/watch/conway-all-issues-are-women-s-issues-746954819988\">recently telling MSNBC</a> \u201cI think you should judge people by their actions, not just their words on a political campaign trail\u201d. Whether Trump will be able to listen to and learn from Conway\u2019s guidance, however, remains to be seen.</p> <p>Listening to women has never exactly been Trump\u2019s strong suit, but now his entire campaign may hang in the balance of his ability \u2013 or more likely, lack of ability \u2013 to do just that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/22/kellyanne-conway-is-donald-trumps-last-chance-winning\">Kellyanne Conway is Donald Trump's last, best chance | Lucia Graves</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bb672ce4b0377cf11192aa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-22T20:57:30.736Z\">9.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>The Clinton campaign is really pushing this new campaign advert:</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/767827749063057409\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In times of crisis, America depends on steady leadership, clear thinking, and calm judgment. <a href=\"https://t.co/Tpo3Sp7Ri1\">https://t.co/Tpo3Sp7Ri1</a></p>&mdash; Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/767827749063057409\">August 22, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bb608ce4b0b7e6490021a8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-22T20:35:28.093Z\">9.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Donald Trump postpones immigration speech</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Donald Trump\u2019s highly anticipated speech on immigration, originally set to take place on Thursday in Denver, Colorado, has been postponed.</p> <p>A Trump campaign spokesperson <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/2016/08/22/donald-trump-immigration-plan-aspen-colorado/\">told the Denver Post</a> that although the candidate will be appearing in at a big-dollar fundraiser in Aspen, Colorado, the trip will not be accompanied by a much-ballyhooed policy address on Trump\u2019s signature issue: immigration.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.univision.com/univision-news/politics/trump-now-says-he-plans-to-legalize-some-undocumented-immigrants\">Rumors flourished this weekend</a> that Trump had softened his stance on deporting the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the US, including openness to creating a pathway to legal status, after a meeting with Latino leaders in which Trump reportedly admitted that deporting millions of US residents \u201cis neither possible nor humane\u201d.</p> <p>In an interview with Fox &amp; Friends this morning, a defiant Trump dismissed the reports, but did not come out and say that he would, as he\u2019s previously suggested, implement a \u201cdeportation force\u201d to hunt down undocumented immigrants living in the United States,</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not flip-flopping,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe want to come up with a really fair, but firm answer.

I am committed to visiting communities affected by these floods, at a time when the presence of a political campaign will not disrupt the response, to discuss how we can and will rebuild together.</p> <p>\u201cIn times of crisis, Americans have always come together to lift each other up, support each other, and rebuild stronger and better than before.

Lorge says there have already been preliminary discussions with local councils in Australia about the improved management of loading zones, and incentives for shipping companies to meet tighter delivery windows, such as waived toll fees.
