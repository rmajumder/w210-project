  "<p>Theresa May long plotted to become leader of her party. Now all those weary evenings on the rubber chicken circuit and long hours in the Home Office have paid off, leaving our new prime minister in ebullient mood in Birmingham. I watched her speak in two private events yesterday night. She was warm and even witty as she engaged in a spot of rabble-rousing after her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/02/conservative-conference-may-to-explain-brexit-great-repeal-bill-in-marr-interview-politics-live?page=with:block-57f11d1ce4b015be63833667#block-57f11d1ce4b015be63833667\">landmark Brexit speech</a> at the Conservative conference, cheered by adoring audiences of boisterous party workers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/jul/13/theresa-mays-speech-what-she-said-and-what-she-meant\">Theresa May's speech: what she said and what she meant</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tory activists tend to be loyal to new leaders. And to Tory activists May is recognisably one of them \u2013 unlike her predecessor \u2013 after a 30-year political journey from <a href=\"http://news.radiojackie.com/2016/07/theresa-may-served-on-merton-council.html\">Durnsford ward on south London\u2019s Merton council</a> to Downing Street. Yet there is an extra whiff of triumphalism this year after the referendum result. <a href=\"http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/\">Almost 5 million Tory voters backed remain</a>, but the mood at conference is one of unrestrained delight: Brussels has been beaten and metropolitan liberals banished, and foreigners flooding Britain will be turned back.</p> <p>May wants her premiership defined by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/11/theresa-may-tory-leadership-pitch-andrea-leadsom\">social justice reforms</a>, not just Brexit. This is admirable. But the conference\u2019s post-referendum delirium feels depressing; much of the time like stumbling into a Ukip event. Speeches from the podium talk of taking back control from Europe and imply that other nations will do exactly as Britain tells them, while in fringe meetings they discuss how to stop migration and bring back grammar schools. All that is missing are the purple and yellow ties.</p> <p>Brexit has impacted inevitably on political discourse in both main parties, especially on immigration. A book by Gary Gibbon, the Channel 4 News political editor, suggests the Australian points system was only pushed by leave campaigners to send a <a href=\"http://mogaznews.com/en/World-News/187939.html\">dog-whistle signal to white voters</a> since that nation is seen as overwhelmingly white. Now we must live with the legacy of such cynical and divisive politics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"25b8152d7ef800d509b53aa01988496c7209f38c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25b8152d7ef800d509b53aa01988496c7209f38c/4_0_1192_1490/800.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Gibbon, the Channel 4 News political editor\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gary Gibbon, the Channel 4 News political editor, \u2018suggests the Australian points system was only pushed by leave campaigners to send a dog-whistle signal to white voters\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But like it or not, Brexit is a reality. Those of us who think it a disastrous idea need to stop being so stunned by this self-harming decision and start forging a sensible response to protect the economy and liberal values. Not least since May has interpreted the referendum result as first and foremost a vote to curb immigration, so will sacrifice single-market membership to impose restrictions on free movement.</p> <p>Clearly the prime minister is adopting a negotiating stance ahead of tough talks over terms of departure. But it was noticeable that she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/brexit-theresa-may-prioritises-immigration-curbs-over-free-movement\">singled out food labelling</a> when discussing sovereignty in her Sunday speech, since this ultimately comes under World Trade Organisation deals that will still be binding post Brexit. This underscores spurious claims of \u201ctaking back control\u201d in such an interlocked world. Meanwhile one cabinet minister said that economic corrosion caused by Brexit may slow down flows of migrants moving here for work.</p> <p>But most dismaying is the mixture of naivety, arrogance and rank hypocrisy found behind the Brexit bravura. No one seems to have a clue as to what sort of agreement can be achieved with our closest trading partners in Europe. The Brexit ministry is still scrabbling to find skilled negotiators, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws\">article 50 is being triggered within five months</a>. Then Britain will have just two years to sort a trade deal with a bloc of 27 nations that does not want to undermine a union based on free markets and free movement. Yes, they have concerns over migration \u2013 but that is from outside, not within, the EU. At the same time, those new negotiators must do bilateral deals with dozens more nations whose EU agreements will no longer apply to us.</p> <p>Ministers admit they may have to use billions saved from Brussels to bail out firms suffering Brexit fallout, while Downing Street has offered indemnities to alarmed trading partners. Bear in mind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/brexit-canada-trade-deal-eu-model-next-steps\">Canada has taken seven years to sort an EU trade deal</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/02/article-50-trade-eu-deals-globalisation\">Switzerland took 17 years</a> to sign one insurance agreement.<a href=\"http://www.euractiv.com/section/uk-europe/opinion/dont-look-to-norway-brexiteers/\"> Norway lost 20,000 jobs</a> and chunks of its fish-processing industry to Denmark and Poland because of having to accept EU tariffs, underlining how duties can distort markets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad02b45538725413636f3f5ae61ab60f9eceabd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad02b45538725413636f3f5ae61ab60f9eceabd0/0_162_4928_2956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Delegates at the Conservative conference in Birmingham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Delegates at the Conservative conference in Birmingham: \u2018all that is missing are the purple and yellow ties\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When pressed about the outcome, a key minister kept repeating to me \u201cthe best possible deal\u201d before finally confessing that Britain would end up accepting the imposition of some tariffs. Another talked airily of deals with Australia, which represents less than 2% of our trade. A third cheerily insisted that City financiers would not wish to move to Frankfurt. A fourth repeated the tired mantra that Europe will give in to British demands because of the size of our economy.</p> <p>We hear brave talk of Britain\u2019s new role in the world, exemplified by <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/02/boris-johnson-bbc-is-infuriatingly-anti-brexit-but-remains-singl/\">Boris Johnson\u2019s speech on soft-power strength</a>. But we also learn of fresh limits on foreign students, despite the global success of our universities, and on foreign workers, who fuel growth in so many sectors (and prop up public services). Already the tightening of visas, plus exorbitant costs, is undermining the ability and desire of many in Africa and Asia to trade with Britain. Incidentally the foreign secretary should remember that <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/uk/361393-boris-johnson-africa-country/\">Africa is not one country</a> \u2013 a slip in his speech that spoke volumes about attitudes.</p> <p>Polling indicates that despite the Brexit vote most voters are unwilling to see their own income fall to reduce immigration. But already growth predictions are slowing, and uncertainty is growing. Our nation has set its future aflame with insouciance \u2013 fuelled by provocateurs who pose as saviours of the country, but clearly have few ideas how to control the blaze.</p>",
  "<p>Much of the talk about Europe these days revolves around the return of the nation state, the rise of identity politics and all sorts of geographical divides, north-south, east-west \u2013 trends again illustrated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/02/hungarian-vote-on-refugees-will-not-take-place-suggest-first-poll-results\" title=\"\">Hungary\u2019s referendum</a> on Sunday.</p> <p>What\u2019s less explored is Europe\u2019s generational gap: not just the differences between young and old but the way people\u2019s expectations have mutated over time, and how that can create deep frustrations when initial hopes aren\u2019t met. Frustrations will easily breed anti-establishment sentiment, and they&#xa0;can fuel the extremes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/02/hungarian-vote-on-refugees-will-not-take-place-suggest-first-poll-results\">Hungary's refugee referendum not valid after voters stay away</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over the past quarter-century or so, Europeans have experienced huge transformations: the fall of the Berlin wall, globalisation, and now the impact of migration, terrorism and illiberal forces. European ambitions that were entertained just two decades ago seem to have shrivelled, opening up a Pandora\u2019s box of grievances. Of course, the 2008 financial crisis hasn\u2019t helped, but economic statistics often fail to measure the gap between what citizens expected their lives to be like and what they feel they have ended up with.</p> <p>A Czech friend of mine who recently returned to Prague after spending 15 years working in Asia told me how impressed he was by the improvement in living standards since the 90s, and yet how depressing it was to see that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/15/milos-zeman-czech-republic-president-populists-post-communist\" title=\"\">populist agenda</a> had now taken hold.</p> <p>A nation that spent decades behind the iron curtain is today a full-blown member of the European club, enjoying consumerism, better housing, better everything, its citizens no longer in the grip of a repressive police state or waiting in endless queues at food shops. Yet despite these changes there is deep frustration \u2013 which illiberal politicians are fast capitalising on.</p> <p>People are obsessed with fears stoked by politicians and much of the media about the supposed threat of Muslim migrants swarming into the country. Czech president Milo\u0161 Zeman is notorious for fanning conspiracy theories about a radical Islamic takeover of Europe. None of this bears any relation to reality. But the very notion of refugees has been conflated with video images of Islamic State militants chopping off heads.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Just 131 people were granted asylum in the Czech Republic in the first half of this year \u2013 64 of them Chinese Christians</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bewildered by this, my friend checked some facts: it turns out that just 131 people were granted asylum in the Czech Republic in the first half of this year \u2013 64 of them Chinese Christians fleeing persecution.</p> <p>Paranoia about refugees is now spread widely throughout the west. But something distinct seems to be at play in central Europe, and it can\u2019t just be explained by the fact that these countries have historically had little or no experience, historically, of immigration from the global south.</p> <p>The need to find scapegoats in countries that have hardly taken in any refugees draws from a particular frustration that has grown over time \u2013 that of comparing one\u2019s life with the life enjoyed by western neighbours, not with what it was like a generation ago.</p> <p>In the Czech Republic, although living standards have risen, wages and GDP per capita remain well below those of neighbouring Germany. When Czechs joined the EU in 2004, the general feeling was that the country had finally \u201cmade it\u201d. But prosperity didn\u2019t follow at the speed many hoped for, and people seem to think they\u2019re still second-tier members of the EU club.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Europe too, it\u2019s not that real problems don\u2019t exist (unemployment, corruption, growing inequalities); it\u2019s that they are compounded by the way many people compare their current lives with what they felt entitled to expect. Paradoxically, criticism of the EU institutions sits side by side with a genuine attachment to the union. The latest <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/pdf/eurobarometre/2016/attentes/eb85_1_synthesis_perceptions_wishes_terrorism_en.pdf\" title=\"\">Eurobarometer poll</a>, published in June, shows 75% of Czechs believe that \u201cwhat brings the the citizens of the different EU member states together is more important than what separates them\u201d.</p> <p>I thought about this when reading another completely different study, carried out among French Muslims. It pointed to a perhaps comparable phenomenon of frustration. The reasons why some French Muslims feel disenfranchised are too long to list here, but the Paris-based Institut Montaigne\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.institutmontaigne.org/fr/publications/un-islam-francais-est-possible\" title=\"\">recent survey</a> also highlighted a generational gap. What first-generation migrants expected from life in France, when they moved there for work in the 1960s and 70s, is something second and third generations no longer accept as anything close to satisfying.</p> <p>Half of the 28% of French Muslims who say they dislike the republican model of integration are between 15 and 24 years old. This is the group, says the institute, that turns to \u201crigorist\u201d Islam as a way of expressing a generational revolt. They compare their lives not to where their parents came from, but to the opportunities other French people of their age can enjoy that they are denied.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63264232abfdea857620655903641dc87a2d3af3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63264232abfdea857620655903641dc87a2d3af3/0_294_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marine Le Pen sings La Marseillaise after a speech on 18 September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marine Le Pen sings La Marseillaise after a speech on 18 September. \u2018Paranoia about refugees is now spread widely throughout the west.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claude Paris/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>None of this may be very surprising, but because Europe seems to be cracking at the seams with all the focus on diversity, lack of inclusiveness, and dividing lines between regions, nations and communities, it\u2019s worth stepping back a little.</p> <p>What links the populist spiral in the Czech Republic (taken as just one example in Europe) and the discontent brewing among some young Muslims in France is that in both cases, the things that parents or grandparents strove for (joining the west, emigrating for jobs) no longer hold the same appeal for younger generations. The young tend to see what they don\u2019t have (German wages, equal opportunities), whereas previous generations felt, to a degree, that they had \u201cmade it\u201d (joining the EU, or establishing themselves in the developed world).</p> <p>It\u2019s as if, in today\u2019s Europe, it has become much harder to cross social and economic boundaries than it was once to break out from behind the iron curtain, or get a migrant\u2019s residence permit. These comparisons certainly don\u2019t sum up everything that\u2019s happening across the continent, but frustrations and multiple generation gaps are real \u2013 and are part of what is challenging the cohesiveness of Europe as a whole, and parts of its social fabric.</p>",

  "<p>Nine years after its ingredients first began to be combined, the future of one of London\u2019s largest and most contested redevelopment schemes looks as clear as mud soup. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/earls-court-project\">Earls Court Project</a>, guided by architect <a href=\"http://www.myearlscourt.com/the-future\">Sir Terry Farrell\u2019s 2010 masterplan</a>, foresaw the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2014/dec/15/earls-court-final-curtain-is-sad-reflection-on-boris-johnsons-london\">closure</a> and destruction of the Earls Court exhibition centre, the relocation of London Underground\u2019s Lillie Bridge maintenance depot and the demolition of 760 homes on two council estates. In their place, and also covering the nearby exhibition centre car park, would rise clusters of mostly very expensive flats together with a new high street to help form and connect four \u201cvillages\u201d. Today, some of the masterplan has been partly put into effect but much of it is mired in uncertainty.</p> <p>During the mayoral election campaign, Sadiq Khan disparaged the project for the low number of additional \u201caffordable\u201d homes it proposed. Of the 7,500 that principal developer Capital and Counties (Capco) has permission to build, 760 would be replacements for those knocked down on the two estates and only 740 of the remaining 6,740 would be \u201caffordable\u201d, all of them of the \u201cintermediate\u201d variety aimed at middle income households. That represents a net \u201caffordable\u201d gain of just 11% of the new housing across the entire project area in a major transformation that\u2019s also been opposed on economic, cultural, architectural and environmental grounds. </p> <p>Khan promised to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/mar/10/sadiq-khan-to-review-earls-court-masterplan-if-elected-london-mayor\">review the scheme</a> if he won. The question now is what can and should be done to change it to make it more to the liking of the new mayor and to other critics, most notably <a href=\"https://westkengibbsgreen.wordpress.com/\">campaigners opposed to the demolition of the two estates</a> and Labour-run Hammersmith and Fulham council (H&amp;F). </p> <p>As Khan has pointed out in a written answer to a question from <a href=\"http://www.carolinepidgeon.org/\">Liberal Democrat AM Caroline Pidgeon</a>, he has no <a href=\"http://questions.london.gov.uk/QuestionSearch/searchclient/questions/question_288742\">power to revoke</a> the borough planning consents currently covering the entire development area that were granted by H&amp;F when it was under Tory control and by its Tory neighbour Kensington and Chelsea, all of them waved through by his predecessor Boris Johnson. </p> <p>However, he has also <a href=\"http://questions.london.gov.uk/QuestionSearch/searchclient/questions/question_289325\">underlined to Pidgeon</a> that \u201cshould a new masterplan be submitted\u201d he would assess it \u201cagainst the policies set out in the <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/current-london-plan\">London Plan</a>\u201d, the legally-binding planning framework for the whole of Greater London. Khan intends to <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/london-plan-full-review/overview-full-review-london-plan\">change the London Plan</a> and, in the meantime, will soon be publishing <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/implementing-london-plan/supplementary-planning-guidance\">supplementary planning guidance</a> reflecting how he will seek to pursue his goals in the context of a document that currently enshrines Johnson\u2019s. </p> <p>Khan\u2019s election is not the only important new factor in the Earls Court Project story. Market conditions were already changing and have been further affected by Brexit. An oversupply of expensive properties in \u201cprime\u201d central London led to a <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/235342/earls-court-developer-capital-counties-sees-share-price-fall-over-fears-of-cooling-property-market-\">collapse in Capco\u2019s share price</a> early this year. Rumours of a takeover persist. However, in July, the company\u2019s chief executive <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/235342/earls-court-developer-capital-counties-sees-share-price-fall-over-fears-of-cooling-property-market-\">told the Telegraph</a> he had suggested to the Greater London Authority (GLA) that it would be possible to increase the grand total of Earls Court Project dwellings from 7,500 to 10,000. </p> <p>Capco says it will be making formal representations to the GLA about Earls Court as Khan\u2019s revision of the London Plan gets underway, adding that \u201cno decision has been reached on whether any [new] planning application will result from this process\u201d. Meanwhile, Khan has said his officers are \u201cworking closely\u201d with H&amp;F, which is committed to securing a better deal for the estates\u2019 residents. An <a href=\"http://questions.london.gov.uk/QuestionSearch/searchclient/questions/question_288743\">answer</a> from him to Pidgeon relating specifically to the Lillie Bridge depot, which also lies within H&amp;F, serves as a reminder that changes can be made to existing planning consents.</p> <p>It seems that all interested parties are in some sense reviewing the state of the scheme, which has vividly illustrated the perils and discontents of major regeneration projects that involve expunging character-defining local institutions, knocking down large numbers of peoples\u2019 homes and are heavily dependent on the vagaries of global property investment. Some parts of this one cannot now be undone, but much remains in flux. Here\u2019s a brief rundown of what\u2019s happening on the project area\u2019s four principal sites.</p> <h2>Lillie Square</h2> <p>This site on Seagrave Road is what used to be the exhibition centre car park. With a 50/50 joint venture between a Capco subsidiary and what Capco <a href=\"http://www.capitalandcounties.com/news/stories/conditional-agreement-kwok-family-interests-acquire-50-stake-seagrave-road-656m\">describes</a> as \u201centities in which certain members of the Kwok family are interested\u201d - the Kwoks are <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17752115\">well-known</a> in Hong Kong real estate - has advanced more quickly than the other three due to being fully self-contained - separated from the others by Lillie Road - and having nothing large on it that needed levelling. Real buildings have been springing from the ground next to West Brompton station, just up the road from the Stamford Bridge ground of Chelsea FC. </p> <p>If completed as planned, <a href=\"https://www.lilliesquare.com/\">Lillie Square</a>, forming the heart of a theoretical West Brompton village, will eventually contain 808 residential units, including 200 of the 760 replacements for those just down the road that would be lost, though these would be hived off from the luxury apartments and their plush communal facilities. </p> <p>Sales of the market-priced properties <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/business/capco-boss-says-doubts-still-cloud-london-property-market-a3241926.html\">have been slow</a>, with one estate agent telling the Financial Times that at this rate it would take Capco 150 years to sell all 6,000 of the market-priced homes it has permission to build across the project area in total. Will they drop their prices? What would be the implications for the rest of the masterplan, including the delivery of the 740 additional \u201caffordable\u201d homes, if they did?</p> <h2>Earls Court Village</h2> <p>An expanse of flat brownfield now fills the space where the exhibition centre stood, awaiting the construction of 1,300 residential units bisected by a linear park. The land is owned by Transport for London (TfL), which has formed a joint venture company - <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2014/march/capco-and-tfl-establish-joint-venture-to-develop-earls-court-1-and-2\">Earls Court Partnership Ltd</a> - with Capco to do the developing and make money to spend on London\u2019s transport networks. None of the putative homes, which have yet to be marketed for \u201coff plan\u201d sale, are intended to be \u201caffordable\u201d. Capco has <a href=\"http://www.capitalandcounties.com/property/ec-properties/earls-court-west-brompton-village\">anticipated</a> \u201cluxury retail, dining in the park, culture, leisure and services for the modern day city-dweller\u201d being provided for residents of medium and high-rise blocks arranged round \u201ccourtyard squares\u201d.</p> <h2>Lillie Bridge Depot</h2> <p>This part of the project map has not yet been altered at all and may not be for several years - London Underground will have to relocate the depot\u2019s facilities to Acton before anything else can be built there, which will take time. The depot land belongs to TfL, which means the mayor will want at least 50% of the housing it may eventually contain to be shared ownership \u201caffordable\u201d homes for long-term renting first-time buyers. If and when that happens, who will TfL partner with to build the homes and how many will there be? Will that quantity contribute to the final number of additional affordable homes in the entire project area being greater than the mere 740 originally planned? That may partly depend on what happens to...</p> <h2>The West Kensington and Gibbs Green estates</h2> <p>The most complexity surrounds the 760 homes of these adjoining post-war estates, bordered at the western end of the project area by North End Road. Under the existing masterplan permissions, they are to be demolished in phases as and when replacements have been built. The slow progress on Lillie Square suggests nothing will get knocked down any time soon. But there remains a <a href=\"http://www.capitalandcounties.com/news/stories/capco-and-lbhf-sign-conditional-land-sale-agreement\">legal agreement</a> made between Capco and the now former Conservative H&amp;F administration to sell Capco the estates land for redevelopment as and when replacement homes are completed. </p> <p>The Tories\u2019 Labour successors have said that, regretfully, this deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/sep/22/earls-court-project-what-will-happen-to-the-peoples-estates\">cannot be undone</a>. Meanwhile, the estates\u2019 tenants and residents\u2019 associations are hoping the communities secretary will enable them to take ownership of the estates through a community-led housing association and enhance the existing stock in line with their \u201c<a href=\"https://westkengibbsgreen.wordpress.com/the-peoples-plan/\">peoples\u2019 plan</a>\u201d. The council is against this, and Mayor Khan, while suggesting that his housing deputy James Murray <a href=\"http://questions.london.gov.uk/QuestionSearch/searchclient/questions/question_287999\">visits the campaigners</a> to listen to their ideas, wrote in June that he thinks the \u201cbest regeneration outcome\u201d for residents is more likely to be achieved if the council remains their landlord. He\u2019s said that GLA officers have been \u201cworking closely\u201d with those of H&amp;F to that end.</p> <h2>Conclusions?</h2> <p>What will emerge from all this is hard to predict. A fundamental issue is the extent to which the different parts of the project have been interconnected in planning and financial terms, with the extra \u201caffordable\u201d homes plus improvements to transport capacity, public realm and a new school all dependent on the sale of the expensive flats. Is the original masterplan still credible? The possibility of a new one being drawn up seems to exist. Where will Capco end up standing on all this? Where might TfL and the mayor want them to? </p> <p>There have been discussions between H&amp;F and Capco about making the development even bigger and grander in return for getting the estates residents a better deal out of demolition. They ran into the sand, but maybe Capco\u2019s \u201cup to 10,000\u201d suggestion means that type of outcome is possible after all. But it wouldn\u2019t suit everyone. Even if the estate residents were satisfied with it, other locals might object on aesthetic and quality of life grounds. The one sure thing remains that this story is still a long way from its end. <br></p>",

  "<p>Lurch dragged himself towards the lectern. Even with extra slap to give his cheeks a pink veneer, Philip Hammond has the look of a walking corpse.

Even the Autocue had had enough.</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t the easiest of gigs for Lurch. All his instincts \u2013 along with those of the City \u2013 tell him Britain should be pursuing the softest of Brexits, but he\u2019s been outflanked by the Eurosceptics and will now have to steer the economy through what may well be a tricky few years. Already the pound was falling sharply and he\u2019d long since had to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/03/philip-hammond-pledges-economic-pragmatism-during-brexit-process\">ditch his party\u2019s promise of eliminating the budget deficit by 2020</a>.

Just because she could. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/man-sells-british-fresh-air-to-wealthy-chinese-elite-for-80-a-jar-a6857461.html\">Tourists are buying British bottled air at \u00a380 a go</a>,\u201d she declared, as if ripping off gullible foreigners was the answer to the country\u2019s problems. <br></p> <p>She had nothing to say about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/03/revealed-mrsa-variant-found-in-british-pork-at-asda-and-sainsburys\">contaminated meat</a> or what was going to happen to the farmers she\u2019d persuaded to leave the EU once their subsidies ran out. Above her pay grade. Smiling was so much easier. That and crossing the globe, flying the flag, banging the drum and mouthing platitudes. She was followed on to the stage by Liam Fox, whom the Tories considered to be an even worse bet than her as party leader. Imagine how that must make him feel.</p>",
  "<p>That\u2019s the spirit. \u201cThe Brexit debate will be seen as a drop in the ocean in the timeline of our business,\u201d says Andrew Formica, the (Australian) chief executive of Anglo-Aussie fund manager Henderson. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/03/janus-henderson-to-have-headquarters-in-london\">the merger with Janus Capital of the US</a>, the combined company, managing $320bn of assets, will make its home in London. The firm will have two bosses \u2013 Formica will be joint chief executive with his Janus counterpart, Dick Weil \u2013 but the American will have to get out of Denver and move to the UK.</p> <p>Brexit-worriers will point out that Henderson\u2019s listing on the London Stock Exchange will be cancelled. New York has been given the primary listing and Sydney the secondary gig. True, but you can\u2019t have everything and there is a particular wrinkle here. Some 60% of Henderson\u2019s shares are still held in Australia and, since three listings would be silly, London was the obvious one to drop. The location of the head office was the important decision.</p> <p>Formica\u2019s analysis is worth noting for its matter-of-factness. Brexit hasn\u2019t altered London\u2019s status as the world\u2019s most important global financial centre. The capital will continue to enjoy the benefits of timezone and financial infrastructure. Thus it is a natural home for an asset manager running operations in the US, Europe and Asia.</p> <p>The calculation, we might agree, could be very different for those big banks or insurers who prize \u2018passporting\u2019 rights to operate across the EU single market. But there is no obvious reason for global asset managers to flee. Henderson\u2019s shareholders will get 57% of the equity, and thus are the senior partners in this \u201cmerger of equals,\u201d but London seems to have been preferred solely for its merit as a global hub. </p> <p>Shareholders may be more worried by the decision to run with two chief executives. The Roman god Janus faced two ways, but having two chiefs is a notoriously tricky arrangement to make work. The task should be easier, though, with one head office.</p> <h2>Tesco: why we should be wary of US-style litigation</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37c65d33f79f59269c77660f781f8851e061dadf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37c65d33f79f59269c77660f781f8851e061dadf/3_0_3195_1917/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tesco\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The Serious Fraud Office <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/sfo-charges-former-tesco-directors-with-fraud\">has charged</a> three former Tesco executives with fraud and false accounting (the trio deny the charges), but some investors don\u2019t want to let the matter end there. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/02/tesco-faces-150m-claim-from-shareholders-to-recoup-losses\">A group of 60 would like to be compensated</a> for Tesco\u2019s \u00a3263m over-statement of profits in 2014. They calculate they suffered collective losses of \u00a3150m when the share price fell and argue they are entitled to expect companies\u2019 financial statements to be true and fair.</p> <p>Nobody would dispute the point about expecting accuracy and purity. Jeremy Marshall, chief investment officer of Bentham Europe, the firm funding the litigation against Tesco, draws a comparison with second-hand cars. You would expect redress if the vehicle you bought turned out to have 10,000 miles on the clock rather than the stated 5,000. Well, yes, but this enthusiasm for US-style litigation is troubling for several reasons.</p> <p>First, a litigation-hungry set of shareholders is seeking to gain at the expense of the other shareholders. That feels underhand. Second, in any share price movement, it\u2019s hard to measure specific factors precisely. Tesco\u2019s confession of an over-statement clearly contributed to fall in the share price, but by how much? How does one isolate secondary effects, like reputational damage?</p> <p>Third, the argument that claims for compensation help to improve boardroom governance sounds like self-interested nonsense. The SFO, the Financial Reporting Council and other bodies exist to do a job. If they do it properly, they shouldn\u2019t require assistance.</p> <p>Sadly, we may have to get used to more such legal cases. One senior London fund manager said he would be happy if such US-style litigation remained in the US, but he felt obliged to participate because it would be hard to explain to clients why other managers had secured a cheque while he hadn\u2019t. That is how momentum for litigation builds. The development is regrettable.</p> <h2>Philip Hammond\u2019s \u2018midlands engine\u2019 </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd2ce0fa73bc1eefd481f472f707b395a0e8bcd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd2ce0fa73bc1eefd481f472f707b395a0e8bcd9/1494_81_1804_1082/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Hammond\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>By the time he gets to his autumn statement, let\u2019s hope chancellor Philip Hammond, above, has found some policies (and better jokes). <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/03/conservative-conference-philip-hammond-confirms-osbornes-austerity-timetable-has-been-dropped-politics-live\">Monday\u2019s conference speech</a> brought news of a \u00a33bn package to increase the number of houses built in Britain \u2013 an ambition that has confounded successive governments \u2013 but there was nothing else to bite on.</p> <p>The definition of the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d remains as obscure as it did under George Osborne.

  "<p>A writer\u2019s relationship with their readers is delicate territory. Readers always want more: we flood to book signings and fill tents at literary festivals in a quest to see if the writer in the flesh matches the voice we hear in our head when we read. Many writers, solitary and private people, want less. In the past 24 hours the extremes of this relationship have collided in time and space. The most famous pseudonymous novelist of our times, Elena Ferrante, who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/19/elena-ferrante-anonymity-lets-me-concentrate-exclusively-on-writing\" title=\"\">guarded her anonymity </a>for 24 years to escape the social pressure and obligations of maintaining a public image, has, apparently, been unmasked.

The radical who uses her genius for storytelling as a political weapon, and simultaneously exploits her fame to promote her causes, fills her readers\u2019 heads with her voice. Elena Ferrante, of whom we know nothing except she is not who she says she is, is so blank a space in her readers\u2019 imagination that her characters, whose inner lives are as rich as the times that press upon them, have a substance that is entirely for us to realise.

We are leaving the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\">European Union</a>. But it is equally clear to me that the British people did not vote on 23 June to become poorer or less secure.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cOur task is clear: repatriate our sovereignty, control our borders and seize the opportunities that the wider world has to offer \u2026 but do all of this while protecting our economy, our jobs and our living standards.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking in the wake of May\u2019s address to the conference, which <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/may-on-collision-course-with-backbenchers-seeking-soft-brexit\">appeared to hint that the government</a> was pursuing a hard Brexit without full access to the EU\u2019s single market, Hammond noted that many businesses were unsure about what lay ahead.</p> <p>The pound was down sharply against the euro on Sunday as traders digested the implications of May\u2019s speech, falling as low as \u20ac1.1434 at one point, the weakest since the summer of 2013. Sterling was also down more than 1% against the US dollar, to as low as $1.2818, just a fifth of a cent off its 31-year low in early July.</p> <p>Experts said sterling had lost value on expectations a hard Brexit would damage the UK\u2019s trading position and depress overseas investment in the UK. Such fears have been central in investors\u2019 minds after car company Nissan warned last week that its future in Britain was not assured in the event of a hard Brexit.</p> <p>The prospect of a hard Brexit would have \u201cprofound consequences across larger swaths of the UK economy\u201d, said economists at the bank Daiwa. \u201cOverseas firms invest here precisely because of the UK\u2019s access to the single market ... No doubt those firms that were putting in contingency plans to move some of their operations to other EU locations, so as to be able to continue doing business in the world\u2019s largest single market after the UK has left, will now step up those efforts,\u201d they added.</p> <p>Sterling\u2019s weakness contrasted with a rally on stock markets, where share prices were lifted by a combination of near-term economic optimism, relief over May providing some certainty on Brexit timing and the effects of a weak pound, which flatters the earnings of UK-listed firms reporting in dollars. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares rose more than 1.2% to a 16-month high of 6,983.52.</p> <p>In his speech, Hammond promised to pay down the deficit, but to do so at a slower and more flexible pace. He will set out new spending plans \u2013 and revised economic forecasts \u2013 in his autumn statement in November.</p> <p>The scale of the challenge facing the government in resetting Britain\u2019s trading relationships became clear when Alexander Downer, the Australian high commissioner to the UK, spoke up from the audience at a fringe event to warn that his country would be unable to contemplate a trade deal with Britain unless it leaves the single market and customs union.</p> <p>\u201cFor us, there is a huge outstanding issue about membership of the single market and customs union. I don\u2019t think everyone understands this but it will not be possible to negotiate a free trade agreement with Australia, the US or others [if the UK stays in them] \u2026 If the UK remains in the single market and customs union, we will negotiate just with Brussels,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Theresa Villiers, a former cabinet minister and MEP, said he was absolutely right and the UK would need to come out of both.</p>",

She considers herself an American artist, as well as an African one, having studied art at Swarthmore College and Philadelphia University of the Arts, before taking her MFA at Yale, where she was also a teaching assistant. None of this was expected \u2013 she left Nigeria thinking she would become a doctor just like her father and several of her five siblings. Her earliest memory is of poring over her dad\u2019s Atlas of Diseases, fascinated by the human body. Yet when, aged 16, she added painting \u2013 a \u201cfun class\u201d \u2013 to her \u201creally intense and science based\u201d community college courses, her art teacher encouraged her to take it further. \u201cThat was my first painting class ever in my life,\u201d she says, clearly still surprised by how her life has turned out. Her teacher wasn\u2019t wrong though: she has since been awarded the Prix Canson 2016, the 2015 Next Generation prize at the New Museum of Contemporary Art, the 2015 Joyce Alexander Wein Artist Prize at the Studio Museum in Harlem, and was listed in Foreign Policy\u2019s Leading 100 Global Thinkers of 2015.</p> <p>Initially, her paintings seem reasonably simple, with their domestic scenes of living rooms, couples, families. But there are so many layers: the collaged materials she uses as background, taken from Nigerian popular culture, or portrait fabrics printed with people\u2019s faces from her family\u2019s weddings. Her marriage to a white Texan, Justin Crosby, is there too, with their difference&#xa0;in colour, in family background. Although that difference became perhaps too obvious for her. \u201cI&#xa0;felt I was making too many pieces with&#xa0;the couple in it, so then I thought, what if I take the couple out? How do I&#xa0;still say everything I want to say? I&#xa0;try&#xa0;to keep it interesting for myself because&#xa0;each piece is a puzzle.\u201d</p> <p>After growing up in the city of Enugu, Akunyili Crosby moved to a girls\u2019 boarding school in Lagos. \u201cI was used to spending weekends and summers with my grandmother in the village.

Her mother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/09/7\" title=\"\">Dora Akunyili</a>, who died in 2014, had studied pharmacy and taught at a university, among other jobs. Diagnosed as needing major surgery, she was given \u00a312,000 from a work insurance fund to go to London and have treatment. But the London doctor said it was a misdiagnosis, so she went home again and gave the money back. \u201cNigeria is not a country where anybody ever asks for your receipts,\u201d her daughter explains, \u201cand knowing how poor we were at the time, it\u2019s amazing that she didn\u2019t keep it.\u201d But Dora was unaware that the story of the incredibly honest pharmacist rose up the ranks until one day, years later, she got a phone call at home from President Obasanjo. He was desperate to solve the problem of counterfeit and fake medicine that was killing so many Nigerians, and asked her to help. Akunyili was made head of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, took on frightening crime cartels and won \u2013 becoming a national hero.</p> <p>Does it make her daughter feel duty-bound to live a moral life? \u201cOh yes! I always feel my life in Nigeria is quite different from my life in the States. Every time I come back, I go from being anonymous \u2013 I hand my passport over and it\u2019s the same every time. They look at it, look up at me, say, \u2018Are you who I&#xa0;think you are? I hope you\u2019re like your mother!\u2019 And I say [she whimpers], \u2018I&#xa0;try!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>I ask her what Yale was like, but she isn\u2019t too keen to talk about it. \u201cHave you seen Mean Girls?\u201d she asks, comically, \u201cor the season of Project Runway where everyone gangs up on Michael Costello?\u201d Arriving at the Studio Museum in Harlem, a space for black artists, was her salvation after that. \u201cYale was not a community. But I think of the Studio Museum as a family.\u201d She says that almost every successful black artist in the US was nurtured there.

  "<p>When the artist <a href=\"http://www.spencerfinch.com/\">Spencer Finch</a> outlined plans for thousands of redwood trees, the tallest living species on the planet, to be placed in the concrete heart of Brooklyn, city authorities initially assumed he meant fake replicas. They were a little taken aback when Finch insisted that they be the real thing.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe idea came pretty quickly, and then it was about figuring out if it was actually possible,\u201d Finch said. Fortunately it was, crucially because the redwood forest was to be in miniature \u2013 an exact but tiny replica of the towering redwood forests of America\u2019s west coast.</p> <p>Finch has recreated a 790-acre section of California\u2019s Redwood national park in downtown Brooklyn at 1:100 scale. The exact topography of the area has been replicated through tons of soil and an undulating wooden border. The eponymous waterway of the piece, <a href=\"https://www.publicartfund.org/view/exhibitions/6126_spencer_finch_lost_man_creek\">Lost Man Creek</a>, runs through its heart through meters of tubed irrigation.</p> <p>The original trees can reach 380ft, taller than the buildings that surround the public square where the art project sits. Finch\u2019s 4,000 saplings will, however, be pruned so they grow to no more than 4ft.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23982bbffe1e0d5a93d52843e1971656422b4150\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23982bbffe1e0d5a93d52843e1971656422b4150/0_406_6016_3610/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Finch\u2019s 4,000 saplings will be pruned so they grow to no more than 4ft.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Finch\u2019s 4,000 saplings will be pruned so they grow to no more than 4ft.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Timothy Schenck/Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a destination for art \u2013 people have other things on their mind,\u201d said Finch, as he looked around the MetroTech Commons, an unglamorous slice of the rapidly gentrifying New York borough. \u201cI thought if I were to do something it would have to be a little unconventional, something that was new and adventurous.\u201d</p> <p>Finch said he has enjoyed bringing a touch of wilderness to a slate-grey landscape of offices and highways. \u201cI can ride my bike here and work outdoors with trees. That\u2019s better than being in the studio answering emails,\u201d he said. </p> <p>This is possibly Finch\u2019s most ambitious work in terms of scale, but it isn\u2019t his first use of environmental themes in his art. Finch created <a href=\"http://art.thehighline.org/project/spencerfinch/\">The River that Flows Both Ways</a>, which charts a journey down the Hudson river and was one of the first pieces to grace the High Line, a linear park built on a disused railway line in Manhattan that has become a tourist favorite. </p> <p>The artist is also known for <a href=\"http://www.spencerfinch.com/view/recent-works/147\">Trying to Remember the Color of the Sky on That September Morning</a>, a sprawling work created for the National September 11 Memorial Museum. Finch, who has been based in Brooklyn since 1990, has made his mark on the fabric of New York, although he shares commonly heard gripes about his adopted home.</p> <p>The High Line is laudable but \u201cjust very very\u201d, as Finch puts it. \u201cIt\u2019s now in a very wealthy neighborhood, it\u2019s mostly tourists. All this money comes into the High Line and there are parks in Brooklyn where there is no grass or trees or playground equipment.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab170703bd7184d1abd2ddb8a9124fbe532989ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab170703bd7184d1abd2ddb8a9124fbe532989ba/0_203_6016_3610/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The forest conceals some hidden campers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The forest conceals some hidden campers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Timothy Schenck/Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Areas of Brooklyn such as Williamsburg and Greenpoint have changed almost beyond recognition since Finch came to the borough, with average rents increasing <a href=\"https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/new-york-neighborhood-gentrification-new-report\">78% over this period in those neighborhoods</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThe income disparity is kind of mind-boggling,\u201d Finch said. \u201cIt was never easy for young artists, it always felt expensive, I had to struggle. But it feels like it has got harder for young artists. New York\u2019s energy is so dependent on people coming in, whether that\u2019s young artists or immigrants or whatever. If that ever stops, the city will stop.\u201d</p> <p>Lost Man Creek, facilitated through the <a href=\"https://www.publicartfund.org/\">Public Art Fund</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.savetheredwoods.org/\">Save the Redwoods League</a>, is probably a sign of gentrification in itself. But it has a soothing quality about it, with a viewing platform providing an ideal portal to a place far from Brooklyn. \u201cIf you squint you can think, \u2018Maybe I am in an actual forest\u2019,\u201d Finch said. </p> <p>The sense of scale is crystalized by a group of small human figures and a campsite, measuring less than an inch tall, placed next to the trees. The faithfulness of the replica doesn\u2019t gloss over the fact this area was disturbed \u2013 a section of the forest that was logged has smaller, stunted trees in place. A path through the center of the forest was mooted and then dismissed for fear of vandalism. \u201cPeople do crazy things,\u201d Finch explained. </p> <p>California\u2019s trees have endured a difficult time of late. Ravaged by drought and disease, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/19/tree-death-california-hawaii-sudden-oak\">more than 66m have died since 2010 alone</a>, with climate change a looming threat even to giants such as redwoods, which rely upon coastal mists and a certain temperature range to flourish. Finch\u2019s miniature forest conjures the grandness of the redwoods, but also hints at their vulnerability.</p> <p>Finch said he is concerned about the environment but invokes the Yeats poem <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/57313\">On Being Asked for a War Poem</a> to argue that his role as an artist isn\u2019t to speak out against the potential devastation of climate change. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m hesitant to talk about it in those terms,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is in the tradition of a landscape, it\u2019s like a landscape painting. I hope people will have a sort of reverie, that it\u2019s an escape for them. So much about urban life now is about commerce. Maybe people can have a magical moment here.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Governance across Africa has seen minimal improvement over the past decade, held back by widespread deterioration in safety and rule of law, according to a report published on Monday.<br></p> <p>Since 2006, according to the <a href=\"http://mo.ibrahim.foundation/iiag/\">Ibrahim index of African governance</a>, the most <a href=\"http://mo.ibrahim.foundation/iiag/downloads/\">comprehensive survey</a> of its kind, 37 out of 54 African nations \u2013 home to 70% of African citizens \u2013 saw an overall improvement of just one point, measured against four categories including security, human rights, economic stability and human development. </p> <p>Mauritius came top, followed by Botswana, Cape Verde, the Seychelles and Namibia.

Therefore, it is important to consider the combined effect of the full package of our policy measures when assessing the impact of our monetary policy action on banks. </p> <p>Low rates put pressure on banks\u2019 profitability, particularly on banks which are very reliant on net interest income. Analysts forecast that negative interest rates will significantly reduce banks\u2019 profitability over the next five years, with the return on equity in some cases falling from 6.5% to 2%. </p> <p>Obviously, our monetary policy package consists of other measures as well and ECB staff estimates show that the <strong>overall</strong> impact on bank profitability of recent monetary policy actions is net positive, compared with a scenario with no monetary policy action<sup>[<a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2016/html/sp161003.en.html#footnote.2\">2</a>]</sup>. But we cannot ignore such analyses. And yet, one also has to ask if a bank that cannot weather headwinds over a few years still has a sufficiently robust business model to stay in the market.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mersh added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Interest rates have to stay low until the economic recovery in the euro area has gained sufficient momentum to lift the inflation rate to a level in line with our definition of price stability. This is, however, taking longer than we had hoped, mainly because the necessary political changes to make economies more competitive and flexible are lagging behind. The sooner these reforms are implemented, the stronger and more sustainable the recovery will be. </p> <p>Although the notion of a \u201czero lower bound\u201d no longer stands, there is a limit to how low interest rates can go \u2013 the point at which the costs of lower rates incurred by the banking sector outweigh the benefits. Many consider that we have reached the \u201ceffective lower bound\u201d or that it might be not that far from the current deposit facility rate of -0.4%. </p> <p>This level I would still deem to be \u201cmildly negative\u201d \u2013 but I would shy away from moving into \u201cwildly negative\u201d territory.

Along with confirmation that the Government will trigger Article 50 by next March, this may have increased concerns over the ultimate economic impact of the vote to leave the EU.</p> <p>But there are a number of reasons not to be concerned about the currency\u2019s depreciation. For a start, it is far from clear that further indications of a move towards a hard Brexit should necessarily be strongly negative for the economy or the pound. They may, after all, reflect increased confidence that the UK can negotiate favourable trading arrangements with the EU without the conditions that a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d might imply.</p> <p>Second, the key driver of sterling\u2019s depreciation (against the US dollar at least) has continued to be relative changes in expectations for UK and US interest rates. As such, there are few signs of a general \u201cBrexit premium\u201d being attached to the currency which might prompt a more disorderly depreciation.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>And finally, regardless of its causes, the drop in sterling has already had a substantial effect in cushioning the economic impact of the Brexit vote. Monday\u2019s Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI survey revealed a further rise in the export orders sub-index to a level consistent with a rapid acceleration in the growth of actual exports in the coming months.</p> <p>Admittedly, the economy may currently be in a \u201csweet spot\u201d in which the beneficial effects of the pound\u2019s drop have been felt before the adverse effects on real incomes of the consequent rise in inflation. But provided that the pound\u2019s fall remains relatively orderly \u2013 our forecast is that it will fall from around $1.28 now to $1.20 next year \u2013 we expect the inflationary effects to be fairly limited and short-lived, allowing the policymakers to continue to support growth.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f266bde4b0ff53b531bbb3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T14:40:16.310Z\">3.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greek pensioner protests overshadow budget unveiling</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back to Greece where pictures of police firing tear gas at pensioners peacefully demonstrating against further cuts has caused deep embarrassment to the government \u2013 just as it tables next year\u2019s budget in parliament.

As I was told by many attending today\u2019s (otherwise low-key) rally, the latest cut was the twelfth they have been forced to endure since the beginning of the debt crisis in late 2009. To make matters worse, Tsipras\u2019 poll ratings are fading fast. In the most scathing survey to be published since he first assumed power in January 2015 \u2013 and in the newspaper of Avgi, the mouthpiece of his ruling Syriza party no less - the leader was found by the Public Issue polling company to be trailing Kyriakos Mitsotakis, chief of main opposition New Democracy, by 19 points in terms of suitability in the role of prime minister (42 percent against 23 percent). A whopping 36 percent of Greeks said they would prefer to see New Democracy in power compared to 14 percent for Syriza and its junior right wing partner, Anel. </p> <p>Which explains why Tsipras, who was otherwise focusing on what he hoped would be an optimistic draft budget forecasting growth and debt decline, personally called the pubic order minister in fury that the tear gas was used at all. In an unprecedented statement the ministry announced: \u201cAfter today\u2019s incident the order was given to forbid any use of tear gas at demonstrations of workers and pensioners.\u201d </p> <p>That notwithstanding, the episode duly eclipsed any talk of the draft budget - which foresees growth of 2.7 per cent n 2017, debt dropping from 180 to 174.8 per cent of GDP and unemployment falling from 23 to 22.4 percent next year \u2013 being tabled and debated in parliament. Greek media have not been slow to pick up on the fact that it also projects an extra \u20ac1.8bn worth of revenues in taxes \u2013 prompting many to say that yet more punitive belt-tightening measures are on the way. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fad7952f9f110336c6737afe6ab1ad11cbd6f9b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fad7952f9f110336c6737afe6ab1ad11cbd6f9b7/0_0_4826_3205/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protestors clash with police in Athens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protestors clash with police in Athens</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ZUMA W/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f269d8e4b0328d7eb88c9b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T14:25:39.387Z\">3.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Royal Bank of Scotland will pay Connecticut $120m to resolve a mortgage bond probe, </strong>according to Reuters.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as investors await news about whether the $14bn fine on Deutsche Bank demanded by the US Department of Justice will be reduced, the bank\u2019s US shares have now dropped by around 2.5%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f2682ce4b0ff53b531bbbc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T14:17:42.344Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The ISM report could also signal a reasonable non-farm payrolls number on Friday, says James Knightley at ING Bank:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Looking to Friday\u2019s payrolls figure, the ISM employment component has offered encouragement to us regarding our above consensus 210,000 prediction for job creation.

With populism gaining traction in many countries, the risk of political shocks adversely affecting the outlook for private investment has increased.

Advanced country growth over 2016 to 2018 will be hardly any better than the lacklustre 1.5% annual average growth rate seen over 2011 to 2015. Moreover, downside risks to advanced country growth have increased.</p> <p>\u201cThe rise in populism seen in many advanced countries could be a precursor to increased trade-protectionism and growing fragmentary tensions in the eurozone, both of which would increase uncertainty and damage prospects for private sector investment,\u201d added [Fitch chief economist Brian] Coulton.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the US in particular it says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Fitch has revised down its forecast for US growth in 2016 to 1.4% in today\u2019s Global Economic Outlook from 1.8% in the July [report].</p> <p>\u201cThis year is likely to see the lowest annual growth rate for US GDP since 2009 as oil sector adjustments, weak external demand and the earlier appreciation of the dollar take their toll on industrial demand,\u201d said [Coulton].</p> </blockquote> <p>Fitch also believes central banks may be running out of ammunition:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Meanwhile, the capacity of central banks to counter adverse growth shocks may be falling. The implications of low and negative interest rates for bank profitability, the increasing complexity of central bank easing announcements, reductions in interest income for savers and market distortions are complicating the transmission of unconventional monetary easing to the economy. Furthermore, the historically unprecedented nature of negative nominal interest rates may be limiting the benefits of central bank easing announcements on inflation expectations.</p> <p>Rising political pressures and concerns about the effectiveness of monetary easing have contributed to growing support among policy makers for fiscal stimulus as a means of restoring growth. A wider shift to fiscal easing is increasingly apparent in the numbers and while its effectiveness may be hindered in some countries by high and rising public debt levels, a co-ordinated fiscal reflation is likely to have growth benefits, at least in the short term.</p> <p> The Fed is likely to be the only major central bank tightening monetary policy in the near term as it lays the groundwork for a December rate rise. With unit labour costs and core inflation measures suggesting underlying inflation close to the Fed\u2019s target and the labour market holding up, the conditions look to be in place for a continuation of gradual normalisation in the Federal Funds Rate. The ECB is expected to extend its quantitative easing programme beyond its current scheduled end-date of March 2017, and will likely need to adjust the limits on bond purchases. The new monetary policy approach adopted by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) opens the door for further cuts in the policy rate, taking it deeper into negative territory. This will allow the BOJ to steepen the yield curve while it varies its asset purchases to hold 10-year JGB yields flat at around 0%. We now forecast the BOJ policy rate will fall to -0.5% by end-2017. </p> <p>In the UK, the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) aggressive easing package in early August has had a positive impact on sentiment. With recent UK data slightly better than expected, the BoE is unlikely to follow through on forward guidance to cut rates again before year-end.</p> </blockquote> <p>In emerging markets, Fitch sees signs of improvement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Most importantly, China\u2019s efforts to stabilise growth in the face of a sharp slowdown in exports and private-sector investment look to have gained traction. Russia\u2019s economy looks to be stabilising after massive import compression, real wage adjustment and fiscal tightening saw domestic demand plummet in 2015. In Brazil, the impeachment of President Rousseff and installation of a new leadership team have renewed focus on fiscal reforms, which should support confidence and help the economy stabilise by year-end. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f23db1e4b05962fdf4a67d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T11:39:15.161Z\">12.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary: Factories fly, but pound slides</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Time for a catch-up, as City traders scoff down a quick sandwich before facing another volley of economic data from across the Atlantic.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/03/pound-falls-hard-brexit-deutsche-bank-manufacturing-data-business-live?page=with:block-57f21706e4b0ab00630875ae#block-57f21706e4b0ab00630875ae\">Activity in Britain\u2019s factory sector has grown at its fastest pace since June 2014, bolstering hopes that the EU referendum won\u2019t trigger a recession</a>.</strong></p> <p>Exports, new orders and staffing levels all increased in September, as the weak pound helps firms sell overseas.</p> <p>Economists broadly agree that UK manufacturing appears to be in decent health right now, and helped the economy grow in the last quarter.</p> <p>Capital Economics, for example, say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI for September showed that both the domestic and export-facing parts of the manufacturing sector are weathering the Brexit vote well.

Much of what he said was similar to what he said in a speech last week, making the case for free trade, but there were some new arguments in it. Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Fox said globalisation offered great opportunities to the UK.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The phenomenon that we have come to know since the mid-1990s as globalisation represents an acceleration of the trend in which the world is increasingly compressed economically, culturally and politically. </p> <p>It brings with it an increasing interdependence that means we cannot insulate ourselves from instability in far-flung parts of the global economy. </p> <p>But it has also brought the chance to share prosperity, liberty and empowerment with millions of our fellow human beings across the world who had only ever known poverty, hopelessness and oppression.</p> <p>The ability to trade every minute and everywhere means that we have the opportunity to increase our links with those trading partners and markets who are functionally like us but not necessarily geographically close to us.</p> <p>Technological advances are dissolving away the barriers of time and distance. </p> <p>I have often said that if Francis Fukuyama had called his book \u201cthe end of geography\u201d rather than \u201cthe end of history\u201d then he would have been more accurate about the world in which we now find ourselves. </p> <p>I think the term globalisation could almost have been written with Britain in mind. It is an era where we have a tremendous opportunity to help shape the world around us for the benefit of all.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the government should help those at risk of losing out from globalisation by focusing on improving people\u2019s skills.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said \u201cisolationism and protectionism never end well\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He confirmed that Britain could not negotiate trade deals while it remained a member of the EU.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While we remain inside the European Union we are bound by its rules not to negotiate any new trade agreements, although we are able to discuss the impediments that we might wish to eliminate ahead of agreements we might reach with other countries when we leave.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is worth pointing out that this is quite different from what <strong>David Davis</strong> said <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2016/07/david-davis-trade-deals-tax-cuts-and-taking-time-before-triggering-article-50-a-brexit-economic-strategy-for-britain.html\">in a ConservativeHome article in July about the Brexit strategy. </a>Writing shortly before he became Brexit secretary Davis said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So be under no doubt: we can do deals with our trading partners, and we can do them quickly. I would expect the new prime minister on September 9th to immediately trigger a large round of global trade deals with all our most favoured trade partners. I would expect that the negotiation phase of most of them to be concluded within between 12 and 24 months.</p> <p>So within two years, before the negotiation with the EU is likely to be complete, and therefore before anything material has changed, we can negotiate a free trade area massively larger than the EU. Trade deals with the US and China alone will give us a trade area almost twice the size of the EU, and of course we will also be seeking deals with Hong Kong, Canada, Australia, India, Japan, the UAE, Indonesia \u2013 and many others.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said no one should doubt Theresa May\u2019s commitment to Brexit.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister has said clearly that Brexit means Brexit \u2013 and for those who believe it can be indefinitely postponed or that there might be a second referendum or that we might stay by some back door mechanism, let me tell you, Theresa May is not someone who is known for saying anything, other than what she absolutely means.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he would conduct a joint trip to Africa in the new year with Priti Patel, the international development secretary. </strong>That was because trade and development had to go together, he said.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A continued focus on good governance, mediated and encouraged by international aid and assistance programs, combined with increasing attempts to see a more open and liberal trading environment, are our best hope to see grotesque levels of poverty consigned to history.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0400b9037d0ecb59b4d9196eecba38770918cbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0400b9037d0ecb59b4d9196eecba38770918cbf/0_0_4859_2917/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liam Fox gestures after delivering his keynote address to the Conservative party conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liam Fox gestures after delivering his keynote address to the Conservative party conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T16:19:59.037Z\">at 5.19pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f2737ee4b03ca720ca219a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T15:22:47.891Z\">4.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If <strong>Andrea Leadsom</strong> had not dropped out when she made the final two of the Conservative leadership contest, and if Theresa May\u2019s campaign had crashed, Leadsom would have been today getting ready for her first conference speech as prime minister.</p> <p>As it was, she ended up as environment secretary.

As well as abandoning their own fiscal charter, this was full of the same empty promises George Osborne made, only with worse gags.</p> <p>The chancellor should apologise today for the failed Tory approach that has meant he has had to abandon the failed economic agenda of the last six years, an approach which has seen them dragging their heels on tax avoidance, an increase in child poverty and housebuilding falling to its lowest peacetime rate since the 1920s.

Under Gordon Brown and George Osborne, this speech was always a highly charged event, combining forceful rhetoric with surprise policy statements that would set the agenda for days, weeks or even longer. Alistair Darling was less of a showman, but for most of his time as chancellor, the UK was facing a severe economic crisis, which gave anything he had to say an edge. Ken Clarke was less given to stunts, but at least he knew how to perform. Hammond, by comparison, had less fizz than a low-energy lightbulb.</p> <p>In news terms, the main point was what he had to say about abandoning deficit elimination by 2020 as a target. But if you listened to him on the Today programme this morning, he explained his thinking just as clearly, if not better, there than he did in his speech. Hammond did say that he might have to revise \u201cfiscal policy\u201d to help the UK cope with Brexit-related turbulance (increase spending or cut taxes), but he offered no clues as to his thinking and we are going to have to wait until the autumn statement to find out what he has in mind. The only other announcement in the speech was a guarantee that projects that receive multi-year EU funding will continue to get cash from the Treasury after the UK leaves.</p> <p>The rest of it was an upbeat assessment of the UK\u2019s economic prospects and a brave (but unsuccessful) attempt to make the productivity challenge sound interesting.</p> <p>Still, one senses that Theresa May does not approve of meretricious conference grandstanding. Being a bit pedestrian was probably what helped Hammond get the job of chancellor, and there is a lot to be said for avoiding the kind of flash policy announcements that can fall apart within hours. If you take the view that dull and boring is good in policymaking, then I suppose this was a triumph.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T12:44:35.870Z\">at 1.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f23e3ee4b0ab0063087689\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T11:17:35.106Z\">12.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hammond is on his peroration.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When future generations look back on our decision in 2016\u2026</p> <p>\u2026they will see not the end of an era\u2026</p> <p>\u2026but the beginning of a new age...</p> <p>\u2026not a country turning inward\u2026</p> <p>\u2026but a nation reaching out\u2026</p> <p>\u2026decisively, confidently to grasp new opportunities.</p> <p>A bigger, better, Greater Britain.</p> <p>Truly, a country that works for everyone.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f23e17e4b05962fdf4a682\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T11:16:51.014Z\">12.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>He says the Tories must \u201cresolve to tackle the challenges we face at home with renewed vigour\u201d.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T12:45:01.836Z\">at 1.45pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f23df5e4b05962fdf4a681\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T11:16:14.993Z\">12.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hammond is back on Brexit.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are going to leave the European Union.</p> <p>To repatriate our laws.</p> <p>To assert the supremacy of our courts.</p> <p>To control our borders.</p> <p>But we are not going to turn our backs on the nations of Europe.</p> <p>Let us resolve that as we leave their Union\u2026</p> <p>\u2026we will remain the best of neighbours\u2026</p> <p>\u2026the closest of trade associates\u2026</p> <p>\u2026the strongest of security partners.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f23d99e4b05962fdf4a67c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T11:15:23.284Z\">12.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>But Hammond says he is also promoting a similar initiative for the Midlands - the Midlands engine.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Midlands Engine, with its hub here in Birmingham, powers 11.7 million lives\u2026</p> <p>\u2026generates \u00a3220 billion of Added Value to the economy\u2026.</p> <p>\u2026.produces 18 percent of UK goods exports\u2026.</p> <p>\u2026.and more than a fifth of UK manufacturing output.</p> <p>In this great region, there are 320,000 more people in work than there were in 2010.</p> <p>But both productivity and economic growth have lagged behind the UK average.</p> <p>So we have developed our Long Term Economic Plan for the Midlands.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f23d4be4b05962fdf4a67b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T11:13:58.260Z\">12.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hammond says he remains committed to the northern powerhouse, Osborne\u2019s initiative to revive the economy around Manchester.

To describe people as divisive nationalists is bad enough; in a Northern Ireland context that can be inflammatory.</p> </blockquote> <p>He played down that down as conference rhetoric but said the Tories appeared very arrogant. \u201cI think a change of tone is required,\u201d he added later.</p> <p>Russell carefully avoided saying Holyrood would veto the Brexit bill, the so-called great repeal act, by refusing to give it legislative consent but said May had to honour her pledge earlier this summer to include Scotland in her Brexit strategy.</p> <p>It would lead to a \u201cvery, very serious situation\u201d if May tried to subvert the UK\u2019s devolution settlement, he said. May had to accept that Brexit had huge implications for Scotland\u2019s devolved responsibilities.</p> <p>Russell said the Scottish government would press for greater involvement in the Brexit talks at May\u2019s first joint ministerial council later this month, where she meets the heads of all three devolved governments. \u201cI\u2019m not talking the prime minister\u2019s pronouncements to her conference as the last word on this,\u201d he said.</p> <p><strong>David Mundell</strong>, the Scottish secretary, told Good Morning Scotland the Brexit deal was a Westminster decision: everyone knew \u201cthe Scottish parliament does not have a veto over Britain leaving the EU.\u201d But he insisted the UK government wanted to work with Russell and first minister Nicola Sturgeon on framing that deal. \u201cWe are willing to listen to options [for Scotland] but we haven\u2019t heard what those options are,\u201d he said.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f216aee4b05962fdf4a5ab\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T08:40:49.966Z\">9.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Lady Wheatcroft</strong>, a Conservative peer, has criticised Theresa May\u2019s decision to declare that she will invoke article 50, starting the formal EU withdrawal process, without consulting parliament. Speaking on the Today programme the former Sunday Telegraph and Wall Street Journal Europe editor said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It doesn\u2019t feel very democratic to me to have one individual using the royal prerogative deciding exactly when we\u2019re going to commit to that momentous path. This is surely something for the sovereignty of Parliament to have a say in, and not for the prime minister alone. </p> </blockquote> <p>She also said the public should get a chance to approve the final Brexit deal, perhaps in a second referendum. But in this morning\u2019s interview she did not go as far as she did in the summer, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-uk-leaves-the-eu-36940775\">when she suggested the House of Lords should block Brexit legislation.</a></p> <p>Wheatcroft\u2019s summer interview prompted this outburst from the Open Democracy founder <strong>Anthony Barnett. </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Everything that is disgustingly cosy, self-regarding, privileged, corrupt and unaccountable about the way Britain is governed is represented by the House of Lords. The idea that it should claim a right to override the <em>hoi polloi</em>, shows a complete failure to understand what has happened.</p> </blockquote> <p>Barnett\u2019s Blimey, it could be Brexit! was one of the best accounts of the EU referendum and now <a href=\"https://unbound.com/books/brexit\">he is crowdfunding a follow up called What Next.</a> The Wheatcroft quote is from <a href=\"https://unbound.com/books/brexit/excerpt\">the introduction that he has already published.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f209e3e4b05962fdf4a572\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T08:17:37.093Z\">9.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hammond's morning interviews - Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Philip Hammond</strong>, the chancellor, has given a series of interviews this morning. </p> <p>Often at party conference it is the job of the chancellor, or shadow chancellor, to deliver the bad news. This morning Hammond duly obliged.</p> <p>Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Hammond said the economy would go through a period of \u201cturbulence\u201d during the Brexit negotiation process.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We must expect some turbulence as we go through this negotiating process. There will be a period of a couple of years or perhaps even longer when businesses are uncertain about the final state of our relationship with the European Union ...</p> <p>We have to expect a period when confidence will go up and down - perhaps on a bit of a rollercoaster - until we get to a final agreement, where businesses and consumers can understand what the future relationship between Britain and the European Union will be.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that, although the economy was doing well at the moment, there was a danger that business uncertainty would lead to investment drying up.</strong> Asked to rate the state of the economy on a scale of one to 10, and when it was put to him that the UK might deserve a five or a six, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Oh, I think we are better than that. From the data we\u2019ve seen from the first half of this year, this economy is running at eight out of 10, with high employment, strong growth, robust fundamentals.</p> </blockquote> <p>But he said that there was some evidence that trouble was looming.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Anecdotally we hear of businesses postponing investment decisions. And if we don\u2019t do something, if we don\u2019t intervene to counteract that effect, in time that would have an impact on jobs and growth. And it is to make sure that we can intervene to deal with that situation that we need to push back the target for fiscal balance.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he was abandoning the plan to get the budget in surplus by 2019-20 because he had to be ready to spend more to support the economy during this period of uncertainty.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As we go into a period when inevitably there will be more uncertainty in the British economy, we need to have the space to be able to support the economy through that period. But we need to do that within a context that makes very clear that we will balance that budget, we will get back to a position of fiscal sustainability.</p> </blockquote> <p>There was a case for \u201ctargeted, high-value investment in our economic infrastructure\u201d, he said. He said investment in infrastructure would create jobs in the short term, and make Britain more efficient in the long term.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He rejected claims that he was now adopting Labour\u2019s approach. </strong>He claimed Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s economic policies were \u201cludicrous\u201d.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019ve heard some very irresponsible proposals from Labour and we heard last week some ludicrous suggestions about borrowing vast amounts of money. And we know from experience that the Labour party, if it were ever entrusted with government, would not be spending this money on the most productive forms of investment.</p> </blockquote> <p>When it was put to him that, although he might not be adopting Corbyn\u2019s policies, he was echoing what Ed Balls was saying before the general election, he also rejected that claim - although less convincingly. Told he sounded like Balls, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I hope I\u2019m sounding like a Conservative pragmatist faced with a challenge of uncertainty in the economy, wanting to ensure that we support the British economy through that period.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the government was still accepted the assumption that Brexit would lower growth.</strong> Asked about an Institute for Fiscal Studies prediction that it would lower growth by 4%, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That is, despite the good economic data that we have had, still the central prediction of economic forecasters, that overall leaving the European Union will have a negative effect on economic growth ... That\u2019s the central prediction of economic forecasters and we have to take what they say seriously. </p> </blockquote> <p>But the prediction did not involve a \u201cone-off hit\u201d to the economy, he said. It was a forecast for what might happen over 15 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b68d26b724fddd956438272795eede1928cea7da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b68d26b724fddd956438272795eede1928cea7da/0_162_4928_2956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Hammond and his wife Susan Williams-Walker at the Conservative conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Hammond and his wife Susan Williams-Walker at the Conservative conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f207f5e4b05962fdf4a568\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/graemewearden\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T07:26:30.719Z\">8.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pound falls as City faces up to hard Brexit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Brexit worries have pushed the pound back towards the 31-year lows plumbed in the aftermath of June\u2019s referendum.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling\">Sterling</a> has lost over half a cent in early trading, dropping to \u00a31.2902 against the US dollar.

  "<p>Executions in Taiwan traditionally involve sedated prisoners being thrust face down on a mattress and shot three times through the heart. If the condemned donate their internal organs, death is delivered by a single bullet to the back of the head.</p> <p>The last execution was at 8.47pm on 10 May inside a jail near the capital, Taipei. Cheng Chieh, 23, received three shots. The crime he committed was a frenzied, mass stabbing of travellers on a metro train, inflicted with a long fruit knife, which left four commuters dead and 24 injured in 2014.</p> <p>Cheng\u2019s final appeal had been dismissed by the country\u2019s supreme court two and a half weeks earlier. He reportedly confessed: \u201cI had to murder people so I would be convicted for murder and given the death sentence. Only then would my miserable life end.\u201d His mental state was the subject of intense legal dispute.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Keir Starmer, the Labour MP and former director of public prosecutions, the solicitor Saul Lehrfreund, who is co-executive director of abolitionist UK charity <a href=\"http://www.deathpenaltyproject.org/\">the Death Penalty Project</a>, and Dr Richard Latham, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, will arrive in Taipei in the hope of halting further executions.</p> <p>Their ultimate aim is to persuade the newly elected Democratic Progressive party government of president Tsai Ing-wen that she should abandon capital punishment, a shift that would signal the island\u2019s political distance from mainland China\u2019s practice of executing thousands of prisoners a year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec9dab2026c8ca2e7e881f813809c330277495c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec9dab2026c8ca2e7e881f813809c330277495c6/0_94_1464_878/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ritchie B. Tongo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The problem is that, according to the latest opinion polls, 80% of the Taiwanese population support the death penalty. The challenge does not seem to deter Starmer. \u201cHistory shows us there are key moments when attitudes change, like the death penalty, or, for example, gay marriage.</p> <p>\u201cWhile popular opinion appears to be strongly in one direction, bold moves are taken in accordance with changing standards. You expect an outpouring of outrage but within a short time a new norm emerges.</p> <p>\u201cIf you said 20 years ago that the public would accept gay marriage, you would have got a very different answer. Rarely has the death penalty been abolished by vote, but it has been restricted by legal measures, then abolished; and that\u2019s been accepted.\u201d Europe, he points out, is now a \u201cdeath penalty-free zone\u201d with the sole exception of Belarus.</p> <p>Starmer is a founding director of the Death Penalty Project, and has appeared frequently on a pro bono basis before the privy council \u2013 the final court of appeal for many Commonwealth countries \u2013 since the 1990s to challenge the use of the death penalty in the Caribbean.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8225b875bfaf64e3a723e84c0ea92895c75d9350\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8225b875bfaf64e3a723e84c0ea92895c75d9350/0_113_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keir Starmer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keir Starmer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite alarm over the recent rate of hangings and beheadings in Saudi Arabia, Iran and Pakistan, the international trend is for countries to abandon executions. There are 109 abolitionist states, although seven retain the punishment for war crimes and treason. A further 39 states abstain in practice.</p> <p>Taiwan has 42 people on death row. Alongside the US and South Korea, it is one of only a few liberal democracies that supports judicially authorised killing of its citizens. When the present governing party was last in power, it introduced a temporary moratorium and drafted into domestic legislation the United Nation\u2019s International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which prevents the death sentence being imposed on pregnant women or those who committed their crimes below the age of 18.</p> <p>That moratorium, however, was lifted when the government changed in 2010, leading to the execution of 33 people. The electoral victory this year of Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan\u2019s first female president, has boosted hopes of converting the country permanently to abolition.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rarely has the death penalty been abolished by vote, but it has been restricted by legal measures, then abolished</p> <footer> <cite>Keir Starmer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Democratic Progressive party emerged out of activist opposition to an earlier era of one-party rule. Human rights are part of its core values. The president, who is a lawyer by profession, has so far not committed herself either way.</p> <p>Lehrfreund says: \u201cWe are not there to dictate, we are there to assist them.\u201d He has been working closely with the <a href=\"http://www.taedp.org.tw/en\">Taiwan Alliance to End the Death Penalty</a>. \u201cWe hope Taiwan will show it is respectful of human rights and wants to be different to other countries in the region. That would create momentum for others to switch, perhaps Thailand and South Korea.\u201d</p> <p>Lehrfreund is convinced that popular support for executions is not set in stone. \u201cOnce you throw in variables about innocent defendants being mistakenly executed, then perceptions change.\u201d Challenging \u201cmisconceived views about the deterrent effect\u201d of the death penalty also helps shift opinion, he adds.</p> <p>The experience of awaiting execution can be mentally destabilising, says Latham. \u201cIt\u2019s termed \u2018death row syndrome\u2019. It has an incredibly negative impact. It resembles a depressive state. Depending on conditions and if you are kept in isolation, prisoners develop more severe responses such as hearing voices and delusional beliefs.\u201d As well as oscillating wildly between hope and fear, inmates overhear neighbours in adjoining cells being dragged away and never coming back.</p> <p>Latham will be talking to doctors about diagnosing prisoners and the way evidence is handled by the courts. \u201cPeople can appear superficially to be well but they may nonetheless be mentally disordered.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"373392f74992e051521bbcc32f076fa48f54820e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/373392f74992e051521bbcc32f076fa48f54820e/0_287_3419_2051/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is among world leaders considering reintroducing the death penalty.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is among world leaders considering reintroducing the death penalty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adem Altan/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Starmer is gratified that what began in obscure privy council legal hearings, has developed into Commonwealth legislation and now broadened out into an international campaign affecting every state around the world.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the government in Taiwan to decide whether it wants to move towards abolition,\u201d says Starmer, \u201cbut the fact that it has signed up to the ICCPR shows that it wants to do so in accordance with international standards. And that\u2019s welcome.\u201d There will also be discussions about Taiwan\u2019s plans to introduce a jury system.</p> <p>Progress towards global abolition may not be straightforward, Lehrfreund concedes. Both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/rodrigo-duterte\">Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte</a> and Turkey president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan\">Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan</a> threatened this summer to restore the death penalty, setbacks that may overshadow International World Day Against the Death Penalty on 10 October.</p> <p>\u201cThere should be a burden on any state to make sure they are not executing people who are mentally disordered,\u201d Lehrfreund says. \u201cIt\u2019s in the political arena that abolition will eventually happen.\u201d</p>",

Bell doesn\u2019t want to just preach to a choir of true believers, though, and he\u2019s finding that his audiences expect more than that from him. \u201cWhen I stand up in front of groups of people who agree with me, I know I have to really step my game up, because I can\u2019t just sort of meet them where they\u2019re at, I have to take them somewhere else,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want you to challenge them and have good ideas.\u201d</p> <p>His new album covers topics like his (white) wife\u2019s struggles to take care of their daughter\u2019s hair, the differences between east and west coast liberalism,<strong> </strong>and how much his mother hated The Dukes of Hazzard<strong>. </strong>She\u2019s someone who played a big part in developing Bell\u2019s gimlet eye for inequality.

He tried different styles, but found that he gravitated towards the socio-political side of the spectrum, returning again and again to subjects of race, inequality and political injustice. At some point, he just gave in to it. \u201cIn standup, you can\u2019t hold to the material,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just sort of pulls you in and you can either reject it or lean into it and I decided to \u2018lean in\u2019 to it.

He has a wife and two mixed-race daughters now and wants to use his platform to help make the world better for them. \u201cI felt that I\u2019ve never seen anybody onstage talk about mixed families in a way that was positive,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of times interracial relationships and mixed-race kids are the brunt of the jokes on stage, so I felt like I wanted to really clear space for my family and, out of that, I really want to talk about things in the world that we can change for my daughters once they get old enough to take it over.\u201d</p> <p>While Bell is trying to make the world a better place, unfortunately, the world just keeps giving him more material to work with on stage. \u201cI started doing the [Ending Racism] shows at colleges about a week and a half ago and I mentioned Colin Kaepernick just at one point,\u201d he said. \u201cI did the show two days ago \u2013 it\u2019s like the sixth show I\u2019ve done in 10 days \u2013 and now there\u2019s a whole section on Colin Kaepernick, the Olympics and Jesse Owens.

  "<p>At the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/picture/2016/jul/08/eyewitness-pamplona-spain\">Pamplona bull run</a>, once they unsnick the latch on the corral, no matter how smartly dressed you are, or how athletic, you are always going to look like a frightened person running away from bulls.</p> <p>So it is in Pamplona, so it was in Madrid on Saturday for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/01/pedro-sanchez-resigns-as-leader-of-spains-socialist-party\">deposed socialist leader Pedro S\u00e1nchez</a>. He picked his moment carefully to take on the raging bulls of his party oligarchy. But they still managed to trample him, and mercilessly.</p> <p>S\u00e1nchez\u2019s mistake was to challenge the tradition of \u201cturnism\u201d \u2013 whereby the socialists and conservatives simply alternate in power, enriching their friends while 20% of Spaniards lack jobs.</p> <p>After two indecisive elections, S\u00e1nchez continued to block a rightwing government and to hold out the possibility of the socialist PSOE governing, with the support of the radical left party Podemos. For this, he was summarily ejected in a chaotic coup led by the party\u2019s powerful regional government bosses.</p> <p>S\u00e1nchez\u2019s fate is one more signal of the crisis facing European social democracy. It was shaped for three decades around the certainties of neoliberalism. Now the free-market model has failed, social democracy seems stripped of the intellectual resource to renew itself.</p> <p>And that, in turn, is the product of a deeper incoherence. Parliamentary socialism was born across Europe in the 1890s from multiple sources \u2013 moderate Marxism, trade unions, co-ops, splits from liberalism.</p> <p>In 1945, social democracy had to be reinvented across continental Europe, this time as both an overt and covert bulwark against Soviet influence. And, in the 1970s, as the remaining dictatorships collapsed in Spain, Portugal and Greece, there was once again a moment of reinvention.</p> <p>Throughout the century, it is remarkable how little emerged by way of a cross-border intellectual culture of the centre-left. If you wanted to choose a globally influential thinker for the centre-left after the second world war, you would have to go for the Hungarian-American historian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Polanyi\">Karl Polanyi</a>. Polanyi argued that capitalism consists of a \u201cdouble movement\u201d \u2013 the push for free markets and the pushback against them, to regulate them in the interests of society.</p> <p>The beauty of Polanyi\u2019s big idea was that it allowed the centre-left in the 1980s to find a justification for its work that could survive the demise of the working class. Instead of \u201cprotecting the working class\u201d, the aim of social democracy became understood as \u201cregulating capitalism for its own good\u201d.</p> <p>The root cause of all social democracy\u2019s problems since 2008 is that it is no longer clear how this can be done. There was a rightwing version of neoliberalism, red in tooth and claw; and a progressive version \u2013 with its financial inclusion agenda, gay marriage, and meritocratic ethos in education, healthcare and social policy.</p> <p>But the central tenets of the economic system were set in stone in the Lisbon treaty, mandating austerity and forbidding the protection of key industries against the global market.</p> <p>Now the economic mainsprings of neoliberalism are broken, social democracy\u2019s task is to speed the invention of something else. But as Pedro S\u00e1nchez\u2019s fate suggests, it is ill-equipped for doing that. Most socialist elites and bureaucracies in Europe \u2013 including Britain, as the backlash against Jeremy Corbyn shows \u2013 are attuned to running a capitalism that does not work, and seem incapable of imagining any other future.</p> <p>The radical left \u2013 in the form of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/podemos\">Podemos in Spain</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/syriza\">Syriza in Greece</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders in the US</a> and Corbyn in Britain \u2013 stands foursquare for the replacement of neoliberalism. But with what?</p> <p>At its best, the new left radicalism is municipal, inclusive, audaciously anti-racist and promotes horizontal democracy. At its worst, it becomes an expression of revolt only; a list of demands; a celebration of resistance techniques; a rehearsal of leftwing tropes from yesteryear. In the one country where the radical left took power, Greece, it was forced into submission by north European social democrats.</p> <p>But now there is a series of alarm calls. The near victory of the far right in the Austrian presidential election in May prompted an inner-party coup, putting left-leaning centrist Christian Kern into the chancellorship.</p> <p>Kern, though a lifelong technocrat, is surrounded by thinkers from the left. <a href=\"https://www.socialeurope.eu/2016/09/europe-must-become-fair-again/\">Last month, he issued an open call</a> for Europe to break with austerity, to double its proposed fiscal stimulus and \u2013 in a thinly veiled attack on Angela Merkel \u2013 to stop gaming the crisis for national advantage.</p> <p>French socialism, meanwhile, is staring at moral collapse. It is impossible for any of its candidates in next year\u2019s election to beat the far-right Marine Le Pen, and its supporters go into that crunch battle knowing they will have to vote for a conservative to stop her. And in Italy, premier <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/06/matteo-renzi-italy-referendum-banks-brexit\">Matteo Renzi has staked the centre-left\u2019s future on a constitutional referendum</a> he looks likely to lose.</p> <p>All this explains why Corbyn\u2019s victory has raised an alarm flag inside European social democracy. It shows you can move a traditional socialist party to the left. The defeat of S\u00e1nchez, exactly one week later, is meant to show that you cannot.</p> <p>The Spanish socialist elite is reconciled now to four years of conservative government as the price for keeping the new, vibrant and radical left away from power. But Spain is about to teach the whole of Europe\u2019s centre-left a lesson: if you cling to neoliberalism, you die. If Podemos, the radical left party, can open itself up to those among the socialists disgusted at S\u00e1nchez\u2019s overthrow, the path is open for its emergence as a Syriza-style hegemonic left party.</p> <p>The question, then, is the one posed by Austrian chancellor Christian Kern. Is Europe\u2019s social democracy going to impose austerity for ever or, even if only for the selfish purposes of survival, actually begin to fight it?</p>",

Afghans constituted the second-largest group of asylum seekers in Europe, with <a href=\"https://www.easo.europa.eu/sites/default/files/public/EN_%20Annual%20Report%202015_1.pdf\">196,170 applying</a> last year.</p> <p>While the text stipulates a maximum of 50 non-voluntary deportees per chartered flight in the first six months after the agreement, there is no limit to the number of daily deportation flights European governments can charter to Kabul.</p> <p>With tens of thousands set to be deported, both sides will also consider building a terminal dedicated to deportation flights at Kabul international airport.</p> <p>The agreement, Joint Way Forward, also opens up the deportation of women and children, which at the moment almost exclusively happens from Norway: \u201cSpecial measures will ensure that such vulnerable groups receive adequate protection, assistance and care throughout the whole process.\u201d</p> <p>If family members in Afghanistan cannot be located, unaccompanied children can be returned only with \u201cadequate reception and care-taking arrangement having been put in place in Afghanistan\u201d, the text says.</p> <p>The EU has negotiated the agreement with the Afghan government as part of the run-up to this week\u2019s Brussels donor conference, where international donors will pledge aid for Afghanistan for the coming four years. Some Afghan officials seem to have felt strong-armed. The Afghan minister for refugees and repatriation, Sayed Hussain Alemi Balkhi, refused to sign the document, leaving the duty to a deputy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/25/child-soldiers-afghanistan-grandsons-fight-to-avenge-their-father\">'My grandsons' fight to avenge their father': child soldiers in Afghanistan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Still, Afghanistan, whose domestic revenue <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2016/04/20/afghanistan-development-update-afghanistan-riding-into-the-headwinds-of-lower-aid\">only constitutes 10.4% of GDP</a>, is so dependent on foreign aid that the government may have had little choice.</p> <p>Liza Schuster, a Kabul-based migration expert, said the deal was an example of \u201chow developed countries are able to push through their agenda in countries where there simply isn\u2019t the capacity in the ministries to push back\u201d. She added that there had been little transparency in the negotiation process.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been no oversight, no consultation, and hardly any mention of it to any of the migrant organisations or rights organisations [in Europe]. There was no chance to mount resistance against it,\u201d Schuster said.</p> <p>The large exodus of Afghans last year seemed partly triggered by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/08/refugee-crisis-germany-creaks-under-strain-of-open-door-policy\">Angela Merkel opening Germany\u2019s doors to almost a million migrants</a>, but it also coincided with a deteriorating security situation, which has not improved since.</p> <p>On Sunday, the Taliban mounted a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/03/taliban-launches-major-assault-on-afghan-city-of-kunduz\">strong assault</a> on the northern city of Kunduz, while attacks have also increased in many other parts of the country.</p> <p>To prevent a migrant flow of the size experienced last year, the deal commits the EU to help fund public awareness campaigns in Afghanistan warning against the dangers of migrating.</p> <p>However, not all Afghan asylum seekers arrive to Europe from Afghanistan. An unknown number were born or grew up in Iran or Pakistan. If sent to Afghanistan, many are likely to struggle without the social networks that are often a prerequisite to getting work, even for the well-educated. According to Schuster, who has authored a <a href=\"http://migration.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/05/08/migration.mns011\">paper on post-deportation experience</a>, destitute people, who do not choose to leave Afghanistan again immediately after deportation, could be ripe targets for recruitment not only by the Taliban but local strongmen commanding militias. In that sense, deportations could add to instability.</p> <p>\u201cThere is not sufficient protection, the level of generalised violence is too high and Kabul is already bursting at the seams,\u201d Schuster said.</p> <p>\u201cThis particular agreement allows European governments to ride straight through all the argumentation that\u2019s been made over the past 15 years that it\u2019s not safe to return people at the moment.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Britain is missing out on billions of pounds in exports every year because of a failure to help small and medium-sized companies crack new markets, according to an analysis that highlights firms\u2019 worries about exporting after Brexit.</p> <p>The UK is among the five worst performing countries in Europe when it comes to getting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) exporting, says the <a href=\"https://www.worldfirst.com/downloads/Think_Global_WorldFirst.pdf\">report</a> (pdf) from the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) consultancy. </p> <p>The low share of total UK exports that comes from SMEs puts the country at the bottom of European rankings alongside Germany, Sweden, Poland and Finland. But the UK and Germany are also in the top five spots for the level of absolute exports, thanks to the success of their larger firms in trading overseas.</p> <p>The CEBR said bringing smaller firms\u2019 export rates more in line with larger firms\u2019 trading patterns could provide a significant boost to government plans to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/21/budget-osborne-exports-target-manufacturers\">almost double UK exports to \u00a31tn by 2020</a> \u2013 a target it is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/17/uk-miss-2020-export-target-warn-mps\">widely expected to miss by a significant margin</a>. </p> <p>The report found that less than a fifth of the UK\u2019s SMEs were selling their goods and services overseas, compared with two-fifths of big businesses in the UK.</p> <p>Helping more SMEs enter new markets and bringing their export rate up to 40%, could reap \u00a3141.3bn a year in overseas sales, the analysis claimed. <br></p> <p>\u201cGiven that SMEs account for around 60% of all private sector employment in the UK and just under half of the overall turnover in the UK\u2019s private sector, there is considerable scope to boost the number of SMEs selling goods and services overseas and, as a result, raise the overall level of exports across the UK economy,\u201d the report stated. </p> <p>While the potential gains from more SME exports look good on paper, they appear much harder to achieve in reality as underscored by the CEBR\u2019s polling of 1,054 smaller and medium-sized companies to accompany its analysis.<br></p> <p>The polling of SME bosses showed only 5% had plans to start exporting in the next five years and more than two-fifths of those polled said Brexit would hinder their ability to export.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The report, commissioned by the currency and money transfer company World First, came alongside the chancellor\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/03/philip-hammond-vows-to-match-lost-eu-funding-for-business\">attempts to allay business fears about a \u201chard Brexit\u201d</a>, which could see the government striking a deal to leave the EU that excludes Britain from the single market. </p> <p>In his <a href=\"http://press.conservatives.com/post/151284663940/hammond-an-economy-that-works-for-everyone\">Conservative party conference speech</a> on Monday, Philip Hammond pledged to fight for \u201cthe best possible access to European markets for our manufacturing and services industries\u201d.</p> <p>The World First/CEBR report found that alongside Brexit, potential exporters were put off from selling into overseas markets by language barriers and cultural differences. Language was the top barrier by SMEs looking to enter the Asia-Pacific region and South America (21%). Culture was named as the biggest barrier for SMEs wanting to enter Africa and the Middle East.</p> <p>Asked about the decision to leave the EU, 42% of SMEs said it would hinder them; 19% said it would help them. Just over a third, or 35%, said it would make no difference. </p> <p>\u201cThe fallout from the UK referendum has also brought about a significant amount of uncertainty for businesses but, if anything, it reinforces the importance of taking a global view and exploring new markets,\u201d said World First\u2019s chief executive, Jonathan Quin.</p> <p>\u201cAs the government\u2019s Brexit negotiations take centre stage over the next few years, we would urge that SMEs are included and actively consulted throughout the process in order to ensure their views and needs are actively considered.\u201d</p>",

The abuse of refugee and migrant women does not stop at the borders of Europe. Another young Eritrean woman I\u2019ve met has been in Calais for 10 months. Her husband is in the UK, but she has given up trying to climb on to the lorries to join him. The women feel vulnerable if they go out at night with the men. They would never tell the police about any attacks. \u201cWe are not people to them.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoiJD37JOXg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QoiJD37JOXg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>What responsibility do we have, here in the UK, to these women at our borders? The view from our government seems to be that any step, however carefully managed, to enable people to find safe routes into the UK will weaken our borders irreparably.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At the end of the day, are we really so scared of these women, that we would block their attempts to seek safety here?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Theresa May seems to be developing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/19/theresa-may-united-nations-right-claim-asylum-migration-refugees\">two-tier system of asylum</a>, in which those who are resettled straight from their home countries are seen as more deserving of refugee status than those who have made these dangerous journeys. But this is a false distinction; women who are already on the move are often just as vulnerable, just as entitled to protection, as those in refugee camps far away.</p> <p>Obviously the wider crises in which these women are caught up need bigger shifts in resources and interventions than the UK government can manage alone. But that is not to say that our leaders can\u2019t play some constructive part in building a safer world.</p> <p>Our prime minister and our home secretary, uniquely in our country\u2019s history, are both women. If they could find it in their hearts to listen to what women on the other side of fortune are passing through right now, they might understand why current policy is so unworkable and inhumane.</p> <p>It\u2019s unworkable because it places an impossible burden on the countries where people enter Europe, and leads to chaos at the borders. It\u2019s inhumane because by refusing to set up any safe routes for women like these, our policy leaves them and their children in a twilight world. Destitution and danger become commonplace, and violence against them goes unpunished. The legacy of that violence can be heard in the stories of every woman I\u2019ve spoken to in Calais.</p> <p>Observers are often puzzled why these women are not claiming asylum in France rather than living in limbo, hoping to cross to the UK. For many women there, it is because the only family members they have \u2013 the fathers of their children, in some cases, or brothers, sisters, parents \u2013 are in the UK. One woman I met has lived in Calais for months with her four-year-old daughter, because her husband is in the UK and she cannot give up hope of reuniting the family.</p> <p>At the end of the day, are we really so scared of these women, that we would block their attempts to seek safety here, and deny them any help in rebuilding their lives? Helen, the woman who made it through the Sahara and Libya, did in the end make it out of Calais and into the UK by climbing into a lorry at night. She has now claimed asylum, and if she is successful in settling here, she wants to become a nurse. I dearly hope that she is able to fulfil her dreams, and that we can find ways to help more women like her to rebuild their lives and reclaim their dignity.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Names have been changed</em></p>",
  "<p> A bid to give the highest level of international legal protection to all African elephants was defeated on Monday at a global wildlife summit. </p> <p>The EU played a pivotal role in blocking the proposal, which was fought over by rival groups of African nations.</p> <p> But the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), meeting this week in Johannesburg, passed other new measures for elephants that conservationists say will add vital protection. </p> <p> All 182 nations agreed for the first time that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/02/worlds-nations-agree-elephant-ivory-markets-must-close\">legal ivory markets within nations must be closed</a>. Separately, a process that could <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-37479072\">allow one-off sales of ivory stockpiles was killed</a> and tougher measures to deal with nations failing to control poached ivory were agreed. </p> <p> More than 140,000 of Africa\u2019s savannah elephants were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/12/elephants-on-the-path-to-extinction-the-facts\">killed for their ivory</a> between 2007 and 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/poaching-drives-huge-30-decline-in-africas-savannah-elephants\">wiping out almost a third of their population</a>, and one elephant is still being killed by poachers every 15 minutes on average. The price of ivory has soared threefold since 2009, leading conservationists to fear the survival of the species is at risk.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/poaching-drives-huge-30-decline-in-africas-savannah-elephants\">Poaching drives huge 30% decline in Africa's savannah elephants</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The acrimonious debate over elephant poaching has split African countries. Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, which host about a third of all remaining elephants, have stable or increasing populations. They argue passionately that elephant numbers are also suffering from loss of habitat and killings by farmers and that they can only be protected by making money from ivory sales and trophy hunting.</p> <p> However, a <a href=\"https://www.africanelephantcoalition.org/\">group of 29 African nations</a>, which host about 40% of all elephants and are led by Kenya and Benin, have smaller and plummeting populations and countered that poaching and the illegal trade in ivory is the greatest threat.</p> <p> Most African elephants already have the highest level of international legal protection \u2013 a Cites \u201cappendix 1\u201d listing \u2013 which bans all trade. But the elephants in Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana, are listed on \u201cappendix 2\u201d, a lower level of protection. On Monday a proposal to add the elephants in Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana to appendix 1 was defeated. </p> <p> Critics said the proposal would do little to protect elephants as all international trade is already banned, but proponents argued it was a crucial signal to poachers and criminals of a global crackdown on the illegal ivory trade. Botswana has the world\u2019s largest elephant population, about a third of all elephants, and it is growing. But it broke ranks with Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe and argued vehemently for appendix 1 protection.</p> <p>Tshekedi Khama, Botswana\u2019s minister of environment, said: \u201cThere is concerning evidence that elephant poaching is moving south. The criminal networks that facilitate much of this trade are highly organised and fluid, operating over several regions in the continent. Therefore no population should be considered secure. Put simply, a threat to elephants anywhere is a threat to elephants everywhere.\u201d</p> <p> The Cote D\u2019Ivoire delegate said it was absurd to have some elephants on appendix 1 and some on appendix 2: \u201cAn elephant that crosses a border may have protection on one side and not on the other. Elephants do not have passports.\u201d</p> <p>Lee White, the British-born director of Gabon\u2019s national parks and Cites delegate, said poachers were now shooting on sight at his rangers. The upgrading of all elephants to the highest protection would have sent \u201ca signal that we will come down as hard on poaching as we do on the trafficking of drugs, arms and people\u201d.</p> <p> However, Namibia\u2019s delegate threatened to withdraw entirely from Cites protections for elephants if the all populations were upgraded the highest levels. \u201cIt is completely fallacious that legal ivory trade covers illegal trade,\u201d he said, a statement flatly rejected by other nations. </p> <p>South Africa\u2019s environment minister, Edna Molewa, said rural communities must benefit from elephants if they are to tolerate the damage caused to crops and the lives sometimes lost. \u201cWe dare not ignore their voices,\u201d she said. \u201cTrophy hunting is the best return on investment [in elephant protection] with the least impact.\u201d</p> <p>The EU, which with 28 votes is a powerful force at Cites, also opposed the upgrade to appendix 1. It said that Cites rules meant the highest level protection is reserved for populations that are in steep decline, and that this did not apply to the elephants in Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana. </p> <p>Some scientific and conservation groups agreed with this, including WWF, Traffic and the Zoological Society of London, arguing the integrity of the Cites was at risk.</p> <p> The EU delegate to Cites said: \u201cThe proposal does not meet the biological criteria. [But] this does not mean in any way we are not concerned about the decline of elephants across the continent.\u201d Several nations said cutting the demand for ivory, through education, and better enforcement against poachers were key. </p> <p> The issue was forced to a vote and was defeated, leaving the southern African elephants on appendix 2. Earlier on Monday, Namibia and Zimbabwe had attempted to legalise the trade in ivory from those countries.</p> <p> Namibia said its elephant population had doubled to 20,000 in the last 15 years. Charles Jonga, from the Campfire Programme, a rural development group in Zimbabwe, told the Cites summit: \u201cThe people in my community say: \u2018These elephants they eat our crops, they damage our houses, what benefit do we get?\u2019 If they get benefits, they will protect and not poach.\u201d </p> <p> But Patrick Omondi, Kenya\u2019s delegate, said: \u201cPoaching levels and trafficking in ivory are at their highest peak. History has shown the ivory trade cannot be controlled. We are reaching a tipping point and need to give elephants time to recover.\u201d</p> <p> Both Namibia\u2019s and Zimbabwe\u2019s proposals, supported by Japan but opposed by the EU and US, were soundly defeated. Observers believe Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa did not expect to unpick the ban on the ivory trade at this summit, but wanted to keep the debate open, in the hope of future success. Another proposal, from Swaziland, to legalise the trade in its rhino horn was heavily defeated. </p> <p>Many conservation groups wanted all elephants to get the highest protection, but Tom Milliken, an elephant expert from wildlife trade monitoring group Traffic, said<strong tabindex=\"-1\">: </strong>\u201cWhere elephants fall on the Cites appendices is inconsequential to their survival. All the paper protection in the world is not going to compensate for poor law enforcement, rampant corruption and ineffective management.\u201d </p> <p>He said the real success of the summit were measures to crack down on countries failing to halt illegal trade.</p> <p>But Kelvin Alie, at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said the failure to put all elephants on appendix one was a disaster: \u201cThis is a tragedy for elephants. At a time when we are seeing such a dramatic increase in the slaughter of elephants for ivory, now was the time for the global community to step up and say no more.\u201d</p>",

Trott, feeling broken, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/25/jonathan-trott-leaves-england-ashes-tour\" title=\"\">left the tour after just one Test</a>. His captain, Alastair Cook, had seen tears in Trott\u2019s eyes when he walked out to join him in the middle in Brisbane. A more haunting image of turmoil had already been witnessed. Practising in the nets, Trott had set the bowling machine to its fastest speed.</p> <p>\u201cHe must have been hit hard 20 times,\u201d Cook recalls in the book. \u201cAgain and again, he took terrible blows. It was horrible to watch \u2026 to my lasting regret, I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p> <p>Trott grimaces amid a graphic memory. \u201cCookie was in the net next to me. The machine was set to any length at high speed. Instead of what I normally do in practice I was looking for a quick fix. I was trying to justify things and prove to the coaches how hard I was&#xa0;working.\u201d</p> <p>Australia\u2019s fast bowlers, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhzQiW4rtY\" title=\"\">led by a menacing Mitchell Johnson</a>, were devastating. \u201cThey circled like hyenas round a dying zebra,\u201d Trott suggests. Yet he was not worried about being hurt. His fear was of failure and being exposed. \u201cI\u2019ve faced really quick attacks. My <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUtUUgja5X8\" title=\"\">highest ODI score was 137</a> [in Sydney in 2011] against Johnson, Lee, and Tait. But in 2013 I couldn\u2019t respond. I felt in slow motion. I felt really bad in the Ashes over here, even before Johnson turned up. So it was not just him. It was my technique. When your head is moving you can\u2019t pick up the ball as quickly. You can\u2019t judge the length. I was a sitting duck. But I\u2019ve never been scared of quick bowling. Never. It\u2019s more that the opposition use it as a sign of weakness and the waters become muddied.\u201d</p> <p>I interviewed Trott six months before that breakdown in Brisbane. On the eve of those back-to-back Ashes, he told me that, having an imposing average of 86.42 against Australia up to that point, the key was to approach each Test <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/08/jonathan-trott-england-ashes-2013\" title=\"\">as if it was just \u201ca club game\u201d</a>. I suggested then that Trott had a \u201cdry sense of humour\u201d \u2013 with both of us unaware he was lurching towards crisis.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/oct/03/jonathan-trott-reflects-on-his-england-cricket-career-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/55mqb\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2772371\"            data-video-name=\"Jonathan Trott reflects on his England cricket career \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"theguardian.com\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57f23323e4b015be63833a86\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/03/161003trott_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733778&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733778&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/oct/03/jonathan-trott-reflects-on-his-england-cricket-career-video\">Jonathan Trott reflects on his England cricket career</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>England had just lost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/23/england-india-champions-trophy-final\" title=\"\">the final of the Champions Trophy against India</a> and, in our 2013 interview, Trott said: \u201cI still feel upset.\u201d He now pinpoints that defeat as the start of his descent into darkness. \u201cI was very upset about it \u2013 same as Ashley Giles [then England\u2019s limited\u2011overs coach]. It would have changed his coaching career if we\u2019d won. The more I look back the more I regret it. I was with Ashley yesterday and we spoke about it \u2013 without really talking because we still feel hurt.\u201d</p> <p>Surely Trott would have endured similar trauma even if England had won their first major one-day tournament on home soil? \u201cMaybe not. I was so disappointed with the way I got out [as England fell five runs short]. Losing a final at Edgbaston, my home ground, made me doubly determined to do well in the Ashes. You become your own worst enemy. Before then I was focused on the process \u2013 scraping my mark in the ground, getting ready for the next ball. But I\u2019d look at the scoreboard and think: \u2018Jesus, I\u2019m on 0. I need 80 to keep standing&#xa0;still.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>His paranoia was intensified by England\u2019s demands \u2013 made worse by the England and Wales Cricket Board\u2019s agreement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jan/28/england-australia-ashes-2013-cricket\" title=\"\">to stage two Ashes series in the same year</a>. Was this relentless schedule the main cause of his disintegration? \u201cI\u2019d say 50-50. After that Oval Test I got offered the opportunity not to play ODIs against Australia before we went back over there. Andy Flower [then England\u2019s head coach] asked me what I thought but it felt like a test. He said: \u2018You missed the one-day series in India in January but this is now.\u2019 I said: \u2018OK, I\u2019ll play.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want to argue with him.\u201d</p> <p>Two months later Trott fell apart in Brisbane \u2013 also the scene of one of his great Test innings. In November 2010, against an attack including Johnson, Trott hit 135 as he and Cook <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/dec/14/alastair-cook-ashes-gabba-adelaide\" title=\"\">shared an unbroken stand of 329</a>.</p> <p>In writing so candidly about his subsequent implosion does Trott hope the ECB might reconsider England\u2019s workload? \u201cPerhaps people will get more insight into it \u2013 but my intention was not to try and force any change.\u201d</p> <p>Surely change is needed? \u201cYeah, but some guys have coped OK. Could there be less international cricket? Yes. Most people would say so. But we\u2019re the only country that plays from April to September so only England can go to eight other places in the winter.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/may/05/jonathan-trott-early-retirement-england-cricket\">Something better change or Trott\u2019s early retirement will not be the last | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His caution is plain in avoiding further controversy after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/22/michael-vaughan-jonathan-trott-accusations-denies\" title=\"\">Michael Vaughan instructed his lawyers</a> in the wake of the Times running an extract from Trott\u2019s book. Trott stresses the contrast between him and Vaughan: \u201cI have a bald head and chipped teeth; he has new hair and suddenly brilliant white teeth.\u201d But will their dispute end soon? \u201cUm \u2026 these points have been made in the book and I\u2019m pretty happy with the way it\u2019s been said. I think the book\u2019s well written and I get my point across. There are plenty of people I\u2019ve disagreed with but I\u2019ve written nicely about them.\u201d</p> <p>In March 2014 he had been disappointed with Vaughan\u2019s reaction to a television interview in which Trott addressed the reasons for his departure from Australia. Trott attempted to explain his problems \u2013 which the sports psychiatrist Steve Peters diagnosed as \u201csituation-based anxiety\u201d rather than depression \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/england/10701664/Jonathan-Trott-must-accept-team-mates-and-opponents-will-feel-he-did-a-runner.html\" title=\"\">and Vaughan complained that he felt \u201cconned</a> \u2026 we were allowed to believe [Trott] was struggling with a serious mental health issue \u2026 but he was struggling for cricketing reasons\u201d.</p> <p>His wife, Abi, explains that, after reading his newspaper column, she wrote an unsent letter to Vaughan. \u201cIt\u2019s not horrid or abusive. It just makes it plain how much damage he caused.\u201d Will Abi eventually send her letter to Vaughan? \u201cIt\u2019s up to her really.\u201d</p> <p>Before he was burnt-out and scarred by the intensity of international cricket, Trott approached his Test debut with thrilling certainty. Remembering his mood before a very different Oval Test in 2009, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/aug/22/england-australia-jonathan-trott-fifth-test\" title=\"\">when he hit a century in an Ashes decider</a>, Trott says: \u201cI opened my hotel door and my mum, dad, uncle and grandad were frozen against the wall. They were apprehensive and nervous. I said: \u2018C\u2019mon, it\u2019ll be all right!\u2019 I felt prepared and really confident. I was very excited. At the end of day three, one of my best days ever, I got a hundred and I wanted to go back to the changing rooms and sit with my team-mates. I\u2019d had the best fun ever. But I got whisked away for a Sky interview and I thought: \u2018OK, that\u2019s done.\u2019 They said: \u2018No, you\u2019ve got another interview.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI think this gives you the scarring and apprehension about playing sport. It\u2019s not the actual game. It\u2019s more the consequences and knowing what those guys are punching into their laptops or what people are saying about you. You are judged and if you\u2019re not in the right frame of mind it brings you down \u2013 which happened to me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"659a0bba14e79e3358accf9bc80e336ddbb2f5d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/659a0bba14e79e3358accf9bc80e336ddbb2f5d0/0_138_4440_2665/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trott after guiding Warwickshire to victory in the final of this year\u2019s Royal London One Day Cup.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trott guided Warwickshire to victory in the final of this year\u2019s Royal London One Day Cup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Ansell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trott\u2019s problems emerged far earlier. He describes his sports-crazed childhood in South Africa and his unsettling perception that the mood at home was dictated by whether or not he was scoring lots of runs in schoolboy cricket. He almost felt he would no longer be loved if he was not a prodigious run-machine. Trott stresses how much his parents helped him but, also, \u201cbetween us, we created something of a monster\u201d.</p> <p>Has he told them how he felt? \u201cA couple of times. But you don\u2019t often get a kid aged three who knows what he wants to do. You have this drive and sometimes it\u2019s uncontrollable. You feel the pressure. When I was eight I felt like a guy starting his professional career. Going home you step back into the environment where if you\u2019d scored 25 your normal mum would say: \u2018That\u2019s great.\u2019 My mother would be like: \u2018OK \u2013 get a 50 next time.\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/21/the-spin-gareth-batty-england-tour-bangladesh\">Gareth Batty\u2019s England encore a victory for bloody-minded persistence | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trott also wrote his book in an effort to explain to his half-brother, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/southafrica/content/player/45709.html\" title=\"\">the former cricketer Kenny Jackson</a>, what happened to him \u2013 for Jackson had not been sympathetic to Trott\u2019s plight in Australia. \u201cHe\u2019s very much from my mum\u2019s school.

Kenny wasn\u2019t as naturally gifted as me but he was from the Andy Flower school. Very tough and never take the easy road. But sometimes you have to take the road to&#xa0;wellness.\u201d</p> <p>Trott left Australia having played 49 Tests. He believes that winning his 50th cap, 18 months later in the Caribbean, was his greatest achievement. Those three Tests against the West Indies last year were a sporting failure \u2013 but he had picked himself up and tried again. Trott hit one 50 and he knew his international career was finished. He ended up staring into a toilet mirror in Bridgetown, seeing \u201cthe toll cricket had taken on me\u201d, relieved it was all over.</p> <p>He has just completed the domestic season with Warwickshire on a high. Trott, batting with serene composure, hit a match-winning unbeaten 82 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/17/warwickshire-surrey-royal-london-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">in the Royal London Cup final</a> at Lord\u2019s last month. Relishing his freedom from the conveyor belt of international cricket, the 35-year-old is looking forward to some media work and watching Tottenham this winter. But is he intent on still playing cricket \u2013 for the love of a game which once tortured him?</p> <p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Trott says. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic. I am very proud of my England career but I now have that drive to help younger players at Warwickshire. I like that responsibility of being a senior player with the challenge of setting the bar high.

  "<p>These days, Raed al-Saleh doesn\u2019t have to see a&#xa0;warplane to know what kind of bombs it drops. He just needs to hear it. \u201cIt\u2019s very depressing,\u201d Saleh says. \u201cBased on its sound, we can predict the kind of airplane, and then anticipate the scale of the destruction.\u201d He has reached the stage where he hopes for the rumble of a Mig-29, rather than a Su-24. It\u2019s the Su-24s that carry the cluster bombs.</p> <p>In rebel-held Syria, where the Syrian regime and its Russian allies are dropping more bombs than ever before, Saleh isn\u2019t the only person who has learned to discern between the roar of different warplanes. But he is among the best practised. He\u2019s the head of the Syrian civil defence, a team of 2,700 civilian rescue workers that saves people from the rubble of airstrikes across rebel-held Syria. Known internationally as the White Helmets, after the colour of their hardhats, they are the subject of a new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/sep/23/the-white-helmets-syria-volunteer-rescue-workers-heroes-hope-horror\" title=\"\">Netflix documentary</a>; the winners of the Right Livelihood award, known as the alternative Nobel peace prize; and <a href=\"https://nobelpeaceprize.whitehelmets.org/en\" title=\"\">nominees for the real thing</a>. And understandably so: at least 130 White Helmets have been killed in the course of saving more than 60,000 lives.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone need saving?\u201d asks Khaled Farah, a builder turned rescuer, during a moving new documentary about the Syrian civil defence. \u201cAnything you need, we\u2019re the White Helmets.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8171733be885dd5650fb91ba2e4ef7b722cd4b2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8171733be885dd5650fb91ba2e4ef7b722cd4b2c/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"There are 2,700 civilians in the White Helmets, rescuing people from the rubble of airstrikes across rebel-held Syria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There are 2,700 civilians in the White Helmets, rescuing people from the rubble of airstrikes across rebel-held Syria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I meet Saleh on the sidelines of the recent UN general assembly in New York. He has donned a shirt and tie for his meetings with diplomats and politicians, but still looks out of place. He\u2019s a&#xa0;man of action transplanted to a&#xa0;parallel reality of suits and lanyards, of grand talk but few decisions. At the UN headquarters down the road, diplomats publicly maintain that a Syrian ceasefire is still in play. From out in the real world, Saleh has just learned of another round of regime attacks on rebel-held Aleppo. The news seems to exhaust him. There are big bags under his eyes, which he spends several moments rubbing.</p> <p>\u201cThere are no signs of improvements,\u201d Saleh says. \u201cToday in Aleppo, 12 people were killed by the airstrikes. There are hundreds of thousands of civilians under siege who need supplies. For the past month, nothing has entered Aleppo, so we expect that in less than a month, the supplies will run out.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/03/i-need-peace-seven-year-old-bana-tweets-her-life-in-besieged-aleppo\">'I need peace': seven-year-old Bana tweets her life in besieged Aleppo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During his time in New York, things will worsen still, and hundreds more will die. The bombing raids reach an unprecedented intensity, the regime attempts a ground invasion, and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/23/495160608/syrias-famed-white-helmets-group-says-its-being-targeted-in-new-offensive\" title=\"\">the White Helmets\u2019 bases fall under attack</a>. Yet inside the UN, Russia and the US cannot agree on how to end \u2013 or even pause \u2013 the bloodshed.</p> <p>\u201cNew York is another world,\u201d Saleh sighs. \u201cWe hear a lot of talk about peace and war and terrorism and refugees and UN convoys. But we don\u2019t see decisive actions. We don\u2019t see the political will to address the roots of the problem. And we don\u2019t understand why that is.\u201d</p> <p>On the ground, the humanitarian effort is largely left to groups of volunteers such as the White Helmets. Before the war, most of them knew little about rescuing bomb victims. Saleh himself was an electronics salesman, buying Chinese-made gadgets from wholesalers in Aleppo, and selling them in western Syria. Another man featured in the documentary, Mohamed Farah, was a tailor. Khaled, Mohamed\u2019s brother, was a&#xa0;builder.</p> <p>To begin with, these men formed disparate rescue teams, without a central command. They were united by a desire to stay out of the fighting. \u201cIt\u2019s better to do humanitarian work than to be armed,\u201d says Farah during an interview in the film. \u201cBetter to rescue a soul than to take one.\u201d</p> <p>To begin with, they were untrained, and so less effective. In 2013, not long after Saleh first joined a rescue team, they arrived at a bombsite in a market in Darkoush, north-west Syria. At least 112 people were killed. \u201cThe smell of burnt bodies was everywhere and the first responders felt like they were helpless,\u201d Saleh says. \u201cWe rescued just two or three people, and it was&#xa0;depressing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95cc6693f1309c2221d6c4272148cf72add379ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95cc6693f1309c2221d6c4272148cf72add379ff/0_106_4665_2799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raed al-Saleh during an interview in Berlin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raed al-Saleh during an interview in Berlin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bernd von Jutrczenka/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Across the border that year, Turkey began to invite different rescue teams for training, and Saleh was chosen by his colleagues as their representative. Again, it was a sobering experience. He was tasked with finding corpses in a mock-up bomb site \u2013 and found no one.</p> <p>\u201cThen the trainers turned the lights on and guided us to the people underneath the rubble in the room,\u201d says Saleh. \u201cWe were shocked. The trainers told us: this is the difference between a trained rescue worker and an untrained one, between a blind person and a person who can see. And, at that moment, we made a pledge that we had either to quit then and there, or be fully committed to learning all the required skills in order to go back and rescue our people.\u201d</p> <p>It was in the months that followed this experience that the Syrian civil defence was formed. Gradually, the different rescue teams in northern Syria began to coordinate. In 2014, they started standardising their uniform \u2013 a&#xa0;beige jumpsuit \u2013 and agreed to work as a unified entity. At a meeting of 69 different branches, Saleh was elected&#xa0;director.</p> <p>There are few reasons for hope in Syria, but the rise of the White Helmets is one of them. Over time, the rescuers have got steadily better at finding people in the rubble. When a&#xa0;series of strikes hit Darkoush last year, they rescued more than 120 people in 24 hours. One of the most uplifting scenes in the film comes when the Farah brothers spend 16 hours digging through rubble to find \u2013 against all odds \u2013 a baby boy.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know that feeling when you have a seed and it grows into a beautiful bush?\u201d asks Mohamed. \u201cThat\u2019s how we feel knowing that this baby is still alive.\u201d</p> <p>But Saleh cautions that there is often little to celebrate, and that however angelic his work seems to outsiders, it is in fact highly traumatic. \u201cSome may think what we are doing is heroic,\u201d he said during <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/darkness-and-fear-in-aleppo-as-the-bombs-rain-down/2016/09/28/07b65246-842e-11e6-b57d-dd49277af02f_story.html\" title=\"\">a recent talk in Washington</a>. \u201cBut, in fact, it is devastating and depressing beyond belief. You are pulling corpses from the rubble.

It\u2019s a ridiculous smear, says Saleh. \u201cThat\u2019s a normal reaction from the regime,\u201d he says. \u201cThe regime accuses millions of Syrians of being terrorists and extremists. For the regime, anything that emerges independently from the people is classified as an extremist organisation.\u201d</p> <p>For their supporters, the White Helmets remind us that the vast majority of Syrians aren\u2019t soldiers or jihadis, but ordinary civilians. \u201cThere are armed groups in the liberated areas, which have been formed in reaction to Bashar al-Assad\u2019s terrorism,\u201d says Muhammad Fadila, the governor of rebel-held Aleppo. \u201cBut there are also many civilians, and we have universities and hospitals and schools, administrations and directorates, a&#xa0;ministry of education, and of electricity. And the Syrian civil defence.\u201d</p> <p>Some of them, like Saleh, have the option of a more peaceful life in Turkey. But they have sacrificed their safety to protect the people left behind. \u201cAt the end of the day, this is my country,\u201d he says. \u201cIf Syrians don\u2019t help Syrians, who else will come?\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s changing.\u201d <br></p> <p>But Goyushov and others agree that the political changes feel cosmetic, merely a tactical shift aimed at securing concessions from the west. </p> <p>They say that whatever political retreat the Azerbaijani state has made is the result of the economic crisis. For the last 15 years, soaring oil prices and substantial Caspian Sea<strong> </strong>deposits had bankrolled a massive government spending spree, a windfall that helped Azerbaijan pull itself out of the catastrophe it suffered in the 1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union. </p> <p>The government thoroughly rearmed the military, held high-profile international events such as the Eurovision song contest and the first European Games, and invested in architectural prestige projects, <a href=\"http://www.rferl.org/a/azerbaijan-baku-heydar-aliyev-center-fire/24651102.html\">such as the $250m Zaha Hadid</a> building in the shape of the signature of the former president, Aliyev\u2019s father. </p> <p>But the recent oil price collapse has inflicted serious damage. Over the last year and a half the currency, the manat, has lost half its value. Baku is reportedly <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-28/imf-starts-talks-with-azerbaijan-on-possible-financial-aid\">angling for loans and bailouts from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund</a>. <br></p> <p>According to Khadija Ismayilova, an investigative reporter and the best-known of the political prisoners released this spring, the Azerbaijani government \u201cneeds money \u2026 and western institutions that can give it will probably do it conditionally\u201d \u2013 by demanding transparency and the rights of private groups to monitor them. </p> <p>\u201cThis is why the government is now trying to give more space to NGOs, but it\u2019s all an imitation.

  "<p>Meat produced from British pigs has been shown to be infected with a livestock strain of MRSA, the Guardian can reveal, raising concerns that the UK is on the brink of another food scandal.</p> <p>Tests on a sample of 97 UK-produced pork products from supermarkets show that three \u2013 sold at Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 were contaminated with the superbug strain which can cause serious health problems. </p> <p>The Guardian, working with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ), has also established that a loophole in import regulations is leaving an open door for MRSA CC398-infected live pigs from countries such as Denmark, where the disease is rife.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/18/what-is-the-superbug-la-mrsa-cc398-and-why-is-it-spreading-on-farms\">What is the superbug LA-MRSA CC398 and why is it spreading on farms?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The findings have serious implications for human health. MRSA CC398 is a potentially deadly bacteria which can be resistant to even the strongest antibiotics. It is less harmful to humans than the MRSA bug that kills about 300 people in hospitals in England and Wales each year. But it causes unpleasant persistent infections and can seriously harm people with compromised immune systems, such as those already suffering other illness.</p> <p>It is known to have been responsible for at least six deaths in Denmark, though that is likely to be the tip of the iceberg. People can contract the disease from infected meat, and from infected animals.</p> <p>The superbug, like other foodborne germs, is killed by thorough cooking - but it can be passed on through lapses in hygiene. Workers on pig farms can also catch the disease from infected animals and pass it on to other people.</p> <p>Without action to halt it, the spread of the bug could follow the pattern in Denmark, where MRSA CC398 became established over a decade, now afflicts about two-thirds of pig farms and is viewed as a major public health crisis, with 12,000 people believed to have contracted it. Currently, there is no screening programme for MRSA CC398 on British farms.</p> <p>Prof Tim Lang, of the Centre for Food Policy at City University in London, said: \u201cIf we don\u2019t have tight infection control and we don\u2019t try to control the movement of live animals, infection can spread. The British are up in arms about the movement of people, but the EU also has a large movement of animals. We need biosecurity, we need to tighten up this livestock movement. You may get cheap meat, but in the long term it\u2019s going to add to your public health problems.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Erik Millstone of Sussex University added that the emergence of antibiotic-resistant superbugs from agriculture was \u201ca huge threat to human health\u201d and that there was a clear risk that MRSA CC398 could spread among British livestock herds and to people. He anticipated that the government would downplay this risk but warned: \u201cWhile the [government] tries its customary tactics of blaming the victim, it won\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <p>The tests were carried out by Dr Mark Holmes, director of studies in clinical veterinary medicine at Churchill College, Cambridge University, and commissioned by the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics, founded by the Soil Association, Compassion in World Farming and Sustain.

It is not possible to say whether these products originally came from imported pigs, or whether UK pig herds have been infected through imports. Either way, imports are likely to be the main agent spreading the disease, as the UK\u2019s pork production has remained relatively free from MRSA CC398 until now, and the main method of spreading the disease is from animal-to-animal contact on farms.</p> <p>At least one regular Danish supplier of imported pigs to the UK was found to be contaminated with the drug-resistant bacteria in 2014, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism has established. The company \u2013Breeding Centre R\u00f8nshauge A/S \u2013 refused to say how many pigs it had exported to the UK and whether they could have been contaminated. But official export figures show that the company supplied 41 pigs to the UK in July this year, 65 in 2013 and 16 in 2012.</p> <p>But the UK government does not screen for the infection in imported animals, citing a low risk of serious illness. The main initial effect is a nasty skin infection that is disfiguring, unpleasant and highly infectious, but not fatal.</p> <p>Emma Rose, from the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics, said: \u201cIt is extremely worrying to find LA [livestock-associated]-MRSA in British-produced pork.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cScientists are now warning that the extensive MRSA reservoir in animals could ultimately lead to a pandemic spread in the human population. LA-MRSA is able to cause serious and potentially fatal infections in humans, and as the bacteria is resistant to antibiotics, it is extremely difficult to treat. What\u2019s more, even more dangerous variations are emerging as the superbug evolves.\u201d</p> <p>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: \u201cLivestock-associated MRSA is not the same as MRSA strains that can cause healthcare-associated infections and if meat is handled and prepared properly the risk to people is low. Defra and the National Pig Association recommend that pigs imported to Britain are screened for LA-MRSA.</p> <p>\u201cThe government is reviewing options for surveillance, which will be proportionate to the very low health risk posed by livestock-associated MRSA.\u201d</p> <p>Asda said:<strong> </strong>\u201cOur customers can be assured that we are working closely with industry groups and farmers to make sure that antibiotics are used responsibly in farm animals.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s told the Guardian that MRSA CC398 was \u201cvery uncommon\u201d in British pork and that it worked with farmers \u201cto ensure antibiotics are used responsibly and are taking advice from leading industry experts\u201d.</p> <p>The rise of the CC398 variant has been linked to the overuse of antibiotics in factory farming, where often cramped and dirty conditions allow disease to flourish and farmers become dependent on frequent doses of antibiotics.</p> <p>The threat from imports of live animals has been overlooked, according to experts. When animals are imported, they have to undergo screening for a variety of other diseases, but screening for MRSA CC398 is purely voluntary. As a result, there is no way of knowing how many infected animals may have been brought to Britain.</p> <p>There have been at least two confirmed cases of the disease found at UK pig farms, one of them in Northern Ireland and the other in eastern England. However, as no systematic tests are carried out on UK farms, it is impossible to know how many may harbour the bug.</p> <p>Defra does not collate statistics on the number of farm animals imported, but figures from the Danish government show the UK imported more than 3,000 breeding pigs from the country in the past six years, including 916 in 2013, 598 the following year and 283 last year.</p> <p>In the last three years, the UK food industry has been rocked with revelations from the Guardian of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/28/supermarket-chickens-contaminated-campylobacter\">campylobacter in chicken</a>, which can cause serious illness, stronger versions of salmonella with greater resistance, and of drug-resistant forms of E coli, recently found in one in four supermarket chickens, that thwart all but the strongest antibiotics. Most of the problems are thought to be down to the pressure towards factory farms producing the cheapest possible meat.</p>",

  "<p>There have been great movies about gentrification, and maybe cinema is itself a quasi-gentrification experience \u2013 creating tourist jaunts of the mind which allow audiences a short-lease habitation on attractive city locations and idealised city lives. Those places get smartened up, sentimentalised and homogenised by the camera, edited in a hundred subtle ways, their tougher neighbourhoods romanticised and repackaged as the appropriately dramatic arena for a personal journey.</p> <p>Intentionally or not, the key movie about gentrification of recent times is Mike Newell\u2019s upscale romcom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/mar/17/notting-hill-julia-roberts-richard-curtis-film-guilty-pleasure\">Notting Hill (1999)</a>, with Hugh Grant as the loveable, floppy-haired English bookstore owner who falls hopelessly for an impossibly glamorous visiting movie star, played by Julia Roberts.<br></p> <p>Grant lives in one of west London\u2019s smartest neighbourhoods, famed for its trendiness. But how about the non-white people who have lived there, and in adjoining areas such as Westbourne Park, from the 1950s onwards? It\u2019s a likable movie, but Notting Hill manages to avoid showing them or mentioning the Notting Hill carnival (despite a year-round montage explicitly showing Portobello Market) \u2013 and the area\u2019s immigrant history is actually the foundation for Notting Hill\u2019s attractive bohemian reputation. It\u2019s a very different west London from, say, the urban crime thrillers of Noel Clarke \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/aug/26/why-noel-clarkes-hood-trilogy-remains-a-vital-snapshot-of-britain\">Kidulthood, Adulthood and Brotherhood</a> \u2013 which show the lack British experience there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e0a860c6f05747ae3fadb29f585392e5c1058aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e0a860c6f05747ae3fadb29f585392e5c1058aa/863_1137_6291_3775/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Noel Clarke\u2019s Brotherhood depicted a different west London to the one seen in Notting Hill.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Noel Clarke\u2019s Brotherhood depicted a different west London to the one seen in Notting Hill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Baker Ashton/Unstoppable Entertainment</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But sometimes films have to reflect a newly gentrified reality. The Boston columnist Charlotte Wilder has <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/culture/movies/2015/11/01/boston-is-gentrifying-rapidly-so-why-do-movies-about-it-continue-to-romanticize-the-bygone-grit\">railed against</a> movies that have failed to gentrify her city. These are films like Martin Scorsese\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/08/thriller.jacknicholson\">The Departed</a>, Clint Eastwood\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,1064275,00.html\">Mystic River</a> and Ben Wheatley\u2019s forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/09/free-fire-review-ben-wheatleys-shootout-comedy-is-firing-blanks\">Free Fire</a>. Wilder was impatient with films which incessantly hark back to Boston\u2019s gritty past and stereotype the place as the unvarying location for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/23/the-town-review\">tough guys</a> with exaggerated drama-school Bawwwwston accents. Now, the neighbourhoods of those films are largely gone or changed beyond recognition; so why not make a non-crime picture about this new situation? Is there something condescending and politically correct about a failure to gentrify?</p> <p>Gentrification in cinema is bound up in class, race, sense of self \u2013 and genre. A tough realist drama does not care to gentrify, but a romcom might take things a little upscale. Perhaps the most famous speech on the subject comes from Lawrence Fishburne\u2019s character Jason \u201cFurious\u201d Styles in John Singleton\u2019s Boyz N The Hood (1991). <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2ECcFN8uqg\">He points out</a> to two African-American kids a real estate billboard in their South Central Los Angeles neighbourhood and asks them what they see: \u201cI\u2019m talking about the message. What it stands for. It\u2019s called \u2018gentrification.\u2019 It\u2019s what happens when the property value of a certain area is brought down \u2026 They can buy the land at a lower price. Then they move the people out, raise the value and sell it at a profit. What we need to do is we need to keep everything in our neighbourhood, everything, black. Black-owned with black money. Just like the Jews, the Italians, the Mexicans and the Koreans do.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2ECcFN8uqg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r2ECcFN8uqg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>That is a bold, atypically political analysis of what gentrification is. Usually, the implications of class are invisibly embedded in our generic expectations of cinema. In Paris, for example, an elegant comedy by someone like Agn\u00e8s Jaoui will bring us to the smarter <em>arrondisements</em>; but a tough social drama such as Mathieu Kassovitz\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/03/la-haine-film-sequel-20-years-on-france\">La Haine (1995)</a> or C\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/10/girlhood-gritty-teen-life-review-mark-kermode\">Girlhood (2014)</a> finds its natural home in the council estates, the <em>banlieues</em>, visiting the posher areas in order to shoplift or to transgress, to feel dramatically and importantly out of place.</p> <p>So what happens when the twain meet, when the middle classes encroach on a downmarket neighbourhood \u2013 and when gentrification starts happening? There are two generic modes here: horror and comedy. The \u201chaunted house\u201d movie is a gentrification movie. You move in to a picturesque but slightly creepy house, with all your upwardly mobile newness \u2013 only to find that the terrible spirits of the past are still around, punishing you for trespassing on their turf. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5b8548cc3256f5c4094326d2cc9c5325fe76c462\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b8548cc3256f5c4094326d2cc9c5325fe76c462/670_0_1545_1931/800.jpg\" alt=\"Heather O\u2019Rourke in Poltergeist.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heather O\u2019Rourke in Poltergeist.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Poltergeist (1982), directed by Tobe Hooper and written and produced by Steven Spielberg is about a real estate developer who lives with his family in a chi-chi planned community in California. Terrifying ghosts show up because their house was built on top of a burial ground. That\u2019ll teach them to gentrify these poor souls\u2019 last resting place.</p> <p>The other gentrification genre is satire \u2013 a satire of class and caste, sometimes dark, sometimes funny. Danny DeVito\u2019s Duplex (2003) has Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore as a yuppie New York couple who find a very attractively underpriced brownstone property in Brooklyn \u2013 the district that has now become a global byword for gentrification. But there is a sitting tenant on the apartment on the top floor: an old lady who has been there since Brooklyn was a shabby part of town that no-one liked. Sentimentally, they let her stay on, assuming she will die soon, allowing them to further develop and increase their property\u2019s value. But she toughly stays alive, the upstairs neighbour from hell, making life a misery for them.</p> <p>Ira Sachs\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/22/little-men-review-greg-kinnear-jennifer-ehle-ira-sachs\">Little Men (2016)</a> has a similar idea, though treated with more nuance: Greg Kinnear and Jennifer Ehle play a struggling actor and his wife who get lucky when they inherit a huge apartment in \u2013 where else? \u2013 Brooklyn. But Kinnear needs money and he\u2019s soon faced with having to increase the peppercorn rent they are currently charging to the family on the first floor with whom they have become friends.</p> <p>John Schlesinger\u2019s psychological thriller Pacific Heights (1990) has a similar theme, although the fancy San Francisco neighbourhood of the title needs no gentrifying. Melanie Griffith and Matthew Modine are the couple, and their tenant from hell is Michael Keaton. Again, the issues at stake are ownership and territory and the need to conceal the naked rage under the mask of civility. Perhaps the most complex \u201ceviction drama\u201d is Hal Ashby\u2019s The Landlord (1970) about a rich young guy who buys a tenement in \u2013 presciently \u2013 Brooklyn, planning to evict the tenants, but instead becomes fond of them, an emotional development replete with a kind of paternalist condescension.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"930d85a9376f0668a413d8a46b6841b8c0511d63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/930d85a9376f0668a413d8a46b6841b8c0511d63/0_210_2641_1585/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rod Steiger in Hands Over the City\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rod Steiger in Hands Over the City, \u2018a classic of top-down gentrification\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Warner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is another kind of gentrification movie: the municipal corruption thriller. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/27/favourite-film-chinatown\">Roman Polanski\u2019s Chinatown</a> (1974), set in 1920s Los Angeles, the beat-up private detective played by Jack Nicholson discovers that the city\u2019s water department is drying up land so that it can be bought up cheap. It\u2019s precisely the definition of \u201cgentrification\u201d proposed by Styles in Boyz N the Hood.</p> <p>Francesco Rosi\u2019s Hands Over the City (1962) is a classic of what you might call political or top-down gentrification: the decisions made about land by the the rich and powerful rather than the matter of the incremental inch-by-inch gentrification whereby nice middle-class people show up and start squeezing out the locals. Here Rod Steiger plays a corrupt developer who bribes city officials to let him create a huge new suburban estate . It should be a paradise for upwardly mobile, but one of his shoddy buildings collapses.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/29/gentrification-global-problem-better-solution-oliver-wainwright\">Gentrification is a global problem.

  "<p>It is one of London\u2019s grandest clubs, founded 180 years ago by a group of Whig and Radical MPs.</p> <p>Past members include prime ministers (Winston Churchill, Lloyd George), novelists (EM Forster and Henry James) and writers of detective fiction (Arthur Conan Doyle). Current members are diplomats, peers, academics, lawyers. Plus the bloke next door: the Prince of Wales.<br></p> <p>But the Reform Club in Pall Mall \u2013 once synonymous with enlightened causes \u2013 is now at the centre of a bitter internal row. It follows the election of a new chairman, Hitesh Tailor, who \u2013 ironically enough \u2013 has tried to reform the way the club is run. </p> <p>Tailor\u2019s choice of candidate for the job of club secretary has triggered a huge revolt. A group of members led by the Tory peer Richard Balfe is seeking to have the selection process rerun. They are calling for an extraordinary general meeting. They have circulated a letter to members asking for support.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe the process has been inadequate and inappropriate,\u201d Balfe writes, describing the Reform as \u201cour great club\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, several staff who keep the Grade I-listed building going have recently quit. One has blamed \u201cegotistical management\u201d and a clash over whether it is more important to carry out planned repairs or to hang paintings in the gents\u2019 toilets.<br></p> <p>The club\u2019s ruling body \u2013 the general committee or GC \u2013 is itself bitterly divided. The GC is made up of 15 members elected every year by popular ballot.</p> <p>The row began in January when members voted in Tailor as GC chairman. Tailor was elected against the convention that a chairman serves two years in the job, with his predecessor Richard Lewis voted out.</p> <p>Tailor\u2019s critics claim he is an aloof and abrasive leader. His supporters say he has merely tried to improve corporate governance practices. Those who do not like his management style are a small and vexatious bunch of \u201cchronic complainers\u201d, they add.</p> <p>Nevertheless, in August the Reform\u2019s facilities manager, Alan Hinton, became the latest staff member to quit. Hinton had overseen a huge restoration of the club\u2019s Italianate palazzo clubhouse, with the sumptuous saloon and library repainted at a cost of \u00a34m.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d526ad06b0e3f65b025733384184b70cafafa6eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d526ad06b0e3f65b025733384184b70cafafa6eb/0_179_5185_3111/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The interior of the Reform Club.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The interior of the Reform Club, which was founded 180 years ago.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a blistering letter of resignation, seen by the Guardian, Hinton said he was \u201cunhappy and disillusioned\u201d. He said he could no longer work in an environment he claimed had an \u201coverpowering, self-destructive and egotistical management structure\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a \u2018hardcore\u2019 number of members of staff who love the Reform Club, the building, the traditions and values it represents. I am not eloquent enough to put into words the pain and frustration we feel when we see petty politics tearing the club apart,\u201d he wrote. </p> <p>According to Hinton, staff morale was \u201cat an all-time low\u201d. He said he was sad to witness \u201cthe slow, painful and totally avoidable decline\u201d of an institution to which he had dedicated six years of his life now in the hands of a \u201cruling junta\u201d. His colleagues were \u201cfrustrated and scared\u201d, he said.</p> <p>Hinton declined to comment. Paul Austin, from the club\u2019s general office, said: \u201cAs a private members\u2019 club it\u2019s our policy never to discuss our internal matters with the media.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>This week\u2019s letter by Balfe claims the club has ended up paying \u201caround half a million pounds\u201d after the two previous club secretaries resigned. The last one, a former Falklands helicopter pilot, left last year on the grounds of ill health.</p> <p>The controversy concerns the selection of a replacement. An executive search company run by Richard Evans \u2013 a GC member and Tailor ally \u2013 drew up a shortlist of five candidates. An internal panel then offered the job to a retired naval officer, Lt Cmdr Rodney Craig. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Balfe and other GC members say the process lacked transparency. They want it rerun. Others say it was perfectly fair. Evans declined to comment, emailing: \u201cWe never discuss our internal matters with the media.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Tailor\u2019s name appears in the Panama Papers in connection with an offshore company, Polyver Inc, set up in 2008. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing and Tailor says he has no connection with any Panama company and no idea why he features in the leaked database. The company \u2013 set up by a friend of Tailor\u2019s who works as a Swiss lawyer \u2013 was struck off in 2012. The lawyer said he had no recollection of involving Tailor in his company at any time. It is not illegal to own offshore companies. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2a125e6f16455b0824534636468e030b53fe6f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2a125e6f16455b0824534636468e030b53fe6f9/0_140_6988_4193/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The library of the Reform Club in the 19th century.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The library of the Reform Club in the 19th century.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Reform Club was founded in 1836 and became the HQ of the new Liberal party. In keeping with its progressive traditions, in 1981 it became one of the first gentleman\u2019s clubs to admit women. These days it is not associated with any political party. Its 2,600 members pay fees of about \u00a31,500 a year.<br></p> <p>Critics claim the club\u2019s finances have been poorly managed. According to one estimate, it has lost \u00a3865,000 on catering over the past five years. Others point out the Reform is in \u201csurplus\u201d overall, and say the critics cannot read a balance sheet properly. They add that the dinners held in a splendid mahogany room offer good value for money. \u201cThe food has got better,\u201d one noted. </p> <p>This is not the first time the Reform has found itself engulfed by civil war. In 2012 a previous chairman Hugh Colver, a former Tory party spin doctor, fell out with the club secretary Michael McKerchar. McKerchar left after a six-figure payout. <br></p> <p>This war, however, appears to be particularly bitter. An anonymous letter sent to the Guardian last week, and signed \u201ca sad and angry member\u201d, alleged that the club had long suffered from a culture of bullying. A few members bullied the club\u2019s 100-strong staff, the letter claimed. This had created a \u201ctoxic atmosphere below stairs\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"944889c2683631de3e005b36fa5f5a5e98a87e9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/944889c2683631de3e005b36fa5f5a5e98a87e9c/0_0_3600_5400/667.jpg\" alt=\"The entrance to the Reform Club.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The entrance to the Reform Club.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhile the bullying culture remains rampant \u2018above stairs\u2019 and the chairman and committee refuses to tackle it, the club is a pretty grim place to be,\u201d the letter alleged.</p> <p> \u201cIt is ironic that a place which was founded in the spirit of Reform, promotes equality and makes a new members pledge to \u2018uphold the principles of Reform\u201d is sadly lacking in reforming zeal when it comes to handling workplace relations.</p> <p>\u201cPall Mall is back in the dark ages!\u201d</p> <p>News of the Reform\u2019s woes were \u201cnow spreading through Clubland\u201d, the letter claimed. The management\u2019s priorities were \u201centertaining celebrity guests, organising balls and dinners\u201d and \u201cspending the members\u2019 money on buying quasi-historic artefacts\u201d, it said.</p> <p>Supporters of the current management have rubbished the letter\u2019s claims. They say Tailor has brought in a new rule allowing staff to complain about members. Previously, this was deemed unnecessary on the grounds that all members were gentlemen. </p> <p>Other members, however, said they were unaware of any disputes inside the club. One said he had joined because of the Reform\u2019s \u201cexcellent library\u201d and for the chance to mingle with fellow professionals. The Reform is home to ex-politicians including Roy Hattersley, Betty Boothroyd and the former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell.<br></p> <p>The club was trying hard to attract younger people, the member said. The price of wine had gone up after members \u201cdrank the old stock\u201d, he said. Overall, he added, the Reform offered a positive experience in \u201cone of the most splendid buildings\u201d of any West End club. </p> <p>Another longstanding member said: \u201cThe Reform is not an old gentleman\u2019s club where you have a bottle of claret at lunch and fall asleep in the afternoon under a copy of the Times. Despite the current difficulties and backbiting, it has a hugely impressive list of social events and societies.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>For Jamie Oliver, a man used to politicians beating a path to his door, it must have been a rude awakening. Not only did Theresa May\u2019s new administration<strong> </strong>delete all the juiciest bits from the child obesity strategy<strong> </strong>he had championed, but when the celebrity chef protested, the door unceremoniously shut in his face. \u201cHer people have locked down all communications,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-09-23/jamie-oliver-ive-nothing-nice-to-say-to-theresa-may\">Oliver plaintively told the Radio Times</a>.</p> <p>If it is any consolation, much of Westminster knows the feeling. There are, says one regular visitor, \u201csome seriously good people in there\u201d, but the new No 10 operation is rolling down the shutters.</p> <p>The days of kitchen suppers, old-school ties and being godparents to each other\u2019s children are over, with Downing Street briskly emptied of Cameron\u2019s \u201cchums\u201d. But May is building an inner circle in some ways equally closed to those who don\u2019t have the prime minister\u2019s trust. It is just that, in May\u2019s case, trust tends to be forged professionally, whereas, for Cameron, it often stemmed from friendships dating back to Eton or Oxford. That may have seemed normal to Cameron, having grown up in the kind of upper-middle-class English circle where everyone seemingly knows everyone, but it certainly isn\u2019t to May\u2019s people.</p> <p>The new tribe is more practical, more provincial \u2013 rooted in Birmingham and Bexley, not Notting Hill and Chipping Norton \u2013 and markedly less posh, bonding as beleaguered young party workers in the Tory wilderness years rather than at jolly country house weddings. (Even their salaries are said to have been capped at relatively frugal levels, and far from looking forward to OBEs, one insider jokes that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/06/why-has-david-camerons-honours-list-caused-such-a-fuss\">the fuss over Cameron\u2019s resignation honours list</a> means they will probably be \u201clucky to get a cup of tea and a biscuit\u201d when they leave.) The overall vibe is distinctively more \u201cdoers\u201d than schmoozers. What is intriguing is how far their personal experiences overlap with May\u2019s political agenda of focusing on what she calls the \u201cjust managing\u201d \u2013 people who are working but not wealthy, who know how it feels to be on the outside of well-connected and comfortable elites, and are drawn to meritocratic ideas.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.totalpolitics.com/articles/news/pr-boss-katie-perrior-theresa-mays-top-spin-doctor\">Katie Perrior</a>, Downing Street\u2019s new director of communications, is a case in point. When she began working as May\u2019s press officer in the early 00s, Tory offices were still filled with faintly Sloaney \u201cgirls in pearls\u201d; with her south London accent and down-to-earth manner, Perrior stood out from the start. But though she may have orgnised raucous karaoke nights at party conferences, woe betide anyone who understimates her serious side. She served as a Tory councillor in suburban south London in her spare time, and nine years ago started up her own PR business with fellow Tory aide Jo Tanner. (Ignoring warnings from male rivals in a cut-throat industry that \u201cyou girls\u201d would flounder, they promptly bagged a contract for Boris Johnson\u2019s 2008 mayoral campaign, giving her a useful inside track to the now foreign secretary).</p> <p>Perrior\u2019s appointment is a sign of May\u2019s emphasis on proven practical skills but, crucially, also on loyalty, given that she is one of several longstanding allies who dropped everything at short notice in June to help with May\u2019s leadership campaign. But it is the very devotion of the prime minister\u2019s inner circle that makes some uneasy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3967db7218e3049ad20aafde0479ab66068d9ad9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3967db7218e3049ad20aafde0479ab66068d9ad9/0_0_2123_1428/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fiona Hill, joint chief of staff, seemingly a key confidante when May has to make a decision.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fiona Hill, joint chief of staff, seemingly a key confidante when May has to make a decision.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Back/Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Power in the new regime is centralised in the hands of May\u2019s formidable joint chiefs of staff, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/15/may-appoints-former-advisers-as-joint-chiefs-of-staff\">Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill</a>, both famed for being, as one ex-colleague puts it, \u201chard as nails\u201d in ensuring her writ runs across Whitehall. Everything is funnelled through them and directions then come back down from the top, a change from Cameron\u2019s more open style, according to one former staffer: \u201cHe\u2019d ask us for ideas. He\u2019d say to the policy unit: \u2018This is the problem. What are we going to do?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The pair are also overseeing a systematic review of policy decisions across government, methodically stripping everything back to the bones. \u201cWhat people in government are saying is that it\u2019s almost like a change of government, having to go back to basics and take people through stuff,\u201d says Jill Rutter, programme director at the thinktank <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/\">Institute for Government</a>. \u201cEverything is being radically re-examined from first principles.\u201d</p> <p>It is the way May has always operated \u2013 Timothy and Hill were meticulous in spotting potential elephant traps at the Home Office, where they both worked for her, along with their deputy Jo Penn and deputy head of the policy unit Will Tanner \u2013 and arguably closer to the way things worked under Thatcher and Major. But there are ripples of alarm about the power it places in Timothy\u2019s hands particularly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c707f38c8cf62b5fca9f8314b6dca2d125454c84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c707f38c8cf62b5fca9f8314b6dca2d125454c84/0_167_1908_1144/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joint chief of staff Nick Timothy, the primer mover in bringing back the 11-plus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joint chief of staff Nick Timothy, the primer mover in bringing back the 11-plus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nicknamed \u201cRasputin\u201d, the bearded steelworker\u2019s son has been identified as the prime mover in decisions from pausing the Hinkley Point power plant deal to bringing back the 11-plus. (A grammar school boy from Birmingham, he joined the Tories as a teenager after realising Labour opposed selection.) Crucially, he was also for leave in the EU referendum and, along with press secretary Lizzie Loudon \u2013 a former special adviser to Iain Duncan Smith, who joined No 10 from the leave campaign \u2013 brings an understanding of outers to discussions about Brexit.</p> <p>Hill, a serious-minded and ferociously hardworking ex-Sky News producer who grew up in Scotland, attracts less controversy, but her fingerprints were also evident in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/19/theresa-may-resists-calls-uk-accept-syrian-refugees-aid\">May\u2019s speech earlier this month on modern slavery</a>; Hill encouraged May to take up the issue at the Home Office, and then produced her own report on the issue for thinktank Centre for Social Justice before coming into Downing Street.</p> <p>The word in Whitehall is that May won\u2019t make decisions in front of officials but, instead, says one source, \u201cgoes away for an hour with Nick and Fiona and \u2013 boing! \u2013 a decision is made. Which is exactly like Gordon Brown. He\u2019d go away, and we all assumed Ed [Balls] then told him what to do.\u201d That may not be strictly fair, but the relationship between the three of them is certainly critical to everything May does.</p> <p>The other change that has set tongues wagging is the diminished influence of the Treasury. Only one key member of George Osborne\u2019s camp, special adviser Neil O\u2019Brien, made the leap to the new Downing Street team and, unlike Osborne, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, isn\u2019t invited to the agenda-setting daily morning meeting in No 10. As Rutter, herself a former Downing Street civil servant, points out, that is arguably just a return to the historic norm after years of unusually equal partnership between Cameron and Osborne.</p> <p>But May\u2019s preference for smaller, tighter, more formal circles of decision-making perhaps also reflects her personality. Cameron was a social animal, happy mixing personal with professional, and liked to chew both over with Osborne at the beginning and end of his working day. Tony Blair was relaxed enough to take briefings as he was changing between engagements, hopping around in his underpants while his aides reeled off bullet points.</p> <p>May, however, is reserved to the point of shyness, and likes to keep things businesslike. The nearest thing she has to an old chum in cabinet is the work and pensions secretary Damian Green, an Oxford contemporary whose wife Alicia was her student supervision partner, but even he had to earn his cabinet job on merit. Education secretary Justine Greening and home secretary Amber Rudd are both also personal allies, but that didn\u2019t stop May putting Greening \u2013 a proud comprehensive schoolgirl, leading a Department for Education that has until now been highly resistant to selection \u2013 in a difficult position over grammar schools. There is a brisk professionalism to this regime that comes from the top.</p> <p>Crucially, it\u2019s also a team forged in adversity. Hill, Timothy, Perrior and several other No 10 advisers earned their spurs as junior staffers under Duncan Smith at a time of civil war within the party; John Godfrey, the new director of the policy unit, was an unsuccessful parliamentary candidate in Scotland in the early 90s, hardly the easiest time or place to be a Tory. While many of Cameron\u2019s staff came on board in sunnier times, this lot are battle-hardened and their interests tend towards the gritty.</p> <p>Timothy\u2019s passion is industrial strategy, Godfrey specialises in pensions, housing and longterm care \u2013 while one of few survivors from the Cameron era, special adviser Sheridan Westlake, who famously persuaded Eric Pickles to focus on the unglamorous issues that suburban voters cared about, such as <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2395167/Eric-Pickles-calls-spaces-stop-wheelie-bins-cluttering-streets.html\">the Daily Mail obsession with wheelie bins</a>.</p> <p>While the Cameroons\u2019 house journal was the comfortably establishment Times, anxious Mail readers \u2013 more suburban than urban, less financially comfortable, more anxious and insecure about the future \u2013 are now setting the agenda.</p> <p>May gets on well personally with the paper\u2019s editor-in-chief, Paul Dacre, and often chooses the Mail on Sunday\u2019s political editor, Simon Walters, for interviews; she took Liz Sanderson, a former Mail on Sunday features writer turned special adviser, into No 10 where her job is to promote the prime minister\u2019s agenda via features pages and magazines not read by political junkies. That won\u2019t, however, mean opening up her jealously guarded private life. Unlike Samantha Cameron, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/12/philip-may-theresa-may-quiet-husband-city-experience\">May\u2019s financier husband, Philip</a>, is still working full time, and will be a supportive but largely invisible background presence. There is little chance of cameras being allowed into their private Downing Street flat \u2013 as happened when <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/samantha-cameron-s-dream-kitchen-is-the-lure-at-flat-next-door-to-no-10-a3293781.html\">Angela Merkel and Michelle Obama were photographed on Cameron\u2019s mustard-yellow sofa</a> \u2013 and the new regime is generally warier of the media. While Cameron counted journalists among his personal friends, May keeps them firmly at arm\u2019s length and expects her intimates to do the same. Even the celebrity count at No 10 functions or dinners at Chequers is likely to be lower, with a beady eye on the cost to taxpayers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"914ed61fe36ccc5810097814f5a54c79026bc7a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/914ed61fe36ccc5810097814f5a54c79026bc7a3/0_228_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michelle Obama was invited for tea with Samantha Cameron No 11 \u2013 not the sort of photo opportunity that Theresa May is likely to repeat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michelle Obama was invited for tea with Samantha Cameron at No 11 \u2013 not the sort of photo opportunity that Theresa May is likely to repeat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And if the new Downing Street doesn\u2019t exactly sound like a barrel of laughs \u2013 well, as Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said when backing May for leader, these are serious times for serious people.

But after a summer of rebelliously cultivating beards (yes, that means you, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/aug/17/stylewatch-michael-gove-beard\">Michael Gove</a> and Ed Vaizey) and licking their wounds, the defeated Cameroons are starting to get back down to business.</p> <p>For some, that simply means getting their side of the story out. First, and suspiciously fast, off the blocks was former No 10 spin doctor Craig Oliver, with a book accusing Theresa May of repeatedly finding so many excuses to get out of campaigning publicly for remain that in Downing Street she was known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/25/brexit-books-david-cameron-theresa-may-party-split\">\u201csubmarine May\u201d</a>. Cameroon fingerprints are also evident in Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman\u2019s All Out War, in which unnamed sources accuse \u201clily-livered\u201d May of having privately counselled against pushing for tougher curbs on EU immigration at the last minute, claims denied by her camp. Ken Clarke, who sparred memorably and sometimes publicly with May in cabinet, also has a potentially awkward memoir out shortly \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/20/david-cameron-perfect-political-memoir-more-indiscretion-less-spin\">while Cameron is still negotiating a deal for his</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f876f311134f0ab9f5096e3c82905d10ffe4def\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f876f311134f0ab9f5096e3c82905d10ffe4def/0_376_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ken Clarke, whose potentially awkward memoir will be out shortly\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ken Clarke, whose potentially awkward memoir will be out shortly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it is in parliament, not publishing, that the real battle looms. May\u2019s strategy of methodically reviewing almost every big decision made by Cameron, suggesting she plans a cleaner break with the past than expected, has galvanised his old set to defend what they see as his legacy.</p> <p>If nothing else, the referendum seems to have taught Cameroons of the importance of trying to build \u2013 or at least appear to build \u2013 popular grassroots movements behind them. Hence <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/15/george-osborne-launches-northern-powerhouse-thinktank-with-suppo/\">the thinktank George Osborne has just launched</a>, devoted to galvanising public support for his \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d, a project viewed with some scepticism in the May camp. (Westminster is watching with interest the relationship between Downing Street special adviser Neil O\u2019Brien \u2013 a former aide to Osborne who helped devise the initiative \u2013 and May\u2019s chief of staff Nick Timothy, also keen to grow the economy beyond London but said to have doubts about focusing everything on the northwest).</p> <p>The former chancellor\u2019s speech in Chicago last week, warning that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/23/george-osborne-brexit-won-majority-hard-brexit-did-not\">Britain voted for Brexit but not for a \u201chard Brexit\u201d</a> \u2013 in other words, that there\u2019s no mandate for leaving the single market \u2013 was another warning shot.

  "<p>Looking back on the decade he spent supporting development in Palestine, Dave Harden says the challenge was \u201cgetting people past the psychological barrier\u201d. </p> <p>Harden joined USAid\u2019s West Bank and Gaza mission in 2006 as its deputy head, before becoming its leader in 2013. It was a time of <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/7/16/5904691/hamas-israel-gaza-11-things\">particular tension</a> \u2013 in 2005, the Israelis had pulled out of occupying the Gaza strip, withdrawing their troops along with 10,000 settlers.

Their refusal to recognise Israel as a state, and a civil war with the Fatah party, led to Hamas governing Gaza and Fatah controlling the West Bank. A blockade of Gaza by Israel soon followed, as did three conflicts, three new peace envoys and Congress freezing <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/usaid\">USAid</a> funding temporarily in 2011, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/01/us-congress-blocks-aid-palestinians\">reportedly because of the Palestinians\u2019 appeal to the United Nations for statehood</a>. </p> <p>All of this only intensified <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiEoZbOkY_PAhXhBsAKHTK5AyEQFggkMAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ochaopt.org%2Fdocuments%2Fhno_december29_final.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNFMkTDfnKWMZ5r6BVwUU-xgChpZWQ&amp;sig2=P8pgpBZReKmvuR2iTqInwQ\">a longstanding political and humanitarian crisis</a> [pdf] across the Palestinian territories.

He will leave some big shoes to fill \u2013 Paul Skoczylas, former deputy director of the <a href=\"http://www.wfp.org/\">World Food Programme</a>\u2019s (WFP) Palestine mission, says he cannot imagine USAid without Harden, \u201cwho had this boundless optimism in an endlessly challenging situation\u201d.</p> <p>For Harden, the agency\u2019s success has come down to the creation of longstanding trust between his staff, Israel and Palestinian leaders and the people controlling the purse strings back in the US.</p> <p>\u201cBuilding relationships with both sides, and listening to your local staff who have lived their whole lives in this community would definitely be my advice for whoever\u2019s in my role next,\u201d he says. </p> <p>Persuading people to put their trust in USAid was more difficult in some areas than others. \u201cThe toughest [part of my work] was definitely Gaza,\u201d says Harden, describing how three conflicts in a decade made it difficult to find practical solutions that worked for everyone. USAid projects there were strictly vetted, and no money could go to groups that had any Hamas connections.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"52b09e96c3fa12bf8c3d5cc070453c8b3c21c1c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52b09e96c3fa12bf8c3d5cc070453c8b3c21c1c0/0_284_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Palestinian boy looks up during a rain storm while walking through a neighbourhood destroyed\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gaza experienced three wars in 10 years, which made it difficult to organise effective development work.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mahmud Hams/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe were unable to do all we wanted on water or power issues [while I was in charge] but in the future I do think there are opportunities for the development sector in Gaza to improve trade, agriculture, fishing.\u201d</p> <p>Skoczylas says it was USAid\u2019s pace of response that set them apart from others in the region. \u201cOne thing I remember fondly about USAid\u2019s work is how well they supported people during the 2014 war. They got us the money we needed to provide food supplies at an incredible speed,\u201d he says.</p> <h2>Overcoming psychological barriers</h2> <p>While all aid workers are used to continuously advocating for more funding, few international causes are as politically divisive for Americans as the Israel-Palestine conflict. But Harden is pragmatic about the possibility of losing funding again, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinians-usa-aid-idUSTRE79336920111004\">as happened in 2011 when Congress blocked aid</a>, and makes provisions by putting funds aside a year in advance to pay staff wages. </p> <p>\u201cI probably went back [to the US] quarterly, which is unusual for a mission director,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut at the end of the day, I really wanted these people to see that I wasn\u2019t trying to wade into the top five Israeli/Palestinian tension points, I was just trying to get practical things done \u2013 like access to water, infrastructure.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36b6821ff66fcf2d257d0935c51491d318b31910\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36b6821ff66fcf2d257d0935c51491d318b31910/0_27_620_372/500.jpg\" alt=\"Palestinian farmers harvest cucumbers in their land in the West Bank city of Jenin\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Palestinian farmers harvest cucumbers on their land in the West Bank city of Jenin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saif Dahlah/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The transformation of Jenin in the West Bank is what Harden considers his biggest success. A city once known as a centre for suicide bombers <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-jenin-once-the-suicide-bomber-capital-a-fragile-transformation/\">became a thriving business and tourism hub</a>, and now attracts Israeli-Arabs for weekend shopping sprees. This transformation was possible in part because a trade corridor between Jenin and Israel was opened by USAid and partners. It was not the sexiest sounding development project, but it garnered support because the benefits for both groups were clear. </p> <p>Part of the challenge was persuading Palestinians and Israelis to let cars cross the border. \u201cJenin was such a no-go area, that while one group wanted to let 150 cars in a day, others were worried border guards would struggle to cope with more than 10, so at first we took cars out of the equation all together.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/11/israel-some-ngos-are-seen-as-the-enemy-from-the-inside\">Israel: 'Some NGOs are seen as the enemy from the inside'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead, a consensus was agreed to pass containers of goods through high-tech mobile scanners for contraband \u2013 part of a $10m (\u00a37.7m) USAid investment \u2013 which would facilitate trade in a faster, more predictable way. When this worked, the corridor was opened to 75 Israeli-Arab cars a day, and soon after many more \u2013 an estimated one million cars crossed in 2014. The impact has been impressive. Harden estimates the city has been given a <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/4d0a6af7fefd41abb582c13b021b6765/helping-palestinians-was-uphill-battle-us-aid-chief\">$230m economic boost</a> and unemployment is down from <a href=\"https://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ochahu0405_en.pdf\">36%</a> [pdf] to <a href=\"http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_Rainbow/Documents/unemployment-2015-02e.htm\">16%</a>.</p> <p> \u201cWhat stands out for me [about this project] is that this wasn\u2019t a typical example of development work,\u201d says Harden. \u201cWe weren\u2019t doing jobs training or private sector growth but people got behind it. They understood we wanted to provide consistency for the Palestinian business community and provide security to the Israelis so products could be exported to Israel and beyond.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <h2>Can effective development work ever be non-political?</h2> <p>Not everyone feels the agency went the right way about achieving effective development in the region, however. Mohanad Berekdar, director of <a href=\"http://www.aidwatch.ps/\">Aid Watch Palestine</a>, believes the agency\u2019s strict vetting procedures regarding Hamas connections, which can extend down to beneficiary level, and conditional funding policy have created social fragmentation in Palestinian society. </p> <p>\u201cUSAid controls political life in Palestine through who it funds and who it doesn\u2019t \u2013 today they are one of the biggest donors to the Palestinian Authority but not to civil society organisations,\u201d says Berekdar, whose organisation focuses on making international aid more accountable to Palestinians. </p> <p>He says that a number of people still resent how USAid responded to the election of Hamas in 2006. While they weren\u2019t the only aid agency to cut funding to the Palestinian Authority in the immediate aftermath, \u201cmany Palestinians felt they were being punished for voting for Hamas even though one of the things USAid prides itself on is promoting democracy\u201d says Berekdar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c069a73904523fa70038ba8f29f1b45b86a7623e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c069a73904523fa70038ba8f29f1b45b86a7623e/0_41_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Smiling Palestinian child on a billboard above a road\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">USAid advertised to improve America\u2019s negative image in Palestine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nasser Nasser/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When asked what Harden\u2019s successor could do improve relationships with Palestinian civil society and have a greater impact, Berekdar can only see one way forward \u2013 for the US to pressure Israel to end the occupation.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult for Palestinians to separate America\u2019s support for Israel and USAid\u2019s work in Palestine,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe see them as different hands of the same body. Every few years the US government gives <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/09/united-states-israel-memorandum-of-understanding-military-aid/500192/\">billions of dollars to Israel</a>, but Israel is the root cause of Palestine\u2019s problems,\u201d he says. \u201cUSAid\u2019s funding to the Palestinian Authority is then seen as stabilising the situation \u2013 which is occupation \u2013 rather than improving it.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p>That is easier said than done, and after years playing master diplomat between the Israelis, Palestinians and Americans sceptical about USAid\u2019s work, Harden is convinced the best route forward for effective development is rather to show how aid workers can solve real problems without getting entangled in major political questions.</p> <p>\u201cI put my heart and soul into this job for a very long time and it\u2019s not about solving the world\u2019s problems but people\u2019s daily ones,\u201d Harden says. \u201cI remember when we got water access for this Bedouin village in the north, it\u2019s not a big thing USAid will be remembered for, but I had a 75-year-old lady come up to me and say I\u2019ve lived here my entire life and until today we never had water.

Despite their enthusiam for a new political heroine, they were just as concerned about how she will realise her (and their) ambitions.</p> <p>The Telegraph, while moved by May\u2019s \u201cstirring and patriotic speech\u201d wondered how she will rise to \u201cthe political challenge that lies ahead.\u201d It said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cMrs May said she wanted the \u2018right deal\u2019 for Britain. But there are fundamental differences of opinion over what that constitutes, not just in parliament but in her own party...</p> <p>The deep divisions exposed by the referendum are reflected among Conservatives just as they are in the country at large. </p> <p>Mrs May\u2019s task is to chart a course between the two extremes and find a way through that both holds her party together and benefits the country, while retaining a good relationship with Europe. It is a monumental task that has only just begun.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The Times thought May \u201cshort on specifics\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/comment/no-soft-option-n97ztr02w\">demonstrating \u201cthe risk at the heart of negotiations for Brexit\u201d.</a> It urged the prime minister to \u201cacknowledge that many of the regulations that currently apply as a result of membership are helpful for commerce\u201d and EU membership \u201cconfers economic benefits.\u201d</p> <p>It was unimpressed with her \u201cso-called Great Repeal Act\u201d, arguing that \u201cit is simply not correct for Mrs May to have claimed that this legislation will make Britain a \u2018sovereign and independent country\u2019 again.\u201d</p> <p>The paper also said: \u201cThe idea that there are no costs at all in Brexit and that the benefits of membership may be retained is... false and irresponsible.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian was, if anything, slightly softer on the prime minister. It noted that May has still failed to detail what Brexit means, but argued that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/02/the-guardian-view-on-the-tories-and-brexit-may-still-does-not-know-her-goal\">\u201cshe did enough to be going on with.\u201d</a></p> <p>While accepting that \u201cthis is still a largely symbolic stage of the process\u201d, the paper thought it \u201ca very dispiriting spectacle to anyone who wants the terms of Britain\u2019s departure from the EU to contain some recognition that 48% of the electorate rejected the proposition altogether.\u201d </p> <p>The Independent believed May\u2019s speech indicated <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/theresa-may-s-timetable-for-article-50-won-t-allay-brexit-concerns-a7341636.html\">\u201cshe may be preparing for a hard Brexit\u201d</a> and, if so, \u201cjitters will run through the Europhile wing of the Conservative party quicker than you can say Liam Fox.\u201d</p> <p>It said: \u201cIt is incumbent on the prime minister therefore to provide a clearer sense of what Brexit will look like... Only then can the British people work out whether the government is exceeding the mandate it was given.\u201d</p> <p>The Financial Times was encouraged by May having <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9968043e-88c3-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731\">\u201cprovided much-needed clarity.\u201d </a>Even so, her \u201cspeech still leaves plenty of options open\u201d which \u201cmay not please business, which has been desperate for [Brexit] details\u201d.</p> <p>But the FT is clearly worried: \u201cSignificant questions... remain about the economic impact... Her speech was predictably heavy on patriotic emotion and light on strategy.\u201d</p> <p>The Mail wasn\u2019t so concerned about that, praising May for giving \u201cBritain a date with destiny\u201d and \u201claying out an inspiring vision of Britain\u2019s future after we become an independent sovereign country once more.\u201d</p> <p>It said: \u201cThere is to be no backsliding, no quibbling and no shabby \u2018Brexit-lite\u2019 sellout.\u201d But it also realise that May \u201cshould be under no illusion about the vast scale of the task ahead\u201d, not least from \u201cmany embittered Remainers who still want to subvert the will of the people.\u201d The Mail continued:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cThese contemptible wreckers are in total denial about the referendum result.

By discarding his timepiece, Wyatt is seeking the ultimate temporal freedom.</p> <p>It is a goal with which Simon Garfield sympathises. As he makes clear in this intriguing investigation of our obsession with timekeeping, we have become slaves to the watch and the calendar. \u201cTime, once passive, is now aggressive,\u201d he tells us. \u201cIt dominates our lives in ways that the earliest clockmakers would have surely found unbearable.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Consider our enjoyment of music. Great works seem timeless but are constrained tightly by our chronological capacities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Indeed, we have become so obsessed with keeping to deadlines, the word \u201ctime\u201d is now the most commonly used noun in the English language according to the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>. (\u201cYear\u201d and \u201cday\u201d are also in the top five, further underlining our fetish for keeping to schedules.) Similarly, phrases like \u201clast time\u201d, \u201creading time\u201d and \u201cquality time\u201d pepper our speech. \u201cIt leaves us in no doubt about time\u2019s unassailable presence in our lives,\u201d states Garfield.</p> <p>This point was made even more forcibly by comedian Dave Allen, who triggered hundreds of complaint calls with this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVT2Xi1kwx0\">television diatribe about time</a>. \u201cYou clock in to the clock. You clock out to the clock. You come home to the clock. You eat to the clock, you drink to the clock, you go to bed to the clock\u2026 You do that for 40 years of your life, you retire, what do they fucking give you? A clock!\u201d</p> <p>Garfield\u2019s <em>Timekeepers</em> has two simple intentions, he tells us: \u201cTo tell some illuminating stories and to ask whether we have all gone completely nuts\u201d. This latter question is a fair one. We live in a world in which digital clocks are fitted for free on our phones, computers and domestic devices. Yet there are individuals \u2013 most of them overachieving men, says Garfield \u2013 who are only too willing to shell out hundreds of thousands of pounds on watches made by Mont Blanc, TAG Heuer, IWC and the like. Some of these horological masterpieces are crusted in diamonds. Others have dials made from fossil bones. All are marketed with incredible sophistication. However, when displayed in shops, nearly all these timepieces are set at around 10 past 10. \u201cWhy? Because a watch set at 10.10 appears to be \u2018smiling\u2019,\u201d says Garfield. Subtle isn\u2019t the word.</p> <p>Or consider our enjoyment of music. Great works may seem timeless but they are constrained tightly by our chronological capacities. Last century, two key technologies dictated how we enjoyed our music: the 7in, 45rpm vinyl single and later the compact disc. The trouble with the earliest singles was that if you wanted to record more than about three minutes to a side, the grooves had to be wound so tight that the needle would skip. Thus popular music was limited to the 180-second pop song. (Later, with advances in technology, the likes of Bob Dylan and Don McLean would release six-minute epics while the arrival of the 33rpm LP allowed the dubious delights of 30-minute offerings by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-Aip-gJjlo\">Pink Floyd</a> and Mike Oldfield.)</p> <p>Then came the CD. Philips had designed a disc that would replace old scratchy vinyl and could be operated remotely. They sought a deal with Sony whose vice-chairman Norio Ohga was enthusiastic but \u2013 according to rumour \u2013 only agreed once the basic disc was increased from 11.5 to 12cm. The reason? To allow Ohga\u2019s favourite recording of Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony \u2013 which had a length of 74 minutes \u2013 to fit on one disc. The 12cm disc then became a global standard.</p> <p>It is all enjoyable fare. Garfield is an engaging writer who has stuffed <em>Timekeepers</em> with some fascinating material. Sometimes he strays from his topic \u2013 Prince Charles\u2019s Poundbury estate and the joys of slow food are rather unwelcome intrusions \u2013 but the overall impact is thoroughly enjoyable and illuminating. Timely, you could even say.</p> <p><em>Timekeepers is published by Canongate (\u00a316.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/timekeepers-429748.html\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a313.93</em></a><em> </em></p>",

Among this group, even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/sep/28/new-mit-app-check-if-your-car-meets-climate-targets\">positive climate stories</a> are often <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/9/28/13080498/tool-cars-climate\">viewed through a lens of pessimism</a>, and we often see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/06/global-warming-target-miss-scientists-warn\">stories about the likelihood that we\u2019ll miss climate targets</a>.</p> <p>However, it\u2019s important to acknowledge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/dec/14/the-paris-agreement-signals-that-deniers-have-lost-the-climate-wars\">the progress that\u2019s being made</a>, and retain a sense of hope and optimism that we can still avoid the worst climate consequences. This new DOE report highlights the fact that clean energy technology is quickly moving in the right direction, toward lower costs and higher deployment.<br></p> <h2><strong>Wind energy is blowing away expectations</strong></h2> <p>The report finds that due to its low cost, US wind energy capacity has nearly tripled since 2008. Wind now supplies nearly 5% of total US electricity generation. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed99df783b3c17775794af8264a44fe72b008ba4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed99df783b3c17775794af8264a44fe72b008ba4/0_0_1131_693/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wind cost and cumulative installed capacity in the USA.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"613\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wind cost and cumulative installed capacity in the USA.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: US Department of Energy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a result, there are now nearly 90,000 U.S. manufacturing, construction, and wind operations jobs.

The longer blades allow each turbine to capture more energy, and taller towers </em><em>allow access to the stronger and more consistent wind speeds that occur at higher altitudes in many parts of the </em><em>country. </em><em>Combined, these innovations allow each turbine to produce more electricity, reducing both the number of </em><em>turbines needed to produce a given amount of electricity and the land area needed for their installation.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Offshore wind also presents tremendous untapped potential, with the first such project <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/23/science/americas-first-offshore-wind-farm-may-power-up-a-new-industry.html\">set to begin generating power</a> off the cost of Rhode Island this month.

While solar still accounts for a relatively small percentage of overall US electricity generation, its deployment has been increasing rapidly as costs have dropped.

  "<p>Being creative in today\u2019s fast-moving, tech-driven world requires a particular set of skills that goes beyond fact-based learning: problem-solving; creative thinking; and the ability to experiment, fail and try again. The UK\u2019s creative industries \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/26/creative-industries-84bn-uk-economy-film-television-radio\">which are worth about \u00a384.1bn a year, and grew by 8.9% in 2014</a> \u2013 need these skills. </p> <p>But is our education system set up to deliver innovation and creativity in this rapidly expanding and fast-moving sector? If not, why not? And how can it help to meet those needs? These were the questions under discussion in a roundtable debate hosted by the Guardian and sponsored by the <a href=\"http://www.marketingagencies.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marketing Agencies Association (MAA)</a>. </p> <p>Chair Janet Murray kicked off the discussion by asking: how is the education system shaping the future of creativity? </p> <h2>The curriculum</h2> <p>Jose Chambers, development fellow at the <a href=\"http://theideascollege.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ideas College</a>, said: \u201cThe system has been engineered to be diverse on the back of the notion of choice. But the choice is limited, depending on where you live, who you are, and who your parents are.\u201d </p> <p>She suggested <a href=\"https://studioschoolstrust.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u201cstudio\u201d schools</a> could serve the creative industries well. This is a new type of school for 14-19 year olds, with close ties to local employers, providing vocational and traditional educaton. \u201cThe <a href=\"http://www.jcbacademy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">JCB Academy</a>, for example, is in a small village in Staffordshire. It offers all kinds of opportunities to people who want to become engineers. But you won\u2019t be able to go there unless you live in bussing distance.\u201d Few of the employers present had even heard that such things as studio schools existed. </p> <p>What about the curriculum? Creative subjects are being devalued, said teacher and author Phil Beadle. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/05/michael-gove-baccalaureate-gcse\">In 2010, the then education secretary Michael Gove introduced the English Baccalaureate</a> (Ebacc), a way of measuring school performance. It measures how many key stage 4 pupils achieved a grade C or above in the \u201ccore\u201d academic subjects: English, maths, history, geography, the sciences and a language. Beadle believes this has helped to create a \u201ctwo-tier\u201d system of knowledge, in which subjects such as sociology, music, design and drama are designated as \u201csoft subjects\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cAll the creative aspects of the curriculum are now classed as second division and are no longer approved knowledge for working class children,\u201d said Beadle. \u201cThere is an active drive in policy against kids at the bottom end of society being given access to the arts.\u201d</p> <p>A disconnect emerged between education policy and what creative employers actually look for. As Chambers pointed out: \u201cEducation is industrialising just as industry is de-industrialising.\u201d Testing, \u201crigour\u201d and a drive towards qualifications and results are a big part of today\u2019s education policy \u2013 yet few of the employers present ultimately rely on CVs or qualifications to choose staff. </p> <p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m recruiting, I don\u2019t look at where applicants have been to school but how they think, and how they demonstrate that thinking,\u201d said James Hurst, executive strategic creative director at the <a href=\"https://www.wearedesignstudio.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Design Studio</a>. Paul Jordan, executive creative director of <a href=\"http://www.mcgarrybowen.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">McGarryBowen</a>, agreed. \u201cNot only am I not interested in A-levels, I don\u2019t know whether they have degrees or not. I look for heart, passion, an entrepreneurial bent \u2013 I don\u2019t think these things are taught.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We need to encourage and celebrate failure, experimenting and getting things wrong</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Richard Pinder, European CEO at <a href=\"http://www.cpbgroup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crispin Porter and Bogusky</a> and MAA board member, found the Ebacc approach mystifying when compared with other countries\u2019 plans. \u201cSingapore, for example, has had a huge push for creativity in the past 10 years, but the UK is going the opposite way. We have one of the highest percentages of GDP for creative industries \u2013 we celebrate the people who break through. But virtually everything I have read in the past five years [indicates that] the government is obsessed with the opposite.\u201d </p> <p>A creative education doesn\u2019t necessarily mean an education in creative subjects. It\u2019s something deeper than that, said Amy Smith, global head of recruitment at <a href=\"http://framestorevr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Framestore VR</a>. \u201cThe key problem from my point of view is the assumption that a creative education leads to a creative job. I think that assumption is false.</p> <p>\u201cI think a creative education creates people who can use resources and tools themselves to do any number of jobs. The problem is that by not giving everyone access to a creative education, you end up with people who cannot think for themselves. There is a formal way they learn things, and they don\u2019t know how to learn anything else.\u201d</p> <p>A vital part of that creative thinking is learning to fail, and an appreciation of the \u201cmessiness\u201d of creativity, said Jordan. \u201cIt\u2019s about making mistakes and getting things wrong. With my children, there is certainly an anxiety around perfection. We need to encourage and celebrate failure, experimenting and getting things wrong.\u201d</p> <h2>Learning outside school</h2> <p>But perhaps fostering creativity shouldn\u2019t be left to schools. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be at MIT to take a course from MIT, said David Eveleigh-Evans, chief creative officer at <a href=\"http://www.method.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Method</a>. \u201cTech provides universal access for anyone, anywhere, who has a desire to learn.\u201d Hurst agreed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t look to the government to say go on, teach my kids. I\u2019m going to say: here\u2019s the world, go learn. Maybe this comes down to parenting \u2013 giving your kids access to the tools, experiences and clubs that can teach them about the stuff they choose.\u201d</p> <p>To make it in the creative industries, young people will have to look beyond lessons, said Shaun Mcilrath, chief creative officer, <a href=\"http://www.iris-worldwide.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iris London</a> \u2013 and they\u2019re already doing it. \u201cI see two types of people coming through the doors. There are the makers \u2013 the kids who talk to you about an idea. When you say: \u2018Let\u2019s do it,\u2019 they say: \u2018We already did.\u2019 Then there are the disappointed ones who learned by rote through uni and came out with ridiculous expectations and huge debts.\u201d</p> <p>So, how to keep the talent flowing and forge closer ties between the education system and creative businesses? There was general agreement of the need for more diversity in the creative industries, but many were confused about how to reach out to schools. </p> <p>For Beadle, it is simple. \u201cAll you have to do if you want to find brilliance is go and see your local secondary. There are genius kids in there from very problematic backgrounds. Pick up the phone.\u201d However, as Stefan Bardega, chief digital officer at <a href=\"http://www.zenithoptimedia.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ZenithOptimedia</a> pointed out, this still relies on individuals. \u201cI will pick up the phone but you can\u2019t rely on an individual\u2019s initiative when everyone has day jobs. You have to create [a system]. That is what government is for.\u201d</p> <p>As Chambers pointed out, the old Teacher Placement service, which enabled teachers to spend a week in industrial settings, provided that framework. Going the other way, we had the push for having \u201cadults other than teachers\u201d in schools in the 1980s. \u201cThat did actually model ways of strategically working with businesses on both what is being taught in the curriculum, but also how learning was delivered,\u201d said Heather MacRae, managing director, of the <a href=\"http://ideasfoundation.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ideas Foundation</a>.</p> <p>There is plenty of activity around creativity already, McRae pointed out, and it\u2019s a matter of building on that. \u201cThere\u2019s a group of teachers who are willing to work in partnership with organisations like the Ideas Foundation, who are supported to take risks and will actually really embrace every opportunity to be creative, and create a creative curriculum.\u201d Chambers introduced the idea of \u201c<a href=\"https://makerspace.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">maker spaces</a>\u201d and \u201ctinkering\u201d \u2013 creating community-based learning hubs where children can hang out, create, hack and experiment.

Generators would be penalised for polluting above an emissions-intensity baseline, to help drive an orderly transition to low-emissions energy sources.</p> <p>While the Turnbull government used last week\u2019s events to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/29/jay-weatherill-accuses-barnaby-joyce-of-pushing-anti-windfarm-agenda-over-blackouts\">sharpen criticism of different state governments moving in different directions</a> with their renewable energy targets, in an interview on Sunday the minister for environment and energy, Josh Frydenberg, signalled that any discussion of a new national trading scheme would not be imminent.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/29/south-australia-blackout-explained-renewables-not-to-blame\">South Australia's blackout explained (and no, renewables aren't to blame)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked whether he would countenance changes to the Coalition\u2019s Direct Action policy that would transform elements of the existing regime to an intensity-based emissions trading scheme for the power sector, Frydenberg said consideration would need to wait until a scheduled review of the policy in 2017.</p> <p>Frydenberg defended the government\u2019s existing climate policy framework on Sky News and said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a review in 2017 \u2013 that will be an appropriate time [to consider changes],\u201d he said.</p> <p>But a spokesman for the South Australian mineral resources and energy minister, Tom Koutsantonis, told Guardian Australia on Monday that South Australia was expecting a conversation about a national emissions scheme this coming Friday.</p> <p>\u201cSouth Australia would expect that an emissions scheme is likely to be among issues discussed,\u201d Koutsantonis\u2019s spokesman said.</p> <p>While acknowledging that Friday\u2019s meeting had been convened by the federal government, and not South Australia, the spokesman said: \u201cThere has been no change to South Australia\u2019s position that we would like this explored at a national level.</p> <p>\u201cSadly, the events of last week have been confused with a very important discussion that needs to be had about renewable energy and how it can be better integrated into the national energy market.</p> <p>\u201cAt the last energy ministers\u2019 Coag, Mr Koutsantonis sought to begin the discussion about how to better integrate renewables into the national energy market and how greater interconnection could benefit the nation\u2019s electricity network.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It didn\u2019t matter how power was generated, this was a failure of the transmission systems</p> <footer> <cite>Bill Shorten</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cSouth Australia and Queensland are currently at the end of our electricity markets \u2013 each only interconnecting with one other state. This is a loop that needs to be closed to ensure we have a truly national market. That would improve stability and security and ensure end consumers benefit from a more efficient market.\u201d</p> <p>It is not yet clear whether other states will back South Australia\u2019s push for the national emissions scheme to be considered during Friday\u2019s special gathering in Canberra. <br></p> <p>The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, went to South Australia on Monday to tour regions damaged by last week\u2019s storm and by continued flooding in the state.</p> <p>Shorten took the opportunity to criticise the prime minister, who last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/29/jay-weatherill-accuses-barnaby-joyce-of-pushing-anti-windfarm-agenda-over-blackouts\">linked the blackouts with South Australia\u2019s high reliance on renewable energy</a>, for \u201cseeking to politicise a one-in-50-year storm.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/01/the-lights-go-out-in-sa-and-turnbull-flicks-the-switch-to-peak-stupid\">The lights go out in SA and Turnbull flicks the switch to peak stupid | Lenore Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI want to say very clearly, Labor is up for a discussion about a national energy market, but do it at the right time,\u201d Shorten told reporters on Monday.</p> <p>\u201cI think it is rule 101 of natural disaster is that politicians should not play politics. Playing politics and trying to blame renewable energy for the storm and damage it caused, by Malcolm Turnbull, to me was exactly the lack of leadership, and Australians don\u2019t expect that from their leaders.\u201d</p> <p>Shorten said renewable energy \u201cdidn\u2019t blow over 23 transmission towers or cause 80,000 lightning strikes.

  "<p>The stamp collecting firm Stanley Gibbons has slumped to a \u00a329m annual pre-tax loss and detailed a litany of financial woes after discovering \u201cfundamental errors\u201d in the company\u2019s accounts.</p> <p>In a dismal update that sent its shares down 10% in early trading on Monday, the accountancy firm BDO said it did not have sufficient evidence to perform a proper audit and warned of \u201csignificant doubt about the group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern\u201d.</p> <p>The group is undergoing what it described as an \u201cunsettling\u201d restructuring effort, which forced it to restate results from previous financial years, scrap its dividend and shut its <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/14/stanley-gibbons-launches-online-marketplace-stamps\">online marketplace</a>.</p> <p>The collectibles firm, which was founded in 1856, has also cut jobs, reduced its office space and overhauled its management team.</p> <p>Its chairman Harry Wilson, who was appointed in May, commissioned a review after a dire year that led it to issue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/06/stanley-gibbons-shares-slump-after-second-profit-warning\">two profit warnings</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2016/mar/11/stanley-gibbons-shares-plunge-on-13-fundraising\">tap shareholders for cash</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In his latest sombre update, Wilson said the business had gone \u201cbadly adrift\u201d under previous directors, almost all of whom have left the business.</p> <p>Stanley Gibbons lost \u00a329m before tax in the year to the end of March on revenues of \u00a359m, after taking one-off charges of \u00a324m.</p> <p>The firm issued a lengthy confessional note entitled \u201cWhat went wrong?\u201d, explaining its woes to shareholders, who it said \u201cdeserve an explanation of the combination of events leading to the severely disappointing trading result\u201d.</p> <p>It follows a review by accountants at BDO, who discovered mistakes in the way Stanley Gibbons reported revenue banked from the sale of investment plans in its stamp-trading business.</p> <p>The resulting restatement of figures from previous years led to the value of its assets being slashed by 43%, while its bank debt nearly doubled to \u00a321.9m. It was forced to take \u00a324m of one-off charges, including the write-off of its online collectibles business, The Marketplace, launched as a rival to eBay for trading items such as commemorative coins and stamps.</p> <p>Stanley Gibbons said the business, started only last year, was an \u201cill-conceived, badly managed project which was allowed to severely over-run budgeted expenditure\u201d.</p> <p>The firm parted company with almost its entire boardroom over the summer, with the chief executive, Mike Hall, and finance director, Donal Duff, leaving in July. </p> <p>The new team wasted no time in outlining their predecessors\u2019 failings. The firm highlighted the twin acquisitions of the fine wine, jewellery and antiques trader Noble Investments as well as Mallett, which specialises in art and furniture.</p> <p>The company said the acquisitions were \u201cpoorly managed and, as a result, failed to instil a cohesive, UK-based management structure with adequate challenge and competition for capital\u201d. The firms were not properly integrated, left the group too reliant on certain customers, ate up investment and left the business in too much debt, it added.</p> <p>The firm\u2019s previous auditors, Nexia Smith &amp; Williamson, quit last month, saying the risks of the audit \u201cexceed the level that they are willing to accept\u201d. But Stanley Gibbons said the review of its business had identified \u00a310m of annual cost savings by reducing its office space, cutting jobs and axing The Marketplace.</p> <p>\u201cThe restructuring review identified the need for dramatic changes across the group, which were long overdue and have now been initiated,\u201d Wilson said.</p> <p>He was upbeat about the group\u2019s prospects once the restructuring effort was complete. \u201cThe market for rare collectibles and fine art remains buoyant for collectors and given the low interest rate environment continues to offer an attractive alternative for investment,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe Brexit vote has added a degree of uncertainty over the macro environment but quality collectibles have traditionally maintained their value and appeal over the long term and particularly in times of uncertainty.\u201d</p>",

Reed lags to the side of the hole from 30 feet for his par. McIlroy should convert his birdie chance, but prods with great uncertainty at his putt, and it dies off pitifully to the left.

Spoiler alert: Sir Alex Ferguson is to blame for that final one.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f12931e4b015be638336a0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T15:43:23.415Z\">4.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>So, here we go, then, the day of reckoning!</strong> And let\u2019s start out with a question. Have you ever thought that it\u2019s surely only a matter of time before a professional soccer star, celebrating a goal in the athletic style, mistimes his slide along the turf and splinters his kneecaps into a million bony shards? Similarly, pro golfers in the Ryder Cup really do go overboard with the high fives sometimes, don\u2019t they? There they are, slapping each other\u2019s hands, the tools of their trade, with feeling and a force that is surely excessive. Well, Patrick Reed and Jordan Spieth were certainly highly excited when Reed eagled 6 yesterday afternoon. Gimme five, partner! Don\u2019t leave me hangin\u2019! Problem is, it would seem Reed seriously jarred Spieth\u2019s finger during the throes of their ecstasy. That would explain Spieth\u2019s uncharacteristically dismal form for the remainder of that match; it also raises the question of his ability to compete properly in the singles today.</p> <p><strong>Word right now is, Spieth will be OK to face Henrik Stenson on the first tee at 11.15am. </strong>Phew. If he pulls out before, Darren Clarke will have to present his Special Envelope containing the name of the European player who\u2019d also drop out in such a circumstance. That player would be paired in the draw with Spieth, and their match would be marked down as a half. Henrik Stenson, instead of facing Spieth as originally planned, would move to play whoever the unlucky European was drawn to face. Perhaps Stenson\u2019s in the Special Envelope? Who knows. Anyway, that hopefully won\u2019t be necessary. Here\u2019s to Spieth being hale, hearty, and able to start and finish his match; if he tees off but has to withdraw hurt, Europe will win that one by default.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f0edfee4b05962fdf4a170\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T11:22:44.776Z\">12.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>There haven\u2019t been many better individual performances in the entire history of the Ryder Cup than the one served up by Patrick Reed yesterday afternoon. </strong>Consider the context. The United States of America had gotten off to a dream start in the 41st Ryder Cup, 4-0 in the opening series, but by 5pm on Saturday had been hauled back to parity by a rugged European comeback. Reed and his playing partner Jordan Spieth had thrown away a four-hole lead and half-a-point in the morning; in the afternoon, they\u2019d let slip another dominant position, a three-hole lead against Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson frittered down to one. All of a sudden Europe had a realistic chance of getting something from two of the remaining three matches still out on the course. It was all in the balance.</p> <p><strong>But Reed is made of the right stuff. </strong>With Spieth strangely out of sorts, Reed had built the initial American lead in the match all by himself: three birdies and an eagle between holes 5 and 8. Now he put the foot to the floor again, with bang-bang birdies at 14 and 15, an immediate response to danger that catapulted US to dormie. They\u2019d tie up the match soon after. \u201cHe\u2019s Captain America for us,\u201d Jordan Spieth enthused. \u201cWhat a front nine he had with five birdies and an eagle on his own! Then on the back nine he came through on 14 and 15. He really birdied 16 as well and probably would have birdied 17 if he had to.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Good luck, then, to Reed\u2019s opponent in today\u2019s singles!</strong> Roaring Rory McIlroy has without question been Europe\u2019s answer to Reed, a force of nature raging against the dying of the European light. He\u2019s won three of Europe\u2019s six-and-a-half points, the high-water mark being that eagle at 16 on Friday, though he has done quite a lot of shouting too. His poor vocal cords must look like Harry Nilsson\u2019s after the Pussy Cats sessions. (Just throwing in a cutting-edge pop reference to keep the kids interested.) Rory has been a rare success story for Europe this week, the first name on a short list that also includes the rookies Thomas Pieters, Rafa Cabrera Bello and Chris Wood, and signally omits experienced wild-card picks Martin Kaymer and Lee Stadler-Westwood. His mano-a-mano duel with Reed promises fireworks. Can\u2019t wait!</p> <p><strong>Rory will need to put some blue on the board early if Europe are to have any chance of retaining their trophy. </strong>Problem for Darren Clarke\u2019s team is, even if he does that, their chances are slim: the USA only need five points from the 12 singles rubbers to win, and they\u2019ve been by far the better team this week. Their 9\u00bd-6\u00bd lead is thoroughly deserved. Lightning can strike twice, but the problem there is, we\u2019re not in Medinah any more. Still, you never know, and that\u2019s why we all love sport. Whatever happens, there are some sensational matches taking place this afternoon.

  "<p>Esteban Gir\u00f3n, an organiser with the <a href=\"http://www.crownheightstenantunion.org/\">Crown Heights Tenant Union</a>, is sitting in a Dunkin Donuts on Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn just before closing time. Employees mop the floors, look at the clock and try not to glare.</p> <p>At this time of day, there are two nearby bars he could have been hanging out at instead \u2013 shabby-chic fascimiles of industrial-town dives, except for the $8 beers \u2013 but he and his husband won\u2019t go in them. In fact, he has already told one of the bar owners that he\u2019s planning a protest with his neighbours against them.</p> <p>Like the rest of the tenant union organisers, Gir\u00f3n volunteers his time to help this three-year-old group fight to keep long-time tenants in their homes. It\u2019s a deceptively simple assignment \u2013 but here, in Crown Heights, it might just be the key to stopping yet another episode in New York\u2019s ongoing history of social cleansing.</p> <p>\u201cAll the other organising strategies have been tried in Bushwick,\u201d Gir\u00f3n says. \u201cThey basically pit the landlord against the tenant against the quote-unquote gentrifiers. And when you do that, you\u2019re not going to win anything.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, in the great war against gentrification throughout New York City, most of the battles have been losses. The formerly low-income and heavily minority neighbourhoods of Williamsburg, Bushwick and Bedford-Stuyvesant have already, for all intents and purposes, heavily gentrified.</p> <p>Next in the crosshairs is Crown Heights, which used to be almost exclusively peopled by African Americans and Hasidic Jews. It is now the last line of defence for \u2018affordable\u2019 Brooklyn, where, <a href=\"http://www.realtytrac.com/news/company-news/q3-2016-home-affordability-index/\">according to a new report</a>, the average resident must now spend 124% of their wages to meet the monthly payments on a median-priced home \u2013 the highest figure in the the country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/brooklyn-gentrification-crown-heights-bedford-union-armory\">Brooklyn lawmakers enter gentrification feud over Crown Heights neighborhood</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A quarter of a century ago in 1991, this neighbourhood was the <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/crown-heights-erupts-days-race-riots-1991-article-1.2750050\">the site of riots</a> after a Jewish man killed a black seven-year-old in a grisly car accident. But today, <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/brooklynites-25-years-crown-heights-riots-article-1.2760065\">both communities</a> face the same problems: rising rents.</p> <p>The story is the same as it was in Bushwick or Bed-Stuy: as renters get priced out of the rest of New York, many landlords in Crown Heights are trying to chase out long-time and rent-stabilised tenants, so they can charge more to new renters or sell buildings to developers; the developers, meanwhile, are building more luxury units in the neighbourhood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44b3dc7b1b89741ab27ec7ff543135066895e72c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44b3dc7b1b89741ab27ec7ff543135066895e72c/0_125_3495_2097/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A police car overturned by rioters during the Crown Heights unrest of August 1991.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A police car overturned by rioters during the Crown Heights unrest of August 1991.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Burns/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The losers? Residential tenants who can\u2019t afford the new normal, and small neighbourhood businesses.</p> <p>The CHTU has seen it happen elsewhere in Brooklyn, and is determined Crown Heights won\u2019t end up like the rest. The organisation fights on several levels: it looks to rack up wins for residents through individual tenant assistance, lobbying in Albany for better state laws, and direct action \u2013 such as when, on the coldest day of the winter, tenants in one building <a href=\"http://equalityforflatbush.tumblr.com/post/107729746082/7pm-tonight-emergency-crown-heights-tenants-rally\">found themselves without any heat</a> and a landlord that wasn\u2019t responsive.</p> <p>\u201cWe rushed the lobby and we sat there until the heat came on,\u201d Gir\u00f3n recalls \u2013 and that only happened when the union called local media. \u201cIt was the first time I realised the immediacy of having not just an organisation that\u2019s in the neighborhood, but actual neighbours.\u201d</p> <p>The CHTU approach is straightforward. \u201cWe have to disrupt the landlords\u2019 business model by helping tenants remain in their apartments,\u201d Gir\u00f3n says. There are two keys: building community, then educating tenants about their rights and how to enforce them. </p> <p>Twice a week, Gir\u00f3n accompanies tenants to housing court, to prevent intimidation and show landlords the CHTU is firmly on the tenants\u2019 side. He also helps tenants figure out who actually owns their buildings: some landlords attempt to obscure their involvement to avoid bad publicity about their tactics or housing conditions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4d9ddfb78f3201f6f97069629ee277f90c807153\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d9ddfb78f3201f6f97069629ee277f90c807153/0_134_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A defaced poster showing an impending Crown Heights development\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A defaced poster showing an impending Crown Heights development</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Knox/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What Crown Heights has learned from other neighbourhoods is that while big fights might seem unwinnable, small victories can lead to bigger ones. For example, one hold-out tenant can be enough to prevent a developer from buying a building; keeping tenants in place can disrupt the whole cycle of gentrification. </p> <p>One example of this is sitting across the table from us: Marcia Louisy. Gir\u00f3n says: \u201cThe only way to put a pause on this [gentrification] is when the Marcias of the world hold it down.\u201d</p> <p>Louisy is a transplant from Jamaica. Eighteen years ago, she moved into a rent-controlled, three-bedroom apartment in Crown Heights. She pays roughly $1,000 a month; the neighbours upstairs pay $4,500. Her apartment could clearly fetch thousands more on the open market, and her landlord has already offered her $250,000 to move.</p> <p>That sounds like a lot of money, but it would be <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/realestate/rent-stabilized-apartments-buyouts-application-fees.html?_r=0\">subject to significant taxes</a>, and probably wouldn\u2019t even buy her a small condominium further out in the borough. She\u2019s holding out, and not just because of the money. \u201cThat\u2019s my apartment,\u201d she says. \u201cMy kids were born in that apartment, they\u2019ve grown up in that apartment.\u201d</p> <p>According to Gir\u00f3n, many tenants in the area are harassed and intimidated into taking buyouts, or driven out by crumbling apartments and a lack of repairs. The goal is the same: get rid of rent-controlled tenants with, in many cases, generational rights to remain.</p> <h2>Total disrespect</h2> <p>Vaughn Armour, a 17-year resident of Crown Heights, is also facing down a landlord trying to buy him out. His long-time girlfriend, Barbara Simmons, who lived in the same apartment for 42 years, passed away over Labor Day weekend. Before her memorial service, the landlord went to the apartment to encourage Armour and Simmons\u2019 son to leave.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s not even buried yet, and [the landlord] had the audacity to offer my stepson $5,000 for the apartment,\u201d Armour says. \u201cThat is total disrespect.</p> <p>\u201cHe don\u2019t realise that I\u2019m a member of New York Communities for Change, and I know when it comes to written laws and guidelines that I don\u2019t have to go nowhere. We have succession rights. I\u2019ve been there for 17 years, a New York state-recognised common-law husband, and her son\u2019s been there for 33 years. The only thing this guy can do is give us the succession papers to sign, and a new lease.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8bd6385371de74041e26ae112b622e28764ac485\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bd6385371de74041e26ae112b622e28764ac485/0_109_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vaughn Armour, a Crown Heights resident of 17 years.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vaughn Armour, a Crown Heights resident of 17 years, is facing down the landlord who wants to buy him out.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Knox/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://nycommunities.org/\">New York Communities for Change</a> is another of the groups in Brooklyn fighting to help low- and moderate-income tenants stay in their homes. Like the CHTU, they educate tenants about their rights, advocate for laws that help tenants, and try to help people have a voice in the myriad approval processes that govern development in the city. Armour says the brush with his landlord has spurred him to further action with NYCC.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to get out and start talking to tenants in the buildings, and tell them: \u2018As long as you\u2019re paying your rent and you\u2019re not destroying their property or being a nuisance to other neighbours, you shouldn\u2019t be harassed,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cIt works, too.\u201d</p> <p>Helping renters stay in their homes, though, is only half the gentrification fight. Developers are also tearing down old buildings to erect luxury apartments that few locals could afford, in a city where rents have risen twice as fast as incomes.</p> <p>As Armour puts it: \u201cDevelopers shouldn\u2019t be able to come in and build something that no one who lives here can afford.\u201d</p> <p>New buildings in neighbourhoods like Crown Heights must usually set aside a certain number of \u2018affordable\u2019 units, although many people can\u2019t afford even those. \u201cEspecially around this area \u2013 Lefferts, Albany, Kingston \u2013 the average salary per year is $23,000,\u201d says Armour, adding that the \u2018affordable housing\u2019 in some of the new apartment buildings doesn\u2019t reflect that. \u201cFamily of four, $31,000 and up. Who really could afford that from my community?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ee04f74a6e66d69b0590dbd0917faee5e4d324f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ee04f74a6e66d69b0590dbd0917faee5e4d324f/0_0_1817_1090/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The city-owned Bedford-Union Armory building is slated for sale and redevelopment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The city-owned Bedford-Union Armory building is slated for sale and redevelopment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: bedfordcourts.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The biggest new construction project to rile up activists and residents is the Bedford-Union Armory.

  "<p>Once, my family\u2019s kitchen cupboard would have contained dozens of plastic bags. But today \u2013 a year after the introduction of England\u2019s 5p plastic bag charge \u2013 I count just six (three secondhand ones, given to us by other people, one corner-shop bag and two small bags supplied with meat and fish).</p> <p>England\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/30/excess-baggage-will-5p-charge-finally-kill-the-plastic-bag\" title=\"\">plastic bag charge was a long time coming</a> \u2013 long after Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales \u2013 and critics predicted its exemptions for small stores and paper bags would diminish its effectiveness. A year ago, Andy Cummins, <a href=\"https://www.sas.org.uk/\" title=\"\">campaigns director of Surfers Against Sewage</a>, predicted that England\u2019s charge would reduce use of plastic bags, but not as effectively as in Scotland, Wales (down 78%) and Northern Ireland (down 81%).</p> <p>In fact, in the first six months of the charge, the number of single-use plastic bags handed out by the seven biggest supermarkets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/30/england-plastic-bag-usage-drops-85-per-cent-since-5p-charged-introduced\" title=\"\">fell by more than 85% from 7.6bn a year in 2014 to 600m</a>. In that period, the levy raised more than \u00a329m for charities and community groups. A study by Cardiff University found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/29/shoppers-in-england-now-more-likely-to-use-their-own-bags-plastic\" title=\"\">more than nine out of 10 people often or always carry their own bags</a>, up from seven out of 10 before the 5p charge came into effect.</p> <p>Six billion fewer plastic bags in six months: Cummins is happy to be proved half-wrong. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic success,\u201d he says. \u201cThe vast majority have adapted their behaviour without a check in their stride. There will be a phenomenal net benefit for the environment from 6bn fewer bags.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.mcsuk.org/\" title=\"\">Marine Conservation Society</a> undertook its annual beach clean in September. Laura Foster, head of pollution, says that volunteers aren\u2019t seeing plastic bags on the beach any more. \u201cThere is strong anecdotal evidence to suggest a decline in plastic bags in our marine environment,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Single-use plastic bags may not be being discarded in their previous numbers, but there are reservations about their replacements. Bags for life and, in particular, cotton bags require much more energy \u2013 and carbon emissions \u2013 to produce. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/life-cycle-assessment-of-supermarket-carrierbags-a-review-of-the-bags-available-in-2006\" title=\"\">A study by the Environment Agency</a> found a \u201cresource expenditure\u201d of just 2kg of carbon per plastic bag: a paper bag would need to be used seven times to achieve the same per-use expenditure; a cotton bag would need to be used 327 times.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.supreme-creations.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Supreme Creations</a>, which claims to be the world\u2019s largest ethical packaging company, reports a 20% increase in sales of its <a href=\"http://bagsofethics.org/\" title=\"\">reusable carrier bags</a> since the levy was introduced in England. So, are we now creating reusable bag mountains? My family\u2019s reusable bag stash currently stands at 15, but these include a cotton bag from the Devon town of Modbury, which I picked up in 2007 when I wrote about it being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/may/12/uknews.waste\" title=\"\">the first place in Europe to ban plastic bags</a>. That has definitely had more than 300 uses, and so have our three large Ikea bags, which I take to the supermarket each week.</p> <p>Surfers Against Sewage, Keep Britain Tidy and the Marine Conservation Society all say that there are no problems with reusable bags being littered on land or sea. \u201cBecause people pay for them, they value them and there is no tossing them away,\u201d says Foster. What about the free ones? \u201cEven if you get them for free, you hoard them,\u201d says Cummins. \u201cYou need every bag you can get if your shopping is anything like mine.\u201d</p> <p>For analysts such as David Powell of the <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/people/entry/david-powell\" title=\"\">New Economics Foundation</a>, the unequivocal success of the plastic bag charge shows that the government shouldn\u2019t be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2015/sep/12/nudge-theory-mental-manipulation-wrong\" title=\"\">afraid of using financial \u201cnudges\u201d</a> in new environmental regulations. Who would imagine that a 5p charge changes human behaviour so decisively?</p> <p>\u201cBy far the most interesting thing about the plastic bag charge is just how successful an incredibly small charge can be,\u201d says Powell. \u201cIntroduce the right charge in the right way and people respond to it, particularly if there\u2019s such an obvious environmental problem. The government will have to conclude, how can we use this principle for other things?\u201d</p> <p>The Cardiff University survey also reveals that the charge has made people in England more willing to accept regulations to reduce plastic waste, such as a 5p charge on plastic bottles. Plastic bags may have been litter\u2019s poster child, but they amounted to just 2% of beach rubbish. Powell suggests a charge on coffee cups is an obvious next step. \u201cThere are massive piles of unrecycled coffee cups everywhere. It\u2019s an obvious problem that people are keen to do something about.\u201d</p> <p>While the plastic-bag charge was about changing consumer behaviour, announcing a charge on coffee cups to apply at a future date would give the industry an incentive to innovate and find alternatives, rather like the sugar tax, which will apply from 2017.</p> <p>Both Keep Britain Tidy and Surfers Against Sewage would like to see the government close the loopholes in England\u2019s current plastic bag charge so that paper bags incur a charge, too, and small shops are no longer exempt (the Association of Convenience Stores wanted to be included in the charging system from the outset). However, a Defra spokesperson says there are currently no plans to extend the regulations.</p> <p>\u201cWe walk into meetings with Defra where the position is: \u2018The government doesn\u2019t want new regulations.\u2019 Unfortunately, that\u2019s the default position,\u201d says Cummins. He thinks the next example of a win-win regulation that would benefit consumers, industry and the environment is <a href=\"http://messageinabottle.org.uk/\" title=\"\">a deposit-return system</a> for drinks bottles. Such systems are used in dozens of European countries from Germany to Croatia, and in Australian and American states, too.</p> <p>Reverse vending machines that give people, say, 20p for their plastic and glass bottles and aluminium cans deliver recycling rates of up to 90%, provide high-grade recyclable materials for industry, and save councils\u2019 doorstep recycling and rubbish bin costs, argues Cummins. If placed on shop floors, they also encourage footfall; it\u2019s not hard to imagine kids collecting bottles and quickly spending their earnings in the shops.</p> <p>\u201cWe all know that litter breeds litter,\u201d says Cummins. \u201cIf you can take these really visible litter items out of the environment with a successful deposit-return system, it will have a knock-on effect and everyone will treat their environment better.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>There are definite advantages, if you\u2019re a Tory, to the existence of Theresa May. The party, despite all the best efforts of its big beasts, is still upright and in charge; and the boiling personal hatreds within Labour appear to have no parallel among Conservatives, even though this can\u2019t be true \u2013 animus hasn\u2019t been resolved but simply buried under pragmatism, like nuclear waste.</p> <p>The party\u2019s internal contradictions are treated as a natural part of politics. Three months ago, you knew this party by its trail of dead: it would have been inconceivable in summer that they could return so fast to being boring. May has given them the gift of tedium. Their gratitude to her is palpable.</p> <p>Nevertheless, there are Conservatives with questions May cannot answer. If her first gambit, to bring back grammar schools, initially seemed rather wild and random, it has sharpened into a picture: she took the referendum result as a mandate to return us to the 1950s.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/tory-conference-brexit-divisions-moderate\">Bitter fight over Brexit set to overshadow Conservative conference</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Doubtless, for some leave voters, that\u2019s what they wanted: a Britain of yore, where lives were better, richer and more fulfilling because the rest of the world left us alone. But that isn\u2019t the full picture of Conservatism, which has since 2010 drawn its energy from being the opposite of conservative.</p> <p>Cameron, Osborne and Gove were radical modernisers, creating a gruesome future in which commerce was king and the state had been wound down to food stamps and fire engines; but it was a future, nevertheless.</p> <p>They gave a sense of having understood modernity, and of being not just ready for it but exhilarated by it. Their worldview was wrong and their excitement unnerving, Osborne\u2019s in particular, with his casual destruction of the social safety net, his maniacal faith in markets, his feverish promises \u2013 manufacturing, march of the makers, running a surplus \u2013 that never materialised. Yet they fulfilled a need in the party, and made a home there for people who weren\u2019t nostalgic.</p> <p>There are still plenty of free trade fundamentalists in the party, but the territory has been annexed by the Brexiteers, in whose hands it sounds either unhinged (a neo-imperialist vision, in which everyone wants to trade with us because we\u2019re simply better than them) or incredibly flaky (a messy, hand-waving \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine!\u201d approach, embodied by Boris Johnson, who can inspire many things but not \u2013 even in his allies \u2013 confidence). May, in her first speech to conference, attempted to harness some of this buccaneering Brexit spirit. \u201cWe don\u2019t need, as I sometimes hear people say, to \u2018punch above our weight\u2019. Because our weight is substantial enough already.\u201d It was nothing more than a big I Am: mindless self-assertion.</p> <p>Furthermore, May\u2019s social agenda is far more toxic to her own youth wing than it is to the members of Momentum. Young Conservatives don\u2019t want equality commissions and redistributive taxation. They want low taxes, a small state, personal freedom as defined by having no responsibility for one another: all those pillars of rightwing thinking that they take to be 21st century but were actually thrashed out by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/15/neoliberalism-ideology-problem-george-monbiot\" title=\"\">Ludwig von Mises</a>.</p> <p>For us on the left, the problem with May is that she neutralises the pursuit of equality by talking about it with no real intention of making it happen; for those on the right, the talk itself is anathema. They would get more from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/28/compass-group-whistleblower-case-call-for-urgent-government-review\" title=\"\">Compass </a>meeting about automation, a future without work and the basic citizen\u2019s income \u2013 which at least is a new problem \u2013 than they would from the rather tired conference oratory about how to tend to the poor while at the same time getting them to buck up their ideas.</p> <p>There is a chimeric thinness to May\u2019s vision of the next two decades that is rather depressing, like getting close to a landscape only to find it has been painted on a sheet of plywood. Let\u2019s say her grammar school plan were to work \u2013 that, contrary to all the experience and evidence, the brightest and best flourished in a segregated school system, got to a world-beating university, emerged with stunning qualifications. Then what?</p> <p>All May\u2019s rhetoric hangs off a world of bank managers and civil servants, a society of old certainties where to be middle class meant to be secure and comfortable, and to ascend to those ranks was reward in itself. That isn\u2019t really true any more for the middle classes under 30, who face a precariousness \u2013 vague terms of employment, unaffordable housing, chronic debt \u2013 that old politics would associate with the underclass.</p> <p>The question of how to create a knowledge economy, how to educate a populace for the next era of work, how to ensure that the changes we know are coming make life easier and not harder: these are all left unanswered.</p> <p>Then there is the frankly terrifying lacuna where her environmental plan should be: there are, of course, climate change deniers on the right, and the American alt-right pretty much defines itself by its ability to meet science with splenetic outburst, and consider itself the victor.</p> <p>But there are perfectly educated Conservatives too who want to see some meaningful, coherent answers to problems they can see are interrelated: how to meet climate change targets, how to generate more energy and liberate ourselves from reliance on fossil-richer countries, how to exist at the frontiers of new technology, how to spread skilled jobs across the country.</p> <p>They will want to at least hear conversations about renewable energy, even if they wouldn\u2019t expect a concrete plan. But this ground is terrifying for the prime minister, who knows that those who blame Europe\u2019s red tape for hardship are the same people who blame wind farms for illness; that the decision to leave the EU, even if it had nothing explicit to say about the environment, would not have been taken by anyone who took environmentalism seriously. There is not much here for the optimistic Tory.</p> <p>All eyes are currently on May\u2019s Brexit plan, and with good reason: it has the greatest consequence in the short and medium term, it is the obvious site of conflict, and it\u2019s the most fun to watch (albeit a devastating sort of fun).</p> <p>But there are deeper problems \u2013 if not for the country, then for the party. What is its offer to the hopeful? How is it addressing its modernisers? Where is its \u2013 big-M and little-m \u2013 momentum?</p>",
  "<p>The organisers of a homelessness protest, in which around 50 rough sleepers have pitched tents in Leeds city centre, are due to appear in court to fight a bid to disperse them.</p> <p>The \u201ctent city\u201d was set up on 21 September to protest against a perceived lack of action by the council to tackle homelessness in Leeds.</p> <p>Leeds Homeless Action Group has called on the council to provide rough sleepers with a safe space to sleep, but the council has argued there is accommodation available for every person sleeping on the streets if they want it. </p> <p>Continuously staffed by volunteers, who distribute donated clothing, food and hot drinks to homeless people sleeping in the tents, the project was first pitched outside the city\u2019s art gallery before it was ordered to move last week to make way for Yorkshire\u2019s Olympics celebrations. </p> <p>Now on its second site in Park Square, which is home to many of the city\u2019s law firms, the protest faces having to move again as the council has issued a claim for possession of the square. The council is also asking for an injunction to stop the organisers setting up the project at other sites across the city centre. The case will be heard at Leeds county court on Monday.</p> <p>Haydn Jessop, one of the protest\u2019s organisers, said that gathering lots of the city\u2019s rough sleepers in one place gives them \u201ca bigger voice\u201d. \u201cWhen you get off the bus in the morning to go to work you might see one or two rough sleepers, but the total number of rough sleepers doesn\u2019t go into people\u2019s minds,\u201d he said. </p> <p>He argued that bringing rough sleepers together makes the scale of the problem clear. \u201cAnd we\u2019re only touching the iceberg with this,\u201d said Jessop. \u201cThere are hundreds in Leeds, all in different areas.\u201d</p> <p>Leeds\u2019s tent city is one of many such communities of homeless people to emerge in towns across the country, inspired by similar projects in Manchester, Nottingham and Bristol. Many of the tents and sleeping bags were salvaged after being abandoned at Leeds festival this summer.</p> <p>Jessop, who was once homeless himself, wants the council to provide a permanent, secure space for the project. He said police told the group privately that crime has fallen in the area since the start of the protest because the rough sleepers are being properly provided for.</p> <p>Michael Eric Bleasby, who has been homeless for four years and has been sleeping at the tent city since it started, said he has witnessed provision for homeless people decline in the city. \u201cI used to walk around Leeds and there used to be loads of hostels, but all the hostels have shut down. They\u2019ve all been turned into studio flats for the students and I don\u2019t recognise it anymore,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Helen Hayton, a volunteer with the project, said rough sleepers live in constant fear of being beaten up, but that the tent city provides a safe environment. When she was volunteering at the protest\u2019s last site late at night, she had to stop people urinating on the tents in which people were sleeping. \u201c[The rough sleepers] are looking a lot more well because they\u2019re getting a proper night\u2019s sleep now,\u201d she said.</p> <p>A statement on behalf of Leeds city council, West Yorkshire police and Leeds BID (business improvement district) said helping the homeless remained an absolute priority for them. \u201cThere is a strong collaborative approach with businesses and third sector organisations to offer access to a wide range of support services and a bed for the night to ensure that no one has to sleep on the streets,\u201d they said.<br>  \u201cWe have asked the Leeds Homeless Action Group to become part of this collaborative approach so they can make a positive contribution and work on practical solutions to help those in genuine need. This offer still stands despite the fact that the Leeds Homeless Action Group is not an official or registered homeless support group or charitable organisation.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/30/posters-berating-homeless-beggars-as-tricksters-not-true\">Posters berating homeless beggars as frauds?

The dissonance was both encouraging and unsettling.</p> <p>Encouraging because the overriding message was that positive change is possible. Santa Marta is a symbol of that. Fifteen years ago, this community of 8,000 residents \u2013 like many favelas in Rio \u2013 was off the social grid. Gangs ruled the streets. There was almost zero public or private investment. Residents stole electricity by tapping power lines so there was little incentive to conserve energy or switch to clean power.<br></p> <p>But since 2008, when it was the first favela to be \u201cpacified\u201d with a permanent police presence, Dona Marta has become something of a model community. A new cable car has improved access. With crime down, tourism \u2013 driven by the spectacular views of Rio and the nearby <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/aug/02/rios-christ-the-redeemer-statue-in-pictures\">Christ the Redeemer statue</a> \u2013 is up. The utilities have moved in. Some new homes have installed sewer pipes and electricity cables.<br></p> <p>Since the end of last year, this is also the site of <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/energy/2015/12/151218-sponsor-content-shell-and-brazilian-startup-light-up-santa-marta-community/\">a pilot project</a> to bring solar power to favela communities. Shell is paying the small local startup <a href=\"http://www.insolar.eco.br/\">Insolar</a> to install more than 150 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaics\">photovoltaic</a> cells on buildings with a communal use. Look down now from the cable car and you can see blue panels on the creche, samba school and residents\u2019 association. In the near future, there will be solar trees, where locals can charge mobile phones.<br></p> <p>\u201cPeople thought we were crazy when we said we want to promote solar use in poor communities in Rio,\u201d said Insolar founder Henrique Drumond. But he said the creche now gets 70% of its energy from the panels, which means considerable savings on a power bill that \u2013 since pacification \u2013 has to be paid. With a panel lifespan of 25 years and lots of sun in Rio, the hope is that, over time, residents of other communities will see the benefits and \u2013 once a financing system is in place \u2013 choose to invest themselves. In that sense, Santa Marta is a shop window.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e7d2928530fe42fb3b174a770a2e093347dcab4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7d2928530fe42fb3b174a770a2e093347dcab4d/0_0_2048_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Solar panels on the roof of the creche in Santa Marta, installed by local startup Insolar and paid for by Shell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Solar panels on the roof of the creche in Santa Marta, installed by local startup Insolar and paid for by Shell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Insolar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSolar brings energy and jobs,\u201d said the community \u201cambassador\u201d Marcelo de Souza. \u201cWe hope this can spread not just in Santa Marta but to all the Rio communities. We want to create not just jobs, but business.\u201d<br></p> <p>Commercial viability is, however, still a distant prospect for most of the projects being exhibited. A greater priority for now is demonstrating that the technology works and getting the word out. This is where Shell\u2019s marketing clout \u2013 rather than an equity investment \u2013 comes in.<br></p> <p>That process is already well underway at <a href=\"http://www.pavegen.com/\">Pavegen</a>, a UK company that built the world\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/02/sustainability-football-green-game-sport\"> first player-powered football pitch</a> at Rio\u2019s Morro da Mineira favela in 2014. That too was a Shell-sponsored project and \u2013 with their backing \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/brazil/11089313/Pele-unveils-unique-football-pitch-where-players-energy-produces-electricity.html\">inaugurated by Pel\u00e9</a>.<br></p> <p>The idea is ingenious, but expensive. Kinetic energy panels are laid under the playing surface. Each step on them generates about five watts (depending on the player\u2019s weight). A single five-a-side game can power floodlights for several hours.<br></p> <p>Underscoring the importance of public security as well as energy in any development, the founder, Laurence Kemball-Cook, was advised not to return to Morro da Mineira because of rising violence in the unpacified community, but his company\u2019s technology was showcased at Santa Marta with a breakdance display.<br></p> <p>Kemball-Cook initially had to take risks to push his ideas. He says his first pilot project was installed without permission on a building site on the South Bank and he was also detained for putting one on the steps of 10 Downing Street. Now, however, he has Shell\u2019s support, \u00a32m raised from a kickstarter campaign, 40 staff and a growing list of trial sites, including West Ham station, a Kia factory in South Korea and \u2013 soon \u2013 several entire blocks of a US city. He is hopeful the collaboration with music artists can take it further, increase demand and help to drive the cost down.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf you believe in an idea, you can\u2019t just sit on your backside,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have great technology, but amplifying it is hard. We partner with artists to amplify it. A 16-year-old won\u2019t listen to me or to Shell but, with a song, you can reach them.\u201d<br></p> <p>The artists \u2013 who will collaborate for a promotional video \u2013 were chosen to appeal to global youth with one representative from each continent. Of the three who were in Santa Marta this week, Santana has 50 million social media followers, Alade is a Nigerian afropop star, and Lott was recently in a West End show.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe idea is to spread the word about these fantastic ideas,\u201d said Lott, who performed on the roof of a favela creche, while on the street below visitors were shown around display booths. \u201cIt is really good to be involved in something so positive and inspiring. These are fantastic ideas that I would have never thought about from people who really care about the world. I hope these things become normal in the future. It is really important for young people to realise it\u2019s going on.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fc8a6b407f50b65c04a92a189760ca9c3c90366b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc8a6b407f50b65c04a92a189760ca9c3c90366b/0_0_640_534/500.jpg\" alt=\"Yemi Alade, Luan Santana and Pixie Lott perform in the Santa Marta favela\" width=\"500\" height=\"417\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yemi Alade, Luan Santana and Pixie Lott perform in the Santa Marta favela.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @yemialadeworld</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Youth appeal, however, is probably more important for Shell \u2013 which needs to greenwash its 100-plus-year history of profiting from dirty carbon fuels \u2013 than for the young entrepreneurs, most of whom are more in need of backing from investors and governments.<br></p> <p>Take Sanwal Muneer, founder of <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/94982491\">Capture Mobility</a>, a firm that produces roadside turbines that generate energy from the air turbulence caused by passing cars. These sophisticated devices also tap solar power and use filters to remove harmful pollutants from vehicle emissions. Having started in Pakistan last year, it is now based in Edinburgh and is already planning four major pilot projects, including one in Germany that will use the collected power to charge electric cars.<br></p> <p>Arguably the most elegant idea on display was also the simplest. <a href=\"http://gravitylight.org/\">Gravity Light</a>, a UK-based firm, aims to provide power \u2013 with a ceiling winch and a bag of sand or stones \u2013 to the one in seven homes in the world that lack electricity. All users need to do is pull the weight up and let it fall. This turns a small turbine that can power an LED light (or a radio) for up to 25 minutes. In its target market of sub-Saharan Africa, the price would be just $25 (\u00a319) for an energy source that would last for several years, does not require batteries and would be several times brighter \u2013 and, ultimately, much less of a drain on household finances \u2013 than kerosene lamps, which are currently the main alternative source of lighting.<br></p> <p>Other entrepreneurs get power from waste. China-based <a href=\"http://www.motioneco.com/\">MotionEco</a> turns used cooking oil into diesel, thereby reducing the public health threat of a product that has, notoriously, been scooped out of gutters and reused for food. UK-based <a href=\"http://www.bio-bean.com/about-us/\">Bio-Bean</a> collects industrial quantities of used coffee and extracts essential oils and biodiesel and then uses what is left to make fuel briquettes that, it says, are cheaper and longer-burning than wood.<br></p> <p>On the main road of Santa Marta, the latter were being used to grill chicken kebabs and sausages at one of the ubiquitous street churrascos. Daniel Crockett, the communications head of the three-year-old company, hoped the principle could spread further.<br></p> <p>\u201cCoffee is just one organic waste stream. If we could spread the idea that this is possible then that would be great,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we know that many of these places have more pressing issues of clean water and basic sanitation.\u201d<br></p> <p>That touched on one of the three unsettling questions raised by the event. Will Santa Marta turn out to be a Potemkin favela used to temporarily showcase the future even as other communities are unable to enjoy the basic services that should be available in the present?<br></p> <p>The second question is about Shell\u2019s motives. Is it genuinely pushing for an energy transformation, simply hedging its bets, or just engaged in PR to salvage its reputation, particularly among the young ? It is probably no coincidence that #makethefuture comes at a time when there is growing pressure from students for universities and other institutions to <a href=\"http://gofossilfree.org/commitments/\">divest their funds from fossil fuel companies</a>. </p> <p>Shell declined to say how much it spent on the project in Santa Marta, though it \u2013 and other clean energy investment by the company \u2013 was almost certainly minuscule compared with its investments in dirty carbon-based energy. The third question, then, is will that balance shift?<br></p> <p>The company\u2019s external relations manager, Glauco Paiva, was clear in his answer. \u201cShell believes the future of energy is renewable,\u201d he said at a press conference in the Santa Marta samba school hall. \u201cThe idea is to change the world.\u201d<br></p> <p>If so, this week\u2019s exhibition is a tiny but welcome step in the right direction. But if Shell\u2019s investment strategy does not also change substantively, the bright ideas will have been shrouded in a PR sham.</p>",

  "<p>On the day I finished reading this book, two newspaper articles caught my attention. A former head of the armed forces warned that the UK could not withstand a Russian attack; on the US presidential campaign trail, more evidence emerged of Vladimir Putin\u2019s support for Donald Trump.</p> <p>Of the many accounts written about the Russian president, Mikhail Zygar\u2019s insider\u2019s guide to his court is one of the most compelling. Zygar, a prominent journalist, has clearly earned the confidence of many. He tiptoes carefully; a number of journalists and their sources who have tried to disclose details of the cash that Putin and his henchmen have squirrelled away have ended up dead or in jail.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/28/where-was-vladimir-putin-when-jeremy-corbyn-needed-him\">Where was Putin when Corbyn needed him? | Stewart Lee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The book charts not just the machinations of the various players \u2013 indeed some of the detail may be perplexing to non-Kremlinologists. It also acutely traces the evolution of Putin\u2019s mind. The former KGB operative in East Germany did, even as he clamped down on the domestic media, initially try to woo the west. After Iraq and particularly the colour revolutions in Georgia and Ukraine, Putin felt betrayed.</p> <p>The \u201cfat decade\u201d, as the 2000s were known, was the period when Russians (or at least some of them) maxed out on conspicuous consumption. \u201cRussia was clumsily learning how to be a rich country,\u201d the author writes. It was not just the oligarchs; the civil service quadrupled in number, a ready cash cow. \u201cThere was scarcely any politics, no public life, just solid hedonism.\u201d The most common form of bribery was a family holiday abroad, worth a few thousand, in return for rubber-stamping a contract worth millions. The state officials grew wiser and developed a taste for proper luxury. \u201cWhy take hand-outs from billionaires if you can become a billionaire yourself?\u201d That is when the power nexus shifted. What mattered was access to the top, and increasingly that meant one man only.</p> <p>In foreign policy, Putin took a binary approach to friend and foe. George W Bush (at first) was the tough guy who knew how to buy elections; Gerhard Schr\u00f6der was the dependable friend who sought \u2013 and received \u2013 a big job in Russian business. The favourite, naturally, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi\" title=\"\">Silvio Berlusconi</a>. The two families were extremely close. \u201cPutin found it so much easier to deal with European cynics,\u201d Zygar notes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Putin never let Medvedev forget his betrayal. When he sought re-election, Putin sent out the order to destroy him</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As for the present pack, he loathes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/barackobama\" title=\"\">Barack Obama</a> (and the feeling is mutual); he sees <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel\" title=\"\">Angela Merkel</a> as the ringleader for a tougher European response to Russia. Hence the constant support Russia gives to Trump and France\u2019s far-right <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen\" title=\"\">Marine Le Pen</a>, and the delight registered over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">Brexit</a>. Russia will use every possible means to shake the status quo and undermine Europe. One of the many amusing anecdotes was how Putin would bring his huge black Labrador to meetings with Merkel; she is frightened stiff of dogs.</p> <p>Few of the cardinals around the president emerge with credit. The most pitiable role is ascribed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/dmitry-medvedev\" title=\"\">Dmitry Medvedev</a>, the man on whom the west briefly pinned some hopes. Plucked from nowhere by Putin (just as Putin was by Boris Yeltsin), his job was to keep the presidential seat warm. Putin needed to step down after two terms, but assumed that as prime minister he&#xa0;would continue to run the show.</p> <p>For a year or two his protege struck out; he not only brought in his own people, he tried (a little) to introduce some constitutional order into the criminal state and he sought a rapprochement of sorts with the west. Obama\u2019s team privately mocked Medvedev and his obsession with western gadgets. They and the Europeans were pleasantly surprised when the Russians did not object to the bombing of Libya. Putin, however, was furious and would never let Medvedev forget his betrayal. When the president briefly contemplated running for re-election, Putin sent out the order to destroy him. Parliament, security services, media and the business community did the rest.</p> <p>By 2012, firmly ensconced in his third term as president, Putin controlled everything and everyone. Within a couple of years of his new tenure, he had seen off the liberal protest movement, annexed Crimea and occupied eastern Ukraine. He had won back some global authority with his clever scheming in Syria.</p> <p>Such was the power he wielded that during his strange (and still unexplained) two long absences from the Kremlin, nobody knew what to do. Western sanctions hit his circle hard, but nobody dared argue with him, \u201cbecause they knew that he was the source and guarantor of their wealth. Putin\u2019s good favour was what gave them legitimacy\u201d. He had by this point become obsessed with victimhood \u2013 Russia\u2019s diplomatic and spiritual comfort blanket.</p> <p>Yet, while emphasising the court\u2019s dependency on Putin, Zygar\u2019s conclusion is more nuanced. Putin became what he is because those around him saw it as the simplest path for their own enrichment and job security. \u201cIn trying to divine the intentions of their leader, his associates effectively materialised their own wishes.\u201d In other words, Putin is more of a phenomenon than a leader.</p> <p>The perennial neurosis about slavophilia versus westernism is therefore a false choice. Russia, the author suggests, seeks solace and confidence in definition against others. \u201cEach of us invented our own Putin.

  "<p>Scientists have taken the notion \u2018you are what you eat\u2019 to a new level by using virtual reality to help people see the world through the eyes of a cow \u2013 or a piece of coral \u2013 to make them feel part of the natural world.</p> <p>With several consumer virtual reality headsets now on the market, researchers hope experiencing life from an animal\u2019s point of view could change environmental behaviour where other methods have failed. </p> <p>As cows, participants donned virtual reality headsets and were left to walk around a virtual pasture on all fours, jabbed by a virtual cattle prod, and told they were to be loaded on to a truck. </p> <p>As coral, volunteers saw the reef around them decay as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/19/great-barrier-reef-93-of-reefs-hit-by-coral-bleaching\">ocean acidified</a>, their own \u2018body\u2019 corrode, and their branches break off with a crack. </p> <p>These immersive experiences led people to feel more connected with nature than those who simply watched the simulation play out on a screen, <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcc4.12173/abstract\">the study</a> found. The aim of the experiments was to make the distant consequences of damaging consumption much more real. </p> <p>\u201cOne of the biggest problems with environmental issues is that there\u2019s a huge temporal gap, so it seems like whatever you do in the present doesn\u2019t really connect to the environmental problems in the future,\u201d explained study co-author Grace Ahn, an assistant professor of advertising at the University of Georgia.</p> <p>\u201cVirtual reality is an amazing tool in terms of being able to show you the really solid causal relationships - this is what you do today, and here\u2019s what might happen 100 years down the road,\u201d she said. </p> <p>The research is part of an emerging field that uses virtual reality to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/sep/08/electronic-empathy-virtual-reality-pokemon-go-oculus\">enhance empathy</a>. In <a href=\"https://vhil.stanford.edu/mm/2013/ahn-mp-embodied-experiences.pdf\">a 2013 study</a> co-authored by Ahn, volunteers who were given virtual reality headsets that simulated red-green colour-blindness spent twice as long helping those with the condition compared to participants who merely imagined it. </p> <p>\u201cWe were quite encouraged by these results and we wanted to take it to the next level to check if people could take the perspective of, not just other people, but also other animate beings, including animals,\u201d Ahn explained. </p> <p>One of the unsolved challenges for virtual reality is simulating touch, in order to convince users that they truly inhabit their virtual bodies. In Ahn\u2019s experiment, some participants were prodded in real life to make being virtually poked with a cattle prod or bumped by a fishing net as coral feel more real.</p> <p>The study, which also involved researchers from Stanford University and the University of Connecticut and was recently published in the <em>Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication</em>, does not claim virtual reality produces instantaneous transformations in levels of environmental compassion. But it does argue it could be used as a valuable tool in promoting ecological awareness. </p> <p>After taking off their headsets, \u201cpeople said \u2018that\u2019s really cool, I\u2019ve never thought about it this way\u2019,\u201d said Ahn. </p> <p>A short period as a virtual cow is unlikely to leave someone \u201creborn into this person who has a thorough interest in environmental issues,\u201d she acknowledged, but longer-term exposure \u2013 perhaps during school \u2013 could be \u201ca lot more effective\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cI believe that it\u2019s able to amplify the qualities that you already have,\u201d Ahn added. </p>",

The US, for example, has a greenhouse gas footprint of <a href=\"http:// http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/overview.php?v=CO2ts_pc1990-2013\" rel=\"nofollow\">16.5 tonnes per person</a>.</p> <p>The city, the world\u2019s northernmost capital, has a population of just over 120,000, with 60% of Iceland\u2019s population in its metropolitan area.

To solve that Reykjav\u00edk plans to keep investing in bike paths (it has a \u00a33.3m budget for this year), install more electric car charging points, and work with six neighbouring municipalities on a new rapid bus or light rail system. </p> <p>The city already has a bus system but it is only used by 4% of people \u2013 and it aims to treble public transport usage by 2030. It wants cycling to increase from 19% to more than 30%, and is encouraging electric car use in its own 9,000 public employees and others via free parking and lower taxes.</p> <p>Solving its \u201curban growth quandary\u201d is key to reducing the transport-related 80% of emissions, says \u00deorsteinn Hermannsson, city director of transport and urban design. \u201cAround 75% of all trips in the Reykjav\u00edk area are by car, so a low-hanging fruit is to get people to walk or bike or use more energy-efficient public transportation,\u201d he says. \u201cWe tend to use our car as our overcoat instead of dressing up and walking 1km.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4c13baa1dedbe906e2a04e4daa6e709be94e754\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4c13baa1dedbe906e2a04e4daa6e709be94e754/0_329_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Geothermal pool\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thanks to Iceland\u2019s geothermal features, all houses in Reykjav\u00edk\u2019s have geothermal heating.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Brabiner / Alamy/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Stopping urban sprawl</h2> <p>Hermannsson is embarking on a project to persuade residents to live in the city, not suburbs. \u201cThe Reykjav\u00edk area is quite sprawled, like an American city, and that\u2019s reflected in the private car choice,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to grow inwards instead of outwards and people living closer to work and shops will mean they move differently.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/04/gurgaon-life-city-built-private-companies-india-intel-google\">Gurgaon: what life is like in the Indian city built by private companies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>City surveys suggest young people are keen to live in the city, and public transport expert Jarrett Walker \u2013 who ran executive workshops for the area last year \u2013 says the current sprawl is a real problem. \u201cCarbon neutrality always comes down to urban form,\u201d he says. \u201cOutside the small historic centre Reykjav\u00edk is mostly high-density sprawl: apartment blocks oriented towards motorways or fast streets rather than to pedestrian infrastructure or logical public transport paths. Many people in these towers can\u2019t even walk to a convenience store.\u201d</p> <p>Developers are keen to exploit \u201cbrownfield\u201d spaces. \u00deorvaldur Gissurarson, owner and chief executive of \u00deGverk and Arcus companies, is building a Hafnartorg (\u201charbour city\u201d) development of retail, offices and 80 apartments in prime downtown. \u201cDowntown hasn\u2019t had that high density we see in many countries due to city planning issues restricting the number of apartments, and prices. The city [authority] needed to change.\u201d</p> <h2>Business support</h2> <p>Companies are also on board. Last year, the Icelandic centre for corporate social responsibility, Festa, encouraged 104 company leaders to sign a pledge to measure and reduce waste and emissions. Managing director Ketill Magn\u00fasson believes there\u2019s genuine will to change, as well as cash-saving motivations, and adds: \u201cThis is something capitals in the Nordic region are doing \u2013 there\u2019s peer pressure between mayors.\u201d</p> <p>One of those corporate leaders who signed the pledge was Erna Eir\u00edksd\u00f3ttir, senior manager of investor relations at Eimskip shipping. She said waste and energy reduction make business and environmental sense. Its long-distance ships cannot currently be electric powered (although Iceland is installing electric chargers for fishing vessels). \u201cWe should be able to do it if we motivate each other, but we may have to compromise between convenience and what it costs in time,\u201d she says.</p> <p>As well as tourists, better green credentials could also increase the city\u2019s attractiveness as an international conference location halfway across the Atlantic, says \u00c1shildur Bragad\u00f3ttir, director of Visit Reykjav\u00edk tourist body. \u201cWe have the <a href=\"http://www.visitreykjavik.is/krysuvik-geothermal-area\" rel=\"nofollow\">geysers</a>, great water pools, glaciers, volcanos \u2013 the landscape is constantly changing because of eruptions, earthquakes and climate change.In Reykjav\u00edk, I think we are more concerned about nature than perhaps other nations because we are so connected to our island, landscape and natural wonders.\u201d</p>",
