  "<p>There are many sides to the refugee debate in Australia, but an overarching question is this: how can we create a more sustainable and humane policy that accords with international law?</p> <p>I was challenged to identify a single intervention that could have this effect. It seemed a formidable task, but the answer is quite simple if we go back to first principles.</p> <p>We could insert a legislative requirement that Australian law must be interpreted in good faith, in accordance with our responsibilities under international refugee law and international human rights law.</p> <p>In most democratic countries, no one would blink at such a proposal. It simply reflects basic rules of international law. It\u2019s sobering that in Australia, a provision like this would be seen as radical.</p> <p>Australia is the only country whose law explicitly says it is \u201cirrelevant\u201d whether or not our <em>non-refoulement </em>obligations are engaged when removing an asylum seeker. Indeed, under the Migration Act, an official\u2019s duty to remove such a person \u201carises irrespective of whether there has been an assessment, according to law, of Australia\u2019s <em>non-refoulement</em> obligations in respect of the non-citizen.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-2000-leaked-reports-reveal-scale-of-abuse-of-children-in-australian-offshore-detention\">The Nauru files: cache of 2,000 leaked reports reveal scale of abuse of children in Australian offshore detention</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The principle of <em>non-refoulement</em> is the cornerstone of the international refugee regime. If there is one thing on which all states agree \u2013 even those that are not parties to the Refugee Convention \u2013 it is that this principle is sacrosanct. It prohibits the return of people to places where they risk being persecuted, tortured, subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, or arbitrarily deprived of life. </p> <p>This September, the principle will be reaffirmed unreservedly in the political declaration that world leaders will adopt at the UN secretary general\u2019s summit on refugees in New York.</p> <p>To my knowledge, Australia is also the only country to have deleted all references to the refugee convention from its domestic law. Instead, it has replaced them with a \u201cself-contained statutory framework\u201d setting out Australia\u2019s own interpretation of its protection obligations under the refugee convention. International law makes clear that states do not have the right to auto-interpret their treaty obligations. </p> <p>Basic rules of treaty interpretation state that a treaty must be interpreted in good faith, and in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context, and in the light of the treaty\u2019s object and purpose. Furthermore, asserting that a treaty obligation is inconsistent with domestic law provides no justification for breaching it.</p> <p>If Australia did insert a legislative provision requiring a principled, good faith interpretation in accordance with international refugee law and international human rights law, our approach to asylum would necessarily change.</p> <p>For a start, it would flip our focus towards the responsibility to provide protection, as part of a global cooperative effort, rather than deflecting those in need. It would mean that people seeking asylum would live among us in the Australian community, not in closed mandatory detention. </p> <p>Offshore processing could not continue, and families would not be separated. Children\u2019s best interests would be a primary consideration in every decision affecting them. Refugees would be welcomed into Australian society quickly, resulting in greater cultural, economic and social benefits over time. People would not be pushed back at sea without the opportunity to have their protection claim thoroughly examined and reviewed. </p> <p>Principled, effective and transparent refugee status determination in Australia would be reinstated, with well-trained decision-makers, access to legal assistance, and robust independent merits and judicial review.</p> <p>All this might sound like wishful thinking in today\u2019s political climate. But each element reflects a feasible past practice in Australian asylum policy.</p> <p>By learning from history and effective practices, we could model \u201cprotection in action\u201d. In turn, we could help to grow the capacity for protection and assistance within our region. We would regain our international reputation as a welcoming country that respects human rights and the rule of law \u2026 and we would also save a lot of money.</p> <p>The drafters of the refugee convention \u2013 including Australia\u2019s representative \u2013 were well aware that refugee protection was not a way to short-circuit migration controls. In fact, the refugee regime requires the most stringent checks of all. But what they also recognised was that never again should the world bear witness to millions of people fleeing for safety and being turned away.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/22/the-claim-that-locking-asylum-seekers-up-in-nauru-and-png-saves-lives-is-bogus\">The claim that locking asylum seekers up in Nauru and PNG saves lives is bogus | Philippe Legrain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Refugees and other vulnerable migrants embark on dangerous land and sea journeys because there are no safe alternatives.

We must develop and promote durable, legal and humane solutions for people in need of protection.

  "<p>Sports Direct is braced for a fierce investor revolt at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting this week as another influential City investor declared it would vote against the reappointment of chairman Keith Hellawell.</p> <p> Hermes Investment Management, which manages and advises on \u00a3215bn of assets, is the latest to call for Hellawell to go, saying it will vote against his reappointment on Wednesday.

  "<p>A raft of data published this week will offer the latest health check on the state of the UK economy following June\u2019s vote to leave the EU, with economists expecting the figures to suggest businesses were so far \u201cproving resilient\u201d. </p> <p>On Monday, figures will show how confidence is holding up in the UK service sector, from the latest survey of purchasing managers. Andrew Sentance, senior economics adviser at PwC, said the update would be the most closely scrutinised of all the data due this week after<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/22/britains-economy-shrinking-at-fastest-rate-since-2009-says-survey\"> activity and orders in July were found to have contracted at the fastest rate since early 2009</a>.</p> <p>\u201cPeople will be looking very closely to see if there is a bounce back in confidence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/uk-factories-bounce-back-brexit-shock-eu-referendum-manufacturing-sector\">as we saw in last week\u2019s PMI survey for manufacturing</a>, and it would not be surprising if there is,\u201d he said. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/04/morrisons-cut-food-prices-12-percent-uk-deflation\">Morrisons to slash food prices by up to 12%</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sentance said it was possible that the business mood in July \u201cwas affected by the shock of the vote and the political fallout\u201d. He added: \u201cSpeaking to businesses it seems confidence has improved as they have realised that the UK economy is not falling off a cliff.\u201d</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said he expected the industry survey to show \u201cmodest expansion\u201d in August. \u201cBoth the manufacturing (especially) and construction (to a limited extent) surveys have shown activity picking up in August after marked weakness in July, and we suspect that this will be the case for the services sector as well,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>Although he added that there were likely to be falls in activity in sectors involving commercial property and house sales, which have both taken a hit since the vote to leave. </p> <p>Archer was generally upbeat about this week\u2019s slew of data, some of which is covering the post-referendum period for the first time. \u201cThere is likely to be further evidence that the economy is proving resilient so far following June\u2019s Brexit vote,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>Sentance said unless there was anything shocking in this week\u2019s figures \u201cit would reinforce the view that the economy might not grow that quickly in the short term but will hold up reasonably well in the final quarter\u201d.</p> <p>Consumer spending appears not to have taken a knock, with shoppers who are spending getting more for their money. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/04/morrisons-cut-food-prices-12-percent-uk-deflation\">Morrisons launched a new grocery price war at the weekend</a>, and food prices have been tumbling. The latest index from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and industry analysts Nielsen showed a 1.1% fall in prices in August, following a 0.8% drop in July. <br></p> <p>Meanwhile the cost of non-food items fell by 2.5% over the month, compared with a 2.2% drop in July. The report said a combination of promotional activity by retailers, softening oil prices and a global glut of wheat had all pushed down prices.</p> <p>When the BRC releases a separate report on retail sales on Tuesday, Archer said he expected the numbers to be healthy, with low prices and rising pay supporting consumer spending. The CBI has already published data covering the first half of the month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/25/cbi-retail-sales-growth-expected-to-slow-after-summer-bounce\">which showed a summer bounce in sales,</a> while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/18/uk-retail-sales-rise-july-shoppers-shrug-off-brexit-gloom\">Office for National Statistics reported a 1.4% increase in July</a>.</p> <p>\u201cRetail sales appear to have been helped in August, as they were in July, by good weather lifting demand for clothing,\u201d said Archer, adding that they may also have been boosted by the feelgood factor of Team GB\u2019s Olympics success, and by visiting tourists exploiting the weakness of the pound to splash out on luxury goods. However, Archer warned that consumer purchasing power could wane as companies look to limit pay increases and inflation rises.</p> <p>Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said that prices could start to rise given the devaluation of sterling following the referendum result. \u201cBut that\u2019s likely to take several months to properly feed through, given that retailers won\u2019t feel the brunt of the cost increases until existing contracts with foreign suppliers come to an end,\u201d she said. <br></p> <p>\u201cEven then, retailers will have to make a decision about when and how much to pass onto consumers. Given the strength of competition in the market, and if the economy softens in line with predictions, any pass through may be more limited than implied by the exchange rate movement.\u201d</p> <p>Official figures on manufacturing and construction due out this week are for July, and only cover the very early days after the referendum. Archer said he expected the ONS data on manufacturing output to show a 0.7% fall month-on-month, with some work having been postponed or cancelled as a result of uncertainty in the immediate aftermath of the vote. Sentance said he would be looking at the figures for capital goods as an early indicator of whether businesses were still investing. However, he said it was very early to reach conclusions on the impact of Brexit. This was echoed by the manufacturing employers group EEF, which said its members were seeing \u201ca mixed picture\u201d so far.</p> <p>Its latest manufacturing outlook survey, produced with accountants BDO, showed that in the third quarter of the year activity levels remained largely unchanged but that confidence in the overall UK economy had taken a knock. Mechanical equipment suffered a big decline but export orders had exceeded expectations, particularly for electronics and electrical equipment. And while recruitment of new employees had fallen, EEF\u2019s members said they did expect to take more people on in the future. </p> <p>Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, said: \u201cSigns of an export revival are helping to drive more optimism about activity in the second half of the year, but concerns about whether the UK economy can shrug off post-referendum challenges is clearly evident.\u201d </p> <p>She added: \u201cThese risks are expected to hit some sectors \u2013 such as industries linked to investment goods and construction \u2013 harder than others. Despite the short-term outlook for manufacturing remaining broadly stable, the continued downward slide in investment plans should keep policy makers alive to the potential risks facing the sector.\u201d</p>",

The report recommends turning that into a type of emissions trading scheme, since polluters could buy carbon credits in order to go over the baseline.</p> <p>The dissenters criticised it for not being a pure emissions trading scheme, since polluters did not generate credits by emitting below that baseline. That left them with no incentive to reduce emissions further, they said.</p> <p>They said the bureaucracy required to manage an expanded ERF would be enormous, expensive and unreliable, and \u201cencourages the emergence of an army of consultants who know how to work the system\u201d.</p> <p>The product was a \u201cdog\u2019s breakfast\u201d suite of recommendations dressed up as a \u201cpolicy toolkit\u201d by the authority, they said.</p> <p>Karoly and Hamilton produced their own set of 28 recommendations, which include adopting a carbon budget approach to setting climate policy, which reflects the agreement made in Paris to stay \u201cwell below\u201d 2C.</p> <p>They recommend the abolition of the ERF, and establishment of a simpler cap-and-trade scheme for most sectors, with the possibility of an emissions-intensity scheme for the electricity sector. They said the baseline for the electricity sector must reach zero emissions by 2035.</p> <p>They also urged government to consider closing the dirtiest brown-coal power plants, through a bidding process, with payments for closure funded by a mandatory charge on other generators, who would benefit from the reduced supply to the market.</p> <p>They agreed with the majority report\u2019s call for emissions standards for light and heavy vehicles but also recommend that the commonwealth play a more active role in planning for zero-emissions public transport.</p> <p>Hamilton said in a statement: \u201cThe evidence suggests that most Australians want stronger action on climate change, and we hope that policy makers are not spooked by the feat campaigns of the recent past. Climate change is too big and too important.\u201d</p> <p>Frydenberg dismissed the minority report on ABC radio on Monday morning. \u201cNow, the two people on that board have had a different view but the vast majority of the those board members have signed on to the report that was submitted to the government and announced last week.\u201d</p> <p>Asked whether the government would strengthen the country\u2019s 2030 emissions reduction targets, Frydenberg was guarded, postponing the question for a review of climate policy scheduled for 2017.</p> <p>\u201cLook we\u2019ll wait and see what happens next year in 2017.

  "<p>Little things can mean a lot. The minutiae of diplomatic protocol seem trivial when the subjects on the G20\u2019s table are so huge, including climate change, global economic growth, tensions in the South China Sea and \u2013 for the UK \u2013 the fall-out from the vote for Brexit.

Only the US president had to use what one might call the Naughty Steps, an uncarpeted flight descending from the bowels of the plane.</p> <p>Cock-up or conspiracy? Chinese arrangements can be surprisingly last minute, and official visits <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/11/queen-chinese-officials-very-rude-xi-jinping-state-visit\" title=\"\">are frequently tense</a>. But at the very minimum, it shows a telling carelessness from a nation so consumed by presentational issues that rooftops in the host city of Hangzhou <a href=\"http://qz.com/768676/how-to-host-a-successful-international-event-from-the-g20-to-the-olympics-just-like-beijing/\" title=\"\">were reportedly repainted</a> to improve aerial views. The G20 is supposed to reinforce the country\u2019s standing as a major power; the row has made China look petty, bolshy and graceless, rather than confident and magnanimous. Had the Chinese president received this welcome at a US-hosted summit, the cries that the US had hurt the feelings of the Chinese people would have been deafening.</p> <p>That formulation, peculiar to western ears from a country so large and powerful, has a potent history behind it. Xi Jinping has doubled down on the Communist party\u2019s heavy promotion of the idea of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/05/rows-japan-china-historical-grievances\" title=\"\">a \u201ccentury of humiliation\u201d</a> at the hands of foreign powers, from the Opium wars onwards. Without a democratic mandate, its leadership rests on its provision of a better standard of living (a task getting harder by the year) and its restoration of national pride. Deng Xiaoping, focused on domestic development, urged his country to \u201chide our brightness, bide our time\u201d. As China began to reemerge as a world power, some in the region feared a new Goliath. But the country itself thought it was David, still kicked about by bullies.</p> <p>Then, in late 2008, came the global financial crisis. Beijing began to believe the hype that China had saved the world. It read Mr Obama\u2019s attempt to reset relations as a sign of weakness, and was alarmed by his subsequent \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia. Not unreasonably, it believes the US wants to maintain its power in the Pacific and contain China\u2019s rise. It chafes at criticism from western powers that portray themselves as disinterested moral voices even when the stakes are evident and even though, in their own ascendancy, they bullied and beat down others. As rising states do, it is pushing the boundaries. It wants to reshape international institutions created in a very different age, and will build its own if others resist.</p> <p>It is not only, or even primarily, the west that is alarmed by China\u2019s more xenophobic tone and increasingly forceful stance. The irony is that Beijing wanted the summit to present a more attractive image to the world, highlighting its global contribution. It wants to reshape the G20 into a more effective format, tackling problems strategically instead of summoning ad hoc responses to the latest crisis. It wants to portray itself as a bridge between the \u201cglobal south\u201d and \u201cglobal north\u201d, hence the invitation of countries such as Chad. It has flagged up space cooperation and its peacekeeping contribution. And then it undid its hard work with a foolish row on an airport runway.</p> <p>The dangers of misplaying its hand are evident at home, too, as Sunday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/26/liberate-hong-kong-calls-independence-china-elections-loom\" title=\"\">legislative council elections in Hong Kong</a> demonstrate. The region enjoys considerable autonomy under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework introduced on its return to China, but the party\u2019s tightening grip has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/29/-sp-hong-kong-protests-more-join-crowds-urged-keep-going-national-holiday\" title=\"\">alienated large parts of the community</a>, who now see themselves primarily as Hong Kongers rather than Chinese citizens and who are even, in some cases, prepared to support independence calls they would previously have shunned as ridiculous. While some are intimidated into taking Beijing\u2019s line, others are pushed into confrontation.</p> <p>The conclusions for China are obvious, though it does not appear to be drawing them. Other countries have much to learn too. They should continue to push back on issues from China\u2019s actions in the South China Sea to the sweeping crackdown under Mr Xi\u2019s leadership and attempts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jun/02/chinese-foreign-minister-canada-angry-human-rights-question\" title=\"\">export its controls on expression</a>. But they must also help to build a positive role for China in the world \u2013 even when, as Mr Obama\u2019s arrival shows, engagement is far from easy.</p>",
  "<p>The arguments <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/30/nobel-winners-slam-greenpeace-for-anti-gm-campaign\" title=\"\">about GM crops</a> show the folly of trying to understand technology as if it stood outside political and economic power. There is nothing intrinsically wicked about manipulating genes directly, rather than through selective breeding. What is wrong and must be combatted is the use of this technology to exploit some of the poorest farmers in the world for the benefit of some of the richest corporations. The struggle between Monsanto and the Indian government shows this clearly.</p> <p>GM cotton has transformed the Indian cotton industry since its introduction in the early years of this century. Grafting into the DNA of cotton plants <a href=\"http://archive.bio.ed.ac.uk/jdeacon/microbes/bt.htm\" title=\"\">some genes from a common bacterium</a> which make them poisonous to the insects that normally consume them has made it possible to grow cotton more efficiently with less use of pesticides. This has made India the second largest cotton exporter in the world. There are two snags. Many people, not just in the west, are deeply concerned by the unintended consequences of GM, and the Indian cotton boom depends on a single company \u2013 Monsanto \u2013 which has a deservedly bad reputation and a monopoly over the technology in India.</p> <p>The seed has to be brought afresh every year, and from time to time the genetic recipe has to be tweaked as parasites develop an immunity to the originally grafted poisons. The struggle between parasites and their hosts is a constant feature of evolution and widespread use of these particular bacterial poisons produces a correspondingly strong selection pressure for resistance in parasites.</p> <p>These two factors assure Monsanto of a steady income stream. That is offensive both <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/blogs/time-for-monsanto-quit-india-2996995/\" title=\"\">to Indian nationalists</a> and some Green activists. Certainly, Monsanto\u2019s position, extracting rents from farmers for the enrichment of foreign shareholders, fits into a long Indian history of such exploitation, not least by the British empire. But that same history shows that the ruthless exploitation of poor farmers does not result from technology. It is oppressive landlords, heavy taxes and rapacious money-lenders who grind them into the dust. And it is difficult to believe the claims for the superiority of native seeds when farmers themselves are willing to pay a premium for the GM version.</p> <p>The Indian government has been trying to cut that premium and reduce the price of GM seed. Earlier this year it slashed the royalties payable by Indian intermediary companies to Monsanto; some had been withholding royalties, claiming they could not afford them. Now Monsanto has retaliated <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a5ffb0c2-6a80-11e6-a0b1-d87a9fea034f.html\" title=\"\">with an announcement</a> that it will not be releasing in India the next generation of its cotton seeds, upgraded to overcome the resistance that has evolved in the past five years.</p> <p>This looks like a hardball negotiating tactic. A fair price needs to emerge from these negotiations, even if multinational corporations have no concept of a fair price, only of profit. The Indian government is right to defend the interests of its farmers; in this instance the GM seed is actually useful to them and to the cotton industry. GM crops cannot provide a miraculous and permanent solution to the problem of agricultural pests, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/20/the-guardian-view-on-antibiotic-resistance-a-clear-and-present-danger\" title=\"\">any more than antibiotics</a> provide a miraculous and permanent solution to the problem of human infections. In both cases nature will fight back. That does not make their benefits less real.</p>",

  "<p>Calm, cautious, careful, with a dash of determined optimism and opportunities for all: such has been the impression created by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/30/theresa-may-launches-tory-leadership-bid-with-pledge-to-unite-country\" title=\"\">Theresa May in her first two months as prime minister</a>.

An EU&#xa0;summit would have been complicated for obvious reasons. The G7 makes the UK look smaller and poorer than it is.

With David Cameron, there was always just a hint of the end of empire. The accent, the bearing, the nocturnal tantrum at an early EU summit, all limited his international appeal. If Tony Blair had continued as the convinced European he started out, the UK would surely not be where it is today. Although he has retained something of the salesman \u2013 silver-tongued, but over-promising. Internationalist ambition, and an unrealistic idea of the country\u2019s power, got the better of him.</p> <p>Theresa May, on first acquaintance at least, has less baggage. There is a technocratic anonymity about her; a notable absence of ideology or ostentation, which was evident at the start of her trip to China. Visually, she and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, seemed almost indistinguishable from the British Airways staff at the top of the aircraft steps.

Hence, to an extent, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s appeal. There is surely room for a review of whether going back \u201ceast of Suez\u201d was really such a good idea. Brexit means that May must urgently reconsider what sort of international player the UK really wants to be.</p> <p>If the answer is more regional than&#xa0;global, then this is where the relevance to the UK of Europe, if not of the EU, may return. As May set off for China, defeated remainers thronged British streets to insist on their EU allegiance. It is a bit late, alas, for that.

  "<p>The director of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/v-and-a\">V&amp;A</a>, Martin Roth, is expected to resign this week and return to his native Germany in a decision fuelled by his disillusionment at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron\">Brexit vote</a>.</p> <p>Roth was appointed in 2011, becoming the first foreign director of the V&amp;A since it was founded in 1852. Sunday newspaper reports in both the UK and Germany said he would tell V&amp;A staff of his decision to leave on Monday.</p> <p>He is likely to publicly outline his reasons for leaving at some point this week, with Brexit apparently having played a part. In interviews with the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.dw.com/en/martin-roth-on-brexit-me-first-mentality-spreading-through-europe-is-brutal/a-19352465\">German broadcaster DW</a>, he said the vote to leave Europe felt like a personal defeat and he was particularly upset to hear aggressive \u201cwar rhetoric\u201d used during the debate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jul/06/unforgettable-va-wins-museum-of-the-year-award\">'Unforgettable' V&amp;A wins museum of the year award</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For Roth, born in Stuttgart in 1955, the issues were personal. \u201cFor me, Europe is simply synonymous with peace,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be a German. I did not want to grow up in a country that had killed a huge part of its population. So for me, Europe always gave hope for a peaceful future, based on sharing, solidarity and tolerance. Dropping out always means creating cultural barriers and that worries me.\u201d</p> <p>Roth replaced Sir Mark Jones as director of the V&amp;A and immediately pledged to make it more international. He has always seen himself as a European, once telling an interviewer: \u201cIf you are German and you are born in 1955, you are not proud to be German.\u201d Always impeccably dressed, he said in an interview with Country Life that one noticeable regret about living in the UK was the sartorial standards. \u201cThe sad thing for me is that nobody seems to wear a tie in London any longer \u2013 only the security guards.\u201d</p> <p>Before the vote he described the referendum debate as toxic. He said: \u201cJust the thought that we could be ruining everything our parents\u2019 generation achieved \u2013 a policy of peace, reconciliation and common thought \u2013 is quite a horrible perspective.\u201d</p> <p>Roth, who oversaw the vast <a href=\"http://www.skd.museum/en/\">Dresden State Art Collections</a> before moving to London, is enormously respected in the British museum world. His tenure has included some of the most successful exhibitions \u2013 in terms of visitor numbers \u2013 ever put on at the V&amp;A, including the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/aug/03/alexander-mcqueen-show-savage-beauty-most-popular-victoria-and-albert-history\">Alexander McQueen retrospective</a> and the global touring success of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/11/david-bowie-is-exhibition-300-items-13m-visitors-but-no-bakelite-saxophone\">David Bowie Is</a>.

  "<p>Nine books will be published this year <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=hygge\">featuring the Danish concept of <em>hygge</em></a> in their title. Such a glut brings a whiff of a bandwagon (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/10/perfect-people-nordic-miracle-michael-booth-review\">for whose initial momentum I suspect I am partly responsible</a>), but <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/say-hello-to-hygge-the-danish-secret-to-happiness/\">if the Telegraph is to be believed</a>, <em>hygge</em> (make a little moue and say \u201choogah\u201d), is the big new wellness trend, here with scented candles and woollen socks to make us feel better about the deaths of all those famous people this year.</p> <p>It is usually claimed there is no English word for the Danes\u2019 uncanny ability to make any situation \u2013 be it family get-together, traffic jam, or failed climate conference \u2013 cosy. Oops, there it is: cosy. That\u2019s what <em>hygge</em> means. It is no great mystery, nor is it even unique to the Danes. The Germans call it <em>gem\u00fctlich</em>, the Dutch, <em>gezelligheid</em>. In English, \u201cconvivial\u201d pretty much covers it, too.</p> <p>True, the Danes are very, very good at keeping things cosy. Like Hobbits. Or aunties. It is their superpower. Having lived among them (Danes, that is) for some years, I have learned a few of their secrets. Yes, light some candles, open a bottle of wine, and try to forget about your credit card balance. The Danes give especially good Christmas, for instance, but is it the secret of their famed happiness, as these books claim?</p> <p>I suspect happiness is a little more complicated. Here\u2019s my stab at why the Danes are such a satisfied bunch: They are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita\">rich</a>, sexy and <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/gallery/news/economy/2013/07/10/worlds-shortest-work-weeks/2.html\">don\u2019t work very much</a>; they also take <a href=\"http://www.opposingviews.com/i/society/worlds-happiest-countries-take-most-antidepressants\">more antidepressants than virtually anyone else in the world</a>, and, yes, they <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption_per_capita\">like a drink</a> and <a href=\"http://www.confectionerynews.com/Ingredients/Ireland-and-Denmark-top-confectionery-consumption-charts\">eat more confectionery</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/2009/sep/02/meat-consumption-per-capita-climate-change\">bacon</a> per capita than most.</p> <p><em>Hygge</em> is a good thing though, surely? It requires equality of participation (it is not <em>hyggelige</em> for one person to hog the limelight, that\u2019s what Americans do); it is predicated on participants living in the moment (\u201cIsn\u2019t this Viking recreation weekend <em>hyggelige</em> [the weekend that we are experiencing right here, right now]?\u201d), and <em>hygge</em> makes good use of the Danes\u2019 ability to use humour to prick pretentions. Also, I have never encountered a people more prone to communal singing. But there is a dark side to <em>hygge</em>. All right, a slight shadow (and not just the singing).</p> <p>With its relentless drive towards the middle ground and its dependence on keeping things light and breezy, <em>hygge</em> does get a bit boring sometimes. Worse, British anthropologist Richard Jenkins has described it as \u201cnormative to the point of coercive\u201d. If you don\u2019t know the rules, if you like to discuss politics or religion or anything other than your holidays, <em>hygge</em>\u2019s appeal may be short-lived. This is likely to be one reason why Denmark ranked an <em>uhyggelige </em>65th out of 67 countries in a new survey of <a href=\"https://www.internations.org/expat-insider/\">expats\u2019 quality of life</a>.</p> <p>A while back, I appeared on the Danish equivalent of Radio 4\u2019s Today programme and remarked on the irony that, while being vocal critics of others\u2019 extremist tendencies, the Danes seemed prone to extremism: in happiness, taxes, their welfare state and the happy pills. Above all, in <em>hygge</em>.</p> <p>\u201cHa, yes,\u201d laughed the sound engineer, as I left. \u201cIt\u2019s true. We are extremists. We are the <em>hygge</em> jihad!\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/almost-nearly-perfect-people-252012.html\"><em>The Almost Nearly Perfect People: Behind the Myth of the Scandinavian Utopia</em></a><em> by Michael Booth is out now (Vintage).</em></p>",
  "<p>The possibility of Paralympic athletes abusing the official classification of their disabilities to improve medal prospects was raised by senior UK Athletics (UKA) officials more than two years ago, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>Mike Cavendish, the performance programme manager at British Athletics, said in an internal email that there were concerns some athletes were intentionally seeking to be placed in classes perceived as having less challenging opposition.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/02/inquiry-paralympic-classification-uk-athletics\">Inquiry into UK Paralympic classification to be launched after Rio Games</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Participants in Paralympic events are grouped into categories according to the degree of their disability so that competitions are fair, but concerns across all Paralympic sports about incorrect categorisation have been increasing globally as the sport has developed.</p> <p>The Guardian revealed on Friday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/02/inquiry-paralympic-classification-uk-athletics\">UKA was preparing to launch an inquiry</a> into the classification of athletes following claims that some have been allowed to compete against those who are significantly more impaired. </p> <p>It can now be revealed that Cavendish said the majority of athletes who had been entered into the wrong Paralympic classification had done nothing wrong, but that others were \u201cthought to have knowingly pursued classifications that they know to be incorrect, simply to gain a competitive advantage\u201d.</p> <p>It also emerged this weekend that one of Britain\u2019s Paralympians had withdrawn from the sport over the classification process.

UK Athletics is not responsible for the classification of any of its athletes competing internationally.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe system for classifying disabilities in Paralympic competitions is highly complex, involving a wide range of physical conditions and requiring detailed analytical processes,\u201d she added. </p> <p>\u201cUK Athletics is confident of the classification of all British athletes who will be competing in Rio and we always cooperate 100% with the IPC to ensure that all GB athletes are correctly classified in line with international rules.</p> <p>\u201cWhere concerns have been raised, UKA have correctly responded by requesting that the IPC check medical and procedural records to either ratify or change the athlete classification.

On the stoop stood several social workers from the state\u2019s department of human resources, responsible for child protection services.</p> <p>\u201cThey had seen my mugshot and they came out with the intention of taking our foster kids and our granddaughter if we could not prove that my mugshot with those charges was false,\u201d Lakey said in a south Texas brogue.</p> <p>The agony lasted for the four hours it took to reach the Blount County officer responsible for sexual abuse cases, who confirmed that Lakey was not a child molester.</p> <p>Just Busted printed a series of retractions, but locals\u2019 suspicions festered and grew. Death stares on the street escalated.</p> <p>\u201cA few days after the magazine article came out my wife started receiving [anonymous] threatening phone calls from people telling her I was gonna get what I had coming to me and if she knew what was good for her she would pack her and the kids up and leave, that [I was going to] get beat up or killed,\u201d Lakey said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3d9cc6470e464d5a6870e16f5a6373bfd363bac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3d9cc6470e464d5a6870e16f5a6373bfd363bac/0_0_1090_1378/791.png\" alt=\"Michael Lakey\u2019s mugshot in Just Busted erroneously describes him as having been charged with child sex abuse.\" width=\"791\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Lakey\u2019s mugshot in Just Busted erroneously describes him as having been charged with child sex abuse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: none</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their home was vandalised on numerous occasions.</p> <p>Months later, shortly after his wife died, Lakey and his granddaughter packed up and left Hayden for Texas.</p> <p>Then last year, Lakey successfully sued Just Busted for defamation, winning a five-figure sum. He said that publishing mugshots before suspects have been tried undermined a sacred tenet of American jurisprudence and hoped his case would force Just Busted to change its ways.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody\u2019s innocent until proven guilty,\u201d he said before taking the stand in December in Jefferson County court in Birmingham. \u201cBut if you put somebody in a magazine like that you\u2019re already saying that they\u2019re guilty to the community.\u201d</p> <p>His attorney, James Morgan, believes that these publications are not the crime-stopping news organizations they claim to be. \u201c[They] deal in schadenfreude \u2026allowing an audience to view people at their worst and to ridicule them.\u201d He points out Just Busted\u2019s regular \u201cDrunk Tank\u201d and \u201cSticky Fingers\u201d sections in which the inebriated and suspected thieves are singled out for mockery.</p> <p>During testimony, Just Busted\u2019s editor explained how the tabloid is compiled.</p> <p>Matthew DeGlopper, the paper\u2019s editor, explained that he did not employ a copy editor or fact-checker to guard against errors. Each issue is put together by a graphic artist rather than a journalist.</p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Lakey is not the paper\u2019s first victim of an egregious error. A previous designer had made five mistakes in seven issues. And in 2014, a Sevierville, Tennessee, man sued Just Busted for defamation, saying he was wrongly described as a rape suspect; that suit was eventually settled.</p> <h2>A \u2018deprivation of liberty\u2019</h2> <p>Just Busted is a major player in the mugshot publication market with titles across several states. But since 2010, copycats have sprouted across the country: Gotcha! covers central Virginia, the Hard Times in Alabama, Green Mountain Mugshots in Vermont, Jailbirds Rocks in Oklahoma. </p> <p>There are others who have been defamed by mugshot magazines, including James Suddarth, a 46-year-old Charlottesville, Virginia, man who successfully sued for defamation in 2012 after the Crime Times wrongly labelled him as a felon who had fired a gun in a public building.</p> <p>Some mugshot websites have also failed in their fact-checking duties. A lawsuit that gained <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/08/mugshot-websites-stop-charging-photo-removal\">national attention in 2014</a> was filed after people complained about being charged hundreds of dollars to remove the mugshots even if the cases against those arrested had been dropped. Two sites eventually settled the suit and agreed to stop charging.</p> <p>Mugshot publications and free-press advocates argue that they are providing a civic service, and one of Just Busted\u2019s owners, Wanda Gilham, said in December that her magazines have led to the capture of fugitives.</p> <p>In 2011, a woman who had been been sexually assaulted three years earlier in Saginaw, Michigan, <a href=\"http://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw/index.ssf/2013/02/first-degree_sexual_assault_co.html\">identified James W Gunn</a> as her attacker only after seeing his picture in a local mugshot magazine after he had been arrested on a separate charge.</p> <p>Scott Ciolek, an Ohio-based attorney who brought the 2014 lawsuit, said that cases such as Lakey\u2019s are extremely hard to win, which does little to incentivise editors to take measures to prevent defamation. </p> <p>\u201cWhen a magazine makes mistakes like this they will argue that the error was made by the local sheriff\u2019s office,\u201d Ciolek said. \u201cAnd in most states, sheriff\u2019s departments have immunity from tort liability.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e49d4d3982259986837cad46e50a277ca471f21a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e49d4d3982259986837cad46e50a277ca471f21a/0_0_508_246/500.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Lakey looking at Just Busted magazine before his case.\" width=\"500\" height=\"242\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Lakey looking at Just Busted magazine before his case.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johnny McDevitt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ciolek, who says there are at least 200 mugshot publications across the country, went on to say that while regulating mugshot magazines seems unlikely, there are other options available to reign in \u201cfly-by-night operations\u201d. He pointed to the FBI\u2019s discretionary policy on the availability of booking photos as one that could be rolled out to other law enforcement agencies. He also called for magazines to be held to the same defamation standards as an individual rather than a newspaper. </p> <p>\u201cJust like if you were to keep a lion in your backyard and somebody climbs over the fence and gets attacked by it, you are liable as its owner,\u201d Ciolek said.</p> <p>Some states have moved to restrict public access to mugshots. In July, the federal appeals court in Ohio for the sixth circuit ruled 9 to 7 that federal booking photos are no longer public records, with Chief Judge R Guy Cole Jr remarking that \u201cthese images preserve the indignity of a deprivation of liberty, often at the [literal] expense of the most vulnerable among us\u201d.</p> <h2>\u2018My reputation completely shredded, that was the worst part\u2019</h2> <p>Gemma, who does not wish to have her real name published, was a well-respected hospital staff nurse in upstate South Carolina.

But after taking the pills, she panicked and called paramedics.</p> <p>She was arrested for theft of a controlled substance. She thought it couldn\u2019t get any worse until, a week after the arrest, her father called her in tears.</p> <p>He had just seen the front cover of Jail Report and his daughter\u2019s picture with an accompanying caption which read: \u201cDistribution of LSD and crack cocaine to a person under 18.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was already at the lowest point of my life,\u201d she recalled, her voice cracking. \u201cAnd then to be humiliated and shamed, my reputation completely shredded, that was the worst part of that time, it just amplified everything.</p> <p>Gemma didn\u2019t leave her home for months, fearing recrimination from the community. But after a pre-trial intervention the charges against her were dropped and she has resumed working as a nurse.</p> <p>In Gemma\u2019s case, fault initially lay with administrators at the local county jail who had inputted the wrong charge with her mugshot, but she never received an apology.</p> <p>\u201cAn officer spoke to me and her explanation was \u2018someone clicked the wrong button\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The paper still has the digital issue with Gemma\u2019s front cover mugshot on its Facebook page at the time of writing.

  "<p>The bishop of Grantham, Nicholas Chamberlain, insisted it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d as he delivered his first service since becoming the first Church of England bishop to publicly declare that he is gay and in a same-sex relationship. </p> <p>However, for the 80 people who attended Chamberlain\u2019s Sunday service at the ancient St Mary and St Nicolas church in Spalding, Lincolnshire, there was time to reflect on a tiring week for their bishop. </p> <p>During the sermon, Chamberlain, whose relationship with his long-term partner is celibate in accordance with church guidelines, discussed the importance of prioritising faith, and the sacrifices that have to be made to do so. </p> <p>Referring to the week as \u201cinteresting\u201d, he also discussed the word \u201chate\u201d, without any overt reference to the backlash from conservative figures in the Anglican community who have spoken out against Chamberlain\u2019s declaration.</p> <p>Also on Sunday, a group of 14 gay and lesbian Anglican clergy revealed in a letter to the Sunday Times that they had defied church doctrine by marrying their partners, and called for parishes to be allowed to decide for themselves whether to celebrate same-sex marriages. <br></p> <p>One, the Rev Colin Coward, founder of the gay pressure group Changing Attitudes, told the newspaper that as well as Chamberlain there were at least ten other bishops in the church who were gay, many of them in some kind of relationship. A church spokesman dismissed the claim as \u201cpure speculation\u201d.<br></p> <p>After the service in Spalding, the parishioners greeted Chamberlain with smiles and handshakes as they left the church, as is customary. </p> <p>The bishop told the Guardian: \u201cIt was very much business as usual today. I actually feel nervous before any act of worship because it\u2019s important, but obviously whatever has happened through the course of the week before, you tend to bring with you to worship, so obviously I\u2019ve brought some of what\u2019s been happening this week with me. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/nicholas-chamberlain-bishop-of-grantham-c-of-e-gay-relationship\">Bishop of Grantham first C of E bishop to declare he is in gay relationship</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling \u2013 I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t be surprised to hear \u2013 tired.

There has been direct response \u2013 I\u2019ve had a lot of emails \u2013 which has been concerned, or anxious, and even angry, but not very much of that and I do understand that. I haven\u2019t had time to take it all in yet.\u201d</p> <p>Referring to condemnation from the Global Anglican Future Conference (Gafcon), which represents conservative Anglicans worldwide, Chamberlain said: \u201cI read it and listened to the news. I can well understand what is being said by my brothers and sisters in Christ.\u201d </p> <p>During the sermon, he talked about the gospel of Luke 14.25-33. He said: \u201cI think Jesus is saying something here about urgency, and priority, about commitment, about the things that hold us back. Powerful, important, life-changing things.\u201d </p> <p>He then recalled a time when he was pulled up on speaking about hate in a sermon while he was training. \u201cA member of the congregation made me think. He said that the word \u2018hate\u2019 was not appropriate on the lips of a Christian, and especially not on the lips of a Christian minister. I\u2019m grateful to him for reminding me of my responsibility, for making me stop and reflect. So it is that Jesus\u2019s words today made me stop, think, reflect. </p> <p>\u201cHe is speaking to a crowd of people. Some people will be interested in what he has to say, some people who might already be offended by what they already know about him. Some people who just happen to be there. He is speaking to the bigger context and opening himself to different reaction. He\u2019s doing this to bring home to those around him what really matters, which is the kingdom he has come to proclaim. He is saying it is a priority and that to follow him, we need to make it our priority. </p> <p>\u201cSecondly, there will be a cost to following him. It will be different for everyone but it will be there,\u201d he added. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been sitting with this gospel over the last few days: they have been interesting days. I hope you will forgive me that my words are not as polished as I would have chosen to be. They are what they are.\u201d </p> <p>Afterwards, one member of the congregation, who asked not to be named said: \u201cI have been really angry this week reading the news. I\u2019m never buying a paper again. There are far more important and worse things going on in the world. The attention it got is all out of context. </p> <p> \u201cI personally have mixed feelings about the issue but it\u2019s for God to judge, not us. And he follows the church\u2019s guidelines on it. I was impressed by him today. I thought he gave a good service. And, as the bible says: \u2018Let him who is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s another saying, too, that says: \u201cWhy do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother\u2019s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? </p> <p>\u201cEveryone should mind their own business,\u201d she added. </p> <p>Another who attended the service, who also did not wish to be named, simply said: \u201cEach to their own.\u201d</p> <p>For Chamberlain, he just hopes that things will just go back to normal. He said: \u201cTomorrow I have a diary full of normal things, whatever normal is. We have work to do because that\u2019s what we do.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Two years ago <a href=\" https://www.theguardian.com/culture/thandie-newton\" title=\"\">Thandie Newton</a> was naked on set when \u201ca major epiphany\u201d struck.

Not because I was naked,\u201d she adds, \u201cbut because it was my choice. Totally my choice.\u201d</p> <p>Feeling comfortable, she waved away the offer of a pubic wig. \u201cI was like: \u2018No, no, no. I want to go back to my kid.\u2019\u201d Her youngest child, Booker, was only six months old. \u201cIt\u2019s two hours extra in makeup to stick that thing on,\u201d she says. \u201cThankfully I\u2019m not a woman who waxes everything off.\u201d</p> <p>Newton is a puzzling blend of forthright and defensive, and it is easy to see why her new show, <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/westworld\" title=\"\">HBO\u2019s Westworld,</a> adapted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/26/westworld-hbo-tv-premiere-trailer-review-jj-abrams\" title=\"\">JJ Abrams from Michael Crichton\u2019s original</a>, drew her thoughts inward. She plays Maeve, a prostitute in a wild west theme park peopled by artificially intelligent androids. While filming, Newton was breastfeeding Booker: hand-squeezing \u201clike a lovely goat\u201d. She cups an imaginary breast to demonstrate. \u201cInto a bottle or bag. Literally get your whole boob and milk yourself. And then I\u2019d get my driver to drive it back to my babysitter.\u201d Maybe it fed her sense of being in healthful service because she says: \u201cI was naked 70% of the time on set \u2013 70%!\u201d \u2013 and it was the first time I felt in control of my body at work.\u201d</p> <p>It seems a terrible pity to reach this peace only after working for 25 years.</p> <p>\u201cSo much of what\u2019s happened in my life has led to the \u2026 What\u2019s the opposite of ownership?\u201d she asks.

And I realised: \u2018Oh, that wasn\u2019t a relationship? Oh, you mean I\u2019d been abused?\u2019 And I thought it was sex.\u201d It was the first of several turning points: meeting her husband, <a href=\" http://gb.imdb.com/name/nm0662530/\" title=\"\">film-maker Ol Parker</a>, whom she married at 25; seeing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/dec/31/saturday-interview-eve-ensler-vagina-monologues\" title=\"\">Eve Ensler\u2019s The Vagina Monologues</a>; motherhood; and activism (she is on the board of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/blog/2013/feb/14/what-is-one-billion-rising-founder-eve-ensler-explains\" title=\"\">Ensler\u2019s V-Day campaign</a>).</p> <p>However, I suspect the timeline is wonkier than those milestones suggest. Ten years ago, Newton was <a href=\" http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/film_and_tv/film/article233628.ece\" title=\"\">still maintaining in interviews that she had never experienced racism in Britain</a>. It was only after discussing Cornwall with her mother that she realised her parents had tried to soak up the racism around her, and she had believed, or colluded in, the pretence that it wasn\u2019t happening. So now there was the additional shame of having failed to confront or claim that experience. The film industry compounded all that childhood alienation with another kind of silencing: a publicist tried to stop Newton talking about the abuse. To have experienced it, to have confided, and then be urged to secrecy seems doubly cruel. She couldn\u2019t win.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I can win!\u201d she shoots back angrily, voice rising above the clatter in Ostuni, a local restaurant for her in north-west London. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing. I am so grateful for all that: \u2018Zip it, Thandie! Zip it! Zip it!\u2019 Because it made me more angry, made me want to talk more.\u201d</p> <p>Has she considered taking legal action against Mr Hideous? Or the director, now in his 80s, who played her audition video at parties?</p> <p>\u201cI could take him to court, darling, if I wanted to. And you know, maybe that will happen.

She mentions Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor\u2019s <a href=\" https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/03/sinead-o-connor-open-letter-miley-cyrus\" title=\"\">\u201cbeautiful\u201d open letter to Miley Cyrus</a>, which Newton has kept and intends to frame: \u201cI must remember to do that.\u201d (She loves O\u2019Connor, \u201ceven though I pretty much know if we sat together for two minutes she\u2019d be calling me a cunt\u201d.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hollywood's another organisation that is concealing an industry of sexual abuse</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She routinely calls out abuse. \u201cDarling!

In her customary pose for photographs, her lips balance on the edge of a smile. Dimples suggest a reserved and private mirth. But her mouth is always shut. This seems inappropriate, given the way she talks.

And the endgame is suicide. It\u2019s species suicide!\u201d That she considers her own body implicated in this tangle becomes clear when she says that she breastfed partly to prevent multinationals such as Nestl\u00e9 from extending their grip on the developing world. She can be hard to follow because she deploys the words that usually join thoughts to introduce new ones. Each time she says \u201cbecause\u201d, I want to grip my seat. Her thoughts go so fast.</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s because they\u2019re mine, and they happen all the time.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m wondering which is her natural state \u2013 the placid composure of photographs, or the frantic, gesticulating, conscientious producer of this verbal torrent. \u201cOh, oh well,\u201d she says. \u201cMy natural state is the waaaah, all over the place.

She looks surprised. \u201cI\u2019m always angry. I wake up angry. There is a lot to be angry about. Anger,\u201d she says calmly, \u201cis a positive energy.\u201d</p> <p>Another flashpoint is the dearth of black faces on the cover of Vogue. She has never been asked, even after winning a Bafta for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2005/aug/12/1\" title=\"\">Crash</a> in 2006, although Vogue\u2019s editor, Alexandra Shulman, is a fellow anthropologist who lives down the road. \u201cI like her a lot. We hang out. She uses my gardener. I nick rosemary from her garden.\u201d Newton kept asking herself what she was doing wrong. \u201cOK, so why have I not got the cover? And I resisted race. Because I don\u2019t even use the term \u2018race\u2019. I resisted it, I resisted it, I resisted it \u2026 And then I had to accept it.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t ask Shulman outright: \u201cToo gauche.\u201d Instead she devised a plan to get sponsorship for a documentary about a Thandie Newton Vogue cover, in which the sponsorship covered any losses that arose from featuring a black face. \u201cThen I was like, wow, that\u2019s a lot of work. That\u2019s a lot of fucking work. And then I realised \u2026 I don\u2019t care any more.\u201d</p> <p>About being on the cover? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho cares?\u201d I say, to cheer her up; she still sounds a bit sad.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I care!\u201d she cries. \u201cBecause I was a little girl a long time ago, and that little girl knew Vogue was everything. It\u2019s about ideas. Vogue is the ultimate. The ultimate. And I want little girls to see that. My little girls had seen me receiving a Bafta. And not just my little girls \u2013 every other little girl with brown skin had seen that. Oh my God!

A lot of music as well.\u201d</p> <p>Along with Booker, now two, she and Parker have daughters Nico, 11, and Ripley, who last week turned 16, the age Newton\u2019s at times traumatic relationship with the film industry began. \u201cOf course.

But to prepare them, and to protect them, Newton pointedly names abuse. \u201cIt freaks my husband out, bless him! He\u2019ll look at me like: \u2018You\u2019re really talking about this?\u2019\u201d But it\u2019s a compulsion, a commitment, and a chance, perhaps, to parent the child she was, as well as the ones she has. \u201cTo go through shame and feel self-love afterwards, there\u2019s nothing like it,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then to pour that into your beautiful girls ... When I look at my girls \u2013 who they are \u2013 partly as a result of what I\u2019ve told them ... \u201d</p> <p>They go to a progressive school. \u201cNo uniform, you use the teachers\u2019 first names, so you don\u2019t create this fear and mindless ... what\u2019s the word?\u201d Deference? \u201cTo authority. We\u2019re big on \u2018No\u2019. [The teachers] have to earn your respect. In the same way that me as a parent, I have to earn your respect, every day you wake up on this planet.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m imagining the impact of this approach to childcare in my own home. Don\u2019t they give her huge amounts of grief? \u201cYeah, they do. But I love it. When they give me shit, that\u2019s their power. I\u2019m like: \u2018Give it to me! Give it to me!\u2019 It really annoys them. When they get fucked off with me, I just smile, I go glazed. Because I\u2019m thinking: \u2018You\u2019re awesome, and this is precisely what you\u2019re going to need in life.

  "<p>Japan\u2019s threat that many of its companies will quit the UK if Brexit negotiations are botched comes with an unprecedented and slightly panicky list of demands. The message to London and Brussels is that Tokyo wants certainty from the outset that every effort will be made to keep the UK\u2019s borders open for people, goods and the complex financial transactions that are the lifeblood of modern global capitalism.</p> <p>In a letter to the EU and UK at the G20 summit in China, Japan says it is representing the needs of businesses that have invested heavily in the UK with a view to exporting across Europe. NIssan\u2019s Washington plant in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, exports more than 80% of the cars it makes. The new Hitachi train factory down the road in Newton Aycliffe is making trains for the UK, but has ambitions to compete with Germany\u2019s Siemens for contracts across the continent.</p> <p>Although the letter says Tokyo respects the referendum vote, the clear demand is for the current arrangements to stay the same for businesses to invest and create jobs. At its heart, the letter implies that UK exports could be jeopardised by a Liam Fox- or David Davis-inspired break with the EU that involves the re-introduction of trade barriers and quotas restricting immigration, whatever the secretary of state for international trade (Fox) or secretary of state for exiting the European Union (Davis) says about their plans for signing deals with other countries.</p> <p>The demands range from the maintenance of low tariffs on exports to keeping various EU agencies in the UK. Some look possible, others almost fanciful. Here we assess the likelihood that the upcoming negotiations can address the concerns of Japanese businesses, beginning with:</p> <ul> <li><em>Maintenance of the current tariff rates and customs clearance procedures</em><br></li> </ul> <p>There is pressure from businesses on both sides of the channel to keep tariffs on goods low and allow lorries to zip back and forth without hindrance. It\u2019s possible the French and German governments will accede to giving the UK special privileges to please Volkswagen and Renault \u2013 which owns 43% of Nissan \u2013 as much as UK exporters concerned at the potential loss of trade.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/g20-theresa-may-warns-of-tough-times-for-uk-economy-after-brexit\">Theresa May joins G20 summit to face Brexit warnings from US and Japan</a> </p> </aside>  <ul> <li><em>Maintenance of the access to workers who are nationals of the UK or the EU</em> <br></li> </ul> <p>It seems likely the Conservative government will adopt a points-based immigration system that will favour skilled workers, alleviating the concerns of Japanese employers at the loss of unfettered access to EU nationals.</p> <ul> <li><em>Maintenance of the freedom of establishment and the provision of financial services, including the \u201csingle passport\u201d system</em><br></li> </ul> <p>UK banks and insurance companies can process transactions without any barriers while they remain part of the EU.

Appeals to the European court of justice are expected post-Brexit from continental financial centres, seeking to bring all euro transactions with the EU.

Without a doubt, Brussels will pull back all its agencies to inside the EU, probably encouraged by Japan\u2019s statement that its London-based pharmaceutical companies would shift their headquarters across the channel if this happened.</p> <ul> <li><em>Maintenance of basic policies regarding the entry of foreign capital and implementation of measures to promote investment</em><br></li> </ul> <p>There are unlikely to be any barriers put up by the government against foreign investment post-Brexit.

  "<p>An ailing Mao Zedong was presiding over the last knockings of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/11/the-cultural-revolution-50-years-on-all-you-need-to-know-about-chinas-political-convulsion\">Cultural Revolution </a>when the era of modern summitry was launched in a French chateau just outside Paris in late 1975. It\u2019s a reasonable bet that none of those present at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_G6_summit\">Rambouillet </a>envisaged that 43 years later the annual get-together for their successors would be in Hangzhou.</p> <p>The emergence of China as an economic superpower with its distinctive breed of state capitalism is a striking example of what has changed in the past four decades. Back then, the six developed nations represented at Rambouillet dominated the global economy. These days it would be inconceivable to hold a meeting to discuss trade, currencies or climate change without the Chinese, the Indians, the Brazilians, the Russians and the Saudis. The G6 has become the G20.</p> <p>But while the guest list has expanded, the agenda has remained similar. The inspiration for Giscard d\u2019Estaing\u2019s fireside chat in 1975 was the stagflation unleashed by the weakening of the post second world war boom, triggered by soaring oil prices. The summit was an attempt to reinvigorate the full employment model that had delivered record levels of growth over the previous quarter of a century, but it proved impossible to return to business as usual. Time was up for a generation represented by Harold Wilson and Gerald Ford, both attendees at Rambouillet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/03/theresa-may-g20-china-britain-stronger-relationships\">Theresa May to seek stronger relationships with G20 countries</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/g20\">G20 </a>was born in equally difficult circumstances. It met for the first time in Washington a couple of months after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, just after the US had voted for Barack Obama to succeed George W Bush. As in the 1970s, the prevailing economic model had suffered system failure. This time the problem was caused by unfettered capital flows and over-exposed banks. Again the imperative was to return to business as usual as quickly as possible. Again, the attempt has been unsuccessful.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/imf-urges-g20-to-champion-globalisation-at-china-summit\">The extent of the failure was highlighted by the International Monetary Fund in the report it prepared for the Hangzhou G20.</a> \u201cThe weak outlook can further reduce incentives to invest and slow down trade, adding to demand shortfalls and limiting the room for productivity gains going forward. At the same time, income growth has not only been meagre, it has bypassed low-income earners in many countries, raising anxiety about globalisation and worsening the climate for political reform.\u201d</p> <p>You don\u2019t need the skills of a Bletchley Park cryptographer to get the gist. The fund\u2019s message is that there is a lack of investment, a lack of good, well-paid jobs, and a growing disenchantment with the status quo. Hence Donald Trump and his plan to build a wall along the Rio Grande. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/26/brexit-is-the-rejection-of-globalisation\">Hence Brexit</a>, the rise of the Five Star Movement in Italy, and the support for Marine Le Pen in France.</p> <p>To be sure, these trends can be over-stated. Governments of the centre-right and centre-left are still in power in Germany, Italy and France. The polls suggest Trump is going to lose to Hillary Clinton, and Le Pen is unlikely to be the next president of France. Greece\u2019s experiment with the radical left has not been an unalloyed success.</p> <p>But the fund is still right to be concerned. Globalisation was sold to voters in the west as a system that would deliver greater prosperity for all through more open markets. Yet as the IMF noted, the income for top earners in many developed countries has been rising while remaining stagnant for those at the bottom. The customers are not getting what it says on the tin.</p> <p>In his <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/corruption-of-capitalism.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">new book</a>*, Guy Standing says it is a myth that the political and economic changes of the 1970s created free markets. Instead, he argues, globalisation has hastened the development of rigged markets dominated by \u201ca plutocracy and plutocratic corporations linked to concentrated financial capital that are able to gain increasing amounts of rental income by virtue of their wealth. Meanwhile wages are stagnating\u201d.</p> <p>Interestingly, this critique has echoes of another feature of the 1970s \u2013 the Alternative Economic Strategy (AES) developed by Tony Benn and his allies on the left of the Labour party. The main thrust of the strategy was that Britain\u2019s economic problems stemmed from the size and power of multinational corporations able to exploit their market power by pushing up prices while at the same time under-investing.</p> <p>Rejecting the idea that Keynesian demand management was sufficient to tackle what Benn called the \u201cspiral of decline\u201d in manufacturing, the AES provided a radical alternative. It involved public ownership of a company in each key sector of the economy, planning agreements with big private-sector companies, price controls, industrial democracy, curbs on imports and withdrawal from what was then the European Economic Community.</p> <p>While Benn and his allies were putting together the strategy, Mrs Thatcher was putting together what might be called the \u201calternative alternative economy strategy\u201d. There was agreement between Benn and Thatcher that British capitalism was in a bad way and a shared derision for the attempts to fix it by the Wilson and Callaghan governments. But there was disagreement about the remedy: Thatcher wanted to sweep away the physical and financial controls without which Benn\u2019s siege economy would not have been viable, and her idea of industrial democracy was to limit the power of the trade unions and restore the \u201cright to manage\u201d. Thatcher\u2019s opponents inside the Conservative party were as dismissive of her ideas as Benn\u2019s enemies inside the Labour party were of his. But only one of the alternative economic strategies was ever implemented, and it was not the left\u2019s.</p> <p>Decades later, there are again competing alternative economic strategies. On the right, Theresa May\u2019s plan to make Brexit work involves some themes familiar to those in the 1970s: workers on boards, an industrial strategy, the need for more public investment.</p> <p>On the left, the Labour party is led by Jeremy Corbyn, who is as critical of Labour\u2019s handling of the economy under Blair and Brown as the Bennites were of the policies pursued by Wilson and Callaghan.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/28/the-guardian-view-on-labours-economic-policy-careful-words-bold-intent\"> If Corbyn\u2019s approach has echoes of the AES</a> that\u2019s because the problems identified in the 1970s \u2013 hollowing out of manufacturing, under-investment and the power of multinational corporations \u2013 remain unresolved.</p> <p>Of course, pursuing an AES in the 2010s is a lot more difficult than it was in the 1970s. Globalisation has seen to that. It is also possible that the AES will be rejected by voters just as it was in 1983. But it is important to understand why Corbyn sees a role for nationalising the train operating companies, why he would set up a national investment bank, and why he retains a strong degree of Euroscepticism. His critique, that there is something dysfunctional about modern industrial capitalism, has not changed since he was a supporter of Benn in the 1970s and 1980s. And, after a decade of crisis, recession and austerity, that\u2019s perhaps unsurprising.<br></p> <p>* <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/corruption-of-capitalism.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">The Corruption of Capitalism</a> by Guy Standing (Biteback, \u00a317.99).

Healy recommended a multi-pronged approach: aerial and ground sprays along with removal of the trash cans, bird feeders and other containers where water pools and mosquitos breed.</p> <p>Aerial sprays threaten other pollinators. Dennis Olle, director of conservation programs for the North American Butterfly Association, noted the effect of chaotic ocean winds near his office in Miami. \u201cIt\u2019s aerial bombing without any sense of being able to lay the chemical down on the target,\u201d he said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It kills everything.

  "<p>Every four years, Labor Day means more than just the end of summer: it\u2019s also the end of high uncertainty in a presidential election, and the time when candidates start to see their real chances.

That\u2019s the share of Americans who identify as independent, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/01/11/independents-outnumber-democrats-and-republicans-but-theyre-not-very-independent/\">Gallup\u2019s</a> most recent analysis. That number is the highest Gallup has ever seen since it started measuring political inclination in 1988, and it\u2019s considerably higher than the share who now identify as Democrats (29%) or Republicans (26%).</p> <p>Understanding independents is key to understanding how Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump became hugely popular. Independents are also crucial for understanding how Hillary Clinton\u2019s support might be overstated in current polls.</p> <p>Currently, Clinton is the most likely candidate to win the 2016 presidential election, according to analysts who rely on polls. At the time of writing, the New York Times projects that she has a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=upshot&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;pgtype=sectionfront&amp;_r=0\">86%</a> chance of winning in November, and FiveThirtyEight puts her chances at <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo#plus\">69%</a>. </p> <p>But these probabilities don\u2019t take into account the fact that polls have become plagued by systemic issues, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2016/jan/27/dont-trust-the-polls-the-systemic-issues-that-make-voter-surveys-unreliable\">from low response rates to media biases</a>, that have made them sometimes unreliable. What\u2019s more, in polling (much like every other type of human interaction), it\u2019s hard to tell whether people mean what they say. Are Trump supporters reluctant to share their views when a stranger from Ipsos, Rasmussen or Gallup calls them up? If so, Clinton could be in trouble.</p> <p>Forecasting the political future means considering not one probability but many possibilities. Here are the three most likely outcomes in this election.</p> <h2>Hillary Clinton wins</h2> <p>Over the past 20 years, there are just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/18/ohio-swing-state-republican-national-convention-clinton-trump\">19 states</a> that have flipped between the two main parties at least once. Many of those states are also on the list of closely fought contests this year: Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Iowa, Virginia, Colorado, Minnesota, Nevada and New Hampshire. Clinton\u2019s hopes rest on voters choosing her and those who might vote Trump staying home.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s rhetoric in the coming months will be important for securing these victories. The former secretary of state needs to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/12/sanders-supporters-clinton-vote-survey\">convince</a> former Bernie Sanders supporters that she shares the values that galvanized so many young voters. Similarly, Clinton needs to persuade voters that she is the only way Americans can keep Donald Trump out of the White House.</p> <h2>Donald Trump wins</h2> <p>Like Clinton, Trump needs to focus his energies on mobilizing supporters to actually go to the polls. Although demographics don\u2019t seem to work in his favor (his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/08/angry-white-men-love-donald-trump\">supporters</a> make up a relatively small fraction of the overall electorate) it is quite possible that Trump\u2019s support is understated in polls. Polling analysis appears to privilege left-of-centre ideas (and many of the journalists who interpret polls, including this journalist, may be viewing the numbers with a misplaced optimism) which helps explains why forecasts about the British EU referendum, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/2015/mar/18/israel-election-why-were-the-exit-polls-wrong\">the Israeli election</a> and the Scottish independence referendum were all off the mark. </p> <p>There\u2019s another factor in this election which may well work in Trump\u2019s favor: third party candidates. Between them, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green party candidate Jill Stein stand to pick up <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html\">11%</a> of the national vote. Votes for Johnson and Stein appear more likely to erode Clinton\u2019s vote share than Trump\u2019s.</p> <p>Those third-party candidates have a <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/gary-johnson-presidential-debates-227654\">slim chance</a> of making it to the presidential debates (they need to be polling with at least <a href=\"http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=2016debates\">15%</a> of the national electorate\u2019s support to qualify), meaning Trump will want to sow what doubt and frustration he can in Democratic-leaning voters, in order to convince them to stay home or vote for a third party candidate.</p> <p>Sexism could also benefit Donald Trump. In a <a href=\"https://www.pershing.com/our-thinking/thought-leadership/americans-crave-a-new-kind-of-leader-and-women-are-ready-to-deliver\">survey</a> of more than 2,000 US adults in 2014, only 74% of women and 58% of men agreed that there are not enough women in positions of power.</p> <h2>Hillary Clinton wins by a landslide</h2> <p>The mere fact this is a possibility shows just how much uncertainty there is around this election. And it is a real possibility, even though more than 20 years have passed since anyone won by a double-digit margin. For a start, the distribution of US electoral college votes privileges the Democratic party. Together, Democratic \u201csafe\u201d states (those that have voted Democratic consistently in the past six presidential elections) yield <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/reality-check/2016/may/06/donald-trump-odds-winning-us-election-reality-check\">242</a> of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election. States that Republicans can reliably count on have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/reality-check/2016/may/06/donald-trump-odds-winning-us-election-reality-check\">102</a> electoral votes.</p> <p>As a Democrat and a seasoned politician, Clinton is the most likely candidate to represent continuity in the minds of many voters. Past elections have also shown that even after contemplating the different options, voters tend to revert towards the status quo in the final days before casting their ballot. Then again, this is no ordinary election.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 5 September 2016. An earlier version said that of the 19 states that have flipped between the two main parties at least once in the last 20 years, around two-thirds of those are likely to be closely fought this year. It went on to list several states, implying those in the list were also among the 19.

  "<p>Theresa May has had a difficult start to the G20 summit as President Barack Obama said the UK would not be the priority for a US trade deal and Japan issued an unprecedented 15-page warning about the consequences of Brexit.</p> <p>The prime minister had been hoping to pitch the UK as a global leader in free trade during her first major outing on the world stage at the G20 summit in Hangzhou.</p> <p>However, she was immediately confronted with harsh warnings about the consequences of leaving the EU and diplomatic tensions with the Chinese over her concerns about their involvement in UK nuclear power.</p> <p>After her first bilateral meeting with Obama, May was warned that the US wanted to focus on trade negotiations with the EU and a bloc of pacific nations before considering a deal with the UK.</p> <p>This was swiftly followed by a message from Japan to the UK that there could be a string of corporate exits from the UK unless some of the privileges that come with access to the single market are maintained.</p> <p>The lengthy document from Tokyo gives a list of possible consequences of Brexit and a series of specific requests from Japanese businesses. About half of Japanese investment in the EU comes to the UK, including from companies such as Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi, Nomura and Daiwa.</p> <p>\u201cJapanese businesses with their European headquarters in the UK may decide to transfer their head-office function to continental Europe if EU laws cease to be applicable in the UK after its withdrawal,\u201d the report concludes.</p> <p>It says: \u201cIn light of the fact that a number of Japanese businesses, invited by the government in some cases, have invested actively to the UK, which was seen to be a gateway to Europe, and have established value-chains across Europe, we strongly request that the UK will consider this fact seriously and respond in a responsible manner to minimise any harmful effects on these businesses.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier, Obama had promised to work hard to stop \u201cadverse effects\u201d of Brexit and assured the UK there was still a \u201cvery special relationship\u201d between the two nations.</p> <p>But he also raised the risk of some trading relations unraveling and made clear that it \u201cwould not make sense to put aside\u201d existing negotiations with big blocs of countries in order to do an immediate deal with the UK.</p> <p>Asked whether he stood by his warnings against Brexit and claim that Britain would go to the back of the queue when it comes to trade deals, Obama repeated his belief that the world would benefit from the UK being a member of the EU.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve committed to Theresa that we will consult closely with her as she and her government move forward on Brexit negotiations to make sure we don\u2019t see adverse effects in our trading and commercial relationship. Obviously there is an enormous amount of trade that already takes place ... That is not going to stop. And we are going to do everything we can to make sure the consequences of the decision don\u2019t end up unravelling what is already a very strong and robust economic relationship.</p> <p>\u201cBut first things first. The first task is figuring out what Brexit means with respect to Europe. And our first task is making sure we go forward on TTIP negotiations in which we have already invested a lot of time and effort.\u201d </p> <p>It comes after the prime minister warned on her flight to China that there would be \u201cdifficult times ahead\u201d for the economy after leaving the EU.</p> <p>The prime minister said the economy was in better shape than some had predicted following the vote for Brexit. However, May said she was not expecting an easy ride, as her ministers examine the possibility of a \u201cfiscal reset\u201d at the autumn statement \u2013<br>potentially abandoning some of the financial strategies and targets of former chancellor George Osborne. </p> <p>Speaking on the flight to Hangzhou, May said: \u201cWe have seen figures giving some different messages in relation to the economy. The reaction of the economy has been better than some had predicted post the referendum. </p> <p>\u201cBut I won\u2019t pretend it is all going to be plain sailing. There will be some difficult times ahead. We will be looking ahead to the autumn statement. So in terms of how we are going to position things, the detail will be coming out then. What I\u2019m clear about is I am going to continue as we have done in government over the last six years ensuring we are going to live within our means.\u201d</p> <p>May also has to contend with diplomatic tensions with China over the country\u2019s proposed multibillion investment in UK nuclear energy. She angered Beijing by placing the French and Chinese-backed Hinkley Point nuclear project under review in July, apparently over security concerns about Beijing\u2019s involvement.</p> <p>Since then, there has been a suggestion that she could be happy for the Chinese to be a passive investor in Hinkley Point nuclear power station in Somerset but does not want the country to have a more active role in developing a new plant at Sizewell in Suffolk or Bradwell in Essex.</p> <p>On the way to Hangzhou, she confirmed that she would go to her first meeting as prime minister with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, on Monday without having come to a decision about allowing Chinese investment in nuclear power to go ahead.</p> <p>\u201cI am going to be talking to President Xi about a whole range of issues. I am not going to be taking the Hinkley decision until ... it\u2019s not going to be taken now. It is going to be taken later this month. I am clear that what I am doing is looking at the evidence.\u201d</p> <p>It is possible May is delaying the decision until after the issue can be discussed fully at the next national security council meeting of top spy and defence chiefs.</p> <p>Asked whether she trusted the Chinese, the prime minister gave an unclear answer. \u201cOf course we have a relationship with them,\u201d she replied. \u201cWe are working with them. And we have seen significant Chinese investment into the United Kingdom. What I want to do is build on that relationship. But I also want to be able to build on relationships with other countries. I want to be unashamedly open to free trade and a global leader in free trade.\u201d</p> <p>May was at pains to stress that she wanted to talk to many other world leaders, not just the Chinese, in a signal that she does not intend to place such a heavy emphasis on the \u201cgolden era\u201d of relations proposed by Cameron and Osborne.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened in the last few years is that the government has built a new strategic partnership with China, the golden era of relationships,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will want to continue to build on that.</p> <p>\u201cI will be meeting President Xi and talking to him but I will be meeting other world leaders as well and wanting to talk to them about the opportunities we can develop looking at free trade. We\u2019ve already seen with some of the early conversations their interest in talking about trading arrangements, the Australians for example.\u201d</p> <p>May embarked on her first trip to China on the new prime ministerial plane used just once by David Cameron before he was replaced. After landing, she headed to the summit for meetings with Obama, the Saudi deputy crown prince, and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, before the first official session at the summit on the economy.</p> <p>May stressed that Britain was \u201copen for business\u201d and wanted to promote free trade but also argued world leaders must be mindful of concerns about globalisation leaving some people behind while others flourish.</p> <p>\u201cI want to be talking about the opportunities for free trade around the world, about how Britain can seize those opportunities and I want us to be a global leader in free trade. But we can\u2019t ignore as we look at the G20 the fact there is a sentiment out there in a number of countries that is anti-globalisation,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is something else we need to consider, looking at whether when we put these free trade agreements in place they are going to work for everyone.\u201d</p> <p>A UK official source said the meeting between May and Obama had been<br>warm, with both sides agreeing that officials would start talking about some of the issues around post-Brexit trade. Asked about the priority given to trade deals with other blocs, the source said: \u201cHe is a president who has invested a lot of<br>time in multilateral trade deals. I don\u2019t think him talking up those and the focus and effort the US have put into those is that much of a surprise.\u201d </p> <p>On the Japanese warning, the source added it was \u201cnot unhelpful\u201d to understand where the UK\u2019s trading partners have concerns.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/04/theresa-may-political-honeymoon-soon-over\">Theresa May\u2019s honeymoon is masking her many vulnerabilities | Andrew Rawnsley</a> </p> </aside>  <p></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc4fbef5c6a4d55810302395c92d26afe44a82eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc4fbef5c6a4d55810302395c92d26afe44a82eb/0_0_2728_1637/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Obama and May arrive to speak to reporters in Hangzhou.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Obama and May arrive to speak to reporters in Hangzhou.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>    <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b34bd75cded712b9a91395cd87189f58bb9a7d15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b34bd75cded712b9a91395cd87189f58bb9a7d15/0_79_3893_2337/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May and Barack Obama during their press conference in Hangzhou.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May and Barack Obama during their press conference in Hangzhou.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/barack-obama-deliberately-snubbed-by-chinese-in-chaotic-arrival-at-g20\">Barack Obama 'deliberately snubbed' by Chinese in chaotic arrival at G20</a> </p> </aside>    <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7e8bdf43b97a3954cf855e8f7552eb5719d4ee5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7e8bdf43b97a3954cf855e8f7552eb5719d4ee5/0_0_1368_1621/844.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May and foreign secretary Philip Hammond given the full red carpet treatment as they arrived in Hangzhou on Sunday.\" width=\"844\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May and chancellor Philip Hammond given the full red carpet treatment as they arrived in Hangzhou on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br></p>",

  "<p>Wall Street drew two conclusions from the news that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/sep/02/markets-await-crucial-us-jobs-report-business-live\" title=\"\">US jobs engine shifted down into a lower gear last month</a>. The first \u2013 that a September increase in interest rates is now a non-starter \u2013 was almost certainly right.</p> <p>Putting up the cost of borrowing so close to the presidential election in early November always looked like an outside bet. It would have taken thunderously good figures for job creation to have persuaded the more dove-ish policymakers at the Federal Reserve to move, and the ones released on Friday were average at best.</p> <p>To be sure, the August non-farm payrolls have come in worse than expected for the past decade, suggesting that there might be some problem with the way the raw data is seasonally adjusted. What\u2019s more, the two previous months \u2013 June and July \u2013 saw strong increases in demand for labour, so the three-month average for non-farm payrolls is running at a healthy 200,000. That could persuade some of the hawks at the Fed to move, but they will not be able to muster a majority.</p> <p>The second conclusion drawn by Wall Street is more questionable. That is the assumption that the rate rise some analysts had pencilled in for September has now simply been put back to a later date. Some economists believe the Fed won\u2019t waste any time once US voters have chosen who will be Barack Obama\u2019s successor at the White House; some think the central bank will wait until March next year.</p> <p>There is, though, a different way of looking at the numbers. For most of this year, the strength of the US labour market has been at odds with data showing the economy growing only slowly. Sooner or later, the theory went, growth would accelerate and come into line with employment numbers, so justifying higher interest rates.</p> <p>But what if Wall Street has got things back to front? Is it possible that it is the labour market that has been giving off false signals and that eventually job creation will decelerate and come into line with a growth rate that averaged just 1% in the first half of 2016?</p> <p>There is enough evidence to make this a plausible hypothesis. <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm\" title=\"\">Take the details of the most recent jobs report</a>, for example. The annual growth rate in average hourly earnings fell to 2.4%, its lowest in six months, while average weekly hours worked declined to 34.3, the lowest in two and a half years.</p> <p>Hours worked by production and non-supervisory staff \u2013 who account for five out of six workers in the US \u2013 rose by 1.1% over the past year, the slowest rate of increase since 2010. None of this suggests the labour market is humming, nor that the recent pick-up in consumer spending \u2013 the economy\u2019s only real source of growth in the first half of the year \u2013 can be sustained.</p> <p>With investment weak and exports affected by low global demand and the lagged effects of the dollar\u2019s previous strength, it is not immediately obvious why the Fed would raise interest rates any time soon. Over the past couple of years, the US has succeeded in creating millions of jobs, but most of them are relatively unskilled and attract low pay. There is no obvious inflationary threat.</p> <p>Rather, the Fed should be focused on the risk that the economy might stall altogether. Corporate profits have come under pressure and this is leading to cuts in business investment. Historically, this is a good leading indicator that the US economy is heading into recession.</p> <p>The softness of the US economy is a concern to the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet Yellen, who has rightly adopted an ultra-cautious approach to raising rates. It will also be a concern for Hillary Clinton. The state of the economy does her no favours in her battle with Donald Trump.</p> <h2>Now bosses actually have to ask not to get bonuses</h2> <p>News that David Brown, chief executive of Go-Ahead Group, has asked not to be considered for a bonus this year prompts an obvious question: why did he think he might get one?</p> <p>Go-Ahead is the main company behind the chaotic Southern rail franchise that delivers daily misery to London commuters. If Brown\u2019s \u00a3558,000 bonus from a year ago had been repeated, riots might have broken out on station platforms.</p> <p>Not all Southern\u2019s woes can be laid at the operator\u2019s door, it should be said. The company doesn\u2019t control the tracks, which is where some of the problems have arisen as Network Rail gives London Bridge a major upgrade.</p> <p>But those difficulties have been compounded by Southern\u2019s bitter battle with the RMT union over plans to hand responsibility for closing train doors from conductors to drivers. Whatever the rights and wrong of the dispute, Southern\u2019s handling of the fallout has been appalling. Time and again, Brown has found himself apologising to customers for the sub-standard service. A bonus would have been another PR disaster.</p> <p>In practice, however, the bonus question arises because the rest of Go-Ahead is doing OK. The bus operations and other parts of the rail business are up to scratch. Despite losses at GTR \u2013 the unit that includes Southern \u2013 Go-Ahead\u2019s pre-tax profits rose 27% to \u00a399.8m. So Brown might have expected a juicy personal reward.</p> <p>But such a notion merely underlines the perversity of the modern bonus. No longer is it a reward for exceptional performance; instead, executives get them merely for delivering targets. In Go-Ahead\u2019s case, meeting the target \u2013 in other words, doing your job \u2013 is worth an extra 75% of salary in normal circumstances; at other companies, the ratio can be higher.</p> <p>This is a nonsense. Pay committees have become wedded to formulas that pay out even when disaster has struck in part of the empire. Boards should get a grip and apply common sense, which they are allowed to do. It should not have been a case of Brown doing \u201cthe right thing\u201d. His chairman should have said no bonuses would be paid because Go-Ahead was failing its customers.</p> <h2>The best way to stop Hinkley is to agree to it</h2> <p>What should Theresa May say to her Chinese G20 hosts about Hinkley Point? Nothing. The PM only ordered a review of the \u00a318bn project, which Beijing wants to part-fund, at the end of July. Hard conclusions probably haven\u2019t been reached. Don\u2019t risk a diplomatic quarrel on the other side\u2019s turf.</p> <p>A decision will have to be reached soon but an elegant solution seems to be emerging from Downing Street: tell the Chinese Hinkley is cleared for take-off but proposed nuclear plant Bradwell, in Essex, which the Chinese hope to build under their own steam, requires an in-depth security review.</p> <p>The Chinese, we are led to believe, would take offence and abandon Hinkley. Good. The plant would be hideously expensive for bill-payers and developer EDF\u2019s other two Hinkley-style developments outside the UK are years behind schedule. If Beijing packs its bags, the UK would have a choice: part-fund Hinkley; or let the plans collapse. Option B is best.</p>",
  "<p>H ere\u2019s a phrase to conjure with: \u201czero-day vulnerability\u201d. If you\u2019re a non-techie, it will sound either like a meaningless piece of jargon or it\u2019ll have a vaguely sinister ring to it. \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Zero_(political_notion)\" title=\"\">Year Zero</a>\u201d was the name chosen by the Khmer Rouge for 1975, the year they seized power in Cambodia and embarked on their genocidal rule. Behind the term lay the idea that \u201call culture and traditions within a society must be completely destroyed or discarded and a new revolutionary culture must replace it, starting from scratch\u201d.</p> <p>If you run a computer network, though, especially one that hosts sensitive or confidential data, then zero-day vulnerability evokes nightmares and worse. It means that your system has a security hole that nobody, including you, knew about and that someone is now in a position to exploit. And you have no real defence against it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In its determination to screw the bad guys, the NSA left all of us vulnerable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>All software has bugs and all networked systems have security holes in them. If you wanted to build a model of our online world out of cheese, you\u2019d need emmental to make it realistic. These holes (vulnerabilities) are constantly being discovered and patched, but the process by which this happens is, inevitably, <em>reactive</em>. Someone discovers a vulnerability, reports it either to the software company that wrote the code or to <a href=\"https://www.us-cert.gov/\" title=\"\">US-CERT</a>, the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team. A fix for the vulnerability is then devised and a \u201cpatch\u201d is issued by computer security companies such as Kaspersky and/or by software and computer companies. At the receiving end, it is hoped that computer users and network administrators will then install the patch. Some do, but many don\u2019t, alas.</p> <p>It\u2019s a lousy system, but it\u2019s the only one we\u2019ve got. It has two obvious flaws. The first is that the response always lags behind the threat by days, weeks or months, during which the malicious software that exploits the vulnerability is doing its ghastly work. The second is that it is completely dependent on people reporting the vulnerabilities that they have discovered.</p> <p>Zero-day vulnerabilities are the unreported ones. Nowadays, they can be very valuable. Software companies and computer manufacturers <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/04/apple-announces-long-awaited-bug-bounty-program/\" title=\"\">offer bounties</a> to those who report them. But they are also <a href=\"https://www.mitnicksecurity.com/S=0/shopping/absolute-zero-day-exploit-exchange\" title=\"\">traded online</a> in the recesses of the dark web, where the customers include not just affluent criminals but also government agencies.</p> <p>For years, it\u2019s been a reasonable conjecture that intelligence agencies such as the NSA and GCHQ were stockpiling zero-day exploits for use in the wars against cybercrime and global terrorism. Some of these will be vulnerabilities that the spooks themselves have discovered; others will be ones they\u2019ve bought on the black market. After all, if you\u2019re a public official charged with protecting society against these threats, then you would take all available steps to fulfil that mission.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/tim-berners-lee-encryption-spy-agencies\">Tim Berners-Lee: encryption cracking by spy agencies 'appalling and foolish'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The agencies won\u2019t talk about their hoards, for obvious reasons.

In which case, it\u2019s embarrassing for the NSA. What is more interesting, from a democratic point of view is the nature of the zero-day vulnerabilities that have been revealed. For some of them can be exploited not just against enemy states or cybercriminals, but against common internet security systems \u2013 Schneier identifies products made by Cisco, Fortinet, Topsec, WatchGuard and Juniper, for example.</p> <p>Why is this important? Simply because it tells us that the NSA knew about vulnerabilities in networking kit on which the internet relies. They should have been reported to US-CERT and fixed, but apparently they weren\u2019t. Which means that in its determination to screw the bad guys, the NSA left all of us vulnerable. Worse still, we wouldn\u2019t have known about it had not a sinister group, possibly Russian in origin, hacked into the NSA\u2019s systems. Just as we wouldn\u2019t know about a lot of other unacceptable practices had not Edward Snowden blown the whistle. This is no way to run democracies in a digital age. Theresa May, please copy.</p>",
  "<p>By the time Theresa May had assembled her cabinet there was only a week until parliament\u2019s summer recess. Nice timing because it gave her team breathing space to work out what on earth to do about Brexit.</p> <p>MPs and peers are back tomorrow and economic policy will be under scrutiny. First up on Wednesday is the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, and fellow rate-setters at the Treasury select committee. After the Bank took what its chief economist, Andy Haldane, called a sledgehammer to monetary policy by cutting interest rates and printing more money, MPs will want to hear about their thinking on the impact and limits of monetary policy amid doubts about what rate cuts can achieve when they are close to zero.</p> <p>That should set things up for the Lords economic affairs committee to question chancellor Philip Hammond the next day. Being the Lords, it will no doubt be a civilised affair but peers should take the chance to press Hammond, in his first committee appearance, on what measures he is considering to give the economy a fiscal boost. Even City economists and businessmen such as Sir Martin Sorrell argue the government needs to step in to promote growth, for instance by spending on infrastructure.</p> <p>With Hammond\u2019s autumn statement not far off, what clues will he give to his thinking?</p> <h2>Not such a fun summit<br></h2> <p>There are no doubt times when prime ministers look forward to G20 meetings. You get to feel important and have your picture taken with other leaders of major economies, and it\u2019s usually a chance to get away for a few days. But Theresa May is unlikely to feel in this frame of mind at her first G20 summit, which takes place on Sunday and Monday.</p> <p>First, it\u2019s in China. Not only does that mean a gruelling 13-hour flight to Hangzhou, but when she gets there her hosts will demand to know what she\u2019s up to over Hinkley Point. A year ago, China agreed to fund a third of the \u00a318bn nuclear power station in Somerset on the understanding it would get to build two reactors of its own in Essex and Suffolk. May, who has long had doubts about the security implications of all this, put the project under review and one option appears to be going ahead with Hinkley but delaying a decision on the other two reactors. That would incense the Chinese, who want to showcase their nuclear abilities in Europe.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s Brexit and its potential to upset the global economy. May is tough, but she could face a gruelling time from her fellow leaders.</p> <h2>High asking price at builder<br></h2> <p>Following share-price plunges straight after the vote to leave the EU, most housebuilders that have reported results have been fairly upbeat. Persimmon, the biggest in the sector, said buyers paused for thought and then carried on viewing. There are more to come this week, including Barratt and Redrow, but the most interesting is Berkeley.</p> <p>The company could \u2013 or should \u2013 face a tough time at its annual meeting near its HQ in out-of-the-way Cobham, Surrey, on Tuesday when it will update on trading. Its shares have picked up a little since their initial drop after the referendum vote, but are still down 18%, and Berkeley is likely to drop out of the FTSE 100. While all this is going on, shareholders are being asked to approve \u00a321.5m in pay for chair Tony Pidgley, mainly from share options.</p> <p>Berkeley builds expensive homes in London whose prices have soared but are now falling fast. The average price of a home in the capital fell by \u00a330,000 in a month in July, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/09/average-london-property-price-falls-30000-in-july-haart-brexit-vote\" title=\"\">according to estate agent Haart</a>.</p> <p>No one knows what effect Brexit will eventually have on the property market, but it\u2019s fair to ask whether Pidgley, whose options date mainly from 2009, when the market was moribund, is raking in millions from a bubble that is bursting.</p>",

The idea that they have been preparing for well over a year for the G20 but suddenly there be a malfunction with the ramp just for one president \u2026 that really strains credulity.\u201d</p> <p>A Chinese foreign ministry official involved in the visit denied it had been a snub, <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2014484/staircase-snub-obama-was-united-states-decision-reveals\">telling the South China Morning Post</a> the US delegation had declined to use the usual rolling red-carpet staircase. </p> <p>\u201cIt would do China no good in treating Obama rudely,\u201d the official, who declined to be named, was quoted as saying. </p> <p>\u201cChina provides a rolling staircase for every arriving state leader, but the US side complained that the driver doesn\u2019t speak English and can\u2019t understand security instructions from the United States; so China proposed that we could assign a translator to sit beside the driver, but the US side turned down the proposal and insisted that they didn\u2019t need the staircase provided by the airport,\u201d the official added.</p> <p>The US president offered a diplomatic reply when asked to comment on the airport \u201ckerfuffle\u201d on Sunday during a joint press conference with Theresa May.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t over-crank the significance of it because, as I said, this is not the first time that these things happen and it doesn\u2019t just happen here. It happens in a lot of places including, by the way, sometimes our allies,\u201d Obama said, adding that \u201cnone of this detracts from the broader scope of the relationship\u201d.</p> <p>Obama suggested his Chinese hosts might have found the size of the US delegation \u201ca little overwhelming\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of planes, a lot of helicopters, a lot of cars and a lot of guys.

I remember when my president came, one of the Mexican press corps came out of it with stitches,\u201d Guajardo recalled.</p> <p>But Obama\u2019s unceremonious arrival was unusual and surely deliberate, the former Mexican ambassador added. \u201cJust as the Chinese are about giving face they are also about not giving it and letting you know that they are not giving it to you \u2026 They don\u2019t overlook these things by mistake. It\u2019s not who they are. It\u2019s not the way they do these things,\u201d he said. </p>",
  "<p>When the 1960s began, I was in the sixth form of a run-down private school on the Isle of Wight with no prospect of going to university and no thought that my future could be any less miserable and monotonous than my past. When they ended \u2013 literally, in December 1969 \u2013 I was on tour with Eric Clapton.</p> <p>In those days before interviewers were dogged by protective PRs, I travelled with Clapton and his band (soon to metamorphose into Derek and the Dominos), hung out with them between gigs and watched every show from the wings. At the back of the stage, unnoticed by their audience, stood a bearded extra guitarist in a buckskin jacket and Stetson hat. It was George Harrison, whom Clapton had invited on the tour to escape the trauma of the Beatles\u2019 breakup and get used to playing live again after years shut away in the recording studio. Sixties memories like that can still make me close my eyes and whistle through my teeth.</p> <p>Many more will be stirring this autumn \u2013 and not only thanks to the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. This month sees the London premiere of <em>Eight Days a Week</em>, a documentary about the Beatles\u2019 touring years, 1963-66, directed by Ron Howard. Hard on its Cuban heels, two more books about the 1960s will join the pile to which I myself have contributed more than my share. Steve Turner\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/beatles-66.html\" title=\"\"><em>Beatles \u201966: The Revolutionary Year</em></a> reconstructs the band\u2019s exploits in that eventful season (also recently commemorated in Jon Savage\u2019s weighty <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/1966-the-year-the-decade-exploded.html\" title=\"\"><em>1966: the Year the Decade Exploded</em></a>.)

At regular intervals since the mid-80s, glossy magazines have announced that the 60s are back with fashion spreads of Paisley fabrics, Mary Quant-ish bobs, shorter-than-ever miniskirts and elastic-sided chelsea boots. Sixties pop music eternally dominates radio playlists while its most notorious band, the Rolling Stones, though now withered old-age pensioners, are still widely reckoned the coolest, most dangerous dudes on the planet.</p> <p>Much of the worship, of course, comes from the surviving participants, those one-time flower children who in some cases went on to be wealthy industrialists or media moguls and, in others, sad gits with grey ponytails. But the 60s\u2019 most fervent acolytes tend to be people who never experienced them first-hand, yet still yearn for them in a syndrome that psychologists call \u201cnostalgia without memory\u201d. (Tony Blair\u2019s concept of Cool Britannia in the 90s, for instance, pastiched the swinging London of 30 years earlier, right down to the union jack carrier bags.) In popular memory they live on as a rosy blur of psychedelic colour, sexual permissiveness and Beatles music, their complexity and manifold horrors (the Kennedy assassination, the Vietnam war, the Moors murders, the ever-present threat of global nuclear war, to name just a few) either unrealised or disregarded.</p> <p>I\u2019m thought of as an expert on the period, thanks to my books about the Beatles and the Stones, but actually I consider myself somewhat of an imposter. I didn\u2019t make it to swinging London until after the 60s\u2019 halfway point when, many sensed then and historians now say, its best was already over. Latecomer or not, my life was to be transformed beyond the wildest dreams I\u2019d never had.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ddf450be6259701f19b76b41fd3e4116889becc3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddf450be6259701f19b76b41fd3e4116889becc3/429_449_2138_1282/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Rolling Stones in 1967: once the most dangerous men on the planet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Rolling Stones in 1967: once the most dangerous men on the planet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I had left school and the Isle of Wight aged 18 to become an \u201ceditorial apprentice\u201d on a weekly newspaper on the fringes of East Anglia. I therefore missed out completely on London\u2019s first phase of totally unexpected fashionability, which was mainly about film and theatre and the first satire worthy of the name since the 18th century. On my second day at work, a vicar from whom I was soliciting news informed me kindly I had no chance of getting to Fleet Street without a university degree. I had already despaired of joining the stripe-shirted Oxbridge satirists currently flaying Harold Macmillan\u2019s clapped-out Tory government on BBC TV\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/nov/26/that-was-the-week-that-was-review-1962\" title=\"\"><em>That Was the Week That Was</em></a>, at Peter Cook\u2019s Establishment club or in the newly founded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/sep/11/private-eye-50\" title=\"\"><em>Private Eye</em></a>. An obvious vain hope on my measly two A-levels.</p> <p>Shackled to my boring round of funerals and whist drives, I watched from afar as the Beatles appeared on the Royal Variety Performance in 1963, sending entrenched class barriers tumbling, and then in 1964 as they left on their first trip to America, the point where the decade really exploded. I could only read in the new Sunday colour supplements about what seemed to follow in their wake; the sudden concerted burst of youthful creativity in fashion, art, photography and graphics. All the new mega-celebrities \u2013 David Bailey, Twiggy, Julie Christie, Rita Tushingham, Tom Courtenay, Terence Stamp \u2013 were my age or a little older and seemed to congregate in the same, unpublicised clubs and bistros; the most emblematic pop single, among so many, was Dobie Gray\u2019s The \u201cIn\u201d Crowd.</p> <p>In 1966, <em>Time</em> magazine dubbed London the style capital of Europe, bringing hordes of young Americans across the Atlantic intent on meeting the Beatles and, maybe, the Queen. From then on, the 60s became industrialised; the \u201cin\u201d crowd was everyone. Even the snack bar around the corner from my Newcastle upon Tyne bedsit put a sticker in its window saying JOIN THE SANDWICH SET. By then I was 22 and a reporter on a north-eastern daily paper but no aspirations beyond, if I was very lucky, the <em>Guardian\u2019s </em>Manchester office. Each weekend, I devoured the <em>Sunday Times</em> <em>Magazine</em> with its ads for Scandinavian furniture, stereo systems and white Kosset carpets that were part of the new \u201cswinging\u201d ethos, as were its recipes for exotic dishes like chicken kiev and beef stroganoff using quantities of butter and cream that in the very recent war and postwar years would have seemed downright immoral.</p> <p>Hugely wealthy from its advertising revenues, the magazine viewed itself as a stand-alone international title on the same level as <em>Life</em> or <em>Paris-Match</em>, employing a galaxy of top international photographers headed by the Queen\u2019s brother-in-law Lord Snowdon (classless or what?) and including Bailey, Don McCullin, Terry O\u2019Neill, Eve Arnold and Diane Arbus. From opulent sales pitches for After Eight mints or Smirnoff vodka, you\u2019d turn to running spreads of Glasgow slums or the Biafra famine or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/02/girl-vietnam-napalm-photo-peace\" title=\"\">Napalm-scalded child victims</a> of the Vietnam war.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60de2235d86636cfc33377ecde7f5845764f71e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60de2235d86636cfc33377ecde7f5845764f71e5/0_235_5456_3274/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside the Biba shop in Kensington in the 1960s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside the Biba shop in Kensington in the 1960s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alain Le Garsmeur/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The \u201cquality\u201d Sunday papers, above all, were known to recruit only from Oxbridge. But in 1966, in a quintessentially 60s moment, The <em>Sunday Times</em> magazine announced a talent contest for writers under 23. I just met the age qualification and sent in a 2,000-word profile of my wicked, irresistible old Grandma Norman, who used to sell seaside rock on Ryde Esplanade. I won the competition and was rewarded with a job as a staff writer at a stupefying \u00a330 per week.</p> <p>Thus I made my belated arrival in London in June 1966. The Beach Boys\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/31/three-albums-1966-beatles-revolver-bob-dylan-blonde-on-blonde-beach-boys-pet-sounds\" title=\"\"><em>Pet Sounds</em></a><em> </em>album had just been released and the Beatles\u2019 <em>Revolver</em> was soon to be. The weather was continuously glorious; Chelsea\u2019s King\u2019s Road thronged with boys in Victorian military tunics and \u201cdolly birds\u201d in wasp-striped minidresses and floppy hats; the new Post Office tower, which then had a revolving gourmet restaurant at its summit, glittered thrillingly on the skyline.</p> <p>A couple of weeks later, England won the World Cup. I was outside the Royal Garden hotel in Kensington when the victorious team appeared on its balcony with the Labour prime minister Harold Wilson, taking a break from economic problems as bad as today\u2019s (another aspect of the 60s no one wants to know about). Later, I went to one of the parties held every night throughout South Ken\u2019s and Earls Court\u2019s bedsitter lands. You didn\u2019t have to be invited: you just walked in. Some people made a living out of stealing from the heaps of coats left on beds.</p> <p>During the evening, I heard one wasp-striped minidress ask another if she and her boyfriend would be going on to the Guys and Dolls coffee bar in Chelsea. \u201cNo,\u201d was the reply. \u201cWe\u2019re going to bed. Honestly, I\u2019m feeling so-o randy tonight.\u201d Quite a change from my late Newcastle girlfriend\u2019s stern injunction: \u201cGerroff, ya booger.\u201d</p> <p>Nothing better illustrates the 60s\u2019 phenomenal indulgence of youth than my career on the <em>Sunday Times </em>magazine. When I arrived, the newspaper was sponsoring Sir Francis Chichester\u2019s first solo circumnavigation of the world in his ketch, Gipsy Moth IV. My first assignment was to interview him before his departure. Coming from the Isle of Wight I was presumed to know about yachting, although throughout my childhood on Ryde pier I\u2019d never set foot in a sailboat. My maiden voyage was with Chichester as he tried out Gipsy Moth in the Solent, just off my former home. I next went to Oxford to talk to a former professor of Anglo-Saxon named JRR Tolkien, whose books about hobbits and elves had thus far sold mainly on American college campuses.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Under Godfrey, life was a constant round of champagne parties and dinners and lunches at his favourite restaurants</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A year later, I was given a first-class Air France ticket and $1,000 of travellers\u2019 cheques and sent to America on a dream assignment: drive Route 66 in a Ford Mustang from Chicago to LA for a 5,000-word cover story, then write about Harlem\u2019s Apollo theatre, see James Brown on stage and meet Big Mama Thornton and Screaming Jay Hawkins. For my stay in New York, I was booked into the Algonquin hotel, famous haunt of James Thurber, Dorothy Parker and the <em>New Yorker</em> wits. As I sat in the lobby in my Take 6 suit, kipper tie and Anello &amp; Davide boots, a judge and his wife from Cincinnati, Ohio, told me that they\u2019d seen all my movies and would be honoured if I\u2019d have dinner with them. They were too nice to tell me who they thought I was; I didn\u2019t ask and we passed a pleasant evening that provided my first-ever taste of green pasta.</p> <p>Like William Boot in Evelyn Waugh\u2019s <em>Scoop</em>, I\u2019d pictured Fleet Street as a place where \u201cneurotic men in shirtsleeves and eyeshades \u2026 rushed from telephone to tape machine, insulting and betraying each other in surroundings of unredeemed squalor\u201d. That was not how things were on the <em>Sunday Times </em>magazine. Picture the Ghost of Christmas Present in Dickens\u2019s <em>A Christmas Carol </em>\u2013 that portly, guffawing figure, seated on a heap of turkeys, strings of sausages and crackers \u2013 and you have a fair idea of my new editor, Godfrey Smith. Under Godfrey, life was a constant round of champagne parties and lunches and dinners at his favourite restaurants, Chez Victor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/aug/09/mario-cassandro-obituary\" title=\"\">Mario and Franco\u2019s La Terrazza</a> and the Gay Hussar. While it didn\u2019t teach me much about writing, it taught me to open champagne, smoke only Havana cigars and guiltlessly enjoy what Godfrey called \u201cNooners\u201d \u2013 lunch with a female companion, then the rest of the afternoon in bed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a98965fe69bc04db23b3c760374db877f5064d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a98965fe69bc04db23b3c760374db877f5064d6/114_35_1218_1521/801.jpg\" alt=\"Lord Snowdon, portrait photographer to the stars of the decade.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lord Snowdon, portrait photographer to the stars of the decade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harry Myers/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Around the first week of December, work virtually stopped for a sequence of pre-Christmas treats including a trip to the Oxford&#xa0;v Cambridge varsity rugby match (when I rooted for Cambridge as fervently as if I\u2019d been there) and a lunch at which executives entertained their secretaries with the thinly disguised objective of Nooners to follow. Our office Christmas party was an occasion to which all London\u2019s in-crowd fought for invitations, and might well contain Lord Snowdon in one corner and the East End gangster Reggie Kray in another. We would push all the desks together, then dance on top of them, Godfrey leading the measure.</p> <p>When I tell young journalists about the expenses, they simply don\u2019t believe me. These you drew in advance with a pink slip which any magazine colleague could countersign; then you took it to a cashier\u2019s window from which old big, blue \u00a35 notes were unquestioningly shovelled out. From the (never challenged) accounts we submitted, the business manager Bill Cater once offered an \u201cExpenseman of the Year\u201d award. It was won by my office-mate James Fox \u2013 later author of <em>White Mischief</em>, and Keith Richards\u2019s ghostwriter \u2013 for an entry reading simply: \u201cTaxi, there. And back.\u201d</p> <p>The magazine\u2019s huge profits in fact subsidised the paper, which led to as much mutual dislike and suspicion as between old East and West Berlin. Our black-and-white colleagues thought us all drunkards and sexual perverts while we referred to them contemptuously as \u201cthe Steam Section\u201d. The paper\u2019s then proprietor, Lord Thomson, was the most benign ever known; so long as the ad revenues kept rolling in, even our worst editorial blunders and bungles received no word of censure. Far from dreading the sack, we had the job security of monks illuminating manuscripts in some medieval cloister.</p> <p>Godfrey was not answerable to the Steam Section\u2019s editor, the dynamic Harry Evans, but directly to Lord T through his chief executive, CD Hamilton (which explains why subsequent <em>ST</em> editors have wanted to make their mark on the magazine rather than the paper). We did whatever we pleased, without any regard to topicality, the PR machine or, indeed, our readers.</p> <p>In 1968, Godfrey decided to profile <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/23/elizabeth-taylor-obituary\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> for no other reason than she was the world\u2019s biggest celebrity and most beautiful woman. Such was the magazine\u2019s prestige that she was instantly at our disposal. Godfrey was to have written the 5,000-word cover piece himself, but when the research was all in, he decided he couldn\u2019t face it and handed the job over to me.</p> <p>I spent two days interviewing Taylor and her husband, Richard Burton, in the Austrian Alps, where Burton was filming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/06/geoff-dyer-where-eagles-dare\" title=\"\"><em>Where Eagles Dare </em></a>\u2013 as usual without a PR in sight. I rode with them in their limo, carried their pet Pekinese around, had dinner with them at their hotel, then sat up drinking brandy with Burton, who still wore his Nazi officer\u2019s uniform from the day\u2019s filming.

After work, if there was no champagne party in the office, I\u2019d go to a club: the UFO in Tottenham Court Road to see Pink Floyd or Soft Machine, the Speakeasy, off Regent Street, where you entered, Narnia-like, through a glass wardrobe door, or Revolution in Bruton Place where Christine Keeler, the woman who brought down the Macmillan government, danced alone every night.</p> <p>Swinging London\u2019s great charm was that three quarters of it wasn\u2019t swinging yet; exploitation of its youthful swingers was still at a minimum. Dinner for two in a bistro cost around \u00a33.50. At my friend Barbara Hulanicki\u2019s Biba boutique in Kensington Church Street, the stuff was so reasonable that the lowest-paid office worker could afford a new outfit every week, trying it on in the communal changing-room with the likes of Cilla Black, Julie Christie or Cher.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t partake of everything in the sensory smorgasbord. I seldom encountered pot (other than in the magazine\u2019s art department) and was never offered LSD. My first and only line of cocaine didn\u2019t come until the early 1980s, albeit through the good offices of a 60s icon, Marianne Faithfull.</p> <p>Nor did I get into eastern religion following the Beatles\u2019 example or join the hippies, who arrived post-1966. I would rather have swallowed hemlock than grown a beard, worn a kaftan, burned a joss stick or murmured \u201clove and peace\u201d in the peculiar, teeth-clenching flower-child accent whose last living practitioner seems to be Sir Richard Branson. But, naive and deluded though they may have been, the hippies\u2019 festivals, love-ins and \u201chappenings\u201d brought hundreds of thousands together without the slightest violence; there were moments when even a cynic like me wondered if they might really be a force for changing the world for the better.</p> <p>Normally, people are impatient to get out of an old decade and into a new one, but not those of us for whom the 60s had turned into a non-stop party. Their final year brought a series of epic open-air festivals \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2016/jul/11/woodstock-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Woodstock</a>, Bob Dylan at the Isle of Wight, the Stones\u2019 free concert in Hyde Park \u2013 as if to squeeze the very most from every second.

The Beatles\u2019 press officer Derek Taylor allowed me to hang around Apple\u2019s offices at 3 Savile Row for several weeks pretty much as I pleased. I spent a morning with Lennon and Yoko Ono in their office, sat in on a George Harrison photoshoot, chatted to Ringo as he ate egg and chips, even got to meet the terrifying Klein.

  "<p>Chocolate is far from a generic product. Madagascan cocoa is fruity, with a slight acidity; cocoa from S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 is woody and spicy, while cocoa from Papua New Guinea has musky, leathery undertones.</p> <p>This uniqueness \u2013 and <a href=\"http://blog.euromonitor.com/2014/08/single-origin-chocolate-the-future-of-premium-chocolate-confectionery-foretold.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">growing interest</a> in it as a selling point to consumers \u2013 provides an opportunity for producing countries to gain a bigger proportion of the billion-dollar chocolate industry by expanding the market for single-origin chocolate. </p> <p>Because of their unique taste profiles, and often small production, single-origin beans command a premium. While beans traded on the commodities exchange currently sell at <a href=\"http://www.icco.org/statistics/cocoa-prices/daily-prices.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">about $3/kg</a>, Fran\u00e7ois Pralus, a <a href=\"https://www.chocolats-pralus.com/en/Francois-Pralus.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">French chocolatier</a>, says that the beans he buys cost from $4.50/kg in Ghana to $11/kg in Venezuela. He also buys them directly from the producer (as is often the case for single-origin chocolate, for issues of traceability), cutting out the middle man.</p> <p>Although this price premium is positive for cocoa growers, the beans remain a raw material export. The chocolate is then manufactured in Europe or North America, with ingredients (cocoa butter, milk, sugar) sourced elsewhere. Most of the costs are added outside the country of origin; typically, raw ingredients only make up <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3OxqkAXt3k\" rel=\"nofollow\">about 3%</a> of a bar\u2019s price.</p> <p>Some chocolate producers are therefore pushing the concept of single origin further. And it is this that offers the potential for even more of the value of the lucrative chocolate trade to be kept in countries such as Ivory Coast and Madagascar.</p> <h2>What is single-origin chocolate?</h2> <p>The new idea of single-origin chocolate means that all the ingredients in the couverture (the wholesale/bulk cocoa used by chefs, chocolatiers etc) must come from the same country and be processed locally. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.chocolaterierobert.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chocolaterie Robert</a> for instance, a chocolate producer based in Madagascar, exports single-origin chocolate products (notably couverture) under the brand name Chocolat Madagascar.

The Madagascan products complement their single-origin couverture range, which also includes chocolate from Colombia and Grenada. </p> <p>Steve Calver, account manager at HB Ingredients, says that single-origin couverture remains a niche market because of its price and limited production (Chocolaterie Robert for instance produces 280 tonnes of cocoa and Claudio Corallo in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe just 20 tonnes).</p> <p>But it is growing, he says, partly because of its quality, and partly because of <a href=\"http://blog.euromonitor.com/2014/08/single-origin-chocolate-the-future-of-premium-chocolate-confectionery-foretold.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">greater consumer awareness</a> of what single-origin chocolate means.</p> <p>Unfortunately, current labelling rules don\u2019t allow consumers to easily distinguish between single-origin chocolate made in the origin country and single-origin chocolate harvested in one country but made elsewhere, so it\u2019s left to manufacturers, distributors and retailers to explain. Chocolat Madagascar uses the <a href=\"http://www.raisetrade.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Raise Trade</a> label, a movement seeking to positively identify products manufactured in the country of origin.</p> <h2>How can cacao producers benefit?</h2> <p>Over the past three years, Chocolat Madagascar has won a raft of international awards and spurred Chocolaterie Robert to invest in a new plantation. Last year, it bought 1,700 hectares of degraded cocoa plantations from the government. When fully rehabilitated (which will take between five and 10 years), the new plantation should have a production capacity of 600 tonnes, more than double what it was previously, with the prospect of adding to its staff of 70 people. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7503781fcc2dcc701b3aec816a8f52f3824a0f0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7503781fcc2dcc701b3aec816a8f52f3824a0f0c/183_0_753_452/500.jpg\" alt=\"Chocolat Madagascar\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chocolat Madagascar is planning to increase production and employment at its facilities in the country.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chocolat Madagascar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A number of small chocolate factories have popped up in Peru, Ecuador, Brazil and Vietnam over the past few years, but they remain few and far between, especially in Africa.

Starting from scratch is an onerous task, even for experienced hands. Pralus, who has a small cocoa plantation on the island of Nosy Be in north-west Madagascar, says that he gave up on plans to build a chocolate factory there because of the difficult business climate \u2013 the country is ranked 164 out of 189 countries for ease of doing business according to the <a href=\"http://www.doingbusiness.org/reports/global-reports/doing-business-2016\" rel=\"nofollow\">World Bank</a>. </p> <p>Breaking into new markets is another challenge. In the mid-2000s, Chocolaterie Robert tried but failed to market its retail products in Europe and the US. \u201cThat\u2019s how we decided to go for wholesale; it means our investment is about cocoa, not about branding or marketing,\u201d says Kelsall.</p> <p>Claudio Corallo, the only cocoa grower to also manufacture in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, says that it is a question of hard work and ultimately, philosophy. \u201cMy chocolate is from soil to bar, not bean to bar. It\u2019s something you must nurture from the plant,\u201d he says. On the sustainable dimension of processing chocolate in the country of origin, he says: \u201cPeople who do the pruning, who deliver, who peel the cocoa beans, they must feel they are part of the machine.

As the Chartists begin the first of many uprisings, can Leopold convince her to keep it in the family? <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2>BattleBots </h2> <p><strong>8pm, Spike<br></strong>In the US, as here, televised mechanical grappling has recently been revived after years away: its version of Robot Wars is the same idea, with predictable differences in execution. The competitors are sterner, as are the bellowing, heavily hairsprayed presenters and commentators. But in a starker arena with no house robots and simple perimeter hazards, the fights are awesome. Painful as it is to admit, the best of these machines would marmalise their British rivals. <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2>Jay Leno\u2019s Garage </h2> <p><strong>7pm, Dave<br></strong>The Top Gear tribute from the most famous chin in chatshow history continues, as Leno delves deeper into Californian car culture. Tonight\u2019s peek at automotive LA includes a history of low-riders, the Peterson Car Museum\u2019s secret celebrity stash, and Leno hanging with Japanese hot-rodders. As with last week\u2019s opener, petrolhead pandering outweighs entertainment value, making this an affair mainly for those born clutching a copy of Redline magazine. <em>Mark Gibbings-Jones</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>The Wolf Of Wall Street<br>(Martin Scorsese, 2013), 9.30pm, Channel 4</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ffe4b8256273517863abceb053e81c4c2e6beda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ffe4b8256273517863abceb053e81c4c2e6beda/0_120_3072_1842/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Wolf Of Wall Street\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Wolf Of Wall Street</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mary Cybulski/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Scorsese has a high old time of it, revelling in the debauchery of Wall Street\u2019s drugs-and-sex-addled stockbroking princes, as described in the (surely overblown) memoir of trader \u2013 and later convict \u2013 Jordan Belfort. It\u2019s done with great skill and fizzing energy, but is basically Goodfellas without the violence and, pretty much, the humour. Leonardo DiCaprio exerts all the star appeal he can but still, over the course of nearly three hours, fails to make Belfort likable. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><strong>The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo<br>(David Fincher, 2011), 10pm, ITV4<br></strong>After the twisty chills of 2009\u2019s Swedish adaptation of Stieg Larsson\u2019s mega-seller, such a swift US remake seemed superfluous, but in the event it\u2019s a success. David \u201cSeven\u201d Fincher is a natural fit for the novel\u2019s gloomy nastiness and Rooney Mara rivals Noomi Rapace as the haunted, brilliantly resourceful Lisbeth Salander, though Daniel Craig radiates a tad too much Bond aura as the investigative journo Mikael Blomkvist. <em>PH</em></p> <h2>Today\u2019s best live sport</h2> <p><br><strong>One-Day International Cricket: England v Pakistan 10am, Sky Sports 2<br></strong>The final game of the series from Cardiff\u2019s Swalec Stadium. </p> <p><strong>Formula 1: Italian Grand Prix Live 12 noon, Channel 4<br></strong>Fast-car action from the Autodromo Nazionale Monza.</p> <p><strong>World Cup Football: Slovakia v England 4.30pm, ITV<br></strong>The nation tries to contain its wild excitement as the Sam Allardyce era begins. </p>"
