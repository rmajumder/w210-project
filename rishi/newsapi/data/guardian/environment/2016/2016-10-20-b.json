  "<p>A long-awaited report investigating sexual violence and harassment in UK universities has been criticised for failing fully to address the problem.</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/mar/17/university-leaders-call-for-new-rules-on-sexual-violence-allegations\">inquiry</a> was begun last year due to growing alarm about harassment, sexual violence and hate crime on university campuses, and concerns about the way in which some institutions deal with the problem.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/oct/21/i-was-being-stalked-but-my-university-refused-to-protect-me\">I was being stalked, but my university refused to protect me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The report calls for institution-wide action to tackle violence against women, harassment and hate crime by creating a zero-tolerance culture. It recommends a centralised reporting system supported by well-trained staff and an annual conference for the next three years to share good practice.</p> <p>The taskforce has also published guidance to universities about managing situations in which a student\u2019s behaviour may constitute a criminal offence,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/mar/17/university-leaders-call-for-new-rules-on-sexual-violence-allegations\"> replacing the so-called Zellick guidelines</a> which date back to 1994.</p> <p>Campaigners said the report, by the higher education representative body <a href=\"http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/\">Universities UK</a> (UUK), failed to tackle staff-student harassment adequately, focusing almost exclusively on incidents between students but also described it as a positive first step.</p> <p></p> <p>Rebecca Nice, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/07/abuse-at-university-case-study\">sexually harassed by a lecturer at Winchester University</a>, said the guidance would not have prevented her ordeal. She added that it failed to address the specific challenges involved in students bringing a complaint against a member of staff. \u201cI had to go to [my harasser\u2019s] boss, the dean of the faculty,\u201d said Nice. \u201cThere were too many loyalties and politics going on. There needs to be someone outside of that circle who can protect the student throughout the complaints procedure. It would help to erase that fear.\u201d</p> <p>While welcoming many of the recommendation, campaigners expressed frustration that there were no mechanisms to enforce the proposals, leaving institutions free to adopt \u2013 or ignore \u2013 them as they wish.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/26/sexual-harassment-of-students-by-university-staff-hidden-by-non-disclosure-agreements\">Sexual harassment of students by university staff hidden by non-disclosure agreements</a> </p> </aside>  <p></p> <p>Dr Rachel Fenton, associate professor of law at the University of the West of England, said it was obvious that no one with knowledge of sexual offences law had been involved in drawing up the legal guidance because it failed to grasp the complexities involved, for example, in determining consent. \u201cYou imagine being a university administrator in a disciplinary procedure where the girl says, \u2018I was drunk and he raped me\u2019 and he says, \u2018It was purely consensual, she was giving me the come on\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cThey have no training, no understanding of what that means, no way of understanding credibility, no guidance on how they are supposed to gather evidence, what evidence is appropriate [or] how they are supposed to make that decision. You are judging whether or not a rape occurred even if it is now called sexual misconduct. It\u2019s the same thing. It\u2019s sex without consent.\u201d</p> <p>The publication of the report, called Changing the Culture, occurred after a series of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/07/scale-of-sexual-abuse-in-uk-universities-likened-to-savile-and-catholic-scandals\">exclusive reports in the Guardian</a> revealing the scale of sexual harassment and violence perpetrated by university staff on students and more junior colleagues.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Guardian has received approximately 200 statements, mainly from women, detailing<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/07/i-was-so-traumatised-accounts-of-sexual-harassment-in-uk-universities\"> incidents of sexual harassment, assault and rape</a>, carried out by staff often on postgraduate and PhD students at a wide range of UK universities, including those in the elite Russell Group.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Jennifer Saul, professor of philosophy at Sheffield University and an expert in sexual harassment in higher education, welcomed the report\u2019s call for commitment from the most senior leaders in universities and its recognition of the need for clear policies and procedures, and proper training for those implementing them. \u201cStaff-student harassment needs to be much more fully addressed \u2013 as I hope it will be \u2013 in future work. It cannot be dealt with by simply extending the plans for dealing with student-student harassment. The power dynamics are fundamentally different from those in peer-to-peer harassment.\u201d</p> <p>The UUK taskforce, which was set up following government intervention, acknowledged that staff-to-student sexual harassment needed to be further addressed, along with online harassment and hate crimes on the grounds of race. \u201cUniversities UK will consult with universities, students and interested groups to assess what more can be done in these areas and what further action is necessary,\u201d a spokesperson said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/07/scale-of-sexual-abuse-in-uk-universities-likened-to-savile-and-catholic-scandals\">Scale of sexual abuse in UK universities likened to Savile and Catholic scandals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The report revealed a worrying lack of data within universities on how many UK students are affected by incidents of sexual violence. The taskforce, made up of university leaders, students and academic experts, also highlighted shortcomings in prevention and response in some institutions.</p> <p>Nicola Dandridge, UUK chief executive and chair of the taskforce, said: \u201cThe university sector has been clear that there is no place for sexual violence, harassment or hate crime on a university campus, nor anywhere else.</p> <p>\u201cThe impact of any such incident on a student is so potentially serious that universities must be ready to respond effectively and proactively engage in prevention initiatives.</p> <p>\u201cThe evidence showed that while many universities have already taken positive steps to address these issues, university responses are not always as joined up as they could be. There is more work that can be done to share effective practice across the sector.</p> <p>Universities minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jo-johnson\">Jo Johnson</a> said: \u201cWe must now ensure that the work this taskforce has done goes on to make a real difference to students across the country. So I have asked UUK to survey progress in six months and make sure universities are doing all they can to protect the safety and security of their students.\u201d<br></p> <p>Green said universities should aim for a standard of protection on a par with safeguarding, which would require external regulation to ensure appropriate standards were met. She also expressed concern about the lack of attention to staff-student harassment.</p> <p>Referring to the Guardian\u2019s coverage, she said: \u201cReports last week detailed the shocking experiences of some postgraduate students at the hands of senior staff, and we know staff-on-student abuse is part of the problem women face. We would like to see regulations put in place [to] prevent sexual relationships between staff and students.\u201d</p> <p>The report acknowledged that, in the absence of statistics from universities, it had relied on the National Union of Students (NUS) for data about sexual harassment and violence against women.</p> <p>Hareem Ghani, the NUS\u2019s women\u2019s officer, said: \u201cWe know sexual harassment and violence is prevalent on our campuses and women are disproportionately affected by this. In our post-Brexit society we have become only too aware of the steep rise in hate crime.</p> <p>\u201cNo student should have to face this on their campus and we welcome the opportunity this guidance presents in offering clear recommendations to the leadership in education on the actions they need to take to challenge these issues.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>During last week\u2019s presidential debate, Hillary Clinton leaned on an old and appealing line. \u201cWe are great because we are good.\u201d Reagan has used it before, as did Eisenhower. What it means, of course, is that our country\u2019s performance advantage on the world stage comes from our willingness to do the right thing.</p> <p>Businesses who market social responsibility as a selling point have been trying to make the same claim for decades. But it hasn\u2019t been enough of a selling point. So, some savvy brands are digging deeper on what it means in practice to be great.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/12/google-environmental-sustainability-data-kate-brandt\">How Google is using big data to protect the environment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Take the recent radical actions of Swiss sportswear brand Skins, for example. Skins invested a good deal of its cache on British marathoner Robert Young. An abused child who had grown into a man committed to the impossible, Young claimed to have run 370 marathons in a single year. His 2016 feat, sponsored by Skins, was to run across America in 46 days. What better way to inspire the brand\u2019s performance minded customers?</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jun/22/robert-young-marathon-record-attempt-cheating-rumors\">rumors began that Young was cheating</a> \u2013 rather than running \u2013 his way across the country. And this is where things got interesting. Rather than sit back and wait for the truth to come out, Skins launched its own investigation, hiring two independent researchers \u2013 Roger Pielke Jr, of the University of Colorado Boulder, and Ross Tucker, of the University of the Free State \u2013 to look into the claims. When they found that Young had likely been hopping into vehicles rather than running, Skins <a href=\"https://www.skins.net/usa/rob-young-investigation/\">published the 101-page report on its website</a> and ended its deal with Young.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a difficult situation when the shit hit the fan,\u201d Skins CEO Jamie Fuller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/oct/02/robert-young-marathon-sponsor-stands-tall\">told the Guardian</a>. \u201cBut the most important thing for us isn\u2019t the initial problem \u2013 because problems will always happen \u2013 it\u2019s what you do when they arise. In our view, there are no half measures when you apply and live by your principles.\u201d</p> <p>The move may seem counterintuitive at first. When the Nike Oregon Project running team faced a doping scandal in 2015, Nike waited for the results of its own investigation and then quietly withdrew sponsorship, a strategy we\u2019ve all come to expect. Why would Skins invite the negative attention? Why spend money on an investigation that is likely to embarrass the company?</p> <p>While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/oct/02/robert-young-marathon-sponsor-stands-tall\">Sean Ingle\u2019s Guardian piece</a> brilliantly scratched the surface as to why this is such a rare example, it\u2019s worth digging deeper into how the company\u2019s actions measure up against other corporate social responsibility efforts.</p> <p>The underlying message of how Skins approached this speaks of a company on a quest for perfection and, in that quest, doing the right thing is just a natural extension of excellence. Skins flipped the logic of traditional corporate social responsibility marketing by saying: \u201cWe are good, because we are great.\u201d</p> <p>See the difference? Skins isn\u2019t saying, \u201cWe\u2019re making great products because we do the right thing.\u201d It\u2019s saying, \u201cWe do the right thing because it\u2019s just part of making great things.\u201d</p> <p>The company\u2019s actions send a strong message about its high-performance gear: to create an extremely high-quality product, a brand must pursue operational perfection. Abusing workers, trashing the planet, tripping through doping scandals \u2013 this is all evidence of a sloppy company that cuts corners.</p> <p>A brand that wants to charge a premium for what it claims are excellent products wins when it shows that it ruthlessly roots out imperfection wherever it\u2019s found.</p> <p>Fuller has built his entire brand around this concept. The company\u2019s mission statement declares that: \u201cSport should be played with creativity, flair and sportsmanship, free of corruption and drugs.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/01/north-carolina-hb2-law-transgender-issues-corporate-businesses-protest\">Inside corporate America's stand against transgender discrimination</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How do you live by that mission? By making excellent products that allow athletes to win cleanly and by standing up against cheating. For consumers, the message reinforces the value of Skins products. In the logic of, \u201cWe are good because we are great\u201d, publicly investigating and cutting Young was a no-brainer. In doing so, Skins took what promised to be yet one more brand-bashing scandal and turned it into something positive.</p> <p>Evidence suggests that transparency in handling a corporate scandal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/jul/29/what-are-the-business-benefits-of-being-more-transparent\">can actually help a company\u2019s bottom line</a>, both from a consumer perspective as well as <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental/03/121703.asp\">overall market value</a>.</p> <p>That\u2019s why brands should take notice of this unusual case. Using recycled content, donating a dollar for each purchase, reducing packaging \u2013 these are common efforts by companies who want to tell a story about doing the right thing. We\u2019ve seen that story before.</p> <p>The story that gets people talking \u2013 and buying \u2013 involves pursuing greatness with passion and zeal and doing the right thing in that pursuit. Any brand can do this simply by asking this: what is the greatness we are pursuing, and what good for the world can we do as part of that pursuit?</p>",

But the canvases of our lives are increasingly splodged and muddled with traffic noise, street noise, loud music from other people\u2019s houses and cars, not to mention our own, TVs and radios.

In 1951, Chess released Rocket 88 by Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats, which is considered the first rock record. Besides electric blues, between 1950 and 1969, the label also released jazz, gospel, soul, doo-wop, rockabilly, some country and psychedelic rock. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcFIj8OuIEI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WcFIj8OuIEI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cThe body of work created by Chess is unmatched in blues history with literally hundreds of songs that are considered classics,\u201d said Bruce Iglauer, president of <a href=\"http://www.alligator.com/\">Alligator Records</a>, the Chicago blues label. </p> <p>Phil and his older brother Leonard emigrated from Poland to the US in 1928 to join their father in Chicago where he worked as a shoemaker and carpenter. By then Yasef Czy\u017c had changed the family name to Chess and his sons, Lejzor and Fiszel, became Leonard and Philip. As teenagers they later joined him in running a family junkyard that happened to be across from a black Baptist church. Years later both brothers would say they were influenced by the music they heard coming through the building\u2019s windows throughout the week. </p> <p>\u201cOn a Sunday, man, they\u2019d get going with that groove and you couldn\u2019t help but stand there and dance. Really, that\u2019s, that\u2019s how good it was,\u201d <a href=\"http://openvault.wgbh.org/transcripts/V_0FDCCD5CA2EB47BAA80E9DDD21954D05\">Phil said in a 1995 interview</a>. \u201cWe gradually got a feel for this black blues. And thank God it took off.\u201d</p> <p>After a stint in the army, Phil joined his brother in the club business in Bronzeville, the city\u2019s center of black nightlife. Eventually they took over Aristocrat Records, a pop label they renamed Chess. The first record under their direction was I Can\u2019t Be Satisfied by Muddy Waters. The 3,000 copies the company pressed sold out in a single day.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL53_etpc7Y\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bL53_etpc7Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Through his earliest days running liquor stores and clubs in Bronzeville, Leonard Chess got to know many of the label\u2019s earliest artists such as Muddy Waters, and throughout the label\u2019s heyday he played a prominent role in securing the artists and producing sessions while his younger brother played a quieter role in the back office, which included handling <a href=\"http://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/bmg-buys-control-of-chess-records-publishing-company-arc/\">Arc Music</a>, the company\u2019s important publishing arm, and traveling to radio stations across the US and persuading disc jockeys to give their artists a chance.</p> <p>\u201cPhil was the rock of the company. He held down the office and took care of financial matters,\u201d said Iglauer. \u201cLeonard was known to be emotional, mercurial, and sometimes difficult to deal with while Phil was always the solid one. He was the go-to guy when business had to be dealt with.\u201d</p> <p>Together the brothers recorded artists targeting the black market with no intention of targeting white record buyers, primarily because radio remained largely segregated with little opportunity for exposure. However as the 1950s moved forward, artists such as Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Howlin\u2019 Wolf and Muddy Waters found their way outside the black market, particularly to England. \u201cTheir early releases of the Muddy and the Wolf and Sonny Boy records helped whites get into it although I don\u2019t think they were too aware this was happening,\u201d said Bob Koester, founder of Chicago-based <a href=\"http://delmark.com/\">Delmark Records</a>, the oldest jazz and blues independent record label in the US.</p> <p>Both men were not musicians nor had musical training, but they often admitted they had no method to their process but instead prided themselves with having an ear for artists they knew were unique. \u201cAnything different that would draw your attention,\u201d was their baseline for signing artists, Phil said. After getting his demos rejected elsewhere, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/chuck-berry\">Chuck Berry</a> showed up at the Chess doorstep with just a notebook of lyrics and a tape. \u201cIt was different \u2026 It had a lot of country to it,\u201d he said. The label would test records by throwing open its doors on South Cottage Grove Avenue and watch the reaction of people waiting at the bus stop. \u201cThat was our gauge. It wasn\u2019t always right, but 99% of the times it was right,\u201d he said. </p> <p>As Chess grew it expanded beyond blues and served as an important label for jazz, recording saxophonists Gene Ammons, Sonny Stitt and Rahsaan Roland Kirk, pianists Ramsey Lewis and Ahmad Jamal.</p> <p>The British Invasion helped usher in a new wave of interest on Chess artists during its second decade. The Rolling Stones, who named their band after a Waters song, made the pilgrimage to Chicago to record there, as did the Yardbirds. But the label never lost its connection with its black audience. In 1963 the brothers purchased a South Side radio station and changed its call letters to WVON (Voice of the Negro) and it became a towering outlet for black music during that decade. </p> <p>The brothers got out of the business in 1969; a few months after selling the company Leonard died of a heart attack. Phil Chess relocated to Arizona where he lived until his death. Sheva Jonesi, his wife of 70 years who he met in high school, died in April.</p> <p>The Universal Music Group now controls the Chess catalogue and the label\u2019s final headquarters at 2120 S Michigan Avenue is now operated by a foundation owned by the family of Willie Dixon, the label\u2019s house songwriter, arranger and bassist. </p> <p>Until his death Phil insisted that Chuck Berry invented rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, not Elvis Presley. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/18/chuck-berry-new-album-first-in-38-years\">Berry turned 90 on Tuesday</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThe story of the blues is you tell your feelings,\u201d Phil said in 1995. \u201cThat\u2019s what it is, you have to catch the blues when it comes from the heart. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re black, white, green or yellow.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Monday night\u2019s Four Corners program about the treatment of asylum seeker children on Nauru has seen the program and the ABC attacked by both the Australian and Nauruan governments. These broad swipes \u2013 attacking the ABC as an institution rather than addressing the merits of the journalism \u2013 is an approach that only works if you\u2019ve been undermining the national broadcaster through years of culture wars.</p> <p>The entire conservative attitude towards the ABC was summed up in a single exchange last month.</p> <p>The former prime minister John Howard was doing the media rounds in mid-September to promote the ABC-produced documentary he had made about his own favourite prime minister, Sir Robert Menzies.</p> <p>On 15 September Howard spoke to Tom Switzer on Radio National\u2019s Between the Lines. Switzer, a journalist and former Liberal National party adviser, frequently explores international politics with guests from traditionally conservative outlets such as the Daily Telegraph, Fox News and the Wall Street Journal. It\u2019s an often-interesting program, a million miles away from the cartoonish Sean Hannity clips that have come to represent rightwing commentary.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/18/abc-and-nauru-government-clash-over-four-corners-expose-of-offshore-detention\">ABC and Nauru government clash over Four Corners expos\u00e9 of offshore detention</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The interview with Howard was light and conversational, which seemed appropriate for the interview topic. (A former prime minister discussing a TV series he made about another former prime minister is not really the place to re-prosecute the Iraq invasion. Your mileage may vary.)</p> <p>Then the moment came.</p> <p>SWITZER: Menzies once said of the ABC, \u201cI have never been persona grata with the ABC, nor the ABC with me.\u201d So let\u2019s hope your experience today means you\u2019ve had a different view about the ABC.</p> <p>HOWARD: Hahaha, next question.</p> <p>A seemingly innocuous exchange, and hardly a surprise to hear someone on the right chuckle at the idea of receiving a fair go on the ABC. But the fact that we are so used to this type of offhand commentary highlights the absurdity of this particular situation.</p> <p>Let\u2019s set the scene: this was at least the third promotional interview Howard had done on the ABC that week, which included time on ABC TV\u2019s Lateline and Radio National\u2019s Drive, not including the live broadcast of Howard\u2019s National Press Club address on the legacy of Robert Menzies, all of it designed to promote Howard\u2019s three-part documentary that the ABC had itself funded. The airwaves were so dominated by commercials for the series, I could probably recreate them verbatim should the need ever arise.</p> <p>So as Howard and Switzer sat in the ABC studios promoting a Menzies puff piece that had been made on the ABC dime, they chuckled at the unspoken but clearly understood premise that the ABC is a hive of leftwing Trotskyites, working overtime to keep the conservative message down. Caricaturists need not apply.</p> <p>This view is one that is profoundly unshakable, no matter what the evidence actually shows. In a 2009 research paper, How Partisan Is the Press?, the economists Joshua Gans and Andrew Leigh (now a federal Labor MP) discovered that the ABC\u2019s coverage slanted more significantly towards the Coalition. This study was released seven years ago but it is a revelation that has never managed to take hold in the public mind, failing to challenge accepted wisdom. The message certainly didn\u2019t make its way to Howard.</p> <p>Meanwhile the ABC itself exists in a state of everlasting course correction. Determined to avoid the appearance of bias, it uses its flagship program Q&amp;A as a cosmetic ballast. </p> <p>The newly elected One Nation Senator Malcolm Roberts was provided with airtime so he could peddle conspiracy theories about global warming. When an actual scientist, Brian Cox, asked if Roberts believed the moon landing was real, Roberts took offence, viewing Cox\u2019s question as an underhanded rhetorical swipe. But Cox meant the question: if global warming is a gigantic global conspiracy then how much of reality do you question? If that\u2019s how far we need to go to establish a baseline of sanity then something is seriously wrong.</p> <p>In 2014, when he was communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull announced a $254m funding cut to the ABC over five years. This year $20m was cut from reporting and digital services. Journalists have been made redundant and the Fact Check unit was shut down. The ABC is being chipped away, bit by bit, and every joke about its inherent, ingrained bias makes it easier to justify.</p> <p>Much of the disdain for the ABC stems from a deeper ideology, one that is rooted in the free market and sees the concept of a public broadcaster as barely indistinguishable from state propaganda, even if the state itself keeps objecting to it. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9e6ee6f94505f8828b20c7a771c165bc9cc04ccd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e6ee6f94505f8828b20c7a771c165bc9cc04ccd/0_0_1456_2231/653.png\" alt=\"Book cover - Double Dissolution: Heartbreak and Chaos on the Campaign Trail by Lee Zachariah\" width=\"653\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Zachariah\u2019s book Double Dissolution.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Echo Publishing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In an environment saturated by privately owned news outlets, justifying a taxpayer-funded news organisation seems like an impossible needle to thread. And yet one glance across the environment of broadcast journalism and the value of a broadcaster focused on the public interest becomes immediately apparent.</p> <p>Attacking the journalism conducted by Four Corners is hardly new territory. The program regularly produces stories that affect the national conversation and even policy: a shocking report on live baiting in greyhound racing led to major reforms to the industry; a story on child abuse in youth detention had the prime minister immediately calling for a royal commission; footage of live cattle exports led to an immediate, albeit temporary, ban on the practice. </p> <p>At a time when the ABC is fighting for its survival it has refused to shy away from difficult and provocative journalism that often upsets the very hands that control its purse strings.</p> <p>The problem is that no accord can be reached. There is no incentive for the ABC\u2019s critics to concede any ground on its ideological makeup: there will never be a time where they confess that, yes, the ABC\u2019s reporting typically bends in every direction to find the impossible moment of balance. They will never admit that its analysis can be seen as right-leaning just as often as it is seen as left-leaning. There is absolutely nothing to be won in such a confession.</p> <p>So long as this belief continues, the ABC will inevitably and self-consciously shift itself to the right. It\u2019s a win-win for conservatives. Like a boa constrictor tightening around its prey, it\u2019s a game of inches that will only ever move in one direction.</p> <p><em>Lee Zachariah is the author of a new book, <a href=\"http://www.echopublishing.com.au/titles/double-dissolution/\">Double Dissolution: Heartbreak and Chaos on the Campaign Trail, which is available now.</a> </em></p>",

  "<p>MPs have voted to strip <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/philip-green\">Sir Philip Green</a> of his knighthood in a symbolic move that adds to the pressure on the retail tycoon over the BHS scandal. </p> <p>The businessman\u2019s reputation was dealt a further blow following a debate in which he was labelled a \u201cbillionaire spiv\u201d who should never have received his honour in the first place.<br></p> <p>The approval of the parliamentary motion carries no official weight but it intensifies the pressure on Green, who has been criticised for foot-dragging in negotiations with the pensions regulator over the \u00a3571m hole in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bhs\">BHS</a> pension fund.</p> <p>Green was pilloried during a more than two hour-long debate in which the once feted entrepreneur, who was knighted for services to the retail sector, was lambasted by MPs from across the political spectrum for his family\u2019s role in the downfall of the high street chain. The fall of BHS triggered 11,000 job losses and left thousands of pensioners facing cuts to their benefits.</p> <p>\u201c[Green is a] billionaire spiv who should never have received a knighthood, a billionaire spiv who has shamed British capitalism,\u201d said Labour MP David Winnick during a debate that, without a single Green sympathiser in the room, turned into a character assassination. MPs labelled Green an \u201casset stripper\u201d and \u201ccorporate raider\u201d, who was likened in the chamber to Napoleon and the former Mirror Group owner Robert Maxwell.</p> <p>The Labour MP Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee, whose role in the MPs\u2019 inquiry into the collapse of BHS has put him into the role of Green\u2019s nemesis, said the businessman appeared willing to lose his reputation rather than \u201csurrender a modest part of his mega-fortune\u201d to aid BHS pensioners. Field said Green, who is worth an estimated \u00a33.2bn, had promised to \u201csort\u201d the pension issue back in June but that there was still no concrete proposal on the table.<br></p> <p>Questioning whether Green had been a deserving recipient of a knighthood, Field said: \u201cThere was nothing the committee could find that shows Sir Philip Green is the king of the high street. He was a very, very, successful asset stripper.\u201d Green was honoured by the Blair government in 2006.</p> <p>Also speaking in parliament, Iain Wright, who co-chaired the select committee investigation with Field as chair of the business, innovation and skills select committee, told MPs that the failure of BHS was \u201cone of the biggest corporate scandals of modern times\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cGreen took the rings from BHS\u2019s fingers, beat it black and blue, starved it of food and water, put it on life support, and then wanted credit for keeping it alive,\u201d said Wright, referring to the \u00a3400m in BHS dividends paid to the Green family in the early years of their stewardship.</p> <p>Wright also questioned whether Green deserved acclaim for his skills as a retailer, suggesting his prowess lay in cutting costs and financial engineering with the bosses of rival chains such as John Lewis and Zara more deserving of plaudits. \u201cGreen can\u2019t be described as a short-term corporate raider, but raid the company he did,\u201d he said, adding that the Green family had sought to enrich itself at \u201cthe expense of long-term and sustainable growth for the company\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cCertainly, profits were made, but they were more akin to a short-term sugar boost rather than a nutritious diet that aided the long-term health and strength of the business [BHS],\u201d concluded Wright.</p> <p>MPs voted in favour of the motion by acclamation, meaning that there was no opposition from parliamentarians on the chamber floor when the speaker put it to them. Despite the strong signal sent by the vote, the power to rescind a knighthood rests with the honours forfeiture committee, a group of civil servants and dignitaries chaired by Sir Jonathan Stephens, a permanent secretary.</p> <p>Richard Fuller, the Tory MP who tabled the amendment calling for Green\u2019s knighthood, said that although MPs could not remove the honour they were able to reflect the views of their constituents. \u201cWe do not make the final decision but it is worthy and honourable for this house to have a view about Sir Philip Green,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cOver the summer, he has had the opportunity to find his moral compass and do the right thing. In the absence of that, the house has no option but to support the amendment and the motion.\u201d</p> <p>The parliamentary inquiry into the collapse of BHS has strained relations between Green and MPs to breaking point, with a war of words between the tycoon and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/frank-field\">Field</a>. The Labour MP for Birkenhead has riled the businessman by telling him to \u201cstop messing around and write a big cheque\u201d.</p> <p>Green sold BHS for \u00a31 in 2015 to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/08/bhs-inquiry-hears-of-theft-and-death-threats-in-dramatic-day-of-testimony\">investors led by Dominic Chappell</a>, who had previously been declared bankrupt.

The report found that BHS was subject to \u201csystematic plunder\u201d by Green and Chappell and concluded there was \u201clittle to support the reputation for retail business acumen for which [Green] received his knighthood\u201d. Field told the chamber that the time had come for Green to face up to his \u201cmega, mega, mega-moral responsibility\u201d.</p> <p>In the wake of the damning BHS report Theresa May has promised to \u201creform capitalism\u201d and stamp out irresponsible corporate behaviour. But the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said Green\u2019s knighthood was a matter for the forfeiture committee: \u201cIt\u2019s a completely independent body and it doesn\u2019t give us any guidance on what it is looking at. MPs have had their say but it\u2019s a matter for the committee.\u201d</p> <p>At the start of this week Green had made a fresh appeal to his former employees, stating he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/18/sir-philip-green-hints-bhs-pension-deal-close-in-bid-to-save-knighthood\">\u201cvery, very, very sorry\u201d</a> for the collapse of BHS and claiming that his advisers are close to brokering a deal with the Pensions Regulator that would avoid a rescue by the pension protection fund (PPF).

Her first role post-Steve McQueen\u2019s 12 Years a Slave, after all, was a play written by a university friend about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/oct/14/eclipsed-review-lupita-nyongo-searing-war-drama\">Liberian war</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have that rulebook.

It was very jarring. The one thing that made it all manageable was my intimate relationships because they have been constant. My mother still calls me to ask whether I\u2019ve had my breakfast and that doesn\u2019t change because I won an Oscar.\u201d</p> <p>Nyong\u2019o is now 33.

She lets out a big sigh and rolls back on the sofa. \u201cOh, God, I don\u2019t even want to know. I still have friends who tease me about the same things they used to tease me about before. I am eternally grateful for that, this happened at a time when I knew who my day ones were.\u201d</p> <p>Nyong\u2019o comes from a lifetime of privilege, and there has always been public interest in her family back in Kenya. She was born in Mexico because her parents were political exiles; her father is now a senator and secretary general of the Kenyan opposition party Orange Democratic Movement, and her mother worked as an editor and is now managing director of the Africa Cancer Foundation.</p> <p>\u201cMy confidence comes from my upbringing,\u201d Nyong\u2019o says. \u201cMy parents took time to instil a lot of values \u2013 patience, striving for excellence, not to compromise. Playing Harriet definitely taught me to appreciate the role a mother plays \u2013 that is a no-joke role. I spent a lot of time apologising to my mother for the unnecessary heartache I put her through.\u201d</p> <p>Such as?</p> <p>She cringes and her voice becomes softer with embarrassment. \u201cI mean, kids are so entitled. So selfish!

  "<p>John Ellson, who has died aged 64 of a heart attack, was a manager and concert producer who believed completely in the freedom of musicians to express themselves. Unlike many on the edges of the music business, John, who was my friend for 30 years and my manager for the last five, was not a musician manqu\u00e9 with a trumpet on which he secretly played Miles Davis solos, but a dedicated professional who never interfered in music programming unless he disliked the music personally, which was rare. Selflessly, generously and humorously, he just let everything happen, and was there at the end to pick up whatever pieces there were.</p> <p>In the 1980s John produced global tours featuring such huge stars as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jun/12/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Ray Charles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/15/bb-king-obituary-mississippi-farmhand-blues-legend\" title=\"\">BB King</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/dec/25/1\" title=\"\">Oscar Peterson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/nov/10/sonny-rollins-interview\" title=\"\">Sonny Rollins</a> \u2013 all of whom he became close to. He was also a piece of old Soho furniture, a friend and collaborator with Ronnie Scott\u2019s club for decades, and producer of the venue\u2019s 40th-anniversary celebrations at the Barbican in 1999.</p> <p>He worked with a fellow producer, John Cumming, on the Camden jazz festival in the 1980s, and as a partner with Cumming in Serious Productions helped to expand it into the now world-famous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/london-jazz-festival\" title=\"\">London jazz festival</a>, as well as managing saxophonists John Surman and Andy Sheppard. From 1998, as producer at ESIP (Ellson Scoble International Producers), he worked closely with the Afrobeat star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/apr/24/worldmusic\" title=\"\">Manu Dibango</a> and the composer and bassist <a href=\"http://www.avishaicohenmusic.com/\" title=\"\">Avishai Cohen</a>.</p> <p>In 2006, with Emma Perry John set up Global Mix, a record company that let musicians retain ownership and copyright of their albums, and which supported the work of Dibango and the British musicians <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/artists/5a489040-3804-4d97-bcb0-26eef7834de8\" title=\"\">Guy Barker</a> and <a href=\"http://www.timgarland.com/\" title=\"\">Tim Garland</a>. Dedicated to giving newcomers a free rein, he also brought his pioneering <a href=\"http://www.rochesterjazz.com/press_room/?id=221&amp;option=view_entry\" title=\"\">Made in the UK series</a> to the Xerox Rochester international jazz festival in the US from 2008, thereby helping to launch the careers of young British jazz artists in the States.</p> <p>Born in East Lambrook, Somerset, the son of Annie (nee Hooper), a glove maker, and John Ellson, a transport driver, John attended Yeovil grammar school before taking a philosophy, politics and economics degree at Portsmouth Polytechnic, where he met his future wife, Elizabeth Smith. He took a diploma in European integration at the University of Amsterdam before marrying Liz, a teacher, in 1975.</p> <p>In 1977 John began working at the Ealing careers service, but left after a few years having met Cumming on a weekend driving job for Bracknell jazz festival. The pair then went on to form Serious Productions.</p> <p>A tireless socialist campaigner, John planned to stand for the Labour party in Henley-on Thames, until the prospect, to him horrendous, of sharing a platform with Boris Johnson forced him to reconsider. One of his last appearances was on PBS in New York, on a telephone call-in programme during which incredulous Americans quizzed him for an hour on the reasons for Britain leaving the EU. He could not think of an argument in the Leave camp\u2019s favour.&#xa0;</p> <p>John is survived by Liz, and by his mother, Annie, brother, Nicholas and sister, Carolyn.</p>",

A poor choice if you are Keanu Reeves, who would surely have been ripped apart pixel by pixel by an angry Laurence Fishburne \u2013 possibly in bullet time \u2013 for his churlish impudence. But this seems to be exactly the path that Hollywood is pursuing.</p> <p>Back in the 1980s, if studios had a franchise as lucrative as the Harry Potter movies on their hands, they would simply have remade it. But in 2016, Warner Bros has given carte blanche to author JK Rowling to deliver new stories set in the same \u201cwizarding world\u201d as the one inhabited by the boy who lived and his chums. The result is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/13/jk-rowling-fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them-franchise\">the proposed five-movie Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them series</a>, the first instalment of which arrives in multiplexes next month.</p> <p>Reaction from fans so far has been rapturous, and the studio clearly thinks it is on to something here. Variety reports this week that Potter and Beasts producer David Heyman has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/19/willy-wonka-movie-reboot-from-harry-potter-producer\">set to work on a new movie about Roald Dahl\u2019s amusingly sadistic chocolatier, Willy Wonka</a>. But rather than being a sequel to the middling Tim Burton/Johnny Depp film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory from a decade ago \u2013 Dahl\u2019s follow-up novel Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator remains unfilmed\u2013 the new story is described as a standalone movie focused on Wonka\u2019s early adventures. Charlie himself is unlikely to appear, we\u2019re told, but might turn up in future instalments if the first film is a hit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/19/willy-wonka-movie-reboot-from-harry-potter-producer\">Willy Wonka big screen reboot is in the works</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Something similar is going on over at Disney, which is ramping up as many as three Star Wars spin-off movies (<a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/confidential/han-solo-return-part-bigger-plan-article-1.2722170\">if the rumours are true</a>) starring Alden Ehrenreich as the young Han Solo. The studio also has Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, about the gang of Rebel Alliance grunts who steal the plans to the first Death Star, in cinemas this December. These movies are generally seen as being part of the trend towards \u201ccinematic universe\u201d world-building, but they fit the mould of what we\u2019ll call the Hollywood \u201csuper spinoff\u201d just as well. Like the other movies I\u2019ve mentioned, they take supporting characters \u2013 in the case of Star Wars and Fantastic Beasts, barely mentioned figures from in-canon history \u2013 and place them front and centre.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t always work, as Universal discovered in April when its prequel-of-sorts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/04/the-huntsman-winters-war-review-dud-followup-to-a-film-no-one-liked\">The Huntsman: Winter\u2019s War</a>, bombed at the box office following derisive reviews. But any critic worth his salt could have told producers that trying to spin a Snow White movie into new territory without the unfortunate apple-munching princess herself on board was always going to be a hard ask. Likewise Disney\u2019s Maleficent, the Angelina Jolie-led 2014 \u201corigins tale\u201d about the horned villain from Snow White. Despite its triumph at the box office, Robert Stromberg\u2019s directing debut remains a deeply grey, insipid movie, the ultimate ill-advised, lazy star vehicle.</p> <p>So is the super spin-off really any better than the remake, prequel or sequel? Should we embrace <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/14/jennifer-lawrence-hunger-games-prequels\">Lionsgate\u2019s pitch for new films set in the Hunger Games world</a> prior to the era of Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s Katniss and her merry band of smouldering admirers, self-sacrificing techno-nerds and battling cyberpunk rebels, or write it off as too much of a stretch? If the makers of the James Bond movies, Eon Productions, were to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/23/james-bond-cinematic-universe-idris-elba-tom-hiddleston-tom-hardy\">fashion a \u201ccinematic universe\u201d based around some of 007\u2019s lesser-known MI6 buddies</a>, would it count as a mark of Hollywood\u2019s newfound creative potency? Or is this just a new riff on a well-worn money-making model? Is the purple pill just a blue one with a paper-thin layer of red veneer?</p> <p>The success or failure of upcoming films I\u2019ve mentioned in this piece \u2013 Fantastic Beasts and the \u201cStar Wars story\u201d movies in particular \u2013 will go a long way to deciding if the super spin-off becomes Hollywood\u2019s new mode of choice, or whether studios are forced back into older, even lazier patterns.

  "<p>What was one of the most telling moments from the third and final presidential debate? When Donald Trump said Hillary Clinton was \u201csuch a nasty woman\u201d, Guardian columnist Jessica Valenti said in a panel on Wednesday night. \u201cWomen recognized his tone in that sentence and what he really wanted to say.\u201d</p> <p>At Tumblr\u2019s HQ in New York, the roughly 300 people who had gathered to watch Trump and Clinton face off for the last time at a debate watch party co-hosted by Guardian US and WNYC, seemed to agree, with many shouting \u201cNo\u201d and booing in response to Trump\u2019s comment. </p> <p>After the debate, the crowd stuck around to watch Valenti, the Guardian\u2019s Spencer Ackerman and panelists from CNN and WNYC dissect the night\u2019s events in terms of gender, race and foreign policy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"778a8c3e1a55e384c6829f59f4775feeb491def1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/778a8c3e1a55e384c6829f59f4775feeb491def1/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tanzania Vega, CNN\u2019s national reporter on race and inequality, Jessica Valenti, staff writer for The Guardian US and Spencer Ackerman, US national security editor for the Guardian.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tanzina Vega, CNN\u2019s national reporter on race and inequality, Jessica Valenti, staff writer for the Guardian US and Spencer Ackerman, US national security editor for the Guardian.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Welsh/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ackerman and Valenti were joined by Tanzina Vega, a national reporter on race and inequality at CNN, and Kai Wright, host of WNYC\u2019s United States of Anxiety podcast and an editor at the Nation, on the panel. </p> <p>The event marked the kick-off of the Guardian\u2019s membership program in the US.

First made in the 1960s, David Medalla\u2019s Cloud Canyons remain ephemeral and beautiful things, in constant flux between form and formlessness. It is like observing the growth and decay of alien fungi.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u8VJp4VMcw\">Medalla</a>, born in the Philippines in 1942, is one of the four shortlisted artists in the inaugural <a href=\"http://www.hepworthwakefield.org/prize/\">Hepworth sculpture prize</a> exhibition, held every two years and open to British or UK-based artists of any age.

Surrounding this folly, first made in 1963, hang stretched hammocks of thin, coloured fabric, appended with reels of cotton. The audience can use these to stitch drawings and designs on to the lengths of material.<br></p> <p>More lengths of fabric \u2013 with stories printed, sewn and painted on to them \u2013 line the walls. Here is Emily Bront\u00eb, there is an invented myth of a virgin-eating crocodile. Delicate, touching and wan, Medalla\u2019s art is as hard to grasp as the soapsuds climbing and falling next door, where a long poem called The Bubble Machine is also pinned to the wall. The poem itself is a delightful, painful spume of reminiscence.</p> <p>What has reading a poem, or soapsuds, or an invitation to sew, or a series of images and stories, got to do with sculpture? In the poem, James Dean licks popcorn from a young Medalla\u2019s face. Further on, the young artist visits a brewery in Edinburgh, watching the froth bubbling in copper vats. And he remembers (or is it all an invention \u2013 Medalla was three when the second world war ended) a young man who was in the same Filipino resistance cell as the artist\u2019s father, fighting the Japanese, lying shot and dying, \u201ctiny bubbles coming out of his mouth/ tiny rainbows / mixed with blood\u201d. The poem makes you look at Medalla\u2019s work differently. His art is a casual affair, but it is impossible for me not to be touched by it, even though it often looks like nothing much. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"369e863320ea90cf63e6295a4383d29ec8493f7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/369e863320ea90cf63e6295a4383d29ec8493f7a/0_0_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scree Stage by Phyllida Barlow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scree Stage by Phyllida Barlow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Beyond, a large gallery is almost entirely filled by <a href=\"http://www.hauserwirth.com/artists/50/phyllida-barlow/images-clips/\">Phyllida Barlow</a>\u2019s untitled: <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesartcenter.org/exhibitions/pbarlow-scree\">Scree Stage, a work first shown in Des Moines, Iowa, in 2013</a>.

The pillars pierce the avalanching boards, rising up like standing stones and set about with boulders and rough wedges.

High above our heads, in a far corner of the gallery, hangs a tangle of black tubing, a sort of hysterical thought bubble. While diagonally opposite, in another corner, painted boards (like estate agent signs) climb the walls. Next year, Barlow is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/04/phyllida-barlowrepresent-britain-2017-venice-biennale-sculptor-british-pavilion\">official artist in the British Pavilion</a> at the Venice Biennale.

Her installation is my favourite to win that prize. Her <a href=\"http://www.serpentinegalleries.org/exhibitions-events/helen-marten-drunk-brown-house\">Drunk Brown House</a> also currently fills the Sackler Gallery at the Serpentine. It is difficult not to see those two exhibits, as well as her work here, as one continuous, interchangeable body of work. There are so many smaller and larger elements \u2013 things made, found, adapted, conjoined, fabricated, aligned, superimposed, ordered and arranged \u2013 that piercing the logic becomes an overwhelming task. \u201cI love the process of dragging legibility into crisis,\u201d Marten has said, \u201cand getting to the kernel of something where you know it but cannot name it.\u201d She defamiliarises the things around us \u2013 surely one of the jobs of all art \u2013 and the associations proliferate.</p> <p>In her Turner prize work, there is a small body, as if lain on a bier. Here, a similarly sorry-looking, doll-like figure is lain across something that looks like a bath for a child. The body is pierced, as if by an arrow. It is a stalk of corn. Another more diagrammatic body lies across a work mounted on the wall. The room she has at the Hepworth is divided by a sort of screen that is also a drawing made from bent, bolted-together strips of grey-painted steel. It describes a sort of flailing shirt. One sleeve looks like an erect penis. </p> <p>Marten\u2019s art is excessive, with too many details to count or describe, too many crafted bits of leather, wood and hand-embroidered fabric, inlaid Formica and woven straw, wicker, feathers, beads, shells and gum-wrappers; the real and the fabricated; drooping fag-ends and drawings of cats. In the Serpentine catalogue, Marten provides a partial lexicon of her art \u2013 from Archeology to Dust, Curves to Falling Stones. None of it helps. Instead, it compounds what is already a vertiginous complexity. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7f8844b74f679a7124c55581f92b8969b9f6b99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7f8844b74f679a7124c55581f92b8969b9f6b99/848_410_3140_1884/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stochastic Conveyor (Transference), Like Shooting Sparrows in the Dark 3 (deterrent lure) and Pernicious Membrane by Steven Claydon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Fake wood and arcane ideas\u2019 \u2026 sculptures by Steven Claydon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The logic of <a href=\"http://www.sadiecoles.com/artists/claydon#sc-exhibition-2016-the-gilded-bough-img\">Steven Claydon</a>\u2019s work is equally arcane. You enter through doorways hung with thick yellow plastic, like entrances to an abattoir or some kind of protected environment. The yellow attracts insects, while the citronella-impregnated plastic is meant to kill them. It is a trap. Six blue industrial lights glow on one wall, the kind that might be installed in some inner-city fast-food restaurant toilets to prevents junkies from finding a vein. The light reflects off a blue wall spangled with stars, except the stars are constellations of copper pennies. A huge carved tree-trunk sits on a trestle of boxes. The wood is fake, made from polystyrene foam, and so are the spoon-like sculptures from Papua New Guinea that sit on the wooden beam. </p> <p>Elsewhere, two cast busts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/03/how-william-morris-beauty-and-anarchy-uk\">William Morris</a> rest on a rusted metal and glass table. Shredded \u00a310 notes are embedded in the glass, lit from below. A microphone, connected to a sheet of suspended steel, is angled over the mouth of one of the busts. So far, it has failed to pick up any sound, but if you bash the metal sheet, a thunderous roar bursts from under the table. Claydon\u2019s art \u2013 like Marten\u2019s \u2013 sucks you down a rabbit hole. You go from mobile phone masts disguised as trees to hollow talking heads, pennies from heaven to rafts of homeless tribal artefacts. If things could speak, all you would hear is thunder.</p> <p>Art needs more interpretations than it does explanations. None of these artists make puzzles to be solved. Understanding is frequently overrated. What a rich, varied and contrary exhibition this is. After a bit, I forgot it was a prize. Here, the best art and the best sculpture might not be synonymous. It is impossible. Give the prize to Medalla, who probably needs it most. </p> <p>\u2022 The winner of the Hepworth sculpture prize will be announced on 17 November.

What will the ECB do at that meeting? We remain convinced that the general council will opt for an extension of QE by six to nine months at the current pace. This would require \u20ac480-720bn of additional purchasable assets. We estimate that, under current market conditions, raising the ISIN limit from 33% to 50% and applying the deposit-rate restriction to a portfolio of bonds rather than to individual bonds would free a sufficient amount of German paper to make this extension possible. Bank bond purchases do not seem to be on the agenda, while a deposit rate cut remains highly unlikely as its side effects would outweigh the benefits.</p> </blockquote> <p>ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It would go too far to call this the Americanisation of the Eurozone. But the outcome of today\u2019s ECB meeting showed some imitations of last night\u2019s presidential debate in the US; at least in terms of memorable statements. Whether it is on tapering, the extension of QE or solutions to the scarcity problem, the ECB is keeping everyone in suspense. At least until the December meeting.</p> <p>[So] what are the take-aways from today\u2019s meeting? In our view, the ECB is not yet ready to extend QE. The recovery of the Eurozone economy is not weak enough to justify more stimulus but also not strong enough to light-heartedly talk about tapering. This is why the ECB is simply buying time. Mario Draghi\u2019s elegant balancing between tapering and an extension of QE keeps all expectations alive and could have one welcome fall-out: slightly higher long-term rates which will bring some relief to the scarcity problem without panic. At the December meeting, our view is that the ECB will announce an extension of QE until the end of 2017, possibly at a slower pace than the current \u20ac80bn. </p> </blockquote> <p>Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There was only a small chance that Mr Draghi would discuss an extension of QE today, following the recent reports that ECB had begun to consider a taper of the programme.</p> <p>In the event, he chose not to. A more appropriate time to do this will be at the next ECB meeting in December, when bank staff have had a chance to revise their economic forecasts.</p> <p>Growth in the Eurozone remains sluggish but steady, with no sign of any major impact from the Brexit vote. Very low core inflation and wage growth should most concern policy makers, and are the main reasons we expect a QE extension in March.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Kathleen Brooks at City Index said although an extension was likely in December, it was not entirely guaranteed:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although we believe that deflation risks in the Eurozone are receding, we still don\u2019t think that the Eurozone economy is out of the deflationary woods yet, so QE is unlikely to end anytime soon. We do expect the ECB to announce that it will lengthen its asset purchase programme when it ends in March 2017, market expectations are for an announcement at its next policy meeting in December. However, we think that there is a small but significant chance that the ECB may hold off from expanding its QE programme, or it may only extend it in the short-term, as the ECB\u2019s whopping \u20ac3.5 trillion balance sheet creates a liquid monetary environment even if QE stops.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5808cc8ce4b005f21833b77c\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T14:24:41.231Z\">3.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary: Draghi hints at more action</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Even though the ECB didn\u2019t take new measures today, Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference was packed with interesting elements.

Yet the ECB owns 21% of all outstanding German bunds and could find it has broadly reached the country limit within 15 months, assuming purchases continue through March 2017 at the target pace.</p> <p> This is further complicated by another rule; the ECB cannot purchase bonds yielding below the ECB\u2019s deposit rate \u2013 that excludes 43% of German bonds, one of the largest and most liquid sovereign bond classes.4 At its September press conference, the Bank did not specifically mention investigating bond scarcity, to the chagrin of some commentators, but it did say it had \u201ctasked the relevant committees to evaluate the options to ensure a smooth implementation of our purchase programme\u201d.</p> <p>The final restriction is the ECB\u2019s capital key. This prescribes the proportion of bonds to buy from each issuer based on the size of the country\u2019s population and economy. For Germany, the capital key indicates 25% of all bond purchases should be from this country.

Production is estimated to have plummeted by 35% in Argentina and 21% in Chile, the seventh-biggest producer. </p> <p>South Africa is set to report a 19% fall, but the news is better for Australia and New Zealand, which are expected to increase production by 5% and 35% respectively. The New Zealand figures would put it near a record it set in 2014. </p> <p>The OIV said the predicted overall decline was strongly affected by climatic events. \u201cThe El Ni\u00f1o climate phenomenon seems to be back in Latin America, where production was affected by fairly exceptional weather, with lots of rain,\u201d said OIV\u2019s chief executive, Jean-Marie Aurand.</p> <p>El Ni\u00f1o, which occurs every four to five years, affects rainfall patterns and causes both drought and flooding. </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/articles/view/3276\">report released earlier this year</a> by the Earth Institute at Columbia University said warming temperatures, the main driver of grape harvest timing, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/17/australian-wine-under-threat-from-climate-change-as-grapes-ripen-early\">significantly pushed these periods forward</a> globally. </p> <p>\u201cAcross the world, scientists have found that each degree centigrade of warming pushes grape harvests forward roughly six or seven days,\u201d the report said. This phenomenon could eventually make pinot noir grapes unsuitable for many parts of Burgundy, according to a 2011 study by the climate scientist Yves Tourre.</p> <p>A 2014 paper in journal Wine Economics and Policy concluded that rising temperatures would have an \u201cextraordinary effect\u201d on agriculture and there were few crops more susceptible than grapes to minor changes in climate. </p> <p>In Europe, the paper pointed to a potential chilling of the Bordeaux region and parts of Spain, due to the loss of the Gulf Stream, while other regions, including Alsace, are expected to get warmer and experience shorter growth seasons. In the Italian region of Chianti, grapes have begun ripening too early, leading to possible future changes in wine varieties.</p>",

The New Republic <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/minutes/136540/chris-wallace-close-roger-ailes-moderate-presidential-debate\">publicly asked</a> whether Wallace possessed the necessary objectivity to moderate the debate; the anchor, son of 60 Minutes anchor Mike Wallace, said in <a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/5172620389001/\">an interview on his network</a> that only he, his producer and his researcher were prepping for his coverage. \u201cIt\u2019s just the three of us against the world here.\u201d</p> <p>Wallace represented his network admirably: he demonstrated a fluency in a wide variety of conservative points of view, persistently referring to public benefits as \u201centitlements\u201d and implying so heavily that Obama caused the Bush-era housing market crash that Trump thanked him for the question.</p> <p>He drilled into Clinton on abortion, a topic that all but disappeared at the tail end of the election cycle but one of prime importance for a huge swath of conservative voters, and one which has completely escaped mention at the other debates. And he made headlines pushing Trump until he declared he would not necessarily accept the results of a free and democratic election.</p> <p>While it may have been as \u201cfair and balanced\u201d as Fox gets, in the Trump-saturated media environment questions of objectivity begin to seem quaint. A single incident early this year looks more and more like a turning point: in March, Michelle Fields, a writer for rightwing site Brietbart.com, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/11/donald-trump-reporter-assault-michelle-fields-corey-lewandowski\">accused then campaign manager Corey Lewandowski of assault</a>.

Eventually Breitbart\u2019s leader, Steve Bannon, managed to elbow out political operative Paul Manafort and acquire the top spot \u2013 \u201cCEO\u201d \u2013 of the Trump campaign.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Lewandowski\u2019s adversarial relationship with the media, whom he had <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/online/remember-that-time-lewandowski-cussed-out-and-threatened-to-blacklist-a-cnn-reporter/\">penned</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/trump-revokes-post-press-credentials-calling-the-paper-dishonest-and-phony/2016/06/13/f9a61a72-31aa-11e6-95c0-2a6873031302_story.html\">blacklisted</a>, to say nothing of Fields\u2019s charges, got him a job at CNN, where he will continue to be paid <a href=\"http://www.syracuse.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/09/corey_lewandowski_trump_campaign_cnn.html\">$20,000 a month by Trump</a> beyond even the end of the campaign.</p> <p>Fox, largely because of Ailes\u2019s departure, has become the site of soul searching among a conservative establishment that has lost its way in a violent upsurge of the same populism that had helped animate it in its formative years. If the allegations of the more than 20 women uncovered by its internal investigation were true, the network had hosted multiple incidents of sexual misconduct against its own talent; that kind of conduct, James and Lachlan Murdoch made clear, could not be publicly tolerated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-tenth-woman-accuser\">Tenth woman accuses Donald Trump of sexual misconduct</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, CNN and other outlets were discovering that the inchoate rage of the populist right could be very good for business.

  "<p>Ooh, it\u2019s the age-old question, isn\u2019t it? How old is OK? When are they old enough? When is it OK to say that something was justified because they didn\u2019t look like a child to you? I notice the Daily Mail this week deploying the famous hair test to determine whether or not it\u2019s OK to go there. Wait \u2013 maybe that wasn\u2019t clear and you thought I was talking about another type of hair? Guys, of course not! I\u2019m talking about hair on the upper lip. Look at that one \u2013 it\u2019s got bumfluff and it\u2019s flaunting its smile. If anything, it\u2019s us that\u2019s going to be taken advantage of. Old muggins here is going to put out for another little chancer.</p> <p>But you see the problem. Sometimes it\u2019s really difficult to know whether we\u2019re on about refugees coming to the UK, or underage children of celebrities that you shouldn\u2019t feel bad about having sexual feelings for. Or maybe not you, but whoever chose the \u201cgorgeous\u201d paparazzi picture of the 11-year-old, or wrote the \u201cleggy\u201d picture caption to accompany it. Or whoever decides that the \u201cchild\u201d in the phrase \u201cchild refugee\u201d can now only appear in print in <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3853830/How-child-migrants-straining-care-British-children-paying-price.html\">inverted commas</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2016/oct/20/kim-kardashian-doesnt-need-to-learn-a-lesson-but-the-media-seems-to\">Kim Kardashian doesn\u2019t need to learn a lesson \u2013 but the media seems to</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Occasionally, it\u2019s almost as if the Mail is deliberately trying to rip a tear in the age-appropriate continuum. Consider <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs/the_papers\">Thursday\u2019s front page</a>. The main headline ran: \u201cGive \u2018child migrants\u2019 age tests, says Straw.\u201d And right next to it was a picture of Cindy Crawford and her 15-year-old daughter, with an exhortation to \u201cspot the difference\u201d. Well, now you\u2019re asking. I used to be sure it was something about one of them being a child, but I\u2019m starting to lose my bearings. Also: can I give Cindy\u2019s daughter an age test? She looks \u201colder\u201d. Say what you like about political correctness, it will never take our inverted commas from us.</p> <p>Even so, whenever they\u2019re talking about individuals of indeterminate age \u2013 be it refugees or hot minors \u2013 I always find it helpful to think of the Mail as engaged in a dangerously perverse take on George Carlin\u2019s famous routine about words you can\u2019t say on TV. \u201cI can prick my finger,\u201d he mused. \u201cBut I can\u2019t finger my prick.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, Lost in Showbiz would like to stress that it\u2019s not just the Mail that\u2019s a bit \u201cconfused\u201d about age. When Adam Johnson was found guilty of sexual activity with a 15-year-old this year, the Sun lost no time in denouncing the \u201cpervert footballer\u201d, despite having run pictures of Cindy\u2019s Crawford\u2019s aforementioned daughter during the trial, in which readers were invited to enjoy her \u201cshapely pins\u201d. She was 14 at the time.</p> <p>Still, maybe the paper knew something we didn\u2019t. Maybe it was using the same <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/19/how-oldnet-no-real-indicator-of-age-says-microsoft-amid-child-refugee-row\">two-bit age-recognition software</a> on which the Mail seem to be nosing its entire coverage of the child-refugee issue. It\u2019s not to everyone\u2019s taste, it must be said. I notice Gary Lineker has taken a lot of stick for appearing repulsed by the Mail\u2019s angle \u2013 and he will doubtless take a lot more from the paper itself before it is <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3852104/Gary-Lineker-sparks-Twitter-row-blasting-utterly-heartless-treatment-child-migrants-arriving-Calais.html\">done with him</a>. In case you missed this \u2013 Gary reacted to the front page querying the ages of some of the refugees leaving the Calais camp for the UK with a tweet reading: \u201cThe treatment by some towards these young refugees is hideously racist and utterly heartless. What\u2019s happening to our country?\u201d</p> <p>How unforgivable that Gary should have failed to understand the Mail\u2019s byzantine etiquette around the issue of age. He can\u2019t say it hasn\u2019t given him special insights. In fact, it wasn\u2019t all that long ago that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarinaHyde/status/400194749732102144\">I saw a Mail headline</a> inquiring suggestively: \u201cSo who\u2019s the younger lady, Gaz?\u201d over a picture of Gary with his \u201cpretty stepdaughter\u201d, who at the time was 11.</p> <p>At least she was older than Heidi Klum\u2019s daughter, described as a \u201cleggy beauty\u201d, who \u201cshowed off her best model walk through the parking lot\u201d after a paparazzo caught her coming out of gym class. She was eight.</p> <p>In some ways, though, it is through the prism of fathers and daughters that we can gain the most insight into the tabloid view of age. A year ago, I was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/11/alexander-carter-silk-charlotte-proudman-trump-father-daughter\">deeply moved</a> by a rather angsty column written by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/oct/19/kelvin-mackenzie-entitled-to-attack-fatima-manji-over-hijab-says-ipso\">Sun\u2019s former editor Kelvin MacKenzie</a>, shortly after Jos\u00e9 Mourinho had attended an award ceremony with his daughter wearing a dress that seemed to have aroused Kelvin. Aroused him to anger, I should stress. Although I suspect what Kelvin was really saying was that he found the picture appealing \u2013 certainly he must have, at some level, to have embarked on such a lengthy deflection mission. \u201cIf I were Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, I wouldn\u2019t be impressed with my 18-year-old daughter,\u201d he fretted. \u201cSurely, no father would enjoy seeing his daughter wear so little.\u201d I bet Donald Trump would. But if Kelvin prefers an answer closer to home, what about Sam Fox\u2019s dad, whose permission he sought to print topless pictures of her when she was 16?</p> <p>Making Kelvin sound like a moral philosopher, meanwhile, is Tory MP David Davies (not the Brexit secretary \u2013 the other one). By chance, I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/14/marmite-royal-yacht-britain-global-joke-news\">wrote about David last week</a>, when he made some sally in the Great Brexit Marmite wars. This week, he pops up again, declaring from a couple of photos of the Calais refugees that they \u201cdon\u2019t look like children\u201d, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/child-refugees-dental-tests-verify-age-david-davies\">demanding they be subjected to dental tests</a>.</p> <p>Back then to that question: when is it OK to justify something with the observation that they \u201cdon\u2019t look like children\u201d? I\u2019m just feeling my way on this. If you are a Tory MP, and about to deploy the phrase \u201cThey don\u2019t look like a child\u201d, you need to first ask yourself an important question. Are you looking at pictures of a) a little minx in a miniskirt, or b) someone who has fled a war zone and has been living in a tented migrant camp for months or even years? If it\u2019s a), then it\u2019s not OK, because times have moved on and we\u2019re all a little more enlightened about which bits of our mind palaces we can open to the public. But if it\u2019s b), it\u2019s still totally fine to say it out loud.</p> <p>David\u2019s such a headline-seeking brainiac that I half expect him to roll out this plan to the Premier League, and demand that the big clubs fund in-nightclub dental screening to guarantee the age of the females the players might want to do it with later. Or maybe the bars could install booths fitted with the shonky age-guessing software the Mail are using?</p> <p>Failing that, maybe someone could invent some software through which kid-related newspaper copy could be fed, in order to determine whether it\u2019s \u201cbravely saying the things that ought to be said\u201d or \u201cobviously fucking gross\u201d. Consider this exhibit from a Sun article \u2013 featuring all! the! shocking! photos! \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/reallife/893664/ocean-4-sunbathes-with-me-i-dont-like-fake-tans/\">about a child beauty pageant</a>: \u201cCAVORTING provocatively in a tiny pink swimsuit and clutching a cuddly stuffed kitten, little Ocean Orrey struts her stuff in a British beauty pageant \u2013 aged just FOUR.\u201d</p> <p>So, as we play out, readers, remember: it\u2019s <em>never</em> OK to share pictures of four-year-olds and say they\u2019re \u201ccavorting provocatively\u201d \u2013 unless you\u2019re a national newspaper. I mean that seriously. I think you can literally be arrested for it.</p>",

The impact that HMRC claims for its work far exceeds any reduction in the tax gap.\u201d</p> <p>Next Wednesday, top <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-accounts-committee/\">HMRC officials are to appear before the committee again</a> to answer questions about the tax office\u2019s performance. \u201cOne of the areas where we\u2019ll be focusing hard is on claims about [HMRC\u2019s] compliance performance,\u201d a source close to the committee said.</p> <p>The \u201ctax gap\u201d is the shortfall between the amount of tax expected in Treasury coffers and the sums actually received. The figure includes estimates for losses caused by tax evasion, avoidance, the hidden economy, errors and other non-payments.</p> <p>HMRC\u2019s tax gap figure has been repeatedly criticised because it does not take into account estimates for tax losses caused by multinational corporations such as Google, Amazon, Apple and Starbucks. These international businesses are able to lawfully use complex structures to shift taxable income from the UK to their operations overseas.</p> <p>A year ago, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said, based on extremely conservative estimates, profit-shifting by multinationals was <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/ctp/beps/\">costing governments between </a><a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/ctp/beps/\">$100bn and $240bn</a> (\u00a365bn to \u00a3160bn) a year in lost corporation tax \u2013 equivalent to between 4% and 10% of global corporation tax revenues.</p> <p>Some independent estimates of Britain\u2019s tax gap, including work by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/11/the-man-behind-corbynomics-an-accountant-from-leafy-norfolk\">tax campaigner Richard Murphy</a>, have suggested the figure<a href=\"http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/%20Documents/PCSTaxGap2014.pdf\"> could have reached as much as \u00a3119bn</a> in recent years, taking into account estimates of tax avoidance by multinationals. <br></p> <p>Of HMRC\u2019s \u00a336bn tax gap estimate for 2014-15, \u00a39.5bn was attributed to large businesses. Only \u00a3600m of that sum related to large business tax avoidance. That \u00a3600m estimate is equivalent to less than 1.5% of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446134/HMRC_Annual_Report_and_Accounts_2014-15__Print_version_.pdf\">\u00a341.4bn of corporation tax revenues for 2014-15</a>.</p> <p>Prem Sikka, a professor of accounting at University of Essex, who has advised the Labour party on tax reform, said: \u201cHMRC\u2019s measure of the tax gap is not credible as it excludes profit-shifting techniques used by Google, Microsoft, Apple and others.\u201d</p> <p>In<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=6&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7rau_r-nPAhXJJsAKHdQlCPEQFgg6MAU&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ftaxwatch.org.au%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F09%2FReforming-HMRC-making-it-fit-for-the-twenty-first-century.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNFxqTp6IEA12VvOY8giGc9dNQoaQQ&amp;sig2=K1u3-29nZeqNK7EMDeGuzw&amp;bvm=bv.136499718,d.ZGg\"> a recent report for Labour, </a>Sikka said: \u201cThe [HMRC tax gap] estimate depends on the policies and practices that HMRC is willing to accept or challenge ... HMRC has not challenged [multinationals\u2019] tax practices whereas other countries have shown a greater willingness to challenge the same.\u201d <br></p> <p>Alex Cobham, research director at Tax Justice Network, said: \u201c There is a real risk that this tax gap analysis may be taken seriously as the basis for policy \u2013 in which case HMRC would continue to ignore the major revenue risks represented by multinationals. It\u2019s important for public confidence, as much as for better policymaking, that HMRC swiftly addresses this spurious estimate.\u201d </p> <p>But, on Thursday, the Treasury minister Jane Ellison said: \u201cThis government is committed to tackling tax evasion and avoidance wherever it occurs. The UK has one of the lowest tax gaps in the world. By investing \u00a31.8bn since 2010 in boosting HMRC compliance capabilities, we\u2019ve brought our tax gap down to its lowest ever level.\u201d</p> <p>The official tax gap estimate of \u00a336bn \u2013 equivalent to 6.5% of expected tax revenues \u2013 is down from \u00a337bn for 2013-14. <br></p> <p>HMRC\u2019s tax gap figure includes an estimate of losses caused by tax avoidance of \u00a32.2bn. Meanwhile, the hidden economy and tax evasion caused further estimated losses of \u00a36.2bn and \u00a35.2bn, respectively.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d666f4dafc41774cda6591d82bfa3b22b6b7ac4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d666f4dafc41774cda6591d82bfa3b22b6b7ac4/0_3_801_481/500.jpg\" alt=\"HMRC estimates for Britain's tax gap\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Britain\u2019s tax gap</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HMRC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In terms of which taxes involved the largest shortfalls, lost income tax, national insurance contributions and capital gains tax together contributed \u00a315.5bn to the tax gap.

(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/20/philip-green-knighthood-commons-set-to-debate-stripping-philip-green-of-his-knighthood-politics-live?page=with:block-5808ac7fe4b005f21833b6ca#block-5808ac7fe4b005f21833b6ca\">12.40pm.) </a>Here are key extracts.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Wright described the BHS saga as \u201cone of the biggest corporate scandals of modern time\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>BHS is one of the biggest corporate scandals of modern times. I\u2019m sure the whole House has sympathy for the thousands of workers and pensioners who have lost their jobs and seen their pension benefits reduced as a result of greed, incompetence and hubris. The reputation of business has been tarnished as a result of this greed. The vast majority of businesses are not run and managed like this. It would be wrong to tar all of business with the same brush. However, it is vital that this mess is sorted. Even at this late stage, Sir Philip should make amends for this whole story, and put right the wrongs that he himself engineered.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Wright accused Green of raiding BHS for his own benefit.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> [Green] can\u2019t be described as a short-term corporate raider. But he did raid the company, and his ability to do so meant that he was then in a financial position to be able to obtain the debt to acquire Arcadia and, through the same modus operandi, pay his family the biggest dividend in corporate history. He took the rings from BHS\u2019s fingers, beat it black and blue, starved it of food and water, put it on life support, and then wanted credit for keeping it alive.</p> <p>BHS\u2019s balance sheet was made considerably weaker during Sir Philip\u2019s tenure of the company. His extraction of value early on in his ownership made the company less able to innovate, to retain a market share or competitive place in the retail market which would allow the firm to generate the profits and be in more of a position to survive and to address the growing pension scheme deficit. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Wright said the BHS Group\u2019s dividend policy \u201cset the scene for the eventual demise of the company\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>BHS folded in 2016, a year after Sir Philip Green sold it to Dominic Chappell, but its demise was on the cards a lot earlier than that. In the three year period between 2002 and 2004, BHS Group paid dividends of \u00a3423 million, even though operating profit for the period was less than that amount, at \u00a3325 million. In 2004, BHS Group had dividends of \u00a3199,500,000. This dividend exceeded the Group\u2019s operating profit for that year of \u00a3137 million ...</p> <p>Sir Philip could say, quite reasonably, that he received dividends for only a short period of time early on in his period of ownership. It was a long time ago. That is true. But I do think the dividend policy is crucial to understanding the whole story of BHS and wider lessons for business. </p> <p>Green was to enrich himself, his family and his friends at the expense of long-term and sustainable growth for the company. Certainly, profits were made, but they were more akin to a short-term sugar boost rather than a nutritious diet that aided the long term health and strength of the busines<strong>s. </strong></p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Wright said Green was not even very good at retail.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sir Philip received his knighthood for services to retail. However, throughout the course of our inquiry, it became increasingly evident that he wasn\u2019t particularly good at retail at all. True, he was able, in the early days, of sniffing out a corporate bargain and cutting costs to boost profit. There is nothing wrong with that, but he did not boost BHS\u2019s turnover during his period of ownership, he lost market share to more nimble, or even not-so-nimble competitors, and he failed to anticipate the on-line retail revolution. By failing to innovate and invest in the brand, BHS looked like a remnant of the 1970s and 1980s, in a cut throat competitive sector where grabbing the customer\u2019s attention and retaining their loyalty are paramount.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5808b936e4b055209adaf893\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T12:32:22.059Z\">1.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>James says it is important that the investigating bodies are given time to complete their inquiries.</p> <p>If the evidence supports it, enforcement will be taken, she says.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5808b837e4b005f21833b70f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T12:31:22.742Z\">1.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>James says Green says he is in a dialogue with the pensions regulator.</p> <p>She says she would urge him to sort it out quickly.</p> <p>The pensions regulator continues to investigate the handling of BHS pensions.

Here it is.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Rolf Harris</strong>, March 2015. The former children\u2019s entertainer was stripped of his CBE after being jailed for almost six years for a string of sex attacks on girls as young as seven. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong> Stuart Hall</strong>, October 2013. The former It\u2019s A Knockout presenter was made an OBE in 2012 for services to broadcasting and charity. But the Queen directed it be cancelled after Hall, then 83, was handed a 30-month jail term for sexually abusing 13 victims, one as young as nine, over a period of nearly 20 years. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Vicky Pryce,</strong> July 2013. The economist was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 2009 in recognition of her contribution as head of the Government economic service. But in March 2013 she and ex-husband Chris Huhne were both jailed for eight months for swapping speeding penalty points a decade earlier so he could avoid a driving ban, which only emerged when Pryce approached newspapers after Huhne left her for another woman. She was released from prison after two months but, following her conviction, her name was removed from the Order of the Bath register. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>James Crosby,</strong> June 2013. The former HBOS chief executive, who was knighted in 2006 after leaving the bank, was stripped of the title at his own request following a scathing parliamentary report into its collapse. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Jimmy Savile,</strong> January 2013. The television star was knighted for his services to charity in 1990 but the honours forfeiture committee considered stripping him of the title posthumously when the scale of the paedophile\u2019s crimes emerged. The Cabinet Office later said that he had ceased to be a member of the order upon his death in 2011. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Fred Goodwin</strong>, January 2012. Goodwin received his knighthood for services to banking under the Labour government before guiding the Royal Bank of Scotland to the brink of collapse in 2008. While honours are usually only removed from those convicted or jailed, the Cabinet Office said the scale of the RBS disaster - necessitating a \u00a345bn bailout from the taxpayer - made the case \u201cexceptional\u201d. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Jean Else</strong>, February 2011. \u201cSuperhead\u201d Jean Else was made a Dame in 2001 in recognition of her transforming performance at Whalley Range High School in Manchester. But in January 2009 she was banned from running a school after the General Teaching Council found her guilty of failing to observe minimum standards in recruiting and promoting staff. Her honour was revoked in 2011 after she was found guilty of misconduct. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Robert Mugabe</strong>, 2008. Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe was stripped of his honorary knighthood in 2008 over his \u201cabuse of human rights\u201d and \u201cabject disregard\u201d for democracy. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>\u201cPrince\u201d Naseem Hamed,</strong> 2007. The former WBA world featherweight champion was jailed in 2006 for 15 months and disqualified from driving for four years after a crash in May 2005 that left another man with fractures to \u201cevery major bone in his body\u201d. The boxer was stripped of his MBE in January 2007. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Lester Piggott</strong>, 1988.The former champion jockey was stripped of his OBE after he was given a three-year jail term for evading tax in 1987. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Anthony Blunt,</strong> 1979. Art historian Anthony Blunt was a Professor of the History of Art at the University of London and Surveyor of the Queen\u2019s Pictures. What was not known was that in 1964 he had confessed to having been a member of the infamous Cambridge Five Soviet spy ring, passing information to Moscow while they worked for MI5 during the Second World War. His secret was closely guarded for many years, but Margaret Thatcher publicly revealed his status in November 1979 and he was immediately stripped of his knighthood.</li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5808aec6e4b055209adaf856\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T11:47:58.677Z\">12.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Eleanor Laing,</strong> the deputy speaker, says she expects the debate to end around 2.30pm.

Witnesses appeared to harbour the misconception that they could be absolved from responsibility by blaming others. The worst example was Sir Philip Green, despite his protestations to the contrary. Sir Philip adopted a scattergun approach, liberally firing blame to all angles except his own, though he began his evidence by saying he would do the opposite. The truth is that a large proportion of those who have got rich or richer off the back of BHS are to blame. Sir Philip Green, Dominic Chappell and their respective directors, advisers and hangers-on are all culpable. The tragedy is that those who have lost out are the ordinary employees and pensioners. This is the unacceptable face of capitalism.</p> <p>The sale of BHS did not have to proceed as it did. The potential checks, however, proved to be inadequate. Regulatory concerns were circumvented. Advisers were heavily incentivised to progress the deal ...</p> <p>Sir Philip Green drove the deal forward. He sought to sell a chain that had become a financial millstone and threatened his reputation. He knew that Dominic Chappell was a wholly unsuitable purchaser but overlooked or made good each of Chappell\u2019s shortcomings and proceeded with a rushed sale regardless.</p> <p>Dominic Chappell was out of his depth. He was over-optimistic to the point of arrogance. He failed to recruit a retail expertdespite his own lack of experience; failed to secure funding on commercial terms; failed to address BHS\u2019s property leases in a timely way; and failed to address the company\u2019s long-term underperformance ...</p> <p>The Green family benefited significantly from BHS. In his early years of ownership, Sir Philip cut costs, sold assets and paid substantial dividends offshore to the ultimate benefit of his wife. He failed, however, to invest sufficiently in stores or reinvent the business to beat the prevailing high street competition. We found little evidence to support the reputation for retail business acumen for which he received his knighthood.</p> <p>It is true these are private companies holding Green family money. BHS, however, was a major employer and the sponsor of a large and ailing pension fund. Arcadia, another Green company, is in a similar position. Sir Philip gave insufficient priority to the BHS pension scheme over an extended period. His failure to resolve its problems by now has contributed substantially to the demise of BHS. Sir Philip owes it to the BHS pensioners to find a resolution urgently. This will undoubtedly require him to make a large financial contribution. He has a moral duty to act, a duty which he acknowledges. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5808aa25e4b005f21833b6bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T11:32:25.146Z\">12.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Fuller says Green was running a business with 11,000 employees.

Davis implied the government was looking at such an option. He told her:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are seeking to ensure a smooth and orderly exit from the European Union and it would not be in the interests of either side, either Britain or the EU, to see disruption. And to that end we are examining all possible options, as you would expect.</p> <p>We are approaching these negotiations in good faith and with goodwill towards our negotiating partners, and we hope the same in reverse, focused on a mutual interest to the UK and the EU including financial stability.

But more than 100 MPs have signed an amendment tabled by the Conservative MP Richard Fuller saying Green should lose his knighthood. It says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[This House] noting that Philip Green received his knighthood for his services for the retail industry, believes his actions raise the question of whether he should be allowed to continue to be a holder of the honour and calls on the honours forfeiture committee to recommend his knighthood be cancelled and annulled.</p> </blockquote> <p>It would be surprising if John Bercow, the Speaker, does not call the amendment and, assuming it does get called, it is hard to imagine it not being passed. It is not binding, because the final decision on Green\u2019s knighthood would be taken by the honours forfeiture committee, but the committee may find it hard to ignore parliament.</p> <p>I will be covering the debate in detail.</p> <p>Otherwise it is a relatively quiet day.

  "<p>Wayne Bennett has stuck to his promise of utilising players who have not played for a number of weeks after naming an England squad which includes six uncapped players for Saturday\u2019s Test against France.</p> <p>Bennett, who takes charge of England for the first time in their only warmup game before the Four Nations, had said he would aim to leave out the seven players who played in the Super League Grand Final <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/08/warrington-wigan-super-league-grand-final-match-report\" title=\"\">between Wigan and Warrington</a> a fortnight ago. Only three of that contingent are included in his 19-man squad: Wigan\u2019s Liam Farrell and the Warrington duo of Daryl Clark and Stefan Ratchford.</p> <p>Bennett said that in all probability he will use a three-man interchange bench if possible to reduce the workload on those players whose seasons finished later than the rest, meaning all three are unlikely to play.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/17/sam-burgess-england-captain-four-nations-rugby-league\">Sam Burgess says \u2018I was cool when Wayne Bennett told me I\u2019d be captain of England\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe guys from Warrington and Wigan probably won\u2019t play \u2013 everyone else needs the games,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThey have had more games than probably everyone else, so another week won\u2019t hurt them being out. I will sit one of them on the bench but will probably not play him if I don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p> <p>The St Helens players Jonny Lomax and Mark Percival are included for the first time and are expected to start in a new-look backline. Castleford\u2019s Luke Gale will also win his first cap at half-back, probably alongside the St George stand-off Gareth Widdop.</p> <p>Hull\u2019s Scott Taylor will also make his debut, with the other debutant, Ratchford, likely to miss out as Bennett opts to rest the 28-year-old. Leeds\u2019 Stevie Ward, who was drafted into the 24-man squad this week after his club-mate Brett Ferres was ruled out because of injury, is the sixth potential debutant: he will likely start in the back row.</p> <p>James Graham will captain the side in the absence of Sam Burgess \u2013 the first time Bennett\u2019s new vice-captain will lead the side in six years. Burgess is serving a one-match suspension carried over from the conclusion of the NRL season, meaning he will be available for England\u2019s Four Nations opener against New Zealand at Huddersfield on Saturday 29 October .</p> <p>\u201cThe players have trained well all week and are looking forward to the trip to France,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of competition for places in this squad and it\u2019s good to see a few new faces in there possibly having a run out in Avignon.</p> <p>\u201cThe week leading into this game has been good and the training facilities in London at the Honourable Artillery Company have been outstanding.</p> <p>\u201cFrance are a passionate team and will have plenty of support behind them.

  "<p>Good things come to those who wait, the well-known Guinness slogan once claimed. </p> <p>But that is unlikely to apply <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/16/harder-brexit-worse-for-ireland-sterling-fall\">in the case of a hard Brexit</a>, which would likely stop the black stuff flowing freely across the Irish north-south border, and result in lines of Guinness lorries queuing in both directions.</p> <p>\u201cAn impact on the border will be an impact on the heartbeat of the economy,\u201d said Oliver Loomes, the Ireland country director for the drinks giant Diageo, which produces two of the world\u2019s best known drinks brands, Guinness and Bailey\u2019s Irish Cream.</p> <p>The company\u2019s operations on the island vividly illustrate how interlinked the two economies have become.</p> <p>\u201cWe operate on an all-island basis. I think we have one of the most integrated operations of any business in Ireland,\u201d said Loomes, who is responsible for the company\u2019s operations on the island of Ireland and not simply the Irish Republic.</p> <p>He estimates that there are about 13,000 border crossings a year by Diageo trucks. The introduction of a hard border could delay each truck by between 30 minutes and an hour, making each journey \u20ac100 more expensive. That alone would cost \u20ac1.3m.</p> <p>Diageo is one of Ireland\u2019s largest food and drink exporters, producing beer and cream liqueur at four sites, two in the Republic and two in Northern Ireland. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8198a3ecffd15f8ffcba59e0558a4082a911a898\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8198a3ecffd15f8ffcba59e0558a4082a911a898/1174_788_3730_2238/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Guinness and Bailey\u2019s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guinness and Bailey\u2019s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Leigh/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most famous is at St James\u2019s Gate in Dublin, the home of Guinness, and there is a Bailey\u2019s plant in Dublin. In Northern Ireland, there is a packaging plant in Belfast for the beer business and a Bailey\u2019s manufacturing plant at Mallusk near Belfast.</p> <p>Materials used in manufacturing both products are in constant movement between the plants and across the border. For instance, Guinness brewed in Dublin is canned in Belfast and then sent back to Dublin to be exported around the world.</p> <p>\u201cSt James\u2019s Gate brewery accounts for about 35% of our global beer production but 70% of that production, 1.2bn pints per annum, is exported out of Ireland to more than 130 markets across the world,\u201d said Loomes.</p> <p>\u201cWe make 6m cases of cream liqueurs between the Dublin site and the Northern Ireland site and more than 90% of that 6m cases is exported. All of those operations in beer and cream liqueurs in value terms you are talking of more than a \u20ac1bn out of Ireland.\u201d</p> <p>A crucial aspect of this massive operation is that all raw materials and ingredients are produced in Ireland. \u201cWe would purchase goods and materials that go into making beer and liqueurs to the tune of about \u20ac270m per annum. So we are one of the largest purchasers of high quality agri ingredients in the Irish economy.\u201d</p> <p>Guinness buys about 140,000 tonnes of barley, or about 14% of the national crop, every year. Bailey\u2019s involves the purchase of 275m litres of milk to go into the creation of the cream liqueur. The milk comes from 40,000 cows on 1,500 Irish farms and accounts for nearly 5% of total milk production in the Republic.</p> <p>The milk and the whiskey from various locations south of the border goes north to the Bailey\u2019s production facility in Mallusk and then to Dublin for export around the world. The glass and packaging also come from both sides of the border.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1ecc9c069d247fdca379e79a7d166708dcde67f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ecc9c069d247fdca379e79a7d166708dcde67f8/0_248_4064_2438/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Guinness brewery in Dublin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Guinness brewery in Dublin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As well as employing 1,200 people directly, Loomes estimates that Diageo\u2019s purchase of goods and materials support 19,000 jobs in the wider agri and service economy, while its purchases of milk and barley provide livelihoods for around 6,000 farm families.</p> <p>As well as the economic impact Loomes expressed concern at the impact the reinstatement of a hard border might have on society, given the hugely positive impact of the peace process over two decades.</p> <p>\u201cDiageo is a great example in Ireland of how the impact in terms of free movement of goods and services across the border would impact negatively on our business and also therefore on the wider economy and the wider communities.\u201d </p> <p>He is adamant that having that free movement on the island is a key driver of economic growth for Diageo and for the wider economy.</p> <p>\u201cWe would be highly supportive of the efforts of the Irish government, the Northern Ireland administration and the Northern Ireland secretary are placing on retaining the free movement of goods and services.

  "<p><br>One of the worrying aspects of the Brexit process is that discussions about the UK\u2019s future trade arrangements, and the wider economic goals and ambitions of Brexit, are taking place behind closed doors, and by government departments feeding self-serving information to the media. </p> <p>Parliament should be allowed to inform itself, review and help to start frame this debate as a matter of urgency before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu\">article 50</a> negotiations, that is, before next March, according to the prime minister, Theresa May.</p> <p>As the Guardian revealed earlier this week, the Brexit cabinet committee has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/18/theresa-may-given-stark-warning-about-leaving-customs-union\">presented with findings considering the trade and economic consequences for the UK of leaving the EU and the customs union</a>. The suggestion that exports to the country\u2019s 10 largest non-EU trading partners would have to grow by 37% by 2030 simply to compensate requires open and informed debate as to how this is to be realised, even if the numbers are only approximately right, given the likely economic circumstances surrounding world trade over the next several years. What happens to trade and to related foreign investment inflows is hard-wired into the productivity and living standards of citizens.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/18/theresa-may-given-stark-warning-about-leaving-customs-union\">Theresa May given stark warning about leaving customs union</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In her recent party conference speech, the prime minister left little doubt that the UK would not remain in the single market. Business and finance must work on the assumption that the disruption to trade in goods and services and investment will be greater as a result. Leaving the customs union, and reimposing border controls still hang in the balance, apparently, but the UK cannot make its own trade deals unless Brexit happens.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The most likely outcome is that reduced bilateral trade with EU countries, secondary effects such as broken supply chains \u2013 for example in the automobile and engineering industries \u2013 lead to a significant shock. This would doubtless extend to service sector exports, which represent almost 45% of the UK\u2019s total exports and generate a surplus of 5% of GDP, offsetting half of the deficit on goods trade and investment income.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>If the estimated requirement for 37% growth in non-EU exports, say from 2019 to 2030, is about right in order to balance the UK\u2019s books, then the implicit compound rate of growth of about 3% per annum seems rather tame. Exports to non-EU countries grew by 5.8% per annum between 1999 and 2015, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/international-transactions/outward-foreign-affiliates-statistics/how-important-is-the-european-union-to-uk-trade-and-investment-/sty-eu.html\">according to the Office for National Statistics</a>. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>We should remember, though, that the trade environment in the next decade or so will look nothing like that of the historical period in question. Until just after the financial crisis, world trade grew twice as fast as world output, or about 7% annually in volume terms and nearly 10% in value. UK export growth to non-EU countries in the most expansionary world trade environment imaginable was not much more than half the rate of world trade growth.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/pres16_e/pr779_e.htm\">Things look markedly different nowadays</a>. World trade is stagnating. The trend is so prolonged that it can not be ascribed to cyclical factors. Commodity markets and trade have rallied a little this year, helping beleaguered producers a little, but the boom is over for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>As China\u2019s domestically sourced supply of parts and components has risen over the past decade, this particular share of the country\u2019s total imports has halved. We can think about these trends as part of the deglobalisation narrative, in which cross-border international lending and trade financing is much reduced, and foreign direct investment as a share of global GDP is running at half the rate recorded at the peak in 2007.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If Brexit means Brexit, the debate about trade deserves the fullest possible transparency</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Outside the single market and customs union, the UK would have to make strenuous efforts to penetrate the US and Chinese markets more deeply. These two countries account for half of UK exports to the non-EU countries among our top 25 trading partners. Yet the increase in US imports has flattened out as the country\u2019s potential growth rate has dropped, and China\u2019s imports are similarly on a weaker trend in line with slowing growth. A period of even slower growth is likely in the next few years. Most of the rest of the UK\u2019s non-EU trade is with Norway and Switzerland, which will retain single-market relations with the EU, and with the Middle East, whose import potential is also constrained because of what appear permanently lower energy prices.</p> <p>All this is in stark contrast to the common image of swashbuckling UK ministers travelling the globe to strike up new trade deals . We can do this to a degree, but our track record is not great; we do not have an export-focused <em tabindex=\"-1\"><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/mar/30/the-uk-could-learn-a-lot-from-germanys-long-term-industrial-strategy\">Mittelstand</a></em>, as Germany does, and the world trade environment is weak and more protectionist.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>If Brexit means Brexit, the debate about trade deserves the fullest possible transparency. The government should without delay allow parliament to harness and digest the best possible information, and take a prominent role in framing what is to be done in the country\u2019s name, and how to mitigate the consequences of leaving the EU. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><em>\u2022<a href=\"http://www.georgemagnus.com/about/\">George Magnus</a> is a senior independent economic adviser to UBS and associate at Oxford University\u2019s China Centre</em></p>",

She worked on a huge number of sites through her career, and became <a href=\"http://trowelblazers.com/dorothy-garrod/\">the first woman professor in any field at Oxbridge</a>. In 1929, less than a year after women got the vote in the UK, Garrod directed an excavation at Mount Carmel with an international all-female team. Charming one-off story? Nope - also in 1929, <a href=\"http://trowelblazers.tumblr.com/post/62730801575/gertrude-caton-thompson-society-girl-suffragist-and\">Gertrude Caton Thompson</a>, a friend of Garrod, dug Great Zimbabwe with two young women as assistants.

The new savannasaurus was also to found to be a primitive member of the group.<br></p> <p>The evolutionary analysis, which compared the specimens with similar ones in South America, meant there was a small window between 100m and 105m years ago when an ancestor of the two dinosaurs must have crossed over land from South America, through Antarctica, to Australia.</p> <p>While the evolutionary analysis suggested the dinosaurs only made the journey about 100m years ago, the position of the continents at the time showed it should have been possible earlier.</p> <p>\u201cWe realised there must have been some sort of barrier to them dispersing between South America and Australia before about 105m years ago,\u201d Poropat said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/12/oldest-fossil-of-birds-voicebox-gives-new-hint-at-soundscape-of-the-cretaceous-syrinx\">Oldest fossil of bird's voicebox gives new hint at soundscape of the Cretaceous</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The researchers argued the cool climate of the polar region could have been that barrier.

  "<p>The last time Radiohead topped the bill at Glastonbury, Moby was still big enough to headline one night of the festival, and Suede and Super Furry Animals were both prominent in proceedings, having not yet split up, let alone re-formed.

That finally came to pass in 2011, when their \u201csurprise appearance\u201d was so unsurprising that the Park stage attracted one of its biggest ever crowds. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/24/radiohead-glastonbury-2011-review\">The Guardian\u2019s review</a> of that appearance was lukewarm, noting that a crowd standing in pouring rain would have preferred to hear their best-known songs rather than a selection of their more experimental material. \u201cSo when Radiohead closed the set with Street Spirit and the sodden crowd roared, you couldn\u2019t help but feel that both the band and their audience had been cheated out of the gig they deserved,\u201d wrote Rosie Swash.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti6qhk3tX2s\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ti6qhk3tX2s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Radiohead released their ninth album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/15/radiohead-a-moon-shaped-pool-review\">A Moon Shaped Pool</a>, in May this year, to glowing reviews. \u201cThe stuff about how the future is inside us and people have the power sounds authentically stirring,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/may/08/radiohead-a-moon-shaped-pool-review\">wrote Alexis Petridis in the Guardian</a>. \u201cIt also sounds like Radiohead achieving something they\u2019ve never achieved before, a quarter of a century into their career: long may their neuroses keep them in constant motion.\u201d</p> <p>The band supported the release with a small number of shows, many of them festival appearances, across the summer. Their only UK shows, however, were three nights at the 3,300-capacity Roundhouse in London.

Economies that are dependent on a single city hub are less resilient to global economic shocks. A regional visa system could facilitate and promote economic development outside of London,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>Immigration has been a key part of the Brexit debate. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/government-faces-backlash-from-business-leaders-over-foreign-workers\">raised the idea of companies disclosing the proportion of foreigners they employ</a>.<br></p> <p>\u201cBy allowing the regions to control immigration this will recognise the fact that the needs of London and Yorkshire will differ dramatically. Whilst all regions will have to adhere to the same overall requirement criteria set by the Home Office they will be allowed to control the numbers of migrants and the skills they require for their region,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>It is not clear what visa regime will apply to EU workers after Brexit, but the report said that if the current visa system was applied around three-quarters of Britain\u2019s EU workforce would not meet these requirements. This could have an impact on the City of London \u2013 where 32% of the workforce is international, with 12% hailing from Europe. It would also affect healthcare, agriculture and construction.</p> <p>Australia and Canada are seen as the most relevant comparisons for a UK regional visa. The report said: \u201cBoth countries designed their systems to attract migrants to help combat problems of sparsely populated regions and declining populations. Whilst we acknowledge that a post-Brexit visa system will have different motivations, the mechanisms and lessons are relevant, as these relate to tying migration to particular area needs.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Australia uses a regional sponsored migration scheme where a three-year visa is granted for workers sponsored by employers. Canada has a four-year programme where employers are able to hire from abroad when they have not been able to recruit at home.</p> <p>The UK could adopt two types of visas \u2013 a 12-month visa for those recruited to fill a skills shortage or one for six years to fill a permanent role that could also lead to permanent residency after five years. Individuals entering the UK on the longer term visa would be permitted to purchase property in the area where they had been granted permission to work.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not a London solution to a national problem, but actually something that can support growth outside of the capital across a wide variety of sectors,\u201d said Mark Boleat, policy chairman at the City of London Corporation. </p>",

Aprill, 23, grew up on a dairy farm in a small town with conservative, religious parents (many of the young people I spoke to have parents who are voting for Donald Trump, although Aprill says her parents won\u2019t be) and here she was canvassing for a revolution on the south side of town, the poor white side of town, where she had not spent much time before. \u201cI thought I\u2019d be shouted at for being a scummy liberal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut most everyone I talked to was already planning to vote for him.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b25d22a8c5b06127ce38403d7df7b69f97ecef69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b25d22a8c5b06127ce38403d7df7b69f97ecef69/116_0_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morgan Aprill of the Progressive Student Alliance\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morgan Aprill of the Progressive Student Alliance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian/Gary Younge</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ring was not surprised that support grew. \u201cI think people here understand inequality,\u201d he said. He is fourth generation Muncie. Both his grandfathers worked at <a href=\"http://www.indianaeconomicdigest.net/main.asp?SectionID=31&amp;SubSectionID=62&amp;ArticleID=78894\">the BorgWarner car plant, which is now closed</a>. \u201cAnd they understand the trade issue. People know what killed their jobs and that was Nafta [the North American Free Trade Agreement]. And not only did it kill our jobs here but it exploited people elsewhere and I think people are starting to understand how multinational corporations work. They move the jobs where there\u2019s people they can exploit. So I think people were able to hear his message and I think he put it out in a very cogent way.\u201d</p> <p>By 3 May when the Indiana primary took place, Clinton had all but claimed victory nationally. The week before, she had won Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania. Sanders won just Rhode Island, the smallest state in the union. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/may/03/indiana-primary-results-live\">he caused an upset in Indiana</a>, taking the state 52.7%-47.3% and Delaware County 55.7%-44.3%. People assign his victory in Muncie to the large student population at Ball State University. It\u2019s true that <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/election/primaries/states/in/Dem\">statewide his victory was largely thanks to winning the under-40s with wide margins</a> and losing older groups more narrowly. He also did well with men, whites, the well-off and Independents. Bernardo says it would be a mistake to put it down to just students. \u201cHe did well in neighbouring counties where there was no university \u2013 95% of the volunteers doing the phone banking came from the community at large.\u201d</p> <p>Another reader, Cathy Day, a professor at the university, was one of them. Day, 48, had started following Sanders after she saw him<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/10/AR2010121005431.html\"> filibuster Obama\u2019s tax cut compromise in 2010</a>. Like Day, for many people I\u2019ve met this is very personal. This was her first campaign. \u201cMy dad worked on the railroad and the story Bernie was telling about working class people struck a chord with me,\u201d she said. \u201cMy parents remortgaged their home many times to put three kids and my mum through college and then lost everything in 2008. All of that work they put in and they\u2019re left with nothing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3280ee03ac33816e7aa4777b3d67875a38581f05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3280ee03ac33816e7aa4777b3d67875a38581f05/591_133_2721_2075/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cathy Day, a professor at Ball Sate University\" width=\"1000\" height=\"763\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cathy Day, a professor at Ball Sate University.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gail Werner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/10/barack-obama-supporters-campaign\">In 2008 when I covered the election from Roanoke, Virginia</a>, I saw a lot of people inspired by the Obama campaign who either ceased being active or whose energies were dissipated once the election was over. Some Sanders supporters may have gone back to doing what they were doing before or are now spectating, but there are opportunities to stay active. Sanders has set up <a href=\"https://ourrevolution.com/\">Our Revolution</a> to keep the campaign for a more progressive America going now that he has conceded, which Ring has some involvement in. The extension of the movement provoked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/25/fleeing-the-bern-half-of-staff-quit-sanders-legacy-project-before-it-begins\">some national disillusionment</a>, however, at the notion of a top-down grassroots organisation.</p> <p> At the university, the Sanders campaign transformed into the Progressive Student Alliance, with which Aprill is involved, which is now concentrating on the <a href=\"http://www.unkochmycampus.org/\">UnKoch My Campus</a> campaign to protest <a href=\"http://www.indystar.com/story/news/education/2016/03/02/papa-john-koch-gift-325m-ball-state/81223330/\">the Koch brothers\u2019 plan to fund an Institute for Entrepreneurship and Free Enterprise at Ball State</a>. At a table by the refectory on Tuesday the Progressive Student Alliance provided leaflets calling on students to oppose the influence of the Kochs on campus. \u201cAbout half have heard of them. People are quite receptive. It picks up around lunch time,\u201d said Daniel Wills, explaining why things were so quiet when I dropped by.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ea71ce8ac35f6e28a22d27f343c2ec94f510f4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ea71ce8ac35f6e28a22d27f343c2ec94f510f4b/0_194_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A group of freshman architecture students from Ball State University drawing in downtown Muncie.

Ring will vote for Clinton too, as will Silas, 29, with whom I watched the first debate at the Fickle Peach. \u201cI agree with her on 80% of everything. I think I agree with Trump on almost nothing apart from how you spell America.\u201d This is the view of most people that I spoke to. But by no means all.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Aprill is going to vote for the Green candidate Jill Stein. \u201cI just don\u2019t trust the Democratic establishment ... The fear-mongering is the tactic of the two parties that\u2019s been used for decades to keep people in line. I think the two parties represent different flavours of the same thing which is a elite rich, wealthy class that rules our whole country. And I think it\u2019s pretty apparent by things that happened since the recession that we need more parties in our country to have an actual democracy.\u201d</p> <p>Indiana has been a reliably Republican state. But Obama did take it narrowly in 2008. And with Trump tanking nationally in the polls, it could be closer than usual. In the Senate and governor\u2019s races in the state, Aprill is voting for Democratic candidates with less progressive records than Clinton\u2019s because the contests are close. One gets the feeling she could be persuaded to back Clinton. But not easily.</p> <p>Todd Smekens, publisher of progressive midwestern media outlet, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.muncievoice.com/\">MuncieVoice</a>, voted for Sanders and will now vote for Stein. \u201cAs a progressive, the big issues for me are war, climate and the economy. I\u2019m not signing on for candidates who aren\u2019t going to do anything about those things. The job of the electorate is to assess the problem and then vote for the best candidates to deal with the problems. It\u2019s not my job to bail out the Democratic party. The Democrats keep making out like where everything is OK and it\u2019s not. Nobody\u2019s buying it.\u201d</p> <p>Said the veteran campaigner who braved the elements to sustain Occupy Muncie: \u201cDuring this last year \u2013 after almost two decades of living in this Red State \u2013 I have begun to see the social progress here in Muncie that I have long dreamed of.\u201d</p> <p><em>Main photography: David Levene</em></p> <ul> <li><em>Producing in-depth, thoughtful, well-reported journalism is expensive \u2013 but supporting us isn\u2019t.

  "<p>On a sweaty summer afternoon in Los Angeles, Carlos Ni\u00f1o sat behind the boards in the modest, un-air conditioned studio of <a href=\"http://dublab.com/\">Dublab</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/11/radio.digitaltvradio\">internet radio station</a> that\u2019s been broadcasting for 17 years. With a bushy beard taking over his face and a blue-gemmed ring on his pinky finger, Ni\u00f1o transmits supernatural jazz and acid-licked folk rock at a bit rate of 320. His co-host Miguel Atwood-Ferguson sat in the corner, with a Mac laptop balancing on his knees and his shoes nowhere to be seen.</p> <p>At around half-past two, they switched on the microphones for a brief spoken interlude. \u201cThis is Theme Galaxy, our theme today is \u2018mystical, spiritual, and psychedelic.\u2019 Let\u2019s talk about these pieces,\u201d said Ni\u00f1o with the easy tone of a waiter explaining your salumi plate. \u201cCarioca in the set. He is one of the great keepers of the Santo Daime mystical music of the ayahuasca tradition in Brazil, and this album that he made, which I love dearly, is called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DEGgnbx9YA\">Mist\u00e9rios da Amaz\u00f4nia</a>.

Behind Ni\u00f1o\u2019s head, Dublab\u2019s motto glowed in neon letters, \u201cFUTURE ROOTS RADIO.\u201d Alejandro Cohen, the station\u2019s Argentina-born executive director, explained that the sign, and the others around the station, were gifted to them by a Dublab DJ who once interned for the guy who does all the neon for the stores in the Valley.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/03/nts-london-radio-station\">How London\u2019s NTS is helping to redefine live radio</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the best part of two decades Dublab has existed on a subfrequency of Los Angeles-born radio, one not advertised on highway billboards or emblazoned on tote bags earned with a pledge of $10 a month. It\u2019s become a haven and destination for seekers and eccentrics, an unconventional entity that might start its broadcast day with languid disco and that schedules its hyper-kinetic juke show for the early afternoon on a Tuesday. \u201cPeople usually explore music in such a limited capacity compared to what is possible,\u201d says Mark \u201cFrosty\u201d McNeill, one of Dublab\u2019s co-founders.<br></p> <p>Besides what they send out streaming into the world, Dublab has become an experiential presence in Los Angeles. The station throws its own themed events, like the ambient-focused Tonalism, and sets up club nights where they only play sad music and keep boxes of tissues on hand. The broadcast schedule is filled with an evolving roster of Los Angeles DJs and music obsessives. As McNeill says: \u201cAny night of the week, Dublab DJs are playing somewhere in the city.\u201d</p> <p>A broad swath of outsiders also seek out Dublab\u2019s curatorial talents. The High Times<em> </em>Cannabis Cup<em> </em>had them take over a stage this past summer at its event in San Bernardino, while the Los Angeles Music Center \u2013 Downtown\u2019s hub for usually staid classical music and opera \u2013 began a relationship with Dublab a little over a year ago to get them to advise on and book special events. </p> <p>McNeill started Dublab and was the station\u2019s director for its first 16 years. Now he broadly defines his role as: \u201cDJ, board member, creative consultant, project manager, spirit guide.\u201d He became interested in radio while attending the University of Southern California in the 1990s. Back in the 1970s<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>the school turned its station, KUSC, over to public radio, where it was staffed with professionals and became the region\u2019s biggest classical music station. In response, a group of students created KSCR, an unlicensed, low wattage radio station. While working at KSCR, McNeill became the station director and made the decision, progressive at the time, to schedule electronic music shows throughout the day, not just during the late night hours. More importantly, he discovered that USC had an unused Real Media server sitting in a closet, so the station began broadcasting its FM signal through the internet, a rare move for any radio station during that time.</p> <p>The Federal Communications Commissioned ended up shutting KSCR\u2019s terrestrial broadcasts, but McNeill already realized the possibilities of internet radio. He found a partner for his vision in Jon Buck, who was more interested in the business side of medium. With a financial investment from Buck\u2019s family, Dublab began broadcasting from a storefront off of Melrose Blvd that had been converted into a studio.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ecd9c2b672a23867c97466668a4726cfcf22e954\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecd9c2b672a23867c97466668a4726cfcf22e954/0_498_4826_2895/1000.jpg\" alt=\"DubLab radio\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">DubLab radio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of DubLab</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From the start, McNeill put together a cultivated roster of DJs. He brought along KSCR DJs, such as beat scene mainstay Daedelus. He picked up his favorite DJs who also had shows on local freeform FM stations like KPFK and KXLU. He scooped other talent, including Aurelito and Shakespeare, a pair that famously ran a reggae soundsystem from inside of a converted ice cream truck. In later years they brought on artists like Gaslamp Killer and Flying Lotus, whose Brainfeeder radio show on the station would come to provide the name for his own record label. Recent DJs include the ultra mellow<strong> </strong>Suzanne Kraft and Brian Shimkowitz of the Awesome Tapes from Africa imprint. This year alone has seen new shows for more established names, like Tunde Adebimpe of TV on the Radio, Jennifer Herema of Royal Trux, and underground LA hip-hop\u2019s Cut Chemist. </p> <p>\u201cWe saw online radio as the wild west of media \u2013 a place that could be defined, could be invented, and could be made to do what we wanted to do,\u201d says Cohen, who got involved with Dublab in its early days.</p> <p>Internet radio and streaming music were still in their nascent stages, and Dublab had to develop custom software and programs to even be heard. In the beginning they were still broadcasting over a dial up modem. Taken with the interactive possibilities of this technology, they originally had an active text chat so people could communicate with the DJs and a video simulcast that up the bandwidth. A global community of listeners soon found them. \u201cFor a lot of people it was like magic, and for us it was magic that people were out there,\u201d says McNeill.</p> <p>As Dublab found its footing, in 2001 the internet bubble burst. The situation got dicey, but it managed to hang on, even as its more well funded competitors went bust. \u201cA lot of these players in the late \u201990s were throwing money at these radio stations [that were] basically not challenging the notion of what music could be online,\u201d says Daedelus. \u201cDublab was really something from a different direction, especially in those early days.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/dec/02/best-albums-of-2014-no-9-youre-dead-by-flying-lotus\">Best albums of 2014: No 9 - You're Dead! by Flying Lotus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The station moved to its current location above a nightclub on the fringes of Silver Lake, parted ways with Jon Buck and in 2008 it officially changed its status to a not-for-profit. They\u2019ve pursued side projects, like releasing music as a label and putting on art shows, but over the past few years they\u2019ve decided to return the focus to the station itself.<br></p> <p>As streaming becomes the norm, major streaming services have <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/reggieugwu/the-unsung-heroes-of-the-music-streaming-boom?utm_term=.yxDjOR40vg#.yaDdZqyAm0\">put together teams of actual humans</a> whose job is to create highly specialized playlists for users to draw from. But there\u2019s still something charming about Dublab\u2019s loose approach. \u201cThere\u2019s something nice about clicking on the radio and having something that\u2019s familiar, but within that, having the unexpected arise. [Dublab is] this brain trust of music, and the people who are involved have dedicated their lives to exploring music, and they\u2019re also very open to sharing,\u201d says McNeill.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c355bcfd57a559450475858dd45b6f9eb0f20ef7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c355bcfd57a559450475858dd45b6f9eb0f20ef7/0_82_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark \u2018Frosty\u2019 McNeill (left) and Alejandro Cohen of DubLab radio\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark \u2018Frosty\u2019 McNeill (left) and Alejandro Cohen of DubLab radio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of DubLab</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Dublab keeps refining its niche in the global streaming music landscape, it will soon establish an even greater local presence. After working on it for five years, they recently received a Low Power FM Radio license from the FCC and will also be terrestrial in Los Angeles. In 2017, listeners will be able to find them in the middle of the dial at 99.1FM. \u201cI\u2019m literally driving around looking for buildings in the area to put the antenna,\u201d says Cohen.</p> <p>On a late August evening, DJ Heidi Lawden wrapped up Magic Roundabout, her bimonthly show filled with cosmic house<strong> </strong>music and charming dance edits. Next up was House Shoes, a Detroit transplant who has been in Los Angeles for a decade, to wrap up with the last live set of the night. The lights were dimmed to just an eerie purple. Then toward the end of his set all the power to the DJ equipment and computers suddenly cut out, resulting the dreaded dead air. </p> <p>As House Shoes and his friends spent several minutes tracing wires and flipping switches using their iPhones as flashlights, I thought of something that McNeill had told me. \u201cWe always wanted to make those folks understand that this is not a computer thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to every once in a while have the needle skate across the record or Jimmy Tamborello knock a coffee over into a DJ mixer and you heard it sizzle out live on air.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The government\u2019s refusal to release secret advice about the legality of British drone strikes in Syria is to be challenged by a human rights group.</p> <p>Rights Watch UK is appealing against a decision by the information commissioner that the Cabinet Office and the attorney general\u2019s office should not be obliged to publish the document.</p> <p>Without publication of the legal justification, it is argued, public debate over the policy of carrying out lethal attacks on UK nationals anywhere in the world will remain uninformed.</p> <p>The dispute follows a series of drone attacks in Syria. Two Britons, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/21/briton-reyaad-khan-believed-killed-air-strike-islamic-state-syria\">Reyaad Khan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/10/uk-drone-strikes-murder-charges-clarify-legal-basis-targeted-kill-policy-isis\">Ruhul Amin</a>, were killed in targeted strikes near the Syrian city of Raqqa on 21 August 2015. </p> <p>David Cameron, then the prime minister, told the Commons shortly afterwards that the attack was carried out on the grounds of self defence because the men were planning attacks in the UK.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/13/jihadi-john-definitely-killed-syria-raqqa-dead\">death of Mohammed Emwazi,</a> the British-born militant nicknamed Jihadi John who appeared in Isis beheading videos, last November was also attributed to a joint US/UK airstrike.</p> <p>Earlier this week, parliament\u2019s influential joint committee on human rights (JCHR) criticised the government for refusing to explain how targets are selected, whether there was an \u201cimpossibility of capture\u201d test and whether the laws of war were being misapplied outside recognised armed conflicts.</p> <p>The JCHR\u2019s chair, Labour MP Harriet Harman, said: \u201cThe government has chosen not to answer the most important questions raised by our [committee] concerning its understanding of the legal framework which governs the use of lethal drone strikes outside armed conflict. </p> <p>\u201cIt is simply not good enough for the government to refuse to answer this on the grounds that it is a hypothetical question, when in the course of our inquiry it stated that it would be prepared to resort to such use of lethal force for counter-terrorism purposes even outside of armed conflict. </p> <p>\u201cParliament is entitled to expect an explanation of the government\u2019s view of the legal justification for such a use of force before it happens, rather than wait until it does.\u201d</p> <p>Rights Watch UK submitted a freedom of information request in September last year seeking publication of the advice the attorney general, Jeremy Wright QC, gave on the legality of the Khan and Amin strikes.</p> <p>Both the attorney general\u2019s office and the Cabinet Office declined to release the information. The information commissioner upheld their decisions in August.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/08/human-rights-group-legal-action-uk-government-syria-isis-drone-strike\">Rights Watch UK</a> said there was a disparity between the two departments\u2019 responses: the Cabinet Office said it should be entirely secret, the attorney general\u2019s officials said that only part of it needs to be withheld. </p> <p>Yasmine Ahmed, executive director of Rights Watch UK, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s refusal to clarify its position on the use of lethal force outside armed conflict on the basis that this is \u2018hypothetical\u2019 is a disingenous attempt to evade the crucial question \u2013 one which has profound ramifications for international law and human lives.</p> <p>\u201cThe question lingers as to whether the government is following in the failed footsteps of the United States, reserving the right to kill its citizens outside declared war zones. This would reflect a radical reinterpretation of their international legal obligations \u2013 chipping away at long established constraints on the use of lethal force and creating a dangerous global precedent. </p> <p>\u201cThe public has a right to know what the government is doing in their name, particularly when it involves a significant departure in the use of lethal force that could have implications for the security of the United Kingdom if other countries adopt a similar position.\u201d</p> <p>Appearing before the justice select committee last autumn, Wright acknowledged it was important in such exceptional circumstances that MPs should know that legal advice had been given, but he insisted its precise content could not be revealed.</p> <p>Asked why, Wright said: \u201cIn part, it\u2019s an obligation to ensure that legal advice taken by the government is as full and frank as it can be \u2026 It\u2019s also important to take collective responsibility under cabinet government.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the attorney general\u2019s office said: \u201cThe ICO upheld our decision not to disclose the information to Rights Watch as it was related to, or received from, one of a number of bodies which deal with security matters.

From lawless pariah state to a respectable and stable land, Liberia was open for business and investors clamoured for deals. The government needed quick revenue, which could be generated through agricultural concessions, and jobs for unemployed youth, who could become a major security threat. </p> <p>Post-war Liberia was also a fertile ground for policy experiments by multilaterals, law and business professors, and consultants hired by the likes of businessman George Soros and Tony Blair \u2013 whose <a href=\"mailto:http://www.africagovernance.org/what-we-do/liberia\">Africa Governance Initiative</a> works to build capacity in government ministries \u2013 names that brought status and donor dollars.</p> <p>\u201cWe had some of the best advice in the world,\u201d says Richard Tolbert, former head of the National Investment Commission, the country\u2019s investment promotion agency.

A new <a href=\"https://www.globalwitness.org/en/press-releases/will-big-plantations-help-liberia-economic-study/\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a>, commissioned by Global Witness, claims communities benefited more economically before GVL came, from subsistence farming, hunting and selling charcoal.</p> <p>GVL says the report is \u201cfactually deeply flawed\u201d, that it overstates both incomes from subsistence farming and the percentage of community land under development, and underestimates the benefit palm oil development has brought in terms of local infrastructure. </p> <h2>\u2018The land is our life\u2019</h2> <p>On top of a hill, a short distance away from where Panyonnoh is working, fellow employees throw palm fruit from the company\u2019s first harvest into vats for boiling and refinement. The small, temporary mill where they\u2019re working is framed by the wide skeleton of a much larger mill in the distance, which GVL says will generate jobs and increase the productivity of the plantation. The mill will be finished in late 2017, with other mills expected as the plantation expands.</p> <p>However, the Blogbo-Teh, a community group in the nearby town of Jacksonville, has called for a halt in construction, saying it did not consent to the company using the land, which they say is sacred. GVL says politics is at play and that the Blogbo-Teh represents a minority. It says the alarm was only raised well over a year after the agreement with the Tarjuowon district was signed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6785fbcf3c2c73c9753191ed975b22921feaeb50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6785fbcf3c2c73c9753191ed975b22921feaeb50/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Sworh\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Sworh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Max Cutting/Banyak</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The conflict is broader than the mill. Lee Sworh, a Blogbo-Teh activist, wants the company to leave altogether. He\u2019s calling for the whole concession agreement between GVL and the government to be nullified because, he says, there is no consensus. \u201cLet people make decisions for their own land their forefathers left for them, for the land is our treasury, the land is our bank, the land is our life.\u201d</p> <p>Sworh and his family own a sprawling farm in Geetroh, Sinoe County, where GVL is said to be interested in land. \u201cWhen the people come and take this land you will not farm like this any longer, all of these places will be controlled by the investors,\u201d Sworh says. \u201cYou can\u2019t farm here, you will not do anything here. They will plant their palm.\u201d</p> <p>Sworh fears the little independence rural people have will be taken away. Negotiations between GVL and Blogbo-Teh were being mediated by Parley, an NGO focused on land rights disputes, but came to a standstill last year. The company says it is unclear what the community wants or how to move forward. </p> <h2>The future</h2> <p>Operations on GVL\u2019s plantation have moved slowly over the past six years, with clearing and planting in only 15% of the designated concession area. This has been in part due to the time it takes for the communities and company to reach agreement.</p> <p>These agreements, often signed with blue inked thumbprints, promise to provide communities benefits such as drinking water, schools and access to clinics, but they aren\u2019t legally binding and have vague timelines for delivery.</p> <p>A land rights bill presented to the legislature almost two years ago, which for the first time would legally recognise customary land rights, could hold the key to disputes around concession areas and empower local communities, says Brandy. But land rights activists are skeptical that the bill will be passed before the presidential and legislative elections in 2017.</p> <p>Rothschild says GVL is in favour of the bill, adding that the company has acknowledged community rights through negotiating directly with the community rather than government. </p> <p>For GVL, the gains for the community from palm oil are tangible, if gradual. \u201cThe history of the industry is such that the first generation goes in as unemployed workers, the children go into the schools, get educated through the school system that we provide, and the next generation become the managers of these farms,\u201d says Rothschild.</p> <p>But workers such as Panyonnoh and his generation, whose lives have been put on hold by conflict and poverty, are growing impatient. They say the company needs to offer more training so they can progress beyond fieldwork. \u201cYou should continue to provide the opportunity,\u201d he says. \u201cOther people they are stuck. They are still doing the same thing, still slashing.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Register to attend our seminar, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/13/africa-palm-oil-environment-communities-foreign-investment-liberia-cameroon-proforest-olam-rspo-event\">Africa the new palm frontier: can we avoid the mistakes of the past?</a>, in London on 23 November 2016, 6pm-8.30pm (GMT)</li> </ul> <p>This piece was amended on 21 October 2016 to clarify that Richard Tolbert is the former head of the National Investment Commission.</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong>We all know that the ultimate success story when it comes to development is when a once struggling country goes from being dependent on aid from around the world to being an example of self-sufficiency and resilience when disaster strikes. However, how often do we see such a big transformation? One country that is demonstrating resilience is Botswana.</p> <p>In the autumn of 1984, I packed up my bags after graduating from university and joined the Peace Corps in Kasane, Botswana. At the time, the country was striving to lift its people out of poverty. Its per capita nominal GDP was<a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=BW\"> </a><a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=BW\">$1,082 </a>(today it\u2019s<a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=BW\"> $6,360)</a>. This was already a vast improvement for a country that was born in 1966 as <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/botswana/overview\">the third poorest on Earth</a> with a per capita GDP of $70. But the country was still struggling \u2013 only 20% of children were in <a href=\"https://www.quandl.com/collections/botswana/botswana-education-data\">secondary education</a>, for example.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2016/oct/07/lives-devastated-el-nino-drives-drought-mozambique-in-pictures\">Lives devastated as El Ni\u00f1o drives drought in Mozambique \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As Botswana celebrates its 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of independence this year, its people have a lot to celebrate. The country has seen remarkable development progress over the past half century thanks to smart investments in its people, the land, and the institutions of government. And, critically important, Botswana has adapted to a changing climate, which presents important development challenges for this semi-arid country.</p> <p>Botswana has always faced recurring droughts, which threatened to roll back its development. This year, due to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/26/southern-africa-appeals-for-billions-el-nino-devastation-drought\">a strong El Ni\u00f1o</a>, its people are suffering the worst drought since the early 1980s when another severe drought devastated the country and required a large influx of aid. For example, throughout the 1980s, USAid provided Botswana with more than $40m (\u00a333m) in food aid, which was required after droughts and other shocks.</p> <p>Yet, remarkably, this once fledgling country has managed this year\u2019s massive drought without asking for significant outside help. How did this transformation happen?</p> <p>Certainly, good governance has played a key role. Botswana\u2019s leaders have responsibly leveraged the country\u2019s diamond wealth to invest in infrastructure, education, and other development efforts that have spurred growth. More recently, however, the government has also taken important steps to help the most vulnerable adapt to and mitigate the growing risks they face from climate change and climate variability. For instance, the government\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/06/climate-change-female-farmers-botswana-150611091026193.html\">backyard gardening initiative</a> has promoted small-scale irrigation among poor Batswana farmers, allowing them to grow healthy produce and conserve the soil. <br></p> <p>Donors have also supported Botswana\u2019s efforts to expand conservation agriculture. We\u2019ve worked with farmers in Kasane, and across the Four Corners region for over a decade, to encourage the use of innovative farming techniques to grow more food with less water, avoid losing water to evaporation, and prevent soil erosion. These farmers are also growing drought-tolerant crops, like millet, that can thrive in the semi-arid terrain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/feb/09/12-ways-to-mobilise-the-money-needed-to-stop-climate-change\">12 ways to mobilise the money needed to stop climate change</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Farmers are also being encouraged to diversify how they make a living. Kasane\u2019s farmers live in an area with some of Africa\u2019s most endangered wildlife, but predators such as lions can attack their crops and even their cattle. We\u2019ve been working with Botswana\u2019s government to <a href=\"https://www.usaid.gov/southern-africa-regional/news/conserving-wildlife-okavango-river-basinbigpicture\">disincentivise illegal poaching</a> by facilitating legal, profitable alternatives in ecotourism, conservation agriculture, fisheries, and natural product harvesting and marketing.</p> <p>Botswana still has work ahead if it wants to protect itself from future climate shocks. It must continue to diversify its economy, facilitate private investment and support citizen engagement to fully unleash growth, but it has already come a long way in mobilising its resources effectively to provide a better, more resilient future for its people.</p> <p>Unfortunately, not all of Botswana\u2019s neighbours have taken the same path to development. Malawi, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Madagascar, Swaziland and Lesotho have been hard hit by this year\u2019s drought. Ineffective policies and poor governance are compounding the drought\u2019s impact on food insecurity, health and other secondary effects.</p> <p>More than 18 million people across the region will face crisis food insecurity by March 2017. But like Botswana, the development community is also more prepared for this drought that we were in the 1980s. The <a href=\"http://www.fews.net/\">Famine Early Warning System</a>, for example, was created following the 1980s droughts, and allows us to track food insecurity in more than 35 countries. Using this system has enabled us to assess needs and respond early \u2013 so far we\u2019ve mobilised $300m in assistance and the US government is leading the humanitarian response in the region. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/26/southern-africa-appeals-for-billions-el-nino-devastation-drought\">Southern Africa appeals for billions to cope with El Ni\u00f1o devastation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, as we look ahead, we know that drought is a perennial development challenge for southern Africa. With climate change, droughts will become more frequent and more severe, driving up food insecurity and inhibiting regional growth. Southern Africa cannot escape recurring drought emergencies and stay on a path of sustainable development if it does not mitigate these risks. Donors can support these efforts, but effective resilience strategies must be country-led.</p> <p>As Botswana illustrates, building resilience requires political will from governments to harness resources effectively and promote policies that facilitate inclusive growth. Botswana\u2019s responsible mobilisation of domestic resources to expand educational access and promote conservation tourism has broadened economic opportunities for its people. And the government\u2019s more recent climate adaptation policies have helped its most vulnerable better cope with droughts. This latest drought should serve as an opportunity for other governments in the region to take heed of Botswana\u2019s example.</p> <p><em>David Harden is the USAid\u2019s assistant administrator for the bureau for democracy, conflict, and humanitarian assistance</em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

A total of 137,366 migrant families and children were apprehended by US border patrol this year, compared with 136,986 in 2014. The total number of apprehensions, however, was down from 479,371 in 2014 to 408,870 in 2016. </p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/mwc/\">data published by Trac</a>, groups from Central America made up the bulk of family cases brought to court in 2016. The 16,491 family cases from El Salvador brought in 2016 were the largest of any national cohort \u2013 with the vast majority of these (15,623) still pending. </p> <p>Statistics published by the Department of Homeland Security showed that 27,114 families from El Salvador, 23,067 families from Guatemala, and 20,226 families from Honduras were apprehended at the border in 2016, with just 3,481 families apprehended from Mexico. </p> <p>The homeland security secretary, Jeh Johnson, acknowledged on Monday that: \u201cFar fewer Mexicans and single adults are attempting to cross the border without authorization, but more families and unaccompanied children are fleeing poverty and violence in Central America.\u201d</p> <p>Families and unaccompanied minors have been prioritised in immigration courts <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/06/30/letter-president-efforts-address-humanitarian-situation-rio-grande-valle\">following an executive order issued by Barack Obama in 2014</a> but a shortage of judges has led to <a href=\"https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/empty-benches-underfunding-immigration-courts-undermines-justice\">crippling backlogs throughout the system</a>. </p> <p>The Trac analysis also highlights large disparities in the access to counsel at different court locations.

  "<p>There was a time when Jonjo Shelvey appeared a big part of the problem at Newcastle United but these days he seems very much the solution.</p> <p>Rafael Ben\u00edtez had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/11/newcastle-united-sack-steve-mcclaren-rafael-benitez\">barely succeeded Steve McClaren</a> as manager at St James\u2019 Park last spring before he dropped the midfielder from the team. Despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/11/five-games-newcastle-relegation-premier-league\">Newcastle\u2019s fall into the Championship</a> Shelvey then began this season warming the bench and, when liberated from it, persistently attempting too many \u201cHollywood passes\u201d and over-ambitious long-range shots.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/13/qpr-newcastle-championship-match-report\">Newcastle flying high as Jonjo Shelvey scores twice in mauling of QPR</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over the last few weeks, though, things have changed radically. Endless hours of painstaking training ground work with Ben\u00edtez have taught a 24-year-old who claims to have grown up to apply a precious, game-changing talent properly. And with Newcastle having risen to the top of the Championship, Ben\u00edtez has even dropped heavy hints that Gareth Southgate should give serious consideration to adding to Shelvey\u2019s six England caps.</p> <p>If he is unlikely to supplant the technically assured Vurnon Anita as his club manager\u2019s favourite player, Shelvey has become that rarity in a Ben\u00edtez squad: a player who does not find himself subjected to regular rotation.</p> <p>Strutting through games with accuracy and aplomb, not to mention unusual mental courage, Shelvey has been dictating play from an anchor role in Newcastle\u2019s 4-2-3-1 formation. Crucially he finally appears to have acquired the knack of knowing precisely when to unleash those devastating, defence-splitting passes over 40 to 60 yards.</p> <p>In a football world crammed with neat and tidy midfielders specialising in the low-risk short and sideways ball, Shelvey\u2019s vision, technique and raking passing range set him apart. The difference now is that the familiar swagger is underpinned by a substance sorely lacking in the wake of his \u00a3<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/12/newcastle-united-jonjo-shelvey-bid-swansea-city\">12m, \u00a380,000-a-week switch</a> from Swansea to McClaren\u2019s Newcastle last January.</p> <p>\u201cWe have other players who can play that position,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez. \u201cBut Jonjo\u2019s playing every game. He\u2019s technically good and, when he plays well, the team plays better. In Jonjo we have a player who has it in him to deliver the final pass. He can control games.\u201d</p> <p>And England? \u201cWhen he\u2019s playing as he is now, why not,\u201d added the former Liverpool, Chelsea and Real Madrid manager. \u201cThere were never any doubts about Jonjo\u2019s ability but he\u2019s playing at a really good level now. That\u2019s very clear. I\u2019m very happy with him.\u201d</p> <p>This harmony did not prevent moments of creative tension between coach and midfielder as Ben\u00edtez questioned Shelvey\u2019s passing decisions during Saturday\u2019s 3-1 win against Brentford, in which Shelvey helped to create all of Newcastle\u2019s goals. Such constructive criticism appears to be bringing out the best in the former Charlton and Liverpool player.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not the same person I was before,\u201d said Shelvey. \u201cRafa\u2019s helped me understand myself. He\u2019s a very good manager. I\u2019ve grown so much at Newcastle.\u201d</p> <p>Shelvey has also contracted, shedding well over a stone in weight, as well as a \u201cchildish mind-set\u201d after hiring a personal trainer during the close season. \u201cMy mentality\u2019s better because I feel better physically,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/20/jonjo-shelvey-swansea-city-interview\">Jonjo Shelvey: 'Growing up it was rough, people were getting stabbed'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The resultant metamorphosis may have come too late to save McClaren\u2019s job on Tyneside but it does not surprise Ian Holloway, who took Shelvey on loan from Liverpool to Blackpool in 2011 and quickly detected his potential. \u201cJonjo\u2019s probably the best player I\u2019ve ever seen play in the Championship,\u201d Holloway said after watching Newcastle beat Brentford. \u201cHe can get it off the centre-halves, dictate play and go beyond into the final third. He never looks to play the simple ball, he\u2019s always looking to hurt you. He\u2019s like a puppet; he\u2019s always moving his head. He\u2019s so aware of everything around him.\u201d</p> <p>Described as faultless by Roy Hodgson when the then England coach gave him his debut, Shelvey \u2013 who started 31 games during three years at Anfield having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/apr/28/liverpool-jonjo-shelvey-charlton\">been signed by Ben\u00edtez</a> (who left soon afterwards) as Steven Gerrard\u2019s heir apparent \u2013 has enjoyed purple patches before. The difference this time is that his bravery and ability are now reinforced, and sometimes rationed, by Ben\u00edtez\u2019s instilled discipline.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been confident \u2013 you have to be when you\u2019ve got alopecia and a bald head,\u201d said a man who has emerged as a vocal leader, on and off the field. \u201cBut I feel much more confident and fearless now.</p> <p>\u201cI think the Championship is helping me and helping Newcastle. \u201cThere\u2019s a buzz in the city, the fans are back onside \u2013 we\u2019re getting 52,000 at home games \u2013 and there\u2019s a lot of love for the club.

  "<p>All the major global challenges \u2013 climate change, the economy, inequality, the very future of democracy \u2013 will be solved in cities. If nations want to succeed with their policies, we must be counted as serious actors on the global stage. </p> <p>I believe national governments are hostages to the momentum of the previous century \u2013 but that\u2019s not the real world any more. We live in a world that functions by networking, by faster and more agile contact between cities.</p> <p>Of course, the perfect city does not exist; the democratic city is in permanent conflict and permanent construction. The point is to be really open; to keep innovating, listening to citizens and watching what is done in other cities to make constant improvements.<br></p> <p>Cities are able to make politics more cooperative, and not so competitive. Even though different parties rule, we agree on concrete objectives and we cooperate in a very agile way, exchanging experiences and solutions. I think this should inspire politics at all levels.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/19/right-city-social-movement-transforming-urban-space\">Right to the city: can this growing social movement win over city officials?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is always going to be fear of change \u2013 but cities are trying to be positive, telling national leaders: \u201cYou can count on us to update your policies to succeed. However, if you don\u2019t include us, you will fail.\u201d<br></p> <h2><strong>The right to the city</strong></h2> <p>I believe you can\u2019t talk about a just, sustainable, equitable or inclusive city if you don\u2019t speak about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/19/right-city-social-movement-transforming-urban-space\">right to the city</a> [a model of urban development that includes all citizens].</p> <p>The reference to it in the UN\u2019s <a href=\"http://citiscope.org/habitatIII/explainer/2015/06/what-new-urban-agenda\">New Urban Agenda</a> document [ratified at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/18/world-quito-ecuador-future-cities-local-voices-habitat-3\">Habitat III in Quito this week</a>] could be more ambitious, in my opinion. But we should also recognise the problems we have overcome just to get this far. Global powers such as the United States and China resisted it completely; they didn\u2019t want the right to the city in the declaration at all. <br></p> <p>But thanks to popular mobilisation in Latin America and in some European countries, this political movement has won its place on the agenda \u2013 and it is a significant achievement. The resisting member states were forced to put it in; they had to recognise that the vast majority of the population is located in cities \u2013 and it\u2019s only going to increase.</p> <p>But for the right to the city to become real, we have to fight, starting tomorrow, for it to be transformed into concrete policies and regulations. </p> <p>Cities haven\u2019t \u201cwon\u201d yet \u2013 but we have developed a more united voice, and the national governments are much more aware that if they want their countries to prosper, they need to count on us.<br></p> <p>The problem is, cities are underfunded. In Spain, municipalities only have access to 13% of total public revenues \u2013 which is very low when you have to respond immediately to all the daily problems of education, health, mobility and inequality.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bff308a66a5eb4fc54b7ecf1c2166630811e5bf6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bff308a66a5eb4fc54b7ecf1c2166630811e5bf6/859_432_2808_1685/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ada Colau and Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo (r) leave Barcelona city hall after signing a collaboration agreement between their two cities.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ada Colau and Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo (r) leave Barcelona city hall after signing a collaboration agreement between their two cities.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josep Lago/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Gender equality</strong><br></h2> <p>The role of women in political change has been much more prominent at Habitat III than in previous summits. In a speech I made to the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/pga/71/2016/10/16/world-mayors-assembly-of-habitat-iii/\">World Mayors Assembly</a>, I discussed the feminisation of politics and was struck by the loud applause.</p> <p>We still live in sexist and patriarchal cities \u2013 patriarchy goes hand in hand with the neoliberal city; they are two sides of the same coin. But right now we have an opportunity for those individuals who have traditionally been let down as \u201csecond-class citizens\u201d to become the main characters.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just a question of gender justice; this is an opportunity to improve our democracies. The public is demanding that we \u2013 politicians and institutions alike \u2013 change our priorities.</p> <p>Becoming Barcelona\u2019s first female mayor carried an immediate and very political significance. Many women in my city attached huge importance to it \u2013 and I have also experienced that here in Quito. In all the conferences I\u2019ve been doing, there have been dozens and dozens of women saying: \u201cIt is very important that you are the mayor.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/19/un-new-urban-agenda-inclusive-cities-lgbtq-rights-habitat-3\">Why won't the UN agenda for inclusive cities recognise LGBTQ citizens?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The 21st century is the century of cities \u2013 in part because this is a moment of great political uncertainty at many levels. But within that uncertainty, we see empowered citizens asking to be protagonists, and the city is the place to do this.</p> <p>That\u2019s why I am optimistic: because I see many people who were not bothered about politics now getting really interested. Whereas previous summits used to be more bureaucratic, at Habitat III we have been having much more of a \u201ccitizen discussion\u201d.</p> <p>The most important tests will come after this summit finishes \u2013 when we find out whether all these statements can translate into commitments that create positive solutions for our citizens. Certainly, cities must play a leading role if the UN\u2019s New Urban Agenda is to generate concrete policies that improve our urbanising world.</p> <p><em>Ada Colau spoke to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/mike-herd\">Mike Herd</a>.

  "<p>Back in 2014, David Cameron told the House of Commons Liaison Committee that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/16/cameron-windfarm-subsidies-onshore-energy\">people are \u201cbasically fed up\u201d with wind farms</a>. In 2015, his government then went on to not only cut subsidies for onshore wind, but also make it harder and harder to get planning permission. </p> <p>But politicians are wrong to think wind power is unpopular. Again and again, polls show the UK public are pretty supportive of onshore wind. <a href=\"http://1010uk.org/blown-away-content/public-support-perception\">Our ComRes poll out today</a>, for example, shows 73% of the British public back onshore wind power. Politicians can only dream of such approval ratings. </p> <p>Significantly, the poll also found two thirds of people living in rural areas say they support onshore wind farms (65%). Although support for onshore wind was lower here than in urban areas (75%), it is still very high. The difference is similar to one found if you split by age - 77% of 18-24s support onshore wind compared to 66% of over 65s. </p> <p>We also found support - at 80% - especially high in Scotland, the part of the country with by far the most onshore wind per capita. This reflects <a href=\"http://www.gov.scot/Resource/Doc/47133/0014639.pdf\">older, 2003 research by Mori Scotland</a> (pdf) which talked to people who actually live near large wind sites and feel it\u2019s had a positive impact on their area. </p> <p>Something not covered in our new poll, but we which <a href=\"https://www.cooperativeenergy.coop/why-us/community-energy-conference/icm-polling-results/\">know from elsewhere</a>, is that people are much more likely to support the building of renewable energy locally if they the profits directly benefit the community. According to research on wind farms in the Netherlands, people are even <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19640029\">less likely to worry about the noise if they have a direct financial stake</a> in the turbines. This is something we learnt from building a solar farm in Balcombe, and is just as true, and maybe even more so for wind: involve the local community. Let them be involved in working out where to site it and how you\u2019re going to minimise impact on wildlife, and offer them a direct financial stake too. </p> <p>What\u2019s probably most interesting in the polling data, however, is how much we seem to underestimate support for onshore wind. Ask people if they support or oppose onshore wind and 73% will give it a thumbs up, but ask them to estimate how much of the population agree with them and only a minority (11%) think that 71% or more of people in the UK support the use of the technology. We see a similar trend, though slightly less marked, when it comes to solar farms. 80% say they support solar farms, but only 11% of people think support is that high.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/20/onshore-windfarms-more-popular-than-thought-uk-poll-finds\">Onshore windfarms more popular than thought, UK poll finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To help us understand this odd perception gap we also commissioned some <a href=\"http://1010uk.org/blown-away-content/press-analysis\">research on how the press cover onshore wind and fracking</a>. We looked at wind and fracking coverage from 1st Jan 2011 to the 16th Sept 2016. There was a load more news coverage of fracking - 5,398 news articles on wind and 7,393 on fracking - but when it came to comment pieces and editorials, the number was about the same for the two technologies - 250 on wind and 279 on fracking. Over half the comment pieces about onshore wind were negative - 52% rated as negative, 31% neutral and only 17% considered positive. </p> <p>Wind editorials tend to frame their argument so as to emphasise the risks. We found a total of 226 risk frames and only 53 benefit frames in the wind comment pieces. Or to put this another way, for every four times a risk was raised, only one benefit was. When we came to look at fracking, the relationship was reversed. Here we found 139 risk frames and 206 benefit ones - that is, only two in five frames raised risk. When it came to the arguments made against onshore wind, aesthetic and cultural problems were the most frequently employed, followed by economic issues or technical risks. On the benefits side though, economic arguments were most often used, followed by environment ones. </p> <p>What to make of all this? We seem worryingly out of touch with each other when it comes to onshore wind. And it looks like a minority of people who don\u2019t like wind are finding a disproportionate amount of space to air those views in newspapers. I\u2019m also worried that the pro-wind views that do get through tend to rely on economics and environmental arguments. Robust, sure, and certainly part of the debate, but maybe we need to inject some emotion as well as a sense of culture and aesthetics. It\u2019s not like these arguments can\u2019t be made: lots of people feel a sense of hope and delight when they see a wind turbine on the horizon - that feeling should be expressed and shared. And wind power is an established part of our culture - <a href=\"http://scienceonstreets.phys.strath.ac.uk/new/James_Blyth.html\">we started it after all</a>. </p> <p>We need a fresh debate on onshore wind in this country, and it needs to be one that reflects the importance of personal relationships between technology and the people.<br></p> <p><em>Alice Bell was a founder member of the Political Science blog.

On average, premiums have <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/04/republican-national-committee-republican/republican-national-committee-says-health-insuranc/\">risen</a> by about 5.8% a year since Barack Obama took office, compared with 13.2% in the nine years before Obama, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/04/republican-national-committee-republican/republican-national-committee-says-health-insuranc/\">Politifact found</a> earlier this year. Trump, however, is cherry-picking data from <a href=\"http://acasignups.net/\">various states</a> and <a href=\"https://ratereview.healthcare.gov/#urrresults?U2FsdGVkX19n4kcCdR5qUI27%2BwHheoDO2VGbcEEfi84Zrt9YzdawzO8%2BdPHtCLfThVI4mtetRmr28iQ8w29yvQ%3D%3D\">providers</a> where <a href=\"https://ratereview.healthcare.gov/#urrresults?U2FsdGVkX186EmjG4AR6ruydOJE2fGfzzCgpYCDVKZngFNf0hgLfrIhE%2BJuoUQjwImgHKotCy9LrONfdtvsk4im1VSMZcQCpaU3VHLZUiPU%3D\">rates have had higher</a> jumps. The most common healthcare plans will increase 9% on average, according to an <a href=\"http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/analysis-of-2017-premium-changes-and-insurer-participation-in-the-affordable-care-acts-health-insurance-marketplaces/\">analysis</a> by the Kaiser Family Foundation. </p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cWe take care of illegal immigrants \u2026 better than we take care of our vets\u201d</strong></p> <p>This claim flies in the face of evidence and logic. Like all US citizens, veterans enjoy the basic rights and benefits granted by US law (voting rights, social security, Medicaid, etc), while undocumented migrants (noncitizens) do not. Trump has in the past tried to justify this claim by saying the US spends more on undocumented people than on veterans, but has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/lyin-trump-fact-check-mexico-wall-immigration\"> drawn a $113bn price tag from an explicitly anti-immigration foundation</a>. He also inflated that number. </p> <p>The campaign has said the US spends $2.8bn on housing migrants in prisons, combining an estimate <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/421673/report-us-spent-187-billion-incarcerate-illegal-immigrant-criminals-2014-joel-gehrke\">on prison costs</a> and the 2016 budget for the care and processing of children who came to the US without adults. The Veterans Affairs administration has a 2016 budget of $69.7bn. Veterans and undocumented migrants alike have access to K-12 education, though few veterans would likely seek it, and veterans have access to the Affordable Care Act, military benefits and health benefits, while migrants do not.</p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cOur inner cities are a disaster. You get shot walking to the store, you have no education, no jobs\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump\u2019s repeated claim that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-lies-this-week-taxes-bankruptcy\">African Americans, Hispanics, are living in hell</a>\u201d defies most of American history, from antebellum slavery through the Jim Crow decades, great depression and segregation. Even if Trump is only referring the past half century, he is still wrong by most metrics. </p> <p>Data on employment, education and health show empirical evidence for the <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/18/sharp-differences-over-who-is-hurt-helped-by-their-race/\">persistent reality</a> of <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/27/blacks-with-college-experience-more-likely-to-say-they-faced-discrimination/\">discrimination</a> against black Americans, but also show major gains in the last few decades.

During the FBI investigation, Petraeus lied to agents, according to the plea deal.

The IHRC approved a project between the US, Haiti\u2019s government and Sae-A Trading, a South Korean clothing company, and it now provides 8,900 jobs to Haitians.</p> <p>An eventual <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/655278.pdf\">review</a> by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office found \u201cmixed results\u201d with the project, including \u201cunrealistic initial timeframes\u201d, delays, incomplete information in the feasibility study, and funding problems.

The US committed funding but did not participate in building the industrial park; a labor group that reviewed the factory found it had <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwiJbAWhwPe_U3pDTkpMVmhNdFQ4NWZPR3VsSTNnVEtmVGJF/view\">adequate oversight and had dealt </a>with concerns, though the factory remains within the range of the often grueling garment industry.</p> <p>He was correct, at least, that the Clinton Foundation has accepted millions from Middle East countries with records of repression of women and gay people. <br></p> <p><strong>Clinton: \u201cWe at the Clinton Foundation spend 90% [of what\u2019s given] and have the highest rating from watchdogs\u201d</strong></p> <p>The Clinton Foundation does have high marks from charity watchdogs, which also show that the group does spend the vast majority of its donations on its own charitable programs.</p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cI don\u2019t buy boats, I don\u2019t buy planes [with the Trump Foundation], we put up the American flag, and that\u2019s it \u2026 We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump is not being wholly honest about his charitable foundation, at least according to the Trump Foundation own documents, which <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-used-258000-from-his-charity-to-settle-legal-problems/2016/09/20/adc88f9c-7d11-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html\">show that he used its money to pay for legal settlements</a> and even self-portraits, as Clinton said and<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-clue-to-the-whereabouts-of-the-6-foot-tall-portrait-of-donald-trump/2016/09/14/ae65db82-7a8f-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html\"> the Washington Post </a>has reported at length.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58082834e4b055209adaf5ee\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T02:13:32.369Z\">3.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8fb95e51e74a0970d0460104e4819138c2b4e6d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fb95e51e74a0970d0460104e4819138c2b4e6d7/0_0_4488_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Debate moderator Chris Wallace from Fox News attempts to keep things in control on the stage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"642\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Debate moderator Chris Wallace from Fox News attempts to keep things in control on the stage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Raedle/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c036bd71431d42bbd7449c533cf244bdde2b038\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c036bd71431d42bbd7449c533cf244bdde2b038/0_74_5069_3043/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Wallace has to turn his attention to the crowd who\u2019ve begun cheering and applauding the candidates\u2019 answers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wallace then has to turn his attention to the crowd who\u2019ve begun cheering and applauding the candidates\u2019 answers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ethan Miller/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T02:15:44.501Z\">at 3.15am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-580827f7e4b0cd26ff71ef68\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T02:13:17.809Z\">3.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Question: What to do to ensure that Isis does not re-fill left behind when they are defeated for example imminently in Mosul?</p> <p>Clinton: \u201cI am hopeful that hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off but we know we\u2019ve got lots of hard work to do.\u201d</p> <p>Thousands of civilians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/mosul-thousands-flee-syrian-refugee-camps-iraqi-forces-close-city\">have fled Mosul</a> and its surrounding region to crowded refugee camps in war-torn Syria, aid officials have said, as Iraqi forces continued to advance on the most populous city under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\">Islamic State</a> control.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580826f1e4b055209adaf5e5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T02:11:56.212Z\">3.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump: 'I will keep you in suspense'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Trump says there are millions of people registered to vote who shouldn\u2019t be.

As of 28 September 2016,<a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/current\"> it was $19.5tn</a>. Trump omits, however, two key points: Congress controls the government\u2019s wallet (ie Obama cannot spend or tax without approval from lawmakers), and Obama took office during the financial crisis, when Republicans, Democrats and most economists agreed that the US needed to spend in order to counteract the collapsing economy. Pence has the right numbers but imputes too much responsibility on the president.</p> <p><strong>Clinton: Trump\u2019s plan largely helps the wealthy and add $20tn in debt</strong></p> <p>Clinton is correct that although Trump\u2019s tax plan would cut taxes for everyone, it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">disproportionately help the wealthiest Americans</a>, saving them millions of dollars and adding $5.3tn to the national debt, <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-donald-trump-tax-reform-plan-september-2016\">according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation</a>, a conservative thinktank. She seems to be citing another <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-tax-plan\">analysis, by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center</a>, about the debt, and possibly overstates its estimated consequences. </p> <p>That center warned that without severe spending cuts, the plan would balloon national debt \u201cby nearly 80% of gross domestic product by 2036, offsetting some or all of the incentive effects of the tax cuts\u201d. According to that group, half of Trump\u2019s tax cuts would go to the top 1% of earners, and most families below the top 20% of earners would have income gains of less than 1%.</p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cWhen you ran the State Department, $6bn was missing! Maybe it was stolen \u2026 nobody knows\u201d</strong></p> <p>This is not correct. Trump is alluding to a March 2014 alert, about contractor spending in the Middle East and Africa, by the State Department\u2019s inspector general, who was so perturbed by careless language around the $6bn figure that he wrote the Washington Post a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/about-the-state-depts-missing-6-billion/2014/04/13/a6130790-c194-11e3-9ee7-02c1e10a03f0_story.html?utm_term=.452a9d665b36\">letter</a> that April.

A Trump contractor hired undocumented Polish workers in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and in 1983 union members sued one of their organizers. Trump appeared in court in 1990 and blamed the contractor overseeing the project, which was for Trump Tower.</p> <p><strong>Trump: Obama \u201chas thousands and thousands of people, they have no idea where they come from\u201d</strong></p> <p>Ten thousand Syrian refugees have come to the United States in 2016, but Trump makes it sound misleadingly large.</p> <p>He is patently wrong about the screening process. The US has among the most intensive screening process in the world for refugees: it requires they register and interview with the United Nations, which then must refer them to the US; refugees who pass this test then interview with State Department contractors and have at least two background checks; then they have three fingerprint and photo screenings; then US immigration reviews the case; then Homeland Security interviews the refugee; then a doctor examines the refugee, and finally several security agencies perform one last check after the refugee has been matched with a resettlement agency. </p> <p>The process <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-syria-refugees-us-immigration-security-terrorism\">takes 18 months</a> to two years. The US has a very clear idea about which refugees it allows into the country.</p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cI don\u2019t know Putin. He said nice things about me \u2026 He has no respect for our president.\u201d</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s not clear whether Trump has ever spoken with the Russian president. Putin was invited to but did not attend a 2013 beauty pageant in Moscow, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-trumps-financial-ties-to-russia-and-his-unusual-flattery-of-vladimir-putin/2016/06/17/dbdcaac8-31a6-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html\">one of the oligarchs</a> who helped organize the event. \u201cWill he become my new best friend?\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/347191326112112640\">wondered</a> beforehand.</p> <p>The pair may have communicated through intermediaries. In 2014, Trump <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKkKQmbyECw\">told a National Press Club luncheon</a>: \u201cI was in Moscow recently and I spoke, indirectly and directly, with President Putin, who could not have been nicer, and we had a tremendous success.\u201d A year earlier, Trump <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-putin-tried-arrange-meeting-moscow-source-n619006\">told MSNBC</a>: \u201cI do have a relationship and I can tell you that he\u2019s very interested in what we\u2019re doing here today.\u201d</p> <p>Last November, Trump <a href=\"http://time.com/4107636/transcript-read-the-full-text-of-the-fourth-republican-debate-in-milwaukee/\">claimed in a debate</a> that he \u201cgot to know him very well because we were both on 60 Minutes\u201d. They appeared in separate, pre-taped segments and were not on set together.</p> <p>Trump has repeatedly tried to do business in Russia, and his refusal to release tax returns prevents him proving that he has no assets there. </p> <p>Putin has never called Trump \u201ca genius\u201d; he used the Russian word \u044f\u0440\u043a\u0438\u0439, which means \u201ccolorful\u201d or \u201cflamboyant\u201d. Trump likely heard the word translated as \u201cbright\u201d or \u201cbrilliant\u201d, though its connotations are often more pejorative than not: bright in the sense of glaring and gaudy, brilliant in the sense of dazzling light. Putin also called him \u201ctalented, undoubtedly\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not our business to decide his merits; that\u2019s for US voters,\u201d Putin said earlier this year. He did say, however, that he would welcome the rapprochement in Russian-American relations that Trump has suggested.

Post-debate analysis comes to mind. Also, pre-debate analysis. Every description in advance of what we expect to happen onstage \u2013 the candidate chemistry, the tone, the issues they must surely discuss \u2013 those predictions seem unfailingly to miss. </p> <p>So let\u2019s give it another whirl. What will they discuss tonight? Moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News will have questions cued to the six topic areas announced in advance: debt and entitlements, immigration, economy, the supreme court, foreign hotspots and fitness to be president.</p> <p>But the candidates\u2019 preferred messages in recent days, especially as Trump is concerned, touch on different themes. Trump has been talking a lot about a rigged election and promised to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of Washington. In recent days he has proposed ethics reform laws and congressional term limits. Meanwhile, Breitbart, Trump\u2019s phantom media arm, published today (for the first time, it seems) the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/10/former-tv-reporter-accuses-bill-clinton-of-sexual-assault-229987\">story</a> of a former Arkansas broadcaster, Leslie Milwee, who says Bill Clinton sexually assaulted her in 1980. She\u2019s invited to the debate.</p> <p>Trump says that Clinton emails released by Wikileaks show she is part of an international cabal, with banks and the media, to destroy the country and enrich and empower themselves. He has contended that the state department offered the FBI a quid pro quo for declassifying certain Clinton emails just as they were to come in for public scrutiny. Any of these would-be scandals might be expected to come up.</p> <p>Clinton, for her part, may want to discuss the attack by Trump on his Republican colleagues; Trump\u2019s increasingly wild talk about voter fraud; or the astounding outpouring since the last debate of women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct or assault. (He denies all the claims.)

It\u2019s hard to feel excited or even relieved, though, when her road to victory is so slick with the odium of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>.</p> <p>Between the video of Trump bragging about sexual assault and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/15/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations-cathy-heller\">woman after woman</a> coming forward to claim he did just that, it\u2019s hard to stave off that sick-to-your-stomach feeling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/14/michelle-obama-speech-transcript-donald-trump\">Michelle Obama described so powerfully last week</a>. For those of us who have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/28/jessica-valenti-my-life-as-a-sex-object\">endured a lifetime of unwanted leers and touches</a>, this last leg of the campaign has been painful. And as Trump surrogates and supporters \u2013<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/17/melania-trump-billy-bush-groping-tape-cnn-interview\">even his wife</a> \u2013 continue to shrug off the offenses as \u201clocker room talk\u201d or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787990502415167488\">outright lies</a>, we\u2019re reminded of just how easily women are disbelieved.</p> <p>There is one thing, though, that\u2019s giving me hope in the midst of this ugliness: the outcry from men who refuse to characterize sexual harassment and abuse as normal male behavior. Too often, discussions about sexual assault center only on women \u2013 our victimization and perceived culpability. Since the tape\u2019s release, though, the national conversation has shifted: men are coming forward en masse to reject the idea that \u201creal men\u201d talk about abusing women \u2013 that this is normal language to use in a locker room or anywhere else.</p> <p>Read further:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-sexism-misogyny-men\">The silver lining of Trump's misogyny?

Fox News anchor Chris Wallace - the first anchor from that network to host a presidential debate - will moderate tonight\u2019s engagement. For a network that has been embroiled in scandal that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/21/roger-ailes-leaves-fox-news-sexual-harassment-claims\">brought down its chief executive</a>, Wallace\u2019s position is an opportunity to hit the reset button on a miserable year - although Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/14/fox-anchor-megyn-kelly-meets-donald-trump\">willingness to feud</a> with Fox News personalities means that Wallace will not be protected from onstage criticism from the candidate just because he\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/06/trump-only-goes-on-hannity-megyn-kelly-clashes-with-friend-at-10-oclock\">besties with Sean Hannity.</a></p> <p><strong>What is the format? </strong>The debate will consist of six 15-minute segments, following the same format as the first presidential debate. Each segment will be approximately 15 minutes long. Wallace will open each segment with a question, after which each candidate will have two minutes to respond. Clinton and Trump will then have an opportunity to respond to each other. Wallace may use the balance of the time in the segment for a deeper discussion of the topic. Those topics, <a href=\"http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=2016debates\">as revealed by the Commission on Presidential Debates</a>, are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Debt and entitlements</li> <li>Immigration</li> <li>The economy</li> <li>Supreme Court</li> <li>Foreign hot spots</li> <li>Fitness to be president</li> </ul> <p><strong>Where is the debate being held? </strong>The debate is being held at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, which means that the journalists covering the debate are going to come home broke and hung over (they\u2019ve earned it, trust me).</p> <p><strong>How do I watch the misery? </strong>That\u2019s the easy part!

  "<p>People of colour in South Africa have faced a long history of ostracism on multiple levels. Though I missed the worst of it, apartheid laws mandated racist exclusion: careers, political roles, even door entrances and homes, all were determined by race. These attitudes remain, even without laws to back them up.</p> <p>I was a child, the first time I was subjected to a racial slur. Decades later it continues in South Africa, but also online, particularly in an internet environment dominated by status quo warriors who love Trump, hate women and believe progress is poison.</p> <p>It was fascinating to me, then, to encounter a racial slur in the recent video game <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/10/mafia-3-review-1960s-shooter-gameplay\" title=\"\">Mafia III</a>.

The creators, Hangar 13, <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-3-begins-with-statement-about-racism/1100-6444303/\" title=\"\">make no apologies for the inclusion of racism</a> as it\u2019s central to their story of a black man in the middle of the 20th century. These were the attitudes at the time, they remind us. In a version of 1960s America, players take on the role of Lincoln Clay, a biracial Vietnam war veteran. Lincoln returns home to the fictional city of New Bordeaux and his adopted family, members of the Black Mob.</p> <p>In an early part of the game, Lincoln pretends to be a security guard. A white character snarls that his white friend is unable to find a job, but \u201csome nigger\u201d can. Lincoln says nothing, staying in disguise. A few moments later, the game instructs you to throw that same racist character into a furnace.</p> <p>The game continues to display similar views, while Lincoln is provided with opportunities to respond. There are complaints about affirmative action, how everyone \u201cwants equality\u201d (as if that\u2019s bad), suggestions that black protesters are inherently violent or too loud or too demanding; there\u2019s disbelief that anyone who isn\u2019t white could be better than a white person.</p> <p>But these views are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/10/14/blatant-discrimination-black-female-doctor-says-flight-crew-questioned-her-credentials-during-medical-emergency/\" title=\"\">not caged in the past</a>; they linger today, and they\u2019re <a href=\"http://fusion.net/story/350187/racism-linked-to-death-penalty/\" title=\"\">still dangerous</a>. While playing, Lincoln is frequently warned to leave certain establishments by signs saying \u201cwhites only\u201d \u2013 a sign I\u2019ve seen in my own country. The game has markers indicating when police are watching Lincoln \u2013 and this is more frequent in white areas in the game world, where there is a larger police presence.</p> <p>Officers walking by Lincoln question what he\u2019s doing there. A white woman clutches a bag to her chest when Lincoln passes by. As you progress through the game, the Italian mob becomes flustered, wavering between disbelief and anger at how \u201csome nigger\u201d could be tearing apart their empire.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/04/the-best-and-very-worst-sex-scenes-in-video-game-history\">The best \u2013 and very worst \u2013 sex scenes in video game history</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is a game about how a person of colour destroys white supremacy.</p> <p>As someone who\u2019s frequently the target of racist hate, it\u2019s somewhat cathartic to be able to play a game that not only features racism but doesn\u2019t let racism stand \u2013 Lincoln tackles it head on, dismantles \u201csupremacy\u201d, says: no more.</p> <p>Of course, most of that response is incredibly violent, and there are questions about whether replacing one criminal empire with another is really progress. But that\u2019s another topic. Whatever the rights or wrongs of this traditional gaming narrative, Mafia III tackles the issue of race within those confines.</p> <p>The racism on display isn\u2019t some caricature. White men can be nice and also racist; they can be caring fathers and horrific bigots at the same time.

This is the disbelief that flows through the horror of white supremacists in Mafia III, as a man of colour destroys everything white people stole from the labour of black people.</p> <p>In a time when racism seems to be becoming more acceptable, when confronting and talking about it brings more wrath from self-proclaimed \u201cnot racists\u201d than the existence of racism, I\u2019m glad we have fiction reminding people that racism existed and still exists. I\u2019m glad its effects are used as part of the game\u2019s design, not merely relegated to cutscenes (animated, non-playable interludes) or dialogue.

The yearning for some golden age is so often code for returning to a time when white supremacy was unquestioned, unchallenged. The very world Lincoln finds himself in when the game begins.</p> <p>Mafia III isn\u2019t a perfect game, but it\u2019s one of the few that looks at white supremacy as the established norm and rejects it.

A week later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/10/ethiopia-declares-state-of-emergency-as-deadly-protests-continue\">the government announced a state of emergency</a> after protesters rampaged across Oromia, burning government buildings, and torching farms and factories.</p> <p>The events may mark a turning point in the 11-month uprising by the Oromo, Ethiopia\u2019s most populous ethnic group, who cite frustrations over political and economic marginalisation. The movement, along with a series of violent demonstrations occurring since late July in the historically powerful Amhara region, had already threatened the authority of the government, a favoured <a href=\"https://devtracker.dfid.gov.uk/countries/ET\">partner of the UK</a> and other donors that provide <a href=\"http://dagethiopia.org/new/oda-to-ethiopia\">close to $4bn</a> (\u00a33.2bn) in aid a year.</p> <p>The state of emergency is likely to mean the increased use of federal security forces, including the military, to quell unrest at the expense of regional states\u2019 autonomy, as well as occasional curfews and suspensions of due process. The US Department of State said the move could \u201cfurther enshrine\u201d the repression that has contributed to the crisis.<br></p> <p> The government has killed about 500 Oromo demonstrators so far during the crisis, while detaining tens of thousands more in an effort to discourage civil resistance. The message from those efforts and the latest round of unrest, however, is that it will be hard to subdue protesters, who see the government as discredited and embattled. That means the possibility of escalating violence in Africa\u2019s second-most populous nation.</p> <p>\u201cIf the government persists with the current stand, Ethiopia may be in for long-term instability,\u201d said Hassen Hussein, a US-based regional analyst who has written sympathetically about the Oromo struggle.</p> <p>The Bishoftu violence was preceded by a two-month lull, as new Oromo ruling party leaders emerged and pledged reforms. Before that, on 6 August, activists called for a day of \u201cgrand Oromo protests\u201d, which resulted in about 70 deaths and included a rare demonstration in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/29/insider-guide-addis-ababa-car-crashes-coffee-contemporary-art\">Addis Ababa</a>, the capital. Federal police dispersed that rally, scattering attendees with batons and boots.</p> <p>Among those subsequently detained was an educated young man calling himself Gudina Jalata. He\u2019d previously stayed away from protests out of fear, but felt compelled to participate by witnessing continuing injustice across the sprawling region that encircles the capital. \u201cFirst you have to be respected for your dignity \u2013 that is why I got involved. There is a lot of discrimination against the Oromo,\u201d he said.</p> <p> Before the government came to power in 1991 by removing a socialist junta, Ethiopia was a unitary state. A 1995 federal constitution ensured self-rule for minorities and promoted local languages in schools and government. However, Oromo allege the state is controlled by Tigrayans, <a href=\"http://ecadforum.com/2016/08/17/ethiopia-the-untold-plight-of-the-amhara-people/\">who comprise 6%</a> of the country\u2019s <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/country/ethiopia\">almost 100 million-strong population</a>, and say farmers are being unfairly evicted by investors tied to ruling elites.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/apr/20/unbridled-violence-gambella-ethiopia-south-sudan\">'Unbridled violence' in Gambella leaves Ethiopia searching for answers | William Davison</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The divergent narratives feed a furious debate. Far from being oppressors, TPLF elites say their community made huge sacrifices during a 16-year struggle that liberated the Oromo and other groups from Amhara domination. They add that ethnic federalism now protects those hard-won rights, and power is shared equitably within government, while the statist development model pushed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/aug/21/ethiopia-renaissance-meles-zenawi\">Meles Zenawi</a>, the former TPLF chairman and prime minister who died in 2012, helped Ethiopia advance.</p> <p>For Gudina and the other detainees, such claims seem fanciful. After time in a cramped cell, his group was driven to a federal police facility in the Awash area; some were held for a week and then released, others were held for up to two weeks. There were no showers or toilets and they were given only small amounts of bread and water. The camp had three components: gruelling barefoot exercises on gravel under a scorching sun, political lessons and bouts of investigation.</p> <p>The workouts included being forced to hop forwards with hands behind their head. Even the injured had to participate; if there was any slacking off, they were beaten. \u201cIt was really inhuman,\u201d Gudina said.</p> <p>Tigrayan officers, the interviewed detainees claimed, gave lessons on federalism and ruling coalition doctrines. While they felt contempt for their instructors, the prisoners were compliant, although one bucked the trend and was severely beaten. \u201cThe constitution they are teaching us is not broken by us \u2013 they themselves break the law. For example, it\u2019s our right to protest,\u201d one explained.</p> <p>Mass detention is not a new tactic for a government that has largely failed to move Ethiopia on from an authoritarian past. There have been similar initiatives during these Oromo protests, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/\">Human Rights Watch</a> said in June, while thousands have also been detained in Amhara.

  "<p>It travelled half a billion kilometres across the solar system, deployed its parachute flawlessly and survived a scorching descent through the Martian atmosphere, but the European Space Agency (ESA) has confirmed that its ExoMars lander was lost just one minute before it touched down on the surface of the red planet.</p> <p>The Schiaparelli <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/mars\">Mars</a> lander showed the first signs of a glitch as it released its parachute 1km from the surface and the signal went dead soon afterwards, ESA scientists said on Thursday, leaving them unsure of where the probe is and whether it crash-landed.</p> <p>Andrea Accomazzo, ESA\u2019s spacecraft operations manager, said: \u201cWhen we put it in the Martian environment, the spacecraft didn\u2019t behave exactly as expected \u2026 It might take quite some time before we are able to locate it.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/19/esa-exomars-scientists-wait-and-hope-as-fate-of-mars-schiaparelli-lander-remains-uncertain\">loss of the half-tonne craft</a>, which would have been the first European lander to perform science on the Martian surface, has echoes of the UK\u2019s failed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/aug/24/spaceexploration.sciencenews\">Beagle 2 mission, which touched down</a> in 2003 but failed to phone home and was only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/16/lost-beagle-2-spacecraft-found-mars\">found a decade later</a>.</p> <p>But speaking at a press conference on Thursday morning, Jan Woerner, ESA\u2019s director general, insisted the operations had been largely successful. The lander going off-radar at the last minute would not put the second phase of ExoMars \u2013 a six-wheeled rover due to be launched in 2020 \u2013 in jeopardy.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I am happy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe engineers are doing great work, but still you just need a bit of luck to succeed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/schiaparelli-zip/giv-14067bZldp6bSZ50/\" data-alt=\"Lander's descent to Mars\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/schiaparelli-zip/giv-14067bZldp6bSZ50/\">Lander's descent to Mars</a> </figure>  <p>He confirmed that the lander\u2019s mothership, the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO), had successfully swung into an elliptical orbit around Mars. With a span of nearly 18 metres, the giant TGO is the more important of the two probes. It will spend years sniffing the Martian atmosphere for minute levels of gas, including methane which could point to the existence of alien life on the planet.</p> <p>The lander\u2019s primary goal was to test entry and landing technology planned for the rover, which will be armed with a two-metre-long drill that will burrow into the Martian soil in search of alien organisms. While engineers hope to learn from any glitches that befell Schiaparelli, a question mark hangs over the future of the ExoMars rover because of a \u00a3300m funding gap at ESA.</p> <p>W\u00f6rner said he believed that ministers of member states who are being asked to cover the funding shortfall would not be deterred by the probe having gone off-course at the final hurdle.</p> <p>\u201cI think they will see we will show this mission is a success,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to convince them, we just have to show them the results are obvious.\u201d</p> <p>A successful landing on Mars would have marked a first for Europe. In 1971, the Soviet Union\u2019s Mars 3 craft became the first to land softly on Mars \u2013 although the spacecraft fell silent after transmitting from the surface for less than 20 seconds \u2013 and the US has managed several successful landings on the planet.</p> <p>Ahead of the landing, Fran\u00e7ois Forget, a French scientist on the European-Russian joint ExoMars mission, said: \u201cMany attempts to land on Mars have failed exactly because there is such a long chain of actions to be flawlessly executed. There cannot be a single weak link.\u201d</p> <p>Data beamed back from the Schiaparelli lander now shows that it successfully entered the Martian atmosphere, deployed its parachute and slowed down from 21,000km/h to 240km/h. However, about 1km from the surface, when the craft was due to release its parachute and begin using its thrusters for the final phase of deceleration something went wrong. The thrusters fired, but only for three or four seconds instead of the expected 30 seconds. And then transmission went silent about 50 seconds before landing.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not in a position yet to determine the dynamic conditions in which the lander touched the ground \u2026 to say whether the lander could have survived the landing or not,\u201d said Accomazzo.</p> <p>He added that finding the paddling pool-sized craft on the Martian surface would be a similar task to locating Beagle 2 or the Philae probe on the Rosetta comet, which was lost for almost two years after a bumpy touchdown on the comet 67P.</p> <p>Named after the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli, the European lander was released from the TGO on Sunday afternoon. <br></p> <p>Andrew Coates, who works on the ExoMars rover at University College London\u2019s Mullard Space Science Laboratory, said: \u201cThe science of 2020 is a huge chance for Europe and Russia, and the global science community, to get more information on whether there was or is life on Mars. It\u2019s really unique, drilling two metres under the harsh surface, some 40 times deeper than Curiosity and below where harmful UV, oxidisation and radiation can reach. My feeling is we must carry on with the rover with its world class complement of context instruments, including our PanCam, and sample analysis instruments. We expect the scientific results to be truly stunning.\u201d<br></p>",

Trump omits, however, two key points: Congress controls the government\u2019s wallet (ie Obama cannot spend or tax without approval from lawmakers), and Obama took office during the financial crisis, when Republicans, Democrats and most economists agreed that the US needed to spend in order to counteract the collapsing economy. Pence has the right numbers but imputes too much responsibility on the president.</p> <p><strong>\u201cWhen you ran the state department, $6bn was missing!

His alert did not conclude that the money was \u201cmissing\u201d he told the Post, but rather that officials had failed \u201cto adequately maintain contract files\u201d that created \u201csignificant financial risk\u201d.

During the FBI investigation, Petraeus lied to agents, according to the plea deal. But the justice department only sentenced Petraeus to two years\u2019 probation and a $100,000 fine, provoking accusations that this relatively lenient sentence was evidence of a double standard for the powerful. The justice department\u2019s lenience toward Petraeus actually made it more difficult, in part, for prosecutors to recommend charges against Clinton.<br><br>This week Cartwright pled guilty to lying to the FBI in an investigation into leaking classified information about operations against Iran to journalists. Like Petraeus, though, the FBI found actual intentional wrongdoing in Cartwright\u2019s case.

Over the same period, deaths from household air pollution also continued to increase, but only by 18%\u201d, said a researcher at the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development development centre. The OECD is funded by the world\u2019s richest 35 countries.</p> <p>For Africa as a whole, the estimated economic cost of premature air pollution deaths in 2013 was roughly $215bn (\u00a3175bn) a year for outdoor air pollution, and $232bn for household, or indoor, air pollution. </p> <p>The study\u2019s author, Rana Roy, is concerned by the pace at which outdoor air pollution is growing in Africa, bucking the downward trend in most countries. Used cars and trucks imported from rich countries are adding to urban pollution caused by household cooking on open fires.</p> <p>\u201cThis mega-trend is set to continue to unfold throughout this century. It suggests that current means of transportation and energy generation in African cities are not sustainable,\u201d said Roy. \u201cAlternative models to those imported from industrialised economies, such as dependence on the individual automobile, are necessary. </p> <p>\u201cIt is striking that air pollution costs in Africa are rising in spite of slow industrialisation, and even de-industrialisation in many countries. Should this latter trend successfully be reversed, the air pollution challenge would worsen faster, unless radically new approaches and technologies were put to use.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThe \u2018new\u2019 problem of outdoor air pollution is too large to be ignored or deferred to tomorrow\u2019s agenda.

It quotes UK scientist <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.york.ac.uk/chemistry/staff/academic/d-g/evansm/\">Mathew Evans</a>, professor of atmospheric chemistry at York University, who is leading a large-scale investigation of air pollution in west Africa.</p> <p>\u201cLondon and Lagos have entirely different air quality problems. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/02/toxic-truth-air-pollution-lethal-scandal-saharan-smog\">In cities such as London</a>, it\u2019s mainly due to the burning of hydrocarbons for transport. African pollution isn\u2019t like that. There is the burning of rubbish, cooking indoors with inefficient fuel stoves, millions of steel diesel electricity generators, cars which have had the catalytic converters removed and petrochemical plants, all pushing pollutants into the air over the cities. Compounds such as sulphur dioxide, benzene and carbon monoxide, that haven\u2019t been issues in western cities for decades, may be a significant problem in African cities. We simply don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Whereas China has reached a level of development that has allowed it to concentrate on solving air pollution, most African countries must grapple with several major environmental burdens at the same time, said the report.</p> <p>\u201c[They] are not in the position of a China, which can today focus on air pollution undistracted by problems such as unsafe water or unsafe sanitation or childhood underweight,\u201d said Roy.</p> <p>Henri-Bernard Solignac-Lecomte, head of the Europe, Middle east and Africa unit at the OECD development centre, said the paper made a double case for action. \u201cAir pollution in Africa increasingly hurts people and hinders economic development. Reducing it requires urgent action by governments to change the unsustainable course of urbanisation. Indeed, Africa urbanises at a very fast pace: today\u2019s 472 million urban dwellers will be around a billion in 2050. Today\u2019s investment choices will have decade-long impacts on urban infrastructure and the quality of life of urbanites.</p> <p>\u201cBold action to improve access to electricity, using clean technologies such as solar power, can contribute to reducing the exposure of the poorer families to indoor smog from coal or dung-fired cooking stoves.</p> <p>\u201cAs for outdoor pollution, African economies would be well advised to learn from the experience of industrialised countries, for example by developing mass public transportation systems \u2013 like Rabat or Addis-Ababa are doing with their tramways.\u201d </p> <p>Roy warned that the human and economic costs of air pollution might \u201cexplode\u201d without bold policy changes in Africa\u2019s urbanisation policies.</p> <p>He concluded with a call for urgent international action: \u201cIf Africa\u2019s local air pollution is contributing to climate change today, at a time when its population stands at 1.2 billion, or 16% of the world\u2019s population, it is safe to suppose that \u2026 it is likely to contribute considerably more when its population increases to around 2.5 billion, or 25% of the world\u2019s population in 2050, and thence to around 4.4 billion, or 40% of the world\u2019s population in 2100.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The first time Catarina de Albuquerque made a presentation at World Water Week, people did not like what she had to say. It was 2009, she was just a year into her role as UN special rapporteur on the right to safe drinking water and sanitation, and delegates did not like her suggestion that people should pay for water. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jul/14/water-sanitation-scarcity-population-growth-summary\">13 ways to provide water and sanitation for nine billion people</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey were hoping I was going to say that as water is a human right, it should be free and the private sector should not be involved,\u201d says de Albuquerque. She made her presentation, saying that water should be affordable, and the floor opened for questions. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s when the disaster started,\u201d says de Albuquerque. \u201cI think the NGOs were in shock. They were saying: \u2018How can you say that water can have a price? You cannot sell human rights.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Water can have a price as long as people are not excluded, responded de Albuquerque, and drew parallels with other human rights. There is a right to food, for example, but people will still pay for it in a supermarket. The same goes for health; it\u2019s a recognised human right, but medicines still come with a price. </p> <p>These days, de Albuquerque feels more at ease in the sector. In November 2014, she was appointed executive director of Sanitation and Water for All (SWA), a global partnership working to strengthen political leadership to increase access to water and sanitation. The sector seems to have warmed to her too; earlier this month she <a href=\"http://www.iwa-network.org/press/catarina-de-albuquerque-human-rights-champion-winner-of-the-iwa-global-water-award-2016/\" rel=\"nofollow\">received the Global Water Award</a> at the IWA World Water Congress, in recognition of the role she has played as \u201cthe driving force behind the recognition of the human rights to water and sanitation\u201d.</p> <p>Global water crises are the biggest threat the planet will face over the next decade, according to the World Economic Forum. But the complexity of this problem makes water a particularly knotty issue. On one hand we face rapidly worsening shortages of freshwater \u2013 Nasa satellite data shows that freshwater from <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/16/new-nasa-studies-show-how-the-world-is-running-out-of-water/\" rel=\"nofollow\">21 of the world\u2019s largest 37 aquifers</a> is being withdrawn faster than it can be replenished. On the other, out of a global population of 7 billion, 663 million people still lack access to water and 2.4 billion live without a toilet. The competing demands for finite water resources are so great that in April, a <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/HLPWater\" rel=\"nofollow\">high-level panel of 11 heads of state</a> was convened to help meet the <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg6\" rel=\"nofollow\">sustainable development goal (SDG) on water</a>.</p> <p>The involvement of the private sector, however, still divides water and sanitation professionals. Some see it as a necessary means to bridge the gaps in funding and implementation, while others are concerned that profit-making organisations will exclude the poorest from essential services. </p> <p>In a former life, de Albuquerque was a \u201csimple human rights lawyer\u201d working in her home country of Portugal. When she heard about the role of special rapporteur she simply applied \u201cwith no specific expertise in water and sanitation issues\u201d, and despite being warned against it.<br></p> <p>\u201cFriends of mine at the UN told me: \u2018Oh, don\u2019t apply for the water mandate. It\u2019s new, it\u2019s weak, the right has not even been recognised.\u2019\u201d But de Albuquerque is not one to fear a challenge. \u201cI thought that was even more interesting. I could make the mandate bigger, stronger, richer and ensure that the rights were recognised,\u201d says de Albuquerque. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/gallery/2016/mar/22/world-water-day-global-crisis-13-photographs\">The global water crisis in 13 photographs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When de Albuquerque came to the end of her second and final term as special rapporteur in December 2014, the right had been recognised, she had the biggest budget of all other special rapporteurs \u2013 \u201cI like to ask for money\u201d \u2013 and she was undertaking missions and taking complaints from those whose right had been violated \u2013 something some states objected to when she began.</p> <p>Today, de Albuquerque advocates for the political prioritisation of water, sanitation and hygiene on a global level, and establishes strategic partnerships with other initiatives and sectors. </p> <p>There are 52 country partners of SWA at present, and the nature of democracy means that de Albuquerque\u2019s work is never done. \u201cJust when we manage to convince one set of ministers to prioritise water and sanitation, there are elections \u2013 which is a good thing \u2013 and we have to convince and work with the next ministers. It\u2019s never-ending work, a never-ending story.\u201d </p> <p>Now, at least, there is an end goal in sight. As special rapporteur, de Albuquerque pushed for the inclusion of human rights language in the SDGs, and for a specific goal for water and sanitation. All in all, she is \u201csuper satisfied\u201d when it comes to goal six, which sets a target of ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. </p> <p>She is also pleased that the human right to water and sanitation is one of only two recognised human rights to be mentioned specifically in the 2030 agenda. \u201cThere is one place where the human right can be useful,\u201d she says. \u201cQuality, accessibility, and the elimination of equalities are reflected. Affordability? That\u2019s the problem. Affordability for water is referred to but not affordability for sanitation. My argument is that because we refer to human rights in the declaration, we have to also fight for affordability for sanitation, even though it\u2019s not explicitly mentioned.\u201d </p> <p>The tricky crossroads between the human right to water and sanitation, pricing, and the involvement of businesses seem like something de Albuquerque will be grappling with for the lifetime of the goal. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/sep/19/eight-ideas-to-fund-access-to-water-and-toilets-for-all-by-2030\">Eight ideas to fund access to water and toilets for all by 2030</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWater is life, it\u2019s what we all say. Is it because it\u2019s so essential and so close to us? Is it because of the religious and cultural symbolism around water? Is that why everything around water is so passionate and engages people \u2013 in sometimes irrational ways?\u201d she says. \u201cThere are these misunderstandings around water and the fact that you can put a price on it. I think these were impediments to recognising it as a human right.\u201d</p> <p>But the involvement of the private sector in realising the water goal is something of a no-brainer for de Albuquerque: \u201cFor business, isn\u2019t it better to push for better standards? If the MDGs [millennium development goals] called for a 50% reduction of those without access, and the UN human right and the SDG say \u2018for all\u2019, well then you double the number of clients,\u201d she says. \u201cAre we now at the point where there are zero problems? No, but I think there is a true effort to think about things differently and mainstream human rights.\u201d</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a> of development professionals and humanitarians.

  "<p>Public support for onshore windfarms is far higher than widely believed, according to a new opinion poll, even in rural areas. </p> <p>Wind turbines are also far more popular than fracking or nuclear power, contrasting with the UK government\u2019s decision to block onshore windfarms but back shale gas exploration and new nuclear power plants.</p> <p>The ComRes poll, conducted for climate change charity 10:10, found that 73% of the British public supported onshore windfarms, with just 17% opposed, and the rest not sure. Strong support remained even when only considering the views of those from rural areas, who might live near windfarms: 65% support versus 25% against. </p> <p>However, when people were asked what level of support they thought windfarms had across the country, just one in 10 said it was more than 70%. The average level of support estimated by people was just 42%, far below the true figure. Research for 10:10 conducted by Imperial College London showed that more than two-thirds of newspaper comment and editorial articles in the last five years were negative overall about windfarms. </p> <p>\u201cThe UK public love wind power and they don\u2019t even realise,\u201d said Max Wakefield, at 10:10, which launched its <a href=\"http://1010uk.org/blownaway/\">Blown Away campaign</a> on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s plainly not true onshore wind is unpopular with the UK public. It\u2019s time our politicians caught up. Onshore wind is already the cheapest tool we have to achieve energy independence, keep bills under control and tackle climate change.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/public-attitudes-tracking-survey-wave-17\">government\u2019s own polling</a> has consistently shown that renewable energy has 75-80% public support. But the Conservative victory in 2015, with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2015/results\">37% of the vote</a>, has all but ended onshore windfarm developments, fulfilling a manifesto pledge to do so. </p> <p>The new poll showed even stronger public support for solar energy - 83% for and 8% against - but ministers have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/17/uk-solar-panel-subsidies-slashed-paris-climate-change\">slashed solar subsidies</a>. </p> <p>Fracking was supported by 34% and opposed by 45% in the poll. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/uk-fracking-given-go-ahead-as-lancashire-council-rejection-is-overturned\">Ministers overruled Lancashire council</a> earlier in October to grant permission for shale gas exploration, leading to <a href=\"http://www.theecologist.org/ecologist_partners/2988232/fracking_trumps_climate_change_pollution_health_and_democracy.html\">accusations of double standards</a>, as local communities have the final say over windfarm applications.</p> <p>Nuclear power was supported by 46% in the new poll and opposed by 37%. In September, the prime minister, Theresa May, gave the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-station-gets-go-ahead\">go-ahead for a new heavily subsidised nuclear plant at Hinkley in Somerset</a>. Offshore windfarms, which are supported by ministers, are also popular with the public, with 80% supporting and 10% opposing.</p> <p>The ComRes poll interviewed 2,037 British adults online on 12-13 October 2016 and data were weighted to be representative of all British adults.</p>",

The meeting comes during the 30th anniversary of the commission\u2019s whaling ban, which is estimated to have saved more than 100,000 whales despite Japan, Norway and Iceland killing whales via loopholes.</p> <p>Australia has put forward <a href=\"http://uk.whales.org/sites/default/files/iwc6611_dr_on_improving_the_review_process_for_whaling_under_special_permit.pdf\">a resolution</a> to the conference that would require Japan to get approval from the IWC for its \u201cscientific\u201d quotas. Countries may also formally rebuke Japan for flouting the court ruling.</p> <p>\u201cJapan\u2019s unilateral resumption of its so-called \u2018scientific\u2019 hunt in the Southern Ocean last year is a slap in the face not just for the International Whaling Commission but also for the rule of law, as the international court of justice clearly ruled Japan\u2019s previous Antarctic \u2018research\u2019 programme to be illegal,\u201d said Kitty Block, vice-president of the Humane Society International.<br></p> <p>But Japan will fire back with <a href=\"http://uk.whales.org/sites/default/files/iwc6616_discussion_paper_on_ways_forward_on_stcw.pdf\">its own proposal</a> to allow small-scale hunting of whales in its territorial waters, a plan which it has doggedly pushed for decades despite being <a href=\"http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmars.2016.00121/full\">defeated 17 times at previous IWC meetings</a>. Japanese officials argue such \u201ccoastal whaling\u201d could be done without harming whale stocks.</p> <p>Ghana, Ivory Coast and Guinea have put forward a separate draft resolution calling for whale meat to address food shortages in developing countries, a move which would help Japan, which has stores of frozen whale meat. The sale of whale meat internationally is banned, with a few exceptions. But earlier this week a UK-based wildlife charity, Whale and Dolphin Conservation, <a href=\"http://us.whales.org/news/2016/10/illegal-sale-of-japanese-whale-meat-exposed-by-wdc-on-eve-of-international-whaling-0\">revealed that a Japanese website had been illegally selling whale meat overseas</a>. </p> <p>A plan to create a whale sanctuary is also on the agenda of the whaling conference, though it requires three-quarters of countries voting to support it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/16/japan-opposes-marine-sanctuary-whales-international-whaling-commission\">Japan has previously led opposition to the sanctuary</a> and is expected to be successful at doing so again at the meeting, which runs until 28 October.</p> <p>The UK government is strongly opposed to whaling and the so-called scientific whaling that Japan undertakes, but is not opposed to the exemptions granted for indigenous people for subsistence. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the environment department said: \u201cThe UK has a strong track record in global wildlife conservation and we fully support the existing ban on commercial whaling. We will continue to champion the protection and welfare of whales and other cetaceans, both here and overseas.\u201d<br></p>",

Did you misunderstand what was being offered?<br></p> <p><strong>Leyonhjelm</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He is wrong about that. There are no sunset clauses in most regulations. We look at regulations all the time. I moved to disallow a few of them. <strong>There is no such thing as an automatic sunset clause in regulations.</strong> That is just false. In order to implement the deal that I had with the minister that we negotiated, they had to actually bring in a specific regulation, which they did.</p> </blockquote> <p>Q: You looked at it and thought this was a deal, yes?<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yes, they wanted my vote on a particular amendment to a bill, an unrelated bill. In exchange for that, we agreed that they would implement a sunset clause on the ban on the import of the seven shot lever-action shotgun.</p> </blockquote> <p>Q: What did you say when that deal never materialised that you thought you had?<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That happened in August this year. I had a phone call from <strong>Michael Keenan</strong>, the justice minister who said, \u201cWe are reimposing the import ban on the seven shot lever action.\u201d </p> <p>I said, \u201cYou can\u2019t do that. The sunset clause is about to kick in. \u201cIt was a week before the 12 months was up and it was about to kick in so the ban would be lifted. We did a deal. You are renegotiating on the deal. His answer was, \u201cWe never intended to allow it in anyway.\u201d <strong>In other words, they were intending to do me over.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Q: Has it hardened since what happened this week?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, it has made it a bit more awkward. I am still 50/50. I am prepared to vote against the ABCC. I make no bones about that. I am prepared to vote against it. There are some bad aspects about that bill. Its purpose is admirable.</p> </blockquote> <p>OK that\u2019s it. Let\u2019s crack on. I am @gabriellechan and @mpbowers is just basting himself liberally with a can of Start Ya Bastard.

The flavour of this would change if he put concrete proposals which ensured that the pensioners were better off than they are now, heading for the Pension Protection Fund, that would help.\u201d</p> <p>The debate on Thursday will not automatically lead to a vote among MPs, but will be subject to the speaker\u2019s approval. If MPs do vote to strip Green of his prestigious title, it would be \u201cpersuasive\u201d only. The house\u2019s honours forfeiture committee makes its decisions independently, although the prime minister could make a recommendation.</p> <p>Field and Green <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/18/sir-philip-green-criticises-mps-report-bhs-collapse\">have repeatedly clashed through the course of the parliamentary investigation</a> into the high street retailer.

They are desperate to see a sensible, balanced approach to our future outside the EU. They are increasingly dismayed by the needless turbulence created by a Conservative party that appears \u2013 once again \u2013 more intent on talking to itself rather than serving the long-term interests of the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81b7e36abb72a94855fc6bf0418ecc3caf619000\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81b7e36abb72a94855fc6bf0418ecc3caf619000/0_1111_3520_2110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Clegg joins candidate Liz Leffman campaigning in the Witney byelection.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I would urge any Green, Labour and moderate Conservative voter in Witney to set aside their traditional party loyalties and support Liz Leffman.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Pilston/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Could this carry Liz Leffman across the winning line? Unlikely \u2013 if not wholly impossible, as there is no other candidate from any other party remotely near challenging the Conservatives. Not only would it represent a Lazarus-like resurrection for the Lib Dems, the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen in a generation, it would also require a spectacularly sudden and wholesale collapse of support for the Conservatives. Such sudden abandonment of political parties in government tends only to happen when people are directly feeling the detrimental economic effects of their policies \u2013 that may well happen in the next few years, but at present it is an anticipated fear rather than a lived reality for many people in Witney.</p> <p>But even if such a dramatic upset does not occur today, a strong challenge to Conservative hegemony by the Lib Dems in Witney could nonetheless send a powerful message straight to Theresa May: don\u2019t take your own people for granted, they don\u2019t like the unyielding manner in which you appear to have interpreted the referendum vote; don\u2019t throw the single market baby out with the EU bathwater, the value of people\u2019s jobs and livelihoods cannot be entirely subjugated to the issue of immigration; you may be politically insulated from any meaningful political accountability by a phalanx of aggressive support in the Brexit press, but remember it\u2019s voters not newspaper editors to whom you are ultimately answerable.</p> <p>So I would urge any Green, Labour and moderate Conservative voter in Witney to set aside their traditional party loyalties and support Liz Leffman as the only candidate able to challenge the hard Brexit-supporting Conservative candidate. I realise I may not be the most obvious person to appeal to Labour voters but we all now operate in an entirely altered political environment. The livid anger of the coalition years between Labour and the Lib Dems \u2013 the former condemning every compromise as a betrayal, the latter every denunciation as a denial of economic reality \u2013 has now been supplanted by a huge chasm between openness and introversion where we broadly find ourselves on the same side in favour of openness.</p> <p>British politics is hugely fluid and unpredictable right now. We have a prime minister without a mandate of her own presiding over a hardline Brexit government that is ignoring the deep fractures in a country crying out for more unity, not further division. A vote for Liz Leffman today in Witney could help to tip the balance back to greater reason and moderation.</p>",
  "<p>Talaq, talaq, talaq: for more than a decade Arshiya feared the words like some dark incantation.</p> <p>When she caught her husband talking online to other women, he would snarl at her: \u201cIf you interfere too much in my life, I\u2019ll give you talaq.\u201d</p> <p>Another time she found intimate messages from a lover on his phone. Again, Arshiya says he shouted her down: \u201cYou doubt me?

She need not even be aware.\u201d</p> <p>Now India\u2019s supreme court looks set to declare triple talaq, and another law forcing women who re-marry their husbands to first sleep with another man, unconstitutional. Banning the custom would free up to 90 million Muslim women in the country from a potential trapdoor divorce. </p> <p>But Soman, whose Muslim reform group is fighting the case, wants something even more radical: \u201cTo tell the ulema [Muslim scholars], and the whole world, that ordinary Muslim women are fully capable of reading the Qur\u2019an, understanding the Qur\u2019an, interpreting the Qur\u2019an \u2013 and obtaining justice for themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Arshiya\u2019s husband did finally try to divorce her. She never even heard him say the words. \u201cOne day, suddenly, he told me he had given me talaq. He said, \u2018I gave it to you four days earlier\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI literally begged him,\u201d she says. \u201cI went down on my knees and said, if you want to have affairs, go, just don\u2019t throw me out of the house. Where will I go with my child? I don\u2019t have a steady job \u2013 what will I do?\u201d</p> <p>Because her husband chose an Islamic divorce, rather than one under India\u2019s more progressive secular law, Arshiya was also denied the third of his salary she would be legally due in alimony.</p> <p>The 45-year-old, now working up to 16 hours a day as a teacher in south-west Delhi, is trying to have her husband\u2019s divorce overturned, and pursuing him for the meagre compensation Indian courts have carved out for triple talaq victims.</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t want to get back together. The legal action is about making a point. \u201cI want justice,\u201d she says. \u201cThe question now isn\u2019t money. I was not his servant. I was not his slave, who he kept in the house for 12 years and then threw out.\u201d</p> <p>In Fatima\u2019s case the custom, which scholars trace back to the Qur\u2019an, had a modern twist: she was informed of her divorce by text message.</p> <p>\u201cHe just messaged, talaq, talaq talaq. And then he switched off his phone,\u201d recalls Mohd, her brother-in-law. Fatima said she was too depressed to speak.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/17/priyas-mirror-india-comic-book-superheroine-acid-attacks\">India's comic-book superheroine trains her powers on acid attacks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her husband was already married when they wed in February \u2013 a fact Fatima discovered two weeks after the nuptials.

And if we tried to find him he would tell the police we tried to kidnap him,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t belong to a middle-class family, and he\u2019s financially sound, so for us it was a situation of fear.</p> <p>The friend offered to cut a deal. \u201cPay some money to us and wind it off,\u201d Mohd says. </p> <p>\u201cObviously for us there was no option left. We took 3 lakhs (\u00a33680) as a compensation, and promised we won\u2019t do any defamation of them, or contact their families and friends.\u201d</p> <p>Because he fears that speaking to the Guardian might breach the deal, he asked that neither his, nor his sister-in-law\u2019s last names be published.</p> <p>Soman says cases such as these are unremarkable. A <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B620GpkWZ9-UQmx1T212WHpWelE/view\">national study</a> released last year by her group, the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA), found roughly 1 in 11 Muslim women were survivors of triple talaq \u2013 the vast majority receiving no compensation.</p> <p>Bookish and slight, Soman, 51, speaks in long, elegant paragraphs, that rain criticism on India\u2019s clerics like bombs. \u201cThe reason triple talaq has persisted,\u201d she begins, \u201cis first and foremost because Indian Muslims are poor, socially backward, economically backward and educationally backward.</p> <p>\u201cAs a result, there is a stranglehold by patriarchal elements posing as religious leaders. And they have spread rampant misinformation and misunderstanding.\u201d</p> <p>Under British colonial rule, India\u2019s various religious groups were permitted to organise their own personal affairs, including marriage and divorce. To this day, Indian law says Muslims can be being governed by the shariah, or Islamic jurisprudence.</p> <p>\u201cBut the law doesn\u2019t state the minimum age of marriage, the procedure for divorce, or polygamy, or the guardianship of children,\u201d Soman says. \u201cThe law just says they\u2019ll be governed by sharia. But which sharia? Whose sharia?\u201d</p> <p>Male-dominated groups such as the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) have filled the gap, pushing an interpretation of the Qur\u2019an of which Soman is scathing.</p> <p>\u201cI doubt they\u2019re capable of understanding the Qur\u2019anic values of justice, kindness and wisdom,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The BMMA\u2019s challenge to Muslim divorce laws, and to India\u2019s entire Muslim establishment, is nothing less than this: that she, and any Muslim woman, has as much right to interpret the Qur\u2019an as any cleric or scholar.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Qur\u2019an nowhere has any mention of triple talaq.</p> <footer> <cite>Zakia Soman, activist</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cTriple talaq is totally un-Qur\u2019anic,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Qur\u2019an nowhere has any mention of it. A Muslim marriage is a social contract and the right to divorce is given to both husband and wife.</p> <p>The women\u2019s group has already had one major victory this year: winning a case to overturn a ban on women <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-37193266\">entering the inner sanctum</a> of the 15th century Haji Ali shrine in Mumbai. </p> <p>Now triple talaq is in its sights, after the Indian supreme court announced last year it would measure a raft of Muslim marriage laws against the Indian constitution\u2019s guarantee of gender equality.</p> <p>The AIMPLB, the peak body for Indian Muslims, is bitterly opposed to any change. Its affidavit, filed last month, argued that absent the right of instant divorce, a husband \u201cmay resort to illegal, criminal ways of murdering or burning [his wife] alive\u201d.</p> <p>It has also raised less risible fears of India\u2019s Muslims \u2013 still marginalised, 70 years after Partition \u2013 being subsumed under a wave of Hindu nationalism, which has swelled in the past decades, and is surging under prime minister Narendra Modi.</p> <p>Indeed, one of the reasons triple talaq has remained legal so long is the fear, propounded by Muslim community leaders, that if the government is allowed to tamper with Islamic personal laws, it might one day scrap them completely, \u201cand the majority will swallow you up\u201d, says Seema Mustafa, a Muslim journalist and author.</p> <p>Sure enough, as the supreme court has examined triple talaq these past weeks, members of the ruling Hindu nationalist party have raised the prospect of replacing all religious personal laws with a uniform civil code, which some Muslims fear might be Hindu-inflected, and ride roughshod over their beliefs.<br></p> <p>Soman and the BMMA know this sensitivities well. The group was formed in the embers of the 2002 Gujarat riots, which left 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, dead. They are careful to argue that the alternative to instant divorce should still be Islamic in character: requiring two \u201ctalaqs\u201d, delivered three months apart, and only after negotiation between the couple and their families.</p> <p>Soman is adamant: \u201cThe Qu\u2019ran insists that if and when divorce happens it has to be just and fair to both parties.\u201d</p> <p>It remains to be seen if the supreme court is on her side. But is God? \u201cOf course,\u201d she says, peering hard over her glasses. \u201cGod is on the side of those who work hard, those who are truthful, those who are just, and those who are fair.\u201d</p>",
