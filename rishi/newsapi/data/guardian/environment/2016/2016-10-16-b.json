  "<p> Global technology group Hewlett Packard\u2019s newest cybersecurity employee spent the past two years grilling burgers at McDonald\u2019s. Like many on the autism spectrum, the young man in his 20s possessed an impressive range of IT skills to match or even outshine most university graduates.</p> <p>But unlike the average graduate, he didn\u2019t have the social skills to make it past an interview. This is a common stumbling block for those on the spectrum, according to the psychologist Jay Hobbs from <a href=\"http://au.specialisterne.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Specialisterne</a> \u2013 a non-profit agency finding employment for people with autism.</p> <p>\u201cBeing able to communicate and sell yourself was the barrier for him,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cBut he was absolutely excellent. He\u2019s one of those young men who is self-taught, so he was a very capable guy.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.autismspectrum.org.au/content/what-autism\" rel=\"nofollow\">An estimated 230,000 Australians live with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)</a>, which is defined as a developmental condition that affects the way a person relates to their environment and their interaction with other people. </p> <p>The lifelong condition is well recognised and treated among children, but there is less support for adults with autism. Those on the spectrum describe meeting \u201cthe cliff\u201d after secondary school \u2013 likening the sudden lack of assistance to falling off a cliff. </p> <p>Recent research attests to the lack of support: <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/4428.0Main%20Features62012\" rel=\"nofollow\">the labour force participation rate is about 42%</a>, compared with 53% labour force participation rate for people with disabilities and 83% for people without disabilities.</p> <p>Jeanette Purkis, an author and advocate for the autism community, says many people on the spectrum struggle with job interviews as they often find the sensory experience and social interactions in an interview challenging. \u201cBeing in front of three people who are essentially deciding their future and firing questions they aren\u2019t prepared for off at them is unlikely to enable an autistic person to demonstrate their skills,\u201d she says. </p> <p>\u201cAutistic people often do much better in recruitment processes which enable them to demonstrate their skills over time and not in a high stress situation like an interview,\u201d Purkis adds.</p> <p>Hobbs says it\u2019s an opportunity missed. \u201cWhen I was working as a teacher in Queensland, I met some really interesting people who had some excellent skills, who in some cases after secondary schools just sat at home and wrote on blogs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/08/code-like-a-girl-if-you-can-learn-to-read-music-you-can-learn-to-program\">Code like a girl: if you can learn to read music, you can learn to program</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t able to get opportunities to get a job largely because of the interview process. Someone with autism finds it a bit difficult to communicate and sell themselves as opposed to actually doing what the job would be \u2013 programming or testing software for example.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the tide is turning for unemployed or underemployed people with autism. More companies are ditching the stereotypes of Dustin Hoffman\u2019s Rain Man and Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory, and realising the benefits of employing people on the autism spectrum.</p> <p>Big names include mining company Weir Minerals, cloud computing firm Salesforce, Bankwest and Hewlett Packard. Software multinational SAP has even committed that people with ASD will account for 1% of its global workforce by 2020.</p> <p>The director of human resources at SAP Australia and New Zealand, Lisa Christy, says the goal is consistent with the percentage of people on the spectrum in the general population.</p> <p>\u201cSAP believes that a cornerstone element of innovation is the diversity of those who participate in the creative process and the perspectives they bring to the table, including the perspective of those on the autism spectrum,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The effort to broaden the company\u2019s diversity beyond race or gender started in 2012 when SAP Labs India hired five employees on the spectrum. Successful pilot projects in India and Ireland demonstrated the positive impact of empowering autistic people with a job that played to their strengths.</p> <p>Research points to the clear corporate advantages of hiring autistic staff, including a surge in innovative and creative thinking. </p> <p><a href=\"http://news.curtin.edu.au/media-releases/research-highlights-benefits-employing-people-autism-spectrum/\" rel=\"nofollow\">A study by Curtin University\u2019s school of public health</a> found that the cost of employing an autistic person was comparative with the cost of employing a non-autistic person. The research involved almost 100 employees and 59 employers, who reported benefits from employing staff with ASD, including a high attention to detail and when compared with staff without ASD, a higher work ethic and quality of work.</p> <p>Add to the momentum, comments by the PayPal founder, Peter Thiel, who has long been a proponent of hiring staff with autism and Asperger\u2019s to avoid what he describes as \u201cherd-like thinking and behaviour\u201d. In his book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future-ebook/dp/B00J6YBOFQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero to One</a><em>, </em>Thiel says people with Asperger\u2019s have a single-mindedness that gives startups a unique advantage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/25/the-grattan-institute-is-wrong-we-need-more-science-students-not-fewer\">The Grattan Institute is wrong.

Tan, from Curtin\u2019s autism academy for software quality assurance, oversees a weekend coding club for secondary students aged 12 to 16. The club, like others across Australia focusing on IT and robotics, is where autistic teenagers explore their technical talents while also picking up social skills.</p> <p>Tan\u2019s students typically have high attention to detail and an ability to concentrate on tasks and do repetitive tasks, making them ideal for companies searching for an innovative edge.</p> <p>\u201cThere is anecdotal evidence that people on the spectrum have a huge innovation behind them \u2013 out of the box thinking, a non-traditional way of thinking,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can potentially solve big problems.\u201d</p> <p>But autistic people aren\u2019t limited to the IT industry. Specialisterne has recently launched the Autism and Agriculture employment scheme to develop career paths for those with autism in specialist animal care roles. The organisation is also taking aim at other industries, including art and engineering. It\u2019s the start of a new frontier for people with autism.</p>",
  "<p>Use of some of the strongest antibiotics available to treat life-threatening infections has risen to record levels on European farms, new data shows.</p> <p>The report reinforces concerns about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/20/mrsa-in-pork-farming-leaders-join-calls-for-clampdown-on-illegal-antibiotics-use\">overuse of antibiotics on farms</a>, following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/03/revealed-mrsa-variant-found-in-british-pork-at-asda-and-sainsburys\">revelations from the Guardian</a> of the presence of the superbug MRSA in UK-produced meat, in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/18/what-is-the-superbug-la-mrsa-cc398-and-why-is-it-spreading-on-farms\">imported meat for sale in UK supermarkets</a>, and on British farms.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/regulation/document_listing/document_listing_000302.jsp\">data from the European Medicines Agency</a>, medicines classified as \u201ccritically important in human medicine\u201d by the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs194/en/\">World Health Organisation</a> appear to be in frequent use on farm animals across the major countries of the EU, including the UK.

But this disguises the rise in the use of the strongest medicines, such as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/nov/18/antibiotic-defences-against-serious-diseases-under-threat-experts-warn\">colistin</a>, which is a last resort for life-threatening human illness.</p> <p>The percentage of antibiotics sales made up by the most potent antibiotics remained steady or in some cases increased slightly, indicating an increase in the amount of so-called critically important antibiotics used.</p> <p>For instance, sales of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/apr/30/who-calls-urgent-action-antibiotics-antimicrobial-resistance\">fluoroquinolones</a> \u2013 the newest versions of which are used to treat life-threatening illnesses including pneumonia and Legionnaire\u2019s disease \u2013 stood at 141 tonnes across the countries surveyed in 2013, and rose to 172 tonnes in 2014.

The main reason for the difference is that Spain, like most of Europe, allows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/jun/18/is-it-time-for-antibiotic-free-label-on-our-food\">routine mass medication</a>, whereas the Nordic countries do not. The increased use of last-resort and critically important antibiotics is particularly alarming and confirms that reliance on voluntary and softly-softly approaches is not working.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2015/jun/18/superbugs-la-mrsa-pigs-antibiotics-video\">The Guardian has exposed new evidence</a> of the superbug MRSA present in meat produced in the UK and on sale in UK supermarkets. When present in food, the bug can be killed by cooking, but lapses in hygiene can result in human infection. It can be contracted from infected farm animals, so the finding that UK farms are becoming a reservoir for the disease shows there is a danger of it spreading more widely in Britain.</p> <p>Antibiotic resistance has been called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/19/englands-chief-medical-officer-warns-of-antibiotic-apocalypse\">a threatened \u201capocalypse\u201d</a> by the UK\u2019s chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies. She has warned that in less than two decades operations now regarded as simple, such as hip replacements, could become dangerous to patients because of the risk they could contract untreatable infections. The overuse of antibiotics has been a key factor in the rise of resistant bacteria.</p> <p>The government\u2019s review of the situation, conducted by Lord O\u2019Neill and published last year, found that farms were a potential source of increasing resistance. Germs that acquire immunity to strong antibiotics in animals can spread to humans.</p> <p>Routine use of antibiotics on animals \u2013 which is frequently practised across the world as a method of promoting their growth \u2013 is supposed to be banned within the EU.</p> <p>However, the new data from EMA showed that farmers and vets are over-using strong antibiotics, campaigners told the Guardian. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/19/uk-farmers-to-cut-antibiotic-use-to-combat-drug-resistance\">The O\u2019Neill review advised</a> that the UK and other countries should aim to use no more than 50mg of antibiotic per kilogramme of livestock, but the data shows that the average use across the EU is three times higher at 152mg per kg, according to the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics.</p>",
  "<p> The construction industry faces \u201cinexorable decline\u201d unless radical steps are taken, according to an independent review that urges the government to support the building of rental properties and affordable housing.</p> <p> The government-commissioned review, carried out by the property consultancy boss Mark Farmer, calls for tax incentives and planning breaks to boost the burgeoning build-to-rent sector. A growing number of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/dec/17/renting-build-to-let-boom\">institutional investors and some developers such as Berkeley Homes</a> are building blocks of rental homes. </p> <p>Farmer argues that build-to-rent can play a crucial role in changing the industry, as rental demand is more stable, while traditional housebuilders build homes for sale and are more dependent on the economic cycle. Traditional housebuilders have also been <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/27/taylor-wimpey-housebuilders-reject-claims-hoarding-land-high-property-prices\">accused of hoarding land to maximise profits</a>, but have rejected those claims.</p> <p>The report calls on the government to increase the construction of social and affordable homes by registered providers. It argues that much of this housing can be built more quickly and cheaply using pre-manufactured modules rather than traditional bricks and mortar. </p> <p>Farmer, a 25-year veteran of the industry, believes the UK should take the global lead in producing off-the-shelf components for housing. <br></p> <p>One example is Legal &amp; General\u2019s new factory in Sherburn, Yorkshire, the largest modular housing factory in the world, which will produce homes through automated processes used to make cars and other consumer goods. </p> <p>Another is the drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s \u201cfactory in a box\u201d, which contains multi-coloured components packed in reverse order for quick assembly. It has been developed for emerging markets and cuts the construction time from 12 weeks to four. </p> <p>Farmer said: \u201cIf you buy a new car, you expect it to have been built in a factory to exacting standards, to be delivered on time, to an agreed price and to a predetermined quality. This needs to happen more in construction.\u201d</p> <p>Essential Living, which specialises in private rental homes, is building one of the tallest modular buildings in the UK at Greenwich Creekside Wharf with 249 rental homes (including a quarter at market discount rent). The fully fitted-out factory-made modules will be stacked around a concrete core, which is estimated to reduce the construction period by 25%.</p> <p>To tackle Britain\u2019s worsening housing crisis, the Farmer review calls for the construction of 50,000 pre-manufactured homes a year, on top of 160,000 traditional homes.</p> <p> The report paints a gloomy picture of the construction industry, blighted by low productivity, an ageing workforce, a lack of innovation and collaboration as well as a non-existent research and development culture. Surging costs, driven by a shortage of skilled workers, have stalled numerous housing schemes that have become too expensive to build, such as Galliard Homes\u2019 Capital Homes project in east London.</p> <p>\u201cThe prognosis for the industry, if action is not taken quickly, is that it will become seriously debilitated,\u201d Farmer warns.</p> <p>He highlights the \u201cticking timebomb\u201d posed by a shrinking workforce, which could decline by 20-25% within a decade. More people are leaving than joining the industry each year and Brexit is likely to exacerbate the situation by restricting the inflow of foreign workers.</p> <p>He puts forward an action plan to modernise the industry and boost housebuilding, including a \u201ccarrier bag charge-style\u201d penalty. This envisages levying a tax of 0.5% of a scheme\u2019s construction cost on businesses that commission work that does not support industry innovation and skills development.</p> <p>The report calls for an overhaul of training by reforming the Construction Industry Training Body\u2019s grant funding model; along with a joined-up construction strategy pursued by the government, construction industry and clients. Farmer\u2019s recommendations also include a land value tax for big infrastructure projects.</p> <p>The industry minister, Jesse Norman, said: \u201cThis government is determined to support more housebuilding, more quickly and in the places people want to live. Given the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/06/government-could-buy-developers-unsold-homes-under-2bn-fund\">launch of the \u00a33bn home building fund</a>, Mark Farmer\u2019s important review in this vital sector is very timely. It makes a strong case for change in the industry, identifies areas where it needs to improve, and sets out areas for action. We will now carefully consider his recommendations.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Stanworth, the managing director of Legal &amp; General Capital, the insurer\u2019s main investment division, said:<strong> </strong>\u201cWith such a chronic shortage of homes in the UK \u2026 we sincerely hope that Farmer\u2019s review galvanises the entire sector to invest in innovation and secure its future.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A long-billed, long-legged wader stands on the edge of the mud, waiting for the tide to recede so she can begin to feed.

Like all migrants, she must make a carefully calculated trade off: choosing between the potentially more reliable food supply farther south, set against the dangers of going so far.</p> <p>Different populations of different wader species make different choices \u2013 some staying put, others flying thousands of miles \u2013 which explains why, when I visit a coastline almost anywhere in the world, I come across little flocks of globetrotting birds feeding along the seashore.</p> <p>But this particular godwit\u2019s travels, impressive though they are, pale into insignificance compared with <a href=\"http://nzbirdsonline.org.nz/species/bar-tailed-godwit\">her cousins on the other side of the planet</a>. Back in 2007, another female bar-tailed godwit was fitted with a tracking device in New Zealand, enabling scientists to follow her journey for the first time.</p> <p>What happened next astonished even the most ardent students of bird migration.

But this time she did it non-stop, taking nine days to travel 11,700 kilometres \u2013 more than 7,000 miles \u2013 to her destination. This smashed all previous distance records held by birds, and was also the longest recorded journey without stopping to feed and refuel made by any living creature \u2013 so far, at least. </p> <p>Until this extraordinary discovery, we had always assumed that, like their counterparts here in Europe, Alaskan godwits migrated along the coasts of Asia before island-hopping across the Pacific to New Zealand. Yet this one plucky little bird rewrote the textbooks, making us look at bird migration anew.</p> <p>The godwit on the river Parrett isn\u2019t the only migrant passing through my coastal patch on its way south. A constant stream of low-flying swallows skims the surface of the sea, while <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/whinchat\">whinchats</a> perch on hawthorn bushes and <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/w/wheatear/\">wheatears</a> flit along the shore, momentarily revealing their snow-white rump (the name comes from the Anglo-Saxon for \u201cwhite arse\u201d). </p> <p>This trio are definitely heading south of the Sahara, and while the bar-tailed godwit may join them, she could simply decide to stay put for the winter. Just across the river from here, the tidal lagoons at the new <a href=\"http://www.wwt.org.uk/wetland-centres/steart-marshes/\">Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust nature reserve at Steart</a> are packed with molluscs and crustaceans.

  "<p>If a time traveler from the late 1800s were to visit the present, the one place that she would recognize and, in many cases, feel right at home in, would be academia. Today\u2019s universities and other science institutions are often the sole exception to the percussive pace of change we are now seeing in society and nature. They are, in a word, slow.</p> <p>But that contemplative, reflective pace that defines academia has a growing number of researchers worried that science is too often left sitting at the kids table while decisions are made elsewhere - especially in today\u2019s rapidly changing world. </p> <p>Nowhere is this more true than in the planning for the future of our cities. Over the coming week, tens of thousands of people will spill into Quito, Ecuador, for <a href=\"http://habitat3.org/\">Habitat III</a>, a United Nations Conference that will set the course for the development of cities around the world. At La Casa de la Cultura Ecuatoriana \u201cBenjam\u00edn Carri\u00f3n\u201d in Quito, delegates from nations around the world will vote to approve the <a href=\"..:..:..:private:var:folders:_t:ll8sv5d16lz96hp2k0z88zs00000gn:T:TemporaryItems:Outlook%20Temp:www2.habitat3.org:bitcache:97ced11dcecef85d41f74043195e5472836f6291%3Fvid=588897&amp;disposition=inline&amp;op=view\">New Urban Agenda</a>. It\u2019s a bulging document that details pathways for the growth of cities in the next two decades.</p> <p>Meanwhile, somewhere in the 1.5 acres of exhibition space located almost a half mile from where the leaders are meeting, if you look carefully, you can find a 20-foot by 20-foot space focused on research. There, <a href=\"http://futureearth.org/\">Future Earth</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.icsu.org/\">International Council for Science</a> (ICSU) and <a href=\"http://www.fh-potsdam.de/\">Potsdam University</a> in Germany are <a href=\"http://habitatxchange.org/\">organizing an exhibit space</a> on the science of cities. It\u2019s a bubble of science all but lost in a sea of policy. </p> <p>This observation meshes with what many in the urban research community have been saying for months: Science and diverse fields of urban researchers have played a minimal role in Habitat III. In a <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/scientists-must-have-a-say-in-the-future-of-cities-1.20760\">commentary published this week</a> in the journal <em>Nature</em>, a group of prominent urban researchers write: \u201cOne reason is that the scientific community was unprepared for Habitat III. The few scientists invited to participate accepted a consultative role, nested among other public voices.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not an isolated occurrence, either. Cities use an estimated 70 percent of the world\u2019s energy. But only recently has the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC), perhaps the world\u2019s most well-known body for international science, given special attention to the needs of cities. This year, the IPCC agreed to <a href=\"http://www.c40.org/blog_posts/ipcc-to-give-cities-special-focus\">produce a special report</a> on climate change and cities, due out in 2023 to 2028. Effectively, however, climate scientists have for years been cut off from the leaders who make decisions with huge consequences for climate change: Town mayors, city departments, local non-profit organizations and others.</p> <p>Still, there is momentum building toward a type of science that can keep pace with the speed of change round the world. Researchers with The Luc Hoffmann Institute at the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), for example, have <a href=\"http://luchoffmanninstitute.org/2015/09/using-the-earth-hour-city-challenge-to-identify-high-leverage-points-for-footprint-reduction-in-cities/\">convened a team of diverse experts</a> to comb through mountains of data collected through the <a href=\"http://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/earth-hour-city-challenge\">Earth Hour City Challenge</a> -- a global coalition of cities that are collecting and distributing data on how they are working to respond to climate change. From this work, the team is building a map of how urban areas are tackling climate change and the key points that different cities are using to rapidly shift their carbon footprint. </p> <p>This momentum, and the solutions for global challenges cropping up all over the world, is the focus of a new magazine that Future Earth will launch at Habitat III. The magazine takes its name from the Anthropocene, the word for a new epoch in the geologic history of the planet defined by humanity\u2019s wide-reaching impacts on the planet. <a href=\"http://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/\"><em>Anthropocene: Innovation in the Human Age</em></a> is a magazine focused on innovation and science that is fast, relevant to society and committed to spurring solutions The first issue, which has a special focus on cities, includes stories about driverless cars and the unlikely path that our electronic gadgets take when we throw them out. </p> <p>The speed of change in this new human age -- from the ballooning use of fossil fuels to rising seas and disappearing natural ecosystems -- is at odds with the slow, contemplative nature of science. But <em>Anthropocene</em> magazine will work to merge those two worlds. The publication produces daily digests of sustainability science from around the world, but it will also take time to reflect on the nature of the Anthropocene itself. In this first issue, for example, veteran <em>New York Times </em>science journalist Andrew Revkin reflects on how his own thinking around the Anthropocene has changed over the years.

History of art is a rigorous interdisciplinary subject that gives students the critical skills to deal with a world that is increasingly saturated with images. It brings together visual analysis with history, languages, literature, chemistry, and art and design to name but a few inter-related areas of study and research. Those studying it at university level have a significant impact across the cultural sector, especially in public museums and galleries</p> <p>Art history as a subject needs to be much better known and not denigrated. The Courtauld Institute of Art, the oldest higher education institution in this country dedicated to its study, is deeply committed to increasing understanding and enjoyment of the study of the history of art and to working with others to ensure that it is embedded across the school curriculum and is accessible to all our school students.<br><strong>Professor Deborah Swallow</strong><br><em>Director, Courtauld Institute of Art, London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The decision to abandon art history is lazy, defeatist and a tragedy for our education system. The current A-level syllabus offers teachers the option to \u201cdevelop courses that reflect their own interests, strengths and available resources\u201d, meaning they can focus on almost any artwork from the \u201cwestern world\u201d from a 2,500-year period (including sculpture and architecture); the revised A-level proposed to extend the scope even further by adopting a more global approach towards the discipline. This is simply not practicable. Imagine equipping examiners to mark an English literature A-level where schools were given free rein to select texts from any period without a single work or practitioner being identified in the syllabus.</p> <p>Rather than axing art history A-level altogether, a revised syllabus should be considered, focusing on a limited range of core material and identifying specific practitioners and works. This approach would give candidates a solid foundation in the discipline and enable the board to formulate clear mark schemes to guide examiners.<br><strong>Juliet Learmouth</strong><br><em>Slough</em></p> <p>\u2022 I wonder whether Cambridge University, which offers history of art degrees, would consider it soft? We have been offering it as an A-level at Benenden for many years, and every year a number of students go on to study it at prestigious universities including Cambridge, St Andrews and Glasgow. These students progress to esteemed careers in museums, the art world, business, marketing and advertising. The A-level itself has rigorous and complex content and allows students the chance to evaluate, analyse, synthesise and understand the changing Renaissance, Victorian and modern world through the eyes of some&#xa0;of the greatest cultural icons of western civilisation.</p> <p>We think it is very sad that the A-level has been abandoned at the 11th hour when schools will already have included it in their offering to current Year 11 students. We, like many schools, will now be looking to the [Cambridge] Pre-U as an alternative syllabus, but not all schools will have students able to commit to this as a two-year course, or run two exam systems, and again, it will probably be students in the maintained sector who will lose out. What a shame that what is regarded as an acceptable education has become so narrow and in its focus and loses both its vocational and artistic elements through an anachronistic and erroneously subjective view of what is a \u201csoft\u201d subject.<br><strong>Lesley Tyler</strong><br><em>Deputy head academic, Benenden School, Cranbrook, Kent</em></p> <p>\u2022 If art history is soft so is English literature. Undermining visual analysis in a world where young people are attacked by visual propaganda every day is terribly short sighted.

And what a wise instruction that was. Art illuminates so much of the spirit of every age, and, properly taught, is civilising and life-enhancing. For over 60 years I have taught the subject at school and now at the University of the Third Age in London. Several of my students have written to me years after they had left school to say what a difference to their lives these classes have made, and my classes at the University of the Third Age have had attendances of up to 160 people. So I think it is a tragedy that the history of art A-level is about to disappear. It is of course disappointing that so few schools are offering it and that, as a result, only 839 students sat the exam this summer; but the emphasis should be on encouraging more schools to offer art history, not to close the subject down.<br><strong>Ralph Blumenau</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is a strange argument that says because posh people drink wine, wine must be a posh drink.

  "<p>No amount of spin or legal obfuscation can reconcile the UK government\u2019s clamour for shale gas with its obligations as enshrined in the Paris climate change agreement. Consequently, when the UK\u2019s communities secretary, Sajid Javid, gave the go-ahead for fracking in Lancashire (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/uk-fracking-given-go-ahead-as-lancashire-council-rejection-is-overturned\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 7 October), he was making a clear statement that the government has no interest in abiding by either the spirit or the maths of the Paris agreement.</p> <p>Shale gas is a high carbon energy source. When used for generating electricity its emissions of carbon dioxide are about 30-90 times higher than the full lifecycle emissions of either renewables or nuclear. Given the rapid phase-out of the UK\u2019s existing coal power stations, shale gas will not be produced at sufficient scale and in the necessary timeframe for it to be a substitute for coal.</p> <p>Even assuming that carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies work at scale \u2013 and the UK government recently reneged on its manifesto promise to develop CCS \u2013 the emissions from a shale gas power station with CCS will still be 10 times more than that of genuine low carbon power generation.</p> <p>The Paris agreement\u2019s most ambitious aspiration is to hold the rise in global temperature to no more than 1.5\u00b0C. The global energy-only carbon budget for 1.5\u00b0C is set to be used up in 3-13 years of current global emissions; ie by 2030 at the latest. This would mean a UK shale gas industry having barely five years of meaningful production.

Critics have called it <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/business/media/fenced-in-by-televisions-excess-of-excellence.html?_r=0\">TV\u2019s golden age</a>, but some analysts say \u201cpeak television\u201d is coming to an end.</p> <p>Money is the root of TV\u2019s problems. In the US, where the TV economy is headquartered, TV and internet access costs <a href=\"http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2012/07/10-things-that-are-pricier-in-the-u-s\">two to three times</a> what it does in the UK, and networks are in a tug-of-war with Americans, who are increasingly shredding steep cable bills in favor of Netflix and streaming services. This summer, many networks became locked in <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/biz/news/directv-att-herring-networks-1201727769/\">all-out</a> <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/fox-news-sues-charter-communications-over-carriage-rate-1468949656\">legal battles</a> with cash-strapped cable companies, with multibillion-dollar distribution deals at stake to fund those networks\u2019 huge programming budgets.</p> <p>Executives are planning for a less luxurious future, in which TV shows may be briefer, lower-budget and filled with the kind of product-placement ads that audiences hate and advertisers pay for. Worse still, the company that started much of the trouble may soon confront flaws in its own business model.</p> <p>Netflix reports earnings on Monday. Its problems, and those of companies like it, are more pressing than those of traditional television. At a conference in New York this month, chief executive Reed Hastings was blunt.</p> <p>\u201cDisney, who is very good in China, had their movie service shut down,\u201d he <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-netflix-china-idUSKCN1271PO\">told an audience</a> at the New Yorker Tech Fest. \u201cApple, who is very good in China, had their movie service closed down. It doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d</p> <p>Hastings said his company was seeking to expand in other countries, India in particular. But there\u2019s a reason media businesses seeking vast scale tend to view China as the solution to all their problems: internet penetration in India is rising from 26% <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.USER.P2\">according to the World Bank</a>. In China, it\u2019s rising from 50%.<br></p> <p>Netflix needs the money that increased scale would provide, in part, to pay top dollar for shows such as Arrested Development and Lost. In January, it told investors it owed $10.9bn in TV show licenses alone, with $4.7bn of that due this year. After that, almost the entire balance is due before the end of 2018. </p> <p>Netflix will have to keep buying reruns at what will almost certainly be increasing rates if it wants to retain its users, and the companies selling those shows are now in a tight spot too \u2013 largely thanks to the ad-free Netflix model.</p> <p>At US television networks, budget struggles mean making shows more as UK networks do, except with lots of ads and product placement: shorter lifespans, fewer sets and special effects, fewer episodes per series \u2013 and then little margin for error if shows look like they\u2019re failing early on.</p> <p>Netflix cannot scale back. Its viewers pay for it outright and express their displeasure by canceling subscriptions, not by changing the channel. If anything, its executives are spending more: Baz Luhrmann\u2019s 1970s New York period piece, The Get Down, came with a record price tag for a service that had already driven up the cost of new scripts: $120m for 12 episodes, according to <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/tv/features/the-get-down-netflix-baz-luhrmann-production-troubles-1201822679/\">Variety</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usv442G6H8A\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/usv442G6H8A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The Get Down, a series on Netflix that cost $120m</figcaption> </figure>   <p>All TV companies, not just Netflix, are trying to amortize losses by hawking American wares abroad, but that has proven difficult: US TV shows sell in a lot of places, but they don\u2019t sell everywhere. Like others, Netflix has tried to co-produce shows with local production companies, but outside the UK and Canada cultural hurdles become increasingly important. In 2014 after three years in Japan, network-owned streaming service Hulu <a href=\"http://tv.twcc.com/listings/wcbs-cbs#16-Oct-2016\">simply gave up</a>.</p> <p>Many are skeptical: analyst firm Macquarie Capital <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/news/netflix-downgraded-macquarie-capital-nflx-amzn/\">downgraded Netflix shares</a> to \u201csell\u201d in September.<br></p> <p>Though consumers believe it should only cost $8 a month to watch a network that airs a choice selection of history\u2019s great TV show, on top of eye-poppingly expensive originals, all may not be lost, said Brian Wieser, formerly a head forecaster for ad agency Magna Global and now head of research at Pivotal.</p> <p>\u201cThe suggestion that [TV] actually peaks implies that every network group acts with complete rationality,\u201d Wieser said. \u201cI think networks will heavily invest in content because it\u2019s an arms race.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/24/netflix-us-television-investors-revenue-streaming-service\">Netflix and thrill: TV industry braced for rollercoaster ride</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An under-acknowledged truth in the television industry is that the only way to produce a new TV show on cable is to run an old TV show.</p> <p>Networks may brag about their latest critically acclaimed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/11/bbc3-fleabag-louie-girls-transparent-master-of-none-sadcom\">sadcoms</a>, but the bulk of ads sold on a 24/7 TV network will not be delivered in the early evening when those shows run. They\u2019ll be shown on reruns of Law &amp; Order, The Big Bang Theory, Family Guy and a rotating selection of action movies that fill 21 of most network\u2019s hours, just as networks run cheap-to-produce talk shows and soap operas. Picking the right comfort-food show to snag channel-surfers is a matter of careful strategy.</p> <p>Netflix likes to tell the industry that its innovation is selling TV over the internet, but it might be closer to the truth to say that it was first to see $10bn in unglamorous syndicated reruns.</p> <p>And that\u2019s the hardest truth of the streaming economy: the bulk of Netflix\u2019s billions don\u2019t go into expensive originals like Luke Cage and Stranger Things. They go into buying old-fashioned shows such as Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Buffy the Vampire Slayer in bulk. The creative system capable of producing those shows required 10 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df73k4LDcmA\">Bad Judges</a> and at least one <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLm5Sn1cMyQ\">Cop Rock</a> apiece.</p> <p>Easy access to such shows \u2013 first during the DVD boom, then on streaming \u2013 has bitten deeply into the support system that made them. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way you can look at linear [American] TV as a growth opportunity right now,\u201d said one senior executive at a prominent television company.</p> <p>TV ads are sold by guaranteed numbers of viewers, which makes for one of the industry\u2019s catch-22s: the fewer people who watch, the more the advertiser is asked to pay per person. At a certain point, the executive said, advertisers get fed up with the shrinking audience.</p> <p>The decline also poses a problem when a programmer has to outbid Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime for a hot script, because there\u2019s not as much money to go around. The growth of ad prices, the executive said, \u201chas not paced with the cost of original content\u201d.</p> <p>Still, the executive said, there are ways to get around people who won\u2019t pay for content \u2013 they\u2019re just ways consumers may not be thrilled about.</p> <p>\u201cThe model of the future is wherever your content premieres, you take your advertisers with it,\u201d the executive said. \u201cIt\u2019s taking television creatives and asking them to think commercially, too. The successful executives are going to be the ones who can do both.</p> <p>\u201cYou need producers and writers who can ask, \u2018What\u2019s a natural way for my audience to bring these products in?\u2019\u201d</p>",

The high-speed rail line HS2 is probably the next most controversial project, closely followed by London Crossrail, any large housing development almost anywhere, and the recent government decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/uk-fracking-given-go-ahead-as-lancashire-council-rejection-is-overturned\" title=\"\">permit fracking at a site in Lancashire</a>.</p> <p>With the prime minister reportedly keen to exploit today\u2019s ultra-low interest rates to improve the country\u2019s lagging infrastructure, the number of such disputes, and the attendant cost, is likely to soar. At least part of a solution, however, was recently heralded by Theresa May.</p> <p>The last government broached the creation of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/06/fracking-local-people-payments-theresa-may\" title=\"\">shale wealth fund</a> to temper public hostility to fracking; this would distribute 10% of all shale gas tax revenue to the communities affected. May\u2019s crucial tweak was to propose the money be given directly to householders, rather than added to council coffers. This would give residents a direct financial stake in a development likely to cause them grief, even as it promised benefits to others \u2013 cheaper energy prices, say, from shale gas.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Allowing residents a cut of the tax revenue might not actually tip the balance of opinion</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Allowing residents a cut of the tax revenue might not actually tip the balance of opinion. A <a href=\"https://www.foe.co.uk/resource/press_releases/only-1/3-public-support-fracking-despite-cash-payments-yougov_15082016\" title=\"\">YouGov survey</a> found that a majority would still oppose fracking even if households were paid \u2013 and the sums, it has been emphasised, would not be large. But some payment, however small, could help even up the advantage just a little.</p> <p>A very British response to the idea has been that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/07/fracking-bribe-public-accept-greenpeace-labour-cash\" title=\"\">direct payments would be tantamount to bribery</a>. But direct payments seem to me preferable to a contribution that gets dissipated in council budgets, or to nothing at all.</p> <p>Indeed, I would argue that the same principle should be extended to those adversely affected by all large commercial and infrastructure projects. This could reduce objections \u2013 including to much-needed new housing \u2013 but it would also enshrine in statute the recognition that there is a quality-of-life cost to major works and that this should be priced in at the start.</p> <p>Charges of \u201cbribery\u201d have been made before. When developers of a big London site recently offered payments to affected residents, they were denounced for trying to rig the planning process. With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/17/truth-property-developers-builders-exploit-planning-cities\" title=\"\">councils not unamenable to incentives</a>, however, the alternative is often not a better development, but some recompense for long-suffering residents as opposed to none.</p> <p>I admit to a personal interest here. For the best part of four years the peace of our particularly quiet London flat was destroyed by the demolition and commercial redevelopment of a large government building next door. There was no compensation, not even a discount on council tax, and councils have no real interest in pursuing breaches of noise and other regulations because of the time and cost.</p> <p>If compensation for disruption were levied upfront and fines for subsequent breaches had to be paid direct to affected neighbours (as for late trains), developers might not be more compliant, but they would have \u2013 slightly \u2013 happier neighbours. Far from being bribery, this would be an acknowledgement that quality of life is worth something.</p>",

  "<p>When Delia Davin, the pioneer of Chinese women\u2019s studies, arrived in Beijing in 1963, aged 19, there were still camels carrying coal and wooden ploughs in the fields outside the city. Davin, who has died of cancer aged 72, quickly established a rapport with her students at the Beijing Broadcasting Institute, whom she found to be \u201cvery serious about their work, but [to] have a gaiety which saves them from being priggish\u201d. She taught them Irish songs as well as English grammar, and one of them recited \u201cShall I compare thee to a summer\u2019s day\u201d to console her, the student said, for not being in England on Shakespeare\u2019s birthday.</p> <p>This early experience of contact with ordinary young Chinese (many came from working-class backgrounds, one had been a soldier in the Korean war), at a time of relative freedom before the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), gave Davin an intuitive understanding of the Chinese that would enrich her long academic career and set her apart from many of her colleagues. Davin\u2019s Letters from Peking (1967), written during this first visit, already showed a mature sensitivity for the contradictions of revolutionary China.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t help wishing the Chinese weren\u2019t quite so disciplined, didn\u2019t carry morality to the point of smugness,\u201d she wrote home, \u201cyet when I meet a Chinese who lacks these qualities I often find I don\u2019t like him.\u201d</p> <p>Davin had grown up in a literary Oxford family. Her father, Dan Davin, a writer and publisher, worked for the Clarendon Press and drank in the Lamb and Flag with the biographer and critic Enid Starkie, the poet Louis MacNeice and other literary friends. Davin would remember the novelist Joyce Cary as \u201cthe beloved grown-up of my childhood\u201d. Both her father and her mother, Winnie (nee Gonley), an editor for OUP, came from New Zealand, but there was a strong sense of the family\u2019s Irish background. Delia attended Irish-speaking summer schools in Donegal; in China she would compare the building of haystacks in Zhejiang province to those in the Irish countryside.</p> <p>Delia left school at 15 without any O-levels, but had completed her A-levels through evening classes before going to China in 1963 with her first husband, the sinologist Bill Jenner, and after two years in Beijing she returned home to gain a first-class degree in Chinese Studies at Leeds University. In 1975, she returned to Beijing, now a single mother with a five-year-old child, to spend a year translating Chinese into English at the Foreign Languages Press (FLP). It was the tail-end of the Cultural Revolution, as the struggle for the succession to Mao Zedong developed during his last year of life. In January 1976 she stood in the silent crowd which mourned the death of the premier Zhou Enlai, an unauthorised demonstration against the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/07/china.jonathanwatts\" title=\"Gang of Four\">Gang of Four</a>, led by Madame Mao, who were seeking to seize power.</p> <p>She found Beijing \u201cquiet and rather dreary\u201d compared with 10 years before: upkeep on buildings had been neglected and everything looked shabby. But she deepened her friendship with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/nov/24/guardianobituaries\" title=\"Gladys Yang obituary\">Gladys Yang</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/23/yang-xianyi-obituary\" title=\"Yang Xianyi obituary\">Yang Xianyi</a>, the brilliant, married, translator team who had both been jailed in the Cultural Revolution, and had arranged her job at the FLP. Their household, she would write, was \u201can oasis of learning, entertaining talk and real engagement with politics in what was then an intellectually repressed society\u201d.</p> <p>Returning again to Britain, Davin published Woman-Work: Women and the Party in Revolutionary China (1976), a path-breaking study of women and the Communist party in revolutionary China, the first of many writings that went far beyond the stereotypes offered both by the communist regime and its critics. She would consistently probe the key tensions in the role of modern Chinese women \u2013 tensions between a new \u201csocialist\u201d emphasis on women\u2019s participation in economic and political life and a relatively unchallenged structure of gender and generational relationships in the family.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f6777781cae61ac27612352edcf08a4bc1d5232\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f6777781cae61ac27612352edcf08a4bc1d5232/2_0_1268_1584/801.jpg\" alt=\"Delia Davin bridged the divide between traditional sinology and social studies\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Delia Davin bridged the divide between traditional sinology and social studies</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the one-child policy, routinely criticised in the west as violating women\u2019s freedom to choose, Davin argued instead that reproduction in China had never been a matter of free choice for women, particularly in the countryside, where women were frequently coerced into having children as an obligation to their marital families. In an important later study, Internal Migration in Contemporary China (1999), she highlighted the ambiguous benefits of increased mobility for Chinese women. \u201cWorking extremely long hours in terrible conditions in China\u2019s new industries,\u201d she noted, should not be idealised \u201cas a liberating process.\u201d</p> <p>Throughout her career Davin bridged the divide between traditional sinology and the social sciences, and her work intersected with the international women\u2019s movement \u2013 she published extensively in collections that addressed women\u2019s issues across Asia and Africa,</p> <p>After lecturing at York University, where she helped found the <a href=\"https://www.york.ac.uk/inst/cws/\" title=\"Centre for Womens Studies\">Centre for Women\u2019s Studies</a>, she moved to the department of East Asian Studies at Leeds, serving as its head from 1997 to 2001. Colleagues remember her as an all-round academic whose teaching was immaculate in every area from Chinese documentary texts to current issues, and who took immense pains with students of all levels. Retiring in 2004, she became emeritus professor of Chinese and continued her research and writing. Her brief biography Mao (2013), in the OUP Very Short Introduction series, rejected current appraisals of Mao as no more than \u201ca Chinese Stalin with a taste for killing\u201d, while recognising that his flawed and contradictory character brought great harm to China after the communist revolution of 1949 and creation of the People\u2019s Republic of China.</p> <p>In Davin\u2019s last piece of writing, her introduction to Daughter of Good Fortune: A Twentieth-Century Chinese Peasant Memoir (2015), she returned to the theme that had always been central for her work \u2013 the complexity of change in rural Chinese society. The subject of the memoir, Chen Huiqin, had worked on the land most of her life, living in a house without running water. Now her home had air-conditioning and she could have video-chats with her grandchild living abroad. How long, Davin wondered, would the balance last between traditional and modern values?</p> <p>In 1996 Davin met Owen Wells, a probation officer, through Guardian Soulmates, and they married a year later. He survives her, as do her children, Lucy, Gareth and Sian, and her stepchildren, Jeremy, Hannah and Miriam.</p> <p>\u2022 Delia Davin, China scholar, born 9 June 1944; died 13 October 2016</p>",

  "<p>My friend Angela Sinclair-Loutit, who has died aged 95, was a colourful figure in leftwing circles in London. Into old age she could be found demonstrating against the closure of hospital services, at the Socialist Film Club, sorting out book sales for the <a href=\"http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/\">Morning Star</a>, marching against Trident or demonstrating at armaments fairs.</p> <p>Bird-thin with spiky hair, she always had a twinkle in her eyes. She wore secondhand clothes from charity shops and was proud of it. She was often hunched over her computer until 3am, smoking and writing articles or letters of protest, occasionally sipping a glass of wine. Calling herself an \u201caggressive pacifist\u201d, she was a long-time member both of CND and of the Labour party, and was a friend of her local MP, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Jeremy Corbyn</a>.</p> <p>The stubborn woman I knew in her 80s and 90s had a more glamorous background than I could have imagined. Born in Kensington, London, to Edward de Renzy-Martin, a lieutenant colonel in the army, and his wife, Winifred (nee Hull), Angela was raised in Hampshire, and after attending Downe House boarding school near Newbury, Berkshire, was among one of the early intakes of women students at Oxford University.</p> <p>Already a determined pacifist, she became a conscientious objector when the second world war broke out and left university to sign up with the <a href=\"https://quakerstrongrooms.org/2014/05/22/library-resources-for-researching-world-war-i-friends-ambulance-unit/\">Friends Ambulance Unit</a>, with which she helped to reunite dispersed families, trained as a nurse under Edwina Mountbatten and volunteered to work with Slav refugees in camps in Egypt, where she taught herself Serbo-Croat. She then drove a truck, which she had learned to service herself, through Yugoslavia, delivering medical equipment.</p> <p>In Egypt she met Kenneth Sinclair-Loutit, a doctor. They married in 1946 and after the war moved to London, where Kenneth set up the Finsbury health centre. Thereafter, as Kenneth took on jobs of increasing importance with the World Health Organisation and as an adviser to Unicef, they lived in Canada, France, Thailand and Morocco, all of which contributed to consolidating Angela\u2019s great free spirit, full of empathy for the different peoples of the world. During this time of peregrinations, she did voluntary work as well as raising her children, and in Morocco ran nursing services and first aid from home.</p> <p>In 1972 she returned to London with their three teenaged children, but Kenneth decided not to return. Angela trained as a psychiatric social worker and settled in Islington, north London, where, in retirement, she wrote for the Islington Gazette and the socialist newspaper Tribune, was secretary of the <a href=\"http://www.islingtonpensionersforum.co.uk/\">Islington Pensioners Forum</a>, and campaigned against closure of the local <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/29/whittington-hospital-closure-halted\">Whittington hospital A&amp;E department</a>. She was also part of a team of activists that helped to save <a href=\"http://www.islingtongazette.co.uk/news/environment/gillespie_park_campaigners_score_highbury_victory_1_808606\">Gillespie Park</a> in Highbury.</p> <p>In her 90s she became progressively more deaf and found it difficult to accept the infirmities of old age, although a procession of grandchildren, young relatives and friends paraded through her house to provide her with help and stimulation. Angela was bright and incisive to the end, up to date with world affairs and political developments. For each of us she had an ear, genuine interest in our lives, and a wry comment or two.</p> <p>She is survived by her children, David, Stephan and Jessica, and by seven grandchildren.</p>",
  "<p>By the time the final whistle blew, the morning\u2019s clouds and rain had cleared to leave the splendour of the Cleveland Hills clearly visible from the main stand. The only problem for Aitor Karanka was that the sun elected to shine on Watford rather than his increasingly struggling side, with Jos\u00e9 Holebas\u2019s glorious winning goal highlighting Middlesbrough\u2019s mounting problems.</p> <p>With \u00c1lvaro Negredo and Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez once again letting themselves down, Karanka\u2019s horizon darkened appreciably as Boro rarely looked like curtailing a plummet down the table during which they have collected two points from six games and lost four of the past five.

With that style we have a good chance. We have to keep going. It\u2019s just October so we have a long time to go.\u201d</p> <p>Mazzarri affected to be taken aback by the time-wasting accusations. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he refers to,\u201d he said. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d The Italian then reminded everyone that Boro\u2019s Antonio Barrag\u00e1n should have been sent off for a second yellow-card offence in the first half. \u201cWe all know the rules and it was very evident. But I don\u2019t comment on referees.\u201d</p> <p>Without a ball being kicked, the team-sheets alone created a measure of controversy. While Mazzarri preferred Isaac Success\u2019s attacking potential to that of Odion Ighalo, Karanka recalled Negredo and Ram\u00edrez, leaving Jordan Rhodes and Viktor Fischer warming the bench.</p> <p>When Youn\u00e8s Kaboul \u2013 operating on the right of Watford\u2019s back three \u2013 swiftly turned slapdash and conceded possession the former pair had a chance to show Boro fans what they were really capable of but, after exchanging passes with Negredo, Ram\u00edrez dragged a scuffed shot wide.</p> <p>Watford initially looked vulnerable but Boro\u2019s problem was that Ram\u00edrez \u2013 deployed in the No10 position behind Negredo that is so key to Karanka\u2019s configuration \u2013 seemed to have developed an unfortunate penchant for persistently picking the wrong pass. Even when he took a corner, the Uruguayan Ram\u00edrez overhit it, leaving the ball sailing out of play. Negredo was similarly off key but, in mitigation, that pair were hardly helped by Marten de Roon\u2019s lack of control in a midfield anchoring role.</p> <p>Seeking a lucky break, Boro appealed for a handball penalty against Nordin Amrabat but, correctly, Roger East, the referee, refused to buy it and boos rang around a stadium studded with empty red seats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/16/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-barcelona-future-champions-league-barca\">Pep Guardiola builds on Bar\u00e7a past towards future at Manchester City | Sid Lowe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The stay-aways quite possibly called it right. Although Watford improved as their formation gradually morphed from 3-4-3 to a defensive 5-4-1, the general standard was poor with far too many miscued passes and suspect first touches.</p> <p>If Karanka had reason to be content with Calum Chambers\u2019 and Ben Gibson\u2019s containment of Troy Deeney, Boro\u2019s manager must have been relieved that Barrag\u00e1n was not dismissed after committing that second bookable offence.</p> <p>Already handed a yellow card for hauling down Success, the right-back was fortunate to escape a second for pulling back the same player 10 minutes later.</p> <p>It seemed one of those afternoons when there would be more bookings than shots on target but Watford emphasised their efficiency by scoring with their first. Pouncing on a Boro clearance, Holebas took a steadying touch, before unleashing an elegant yet vicious 25-yard left-foot shot which defied the stretching V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s en&#xa0;route to the top corner.</p> <p>After that it was all about Boro\u2019s lack of a Plan B and Watford\u2019s Italianesque determination to hold on to the win.</p> <p>Perhaps fortunately for Karanka, local anger was directed towards East. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some shit refs but you are the worst,\u201d they chorused after Holebas tripped Chambers on the edge of the area and no penalty was awarded. Replays showed the contact came fractionally outside the box.</p> <p>Indeed, the referee was the wrong target; arguably East\u2019s only key mistake was not handing Barrag\u00e1n a red card for that second bookable offence and, wisely, Karanka refrained from criticising him. Right now a manager who surely delayed too long in liberating Rhodes from the bench has bigger things to worry about.</p>",

  "<p>The future of the nuclear industry may happen somewhere on scenic but relatively isolated land that\u2019s about 100 miles southwest of Yellowstone National Park. Amid the 890-square-mile Idaho National Laboratory campus, a plan is in motion to build a type of nuclear reactor unlike any that\u2019s currently in use to produce electricity. </p> <p>The plan belongs to<a href=\"http://www.uamps.com/index.php/about-uamps\"> Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems</a>, a consortium of 45 municipal agencies looking to replace their aging coal-fired plants. It won approval from the US Department of Energy earlier this year to scope out a site at the lab to analyze the environmental and safety impacts of what\u2019s called the small nuclear reactor. If all goes well, the consortium plans to build a power plant there with 12 reactors totalling 600 megawatts in capacity. </p> <p>The analysis is crucial for determining whether there\u2019s a strong business case for building small nuclear reactors. The emerging technology is meant to create cheaper and safer nuclear power plants. Nuclear power plants emit no emissions, but existing designs have become too costly to be a popular solution for climate change. The new technology has gotten significant funding from investors such as Bill Gates.</p> <p>The Utah group isn\u2019t alone in investing in the new technology. In May, the Tennessee Valley Authority, which supplies power to nine million people in seven southeastern states, became the<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601426/small-modular-nuclear-plants-get-their-first-chance-in-the-us/\"> first utility to apply for a permit</a> from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to build a small nuclear reactor.</p> <p>The name of the technology gives a good clue to its distinguishing characteristics. Unlike other nuclear reactors that usually produce about 1,000 megawatts of carbon-free electricity, the <a href=\"https://www.iaea.org/NuclearPower/SMR/\">small modular reactors</a>, like the ones Utah is planning, are designed to be a fraction of the size at 50 to 300 megawatts. Rather than using electrically operated pumps and motors to circulate coolant and keep the core of the nuclear reactor at a low temperature, as happens in traditional plants, small reactors use no pumps and motors and instead rely on passive means such as gravity and conduction \u00ad\u00adto cool the reactors. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"939338f56b983fbef4d31863258f09fd67e45462\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/939338f56b983fbef4d31863258f09fd67e45462/0_0_960_720/500.jpg\" alt=\"A comparison of small nuclear reactors (left) with a traditional reactor at a nuclear power plant.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A comparison of small nuclear reactors (left) with a traditional reactor at a nuclear power plant today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: NuScale Power</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The compact size and other new improvements, including the ability to assemble all the components in a factory rather than on a project site, in theory make the small modular reactors much cheaper to build than traditional nuclear power plants that cost about<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/12/carbon-free-plants-nuclear-energy-future-power-state-sources\"> $10bn and take a decade</a> to secure permits and build. At a time when many existing nuclear power plants are struggling financially from competition from low natural gas prices and subsidized wind and solar projects, the nuclear industry sees hope in this next-generation technology.</p> <p>\u201cFrom an investment standpoint, this makes it easier to do because you don\u2019t have to put all the money up front; you can stagger when you build them,\u201d said Gene Grecheck, a former president and the current co-chair of a policy advisory committee at the American Nuclear Society, which represents engineers and scientists. Grecheck said scientists are studying other ways to improve nuclear technology.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/12/carbon-free-plants-nuclear-energy-future-power-state-sources\">Can our need for a carbon-free future override our fears of nuclear energy?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere is also a lot of research going on for advanced reactor concepts to take used fuel and reprocess it to reduce [the spent fuel] even more dramatically,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Startup companies working on using spent uranium fuel include the Bill Gates-backed TerraPoweras well as Transatomic and Terrestrial Energy. Another start up, Oklo, seeks to create 2-megawatt reactors that fit inside shipping containers to provide electricity for remote off-grid locations. </p> <p>Many small nuclear reactor companies have yet to line up customers. One exception is Oregon-based NuScale Power, whose technology has been tapped for the project by the Utah consortium in Idaho.</p> <p>NuScale plans to apply for certification from the US Nuclear Regulatory Agency later this year, a step that all nuclear engineering firms must take before their designs can be used to build power plants. The company expects the agency to approve the design by 2020 if the permit process goes smoothly, said Mike McGough, NuScale\u2019s chief commercial officer.</p> <p>McGough said NuScale has currently spent \u201ca little over\u201d $30m on testing ahead of its NRC submission, and if the design is approved, the company expects construction costs to be less than $3bn for the first 12 modules.</p> <p>Comparatively, the Southern Company\u2019s 2,200-megawatt<a href=\"https://www.georgiapower.com/about-energy/energy-sources/nuclear/vogtle.cshtml\"> Vogtle Power Plant</a>, being built in Georgia, is expected to cost $8bn just for its roughly 46% share in the project.</p> <p>Even if the small reactor remains within estimated costs, it will be pricey, at least initially, next to subsidized wind and solar. The US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy\">Energy</a> Information Administration estimates the cost of constructing and operating power plants averages $50.90 per megawatt hour for wind and $58.20 per megawatt hour for solar. NuScale estimates the same type of cost for the first batch of small modules will be about $101 per megawatt hour. Like solar and wind, McGough said he expected the prices would decrease over time as more utilities build small nuclear reactors. The Utah consortium is pegging the cost at $85 per megawatt hour, a lower estimate because city governments can borrow money at cheaper rates, Webb said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/31/california-wind-farm-energy-trident\">Can America's first floating wind farm shake off environmental concerns?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Utah consortium, like power companies across the country, is under increasing pressure from state and federal regulations such as the Clean Power Plan to cut its emissions.

NuScale\u2019s design is much more appealing. \u201cThat way we buy based on what our needs were, which makes a lot of sense,\u201d he said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Plus, Webb said, the small reactor design eases the challenge of using nuclear power to complement the group\u2019s intermittent renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. Current nuclear plants are designed to produce electricity without interruption; adjusting the levels of energy output quickly in response to any sudden increase or drop of renewable energy generation is difficult to do. Small reactors can operate independently, allowing a plant to vary its output more dynamically, McGough said. </p> <p>The Utah consortium will hire Washington state-based Energy Northwest to operate and maintain its 12 reactors in Idaho if they are built. The Utah group expects the project to come online by 2024.</p> <p>The initial high prices mean these tiny nuclear reactors will likely be built in the near future in states that allow utility monopolies, such as California, Utah and Washington. Utilities in those states need to win state approval for charging customers higher rates to pay for the new power plants, but they don\u2019t have to worry about competition.</p> <p>Mike Pasqualetti, senior sustainability scientist at Arizona State University\u2019s School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning, isn\u2019t convinced the world needs this technology. These new plants may be cheaper to build in theory than conventional nuclear projects, but it delays the transition to a more sustainable future in which 100% of the US\u2019 electricity needs come from renewable sources and energy storage, he said.</p> <p>\u201cSmall scale nuclear has advantages to it, but there\u2019s still waste. Are they safer? Probably. Are they cheaper to build? Probably. Do we have any experience doing it? Not really,\u201d Pasqualetti said.</p> <p>While active research is in place to reduce the complexity of building and operating nuclear power plants, there\u2019s a long way to go in making this source of energy an important solution for fighting climate change, said Dan Bakal, head of the electricity power research organization Ceres, a nonprofit sustainability advocacy group.</p> <p>\u201cIf we get to a breakthrough there, that could lead to [new plant construction]. Right now I wouldn\u2019t be betting a lot on that,\u201d Bakal said.</p>",

The result may be uneven but the piece is bold, playful and scorchingly ambitious.</p> <p>Spanning more than 150 years, Hickson\u2019s play focuses on a woman called May who travels effortlessly through time. We first see her as a 19th-century Cornish farmer\u2019s wife for whom the newly invented kerosene lamp becomes a source of personal illumination. Later, we see May working as a servant in 1908 Tehran, at a time when the British are desperate to exploit Persia\u2019s natural resources. By 1970, she has risen to become CEO of an international oil company threatened by Libya\u2019s proposal to nationalise its assets. But, as May rises in the world, difficulties with her daughter, Amy, intensify and become deeply problematic as they head into a nightmarish future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7a12ae559923f7a5f8efb7f6e1440746f87957b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7a12ae559923f7a5f8efb7f6e1440746f87957b/0_142_4252_2552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yolanda Kettle as Amy and Anne-Marie Duff as her mother, May, in Oil at the Almeida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018One of the best theatrical mother-daughter relationships of recent years\u2019 \u2026 Yolanda Kettle as Amy and Anne-Marie Duff as her mother, May, in Oil at the Almeida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard H Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hickson suspends the normal rules of realism to pursue big ideas. One is that there is a parallel between the imperialist instinct of countries and corporations and that of parents. This is most vivid in the scene where May, on one crisis-ridden evening, simultaneously seeks to retain control of her company\u2019s Libyan oil wells and of her teenage daughter\u2019s love life. But Hickson is equally fascinated by the price that has to be paid for living through a century and a half of accelerating progress: in particular, she shows the career-driven, uncompromising May becoming habituated to loneliness and to a sense of estrangement from the activist Amy who, as her three-letter name implies, represents her other self.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/oct/11/anne-marie-duff-i-was-just-so-bloody-minded\">Anne-Marie Duff: \u2018I was just so bloody-minded...\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hickson strives too hard for cyclical neatness. The level of the writing also varies from one scene to another. But she has created a remarkable play that, aside from an opening scene that is as impenetrably dark as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/jun/28/brexit-cultural-heritage-art-georges-de-la-tour\">Georges de la Tour painting</a>, is very well directed by Carrie Cracknell and contains one of the best theatrical mother-daughter relationships of recent years. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/oct/11/anne-marie-duff-i-was-just-so-bloody-minded\">Anne-Marie Duff</a> excellently catches all May\u2019s contradictions: her sensuousness and solitude, her curiosity and curmudgeonliness and the oppressive nature of her maternal love. Above all, Duff, with her taut, expressive features, is very good at suggesting hardship overcome. When May says: \u201cThere is still blood on my hands from hauling myself up, from clinging on,\u201d Duff makes you believe every word.</p> <p>Yolanda Kettle is equally good as daughter Amy: defiant, angry, passionate about the environment, yet imbued with a faint touch of self-righteous certainty. The men are less multi-dimensional, but there is good work from Tom Mothersdale as May\u2019s abandoned husband, Patrick Kennedy as her regimental pursuer and Nabil Elouahabi as a Libyan emissary.

Is growth too dependent on consumer spending and asset price bubbles? Is the productive base of the economy too small? Is it a problem that the UK is running a <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments\">balance of payments deficit </a>worth 6% of GDP, bigger than ever before in peacetime?</p> <p>If your answer to these four questions is yes \u2013 as it should be \u2013 then you need to accept that there is an upside to the falling pound. Indeed, many of those who are now talking about a sterling crisis were last year bemoaning the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/debt-crisis\">Greece </a>\u2013 trapped as it was inside the eurozone \u2013 did not have the benefit of a floating currency and so had to use a brutal internal devaluation involving wage cuts, pension reductions and welfare retrenchment to restore its competitiveness.</p> <p>There have been four big movements in the pound in the past 25 years: a big decline after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/black-wednesday-20-years-pound-erm\">Black Wednesday in 1992</a>, a gradual but sustained increase in the late 1990s and early 2000s, a sharp fall during the financial crash and subsequent recession of 2007-09, and the drop <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/11/pound-completes-worst-four-day-performance-since-brexit-vote\">since 23 June</a>.</p> <p>A good argument could be made for the rise in the late 1990s and early 2000s being the most damaging of the lot. This was the currency movement that hollowed out a large chunk of manufacturing, costing 1 million jobs. This was the period when the strength of the pound attracted hot money flows into London, increasing the size and power of the financial sector. These years saw the widening of the current account deficit and the tendency for consumers to extract spending power from the rising value of their homes.<br></p> <p>The depreciation that followed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/black-wednesday-bad-day-conservatives\">Black Wednesday</a> was more successful than that in the late 2000s. With the global economy booming, the 15% drop in the value of the pound after Britain came out of the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992 boosted exports. By the time Labour came to power in 1997, the balance of payments \u2013 a combination of trade, overseas payments and investment flows \u2013 was the closest it has been to balancing since the UK last ran a surplus in 1984.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"146a3fd473ecafa151f987828bd30bef01fb4271\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/146a3fd473ecafa151f987828bd30bef01fb4271/0_0_499_558/447.jpg\" alt=\"Pound V Dollar graph\" width=\"447\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Three factors limited the ability of the UK to take advantage of the 2007-09 depreciation: the loss of manufacturing capacity; the weakness of global demand; and the growing reliance on exports from the City, which were particularly hard hit during a period when the financial markets froze. There was an improvement in the current account balance from -3.5% to -1.8% of national output but the picture deteriorated rapidly once the economy started to grow again.<br></p> <p>This was hardly surprising. The eurozone was going through an existential crisis at a time when George Osborne was pumping up the housing market through the funding for lending scheme and help to buy. A rising pound and weak demand meant exports struggled and manufacturing output flatlined. A traditional British recovery dominated by a rising property market delivered the traditional British result: a whopping balance of payments deficit.</p> <p>Had the result in the referendum gone the other way, the deficit would have got bigger. Sterling would have risen on the foreign exchanges, making imports cheaper and exports dearer. The economy has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/21/post-referendum-gloom-fears-confounded-economic-evidence\">held up pretty well since late June</a> but would have grown faster had remain won. It would have been business as usual and by now there would have been pressure on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">Bank of England </a>to raise interest rates to prevent the economy overheating.</p> <p>Britain has discovered a way of living beyond its means. Assets are sold to overseas buyers bringing capital into the country to offset the balance of payments deficit. It is the equivalent of a once well-to-do household that has fallen on hard times pawning the silver to keep up appearances. At some point, referendum or no referendum, the financial markets were going to say enough is enough and it is delusional to think otherwise.<br></p> <p>Running permanent balance of payment deficits amounts to borrowing growth from the future. Sooner or later, it has to be paid back and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit </a>means it will be sooner. A weaker pound works by making exports cheaper and imports dearer. The effect, as after all the other devaluations and depreciations of the past 100 years \u2013 1931, 1949, 1967, 1976, 1992 and 2007 \u2013 will make the economy less dependent on consumers and more reliant on producers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/10/fall-in-sterling-is-a-welcome-change-says-mervyn-king-brexit-vote\">Lord Mervyn King</a>, a former governor of the Bank of England, thinks the latest fall in sterling is a good thing and he is right.<br></p> <p>There have been suggestions from some in the remain camp that the hollowing out of manufacturing will make it impossible to gain any benefit from the cheaper pound. This, frankly, is nonsense. The current account deficit will shrink as a result of stronger exports from the manufacturing and service sectors, the boost provided to the tourism industry, and because cheaper domestic goods and services will be substituted for more expensive imports. To say that dearer imports will make life more difficult for consumers is to miss the point. That\u2019s how rebalancing works.</p> <p>Will dearer food and the coming squeeze on living standards will prompt a change of heart about Brexit? Remainers should not bank on it. Life has not been great for many in recent years anyway. What\u2019s more, Britain is a country with a streak of cussedness that delights in having its back to the wall. <br></p> <p>That said, there is a lot of guff talked by some in the leave camp about how being unshackled from the EU will enable Britain to break into markets that have hitherto been closed. The notion that Britain has been prevented from exporting to China, India or any other part of the world by Brussels red tape is disproved by one seven-letter word: Germany.</p> <p>Profound economic change is usually the result of a convulsive shock, of which Brexit is clearly one. The referendum should lead to a period of national introspection and a willingness to address the fundamental vulnerabilities of the economy. If it doesn\u2019t, the opportunity to set sail from fantasy island will be lost.<br></p>",
  "<p>I have a strange relationship with drinks packaging. On the one hand, I\u2019d rather go thirsty than buy a small bottle of fruit juice or water at a station, when I know there\u2019s a litre-carton available for exactly the same price back at my local supermarket. On the other hand, I can\u2019t remember the last time I bought a 2-litre bottle of Coke, and yet here I am now with a can of the full-fat stuff open in front of me as I type. As usual with consumer behaviour, I\u2019m a mess of contradictions. Sensible and rational as Adam Smith\u2019s <em>Homo economicus </em>when it comes to juice and water; a dupe when it comes to my expensive, no doubt marketing-led belief that Coke always tastes better in a can.</p> <p>When it comes to wine, the drink responsible for an uncomfortably large proportion of my monthly spending, I don\u2019t have to worry too much about presentation. When it comes to size or format, in the great majority of cases, the decision is made for you: most wines, of all styles, are only available in the traditional 75cl glass bottle, which began to corner the market in the 19th century. There are competing accounts about the reasons behind the ascent of the 75cl bottle, from the romantic notion that it was the capacity of the average glass blower\u2019s lungs, to the more plausible suggestion that a standard 225-litre French wine barrel makes 300 75cl bottles. What nobody would argue, however, is that the 75cl hegemony is all about quality. Most producers, in fact, would say that a 1.5-litre magnum is a better size if you\u2019re looking to buy fine wine to lay down, for the simple reason that it contains proportionally less oxygen than a single bottle, meaning the wine ages more slowly and, arguably, gracefully.</p> <p>And, talking to merchants, there does seem to have been a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/nov/23/wine-magnums-recommendations-fiona-beckett\">bit of a boom in magnum sales</a>, although that\u2019s only partly due to the refined sensibilities of serious collectors. As Alastair Marshall, of Suffolk-based Adnams, says, there\u2019s \u201csomething impressive\u201d about bringing a magnum to a dinner party, and that\u2019s as true of a wine designed for drinking now, such as Provence ros\u00e9 \u2013 a particularly strong seller in magnum in the past couple of years for Marshall and other merchants \u2013 as it is for swanky Bordeaux or Burgundy.</p> <p>The trouble with magnums is that, per unit, you\u2019re getting slightly less wine for your money: magnums are twice the size but they\u2019re also usually more than twice the price of their single-bottle equivalents. And there\u2019s no getting around the fact that, for most occasions, they\u2019re just, well, too big. But then, for many of us, anxious about our wine consumption, and unable to avoid the temptation of drinking up a bottle once it\u2019s opened, even a 75cl feels too big. Which would seem to make a half-bottle more attractive, were it not for the fact that drinking halves is generally less economical than drinking magnums, with prices often two-thirds or more of the cost of a single bottle. You\u2019re also greatly restricted when it comes to choice. Most retailers find halves, in the words of Marshall, \u201ctoo fiddly\u201d. And even the UK\u2019s sole specialist in the size, halfwine.com, has a significantly less diverse range than a standard indie retailer (although the site is well worth a look if you\u2019re set on small bottles).</p> <p>The best format for drinking economically and sensibly isn\u2019t a glass bottle of any form, but the much maligned bag-in-box. It\u2019s lighter and therefore better for the environment, the wine stays fresher for longer once opened than in a bottle, it\u2019s cheaper per unit, and a 50cl carafe drawn from the bag is just about the perfect serving for two people for dinner.</p> <p>What\u2019s stood in the way of the bag-in-box (or the bag-without-a-box, sometimes known rather unattractively as a pouch) is the quality of the stuff inside. This isn\u2019t a reflection of the packaging itself, which, while not suitable for ageing wines unopened for more than a year, holds them just as well for its shelf life. It\u2019s just that in the UK at least (it\u2019s a very different story in Australia and Scandinavia) they\u2019ve become associated with cheap and cheerless wines.</p> <p>That\u2019s still the case for most supermarket bag-in-box wines, but things are starting to change. Inspired by the trend for serving better wines on tap from kegs, casks and pouches in some of the country\u2019s more informally fashionable bars, a new generation of drinkers and winemakers has become much less sniffy about boxes and pouches. As more of them arrive in shops over the next couple of years, choosing which format to buy is about to get a whole lot more complicated.</p> <h2>Six of the best<br></h2> <p><strong>Mud House Sauvignon Blanc</strong>, Marlborough, New Zealand NV (\u00a315, 1.5l, bag-in-box, <a href=\"http://www.waitrose.com/shop/DisplayProductFlyout?productId=496770\">Waitrose</a>)<br>One of the better supermarket box wines currently available, this is a typically pungent and crisp, simple but good-value take on the successful Kiwi Sauvignon template with plenty of peapod and passion fruit and refreshing citrus.</p> <p><strong>Du Grappin Rouge Bagnum</strong>, Beaujolais, France (\u00a326, 1.5l pouch, <a href=\"http://www.thesolentcellar.co.uk/shop/red/du-grappin-rouge-gamay-bagnum-beaujolais-1-5-litre/\">solentcellar.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"https://prohibitionwines.com/our-wines/\">prohibitionwines.com</a>)<br>A delicious easy-drinking, succulent gamay in classically exuberant and sappy Beaujolais style from Andrew Nielsen, an Australian in Burgundy, who has a full range of high-quality wines in his wittily named 1.5-litre \u201cbagnum\u201d pouches.</p> <p><strong>Dandelion Vineyards Enchanted Garden of the Eden Valley Riesling</strong>, Australia 2014 (\u00a310.05, 37.5cl bottle, <a href=\"https://www.halfwine.com/dandelion-vineyards-enchanted-garden-riesling?productId=1290\">halfwine.co.uk</a>)<br>With its laser-guided lime and fresh peachy flavours, and its mouth-tingling acidity, a full-bottle of this textbook Eden Valley riesling is a good-value buy for \u00a312.99 (nywines.co.uk), but loses none of its zing in half-bottle format.</p> <p><strong>De Bortoli Botrytis Semillon</strong>, Riverina, Australia 2009 (\u00a37, 37.5cl bottle, <a href=\"https://groceries.morrisons.com/webshop/product/De-Bortoli-Reserve-Botrytis-Semillon/310369011\">Morrisons</a>)<br>Because most people drink them only occasionally and in small amounts at the end of a meal, sweet wines often come in half-bottles.

Its mission, to get birth control information to the poor and needy, should have been taken over by government health services, much like countries in western Europe. In the rare US cities where municipal clinics do offer birth control, like New York City, women still come to Planned Parenthood because they know they will get unbiased advice and full options.</p> <p>It shouldn\u2019t be this way.

That was her mantra. Born poor, Irish, Catholic, tubercular, with an 11th-grade education, my grandmother was a tough and determined woman. She witnessed injustice and was determined to fix it. As a nurse, she saw women having children they didn\u2019t want or, all too often, dying from illegal abortions. \u201cEnough,\u201d she said.

The association not only operates a reproductive health clinic, but also runs a community school for orphans and offers training facilities in hairdressing, dressmaking and cooking, providing career paths for underprivileged boys and girls. The Moroccan people trust and respect our organisation, as do people in 172 countries where IPPF operates.</p> <p>To the poor and underserved, to the young and marginalised, to the minorities and immigrants that the US government doesn\u2019t reach, my grandmother said: \u201cWe are here for you, all of you, no questions asked.\u201d</p> <p>A century ago, she was persecuted for this by the government, the churches, and many of her fellow citizens.

  "<p>Devastating hurricane? More than 1,000 lives lost? It must be climate change! Almost inevitably, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hurricane-matthew\">Hurricane Matthew</a>\u2019s recent rampage across the Caribbean and south-eastern US has been fingered by some as a backlash of global warming driven by humanity\u2019s polluting activities, but does this really stack up?</p> <p>The short answer is no. Blame for a single storm cannot be laid at climate change\u2019s door, as reinforced by the bigger picture. The current hurricane season is by no means extraordinary, and the last few seasons have actually been very tame. The 2013 season saw no major hurricanes at all and tied with 1982 for the fewest hurricanes since 1930. This, in turn, is no big deal as there is great year-on-year variability in the level of hurricane activity, which responds to various natural factors such as El Ni\u00f1o and the so-called Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, as well as the progressive warming of the oceans as climate change bites harder.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/10/un-haiti-aid-hurricane-matthew\">Hurricane Matthew's devastation in Haiti forces UN to call for $120m in aid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The current consensus holds that while a warmer world will not necessarily mean more hurricanes, it will see a rise in the frequency of the most powerful, and therefore more destructive, variety. This view was supported recently by Kerry Emanuel, a hurricane scientist at MIT, who pointed to Matthew as a likely sign of things to come.</p> <p>Debate within the hurricane science community has in recent decades been almost as hostile as the storms themselves, with researchers, on occasion, even refusing to sit on the same panels at conferences. At the heart of this sometimes acrimonious dispute has been the validity of the Atlantic hurricane record and the robustness of the idea that hurricane activity had been broadly ratcheting up since the 1980s. Now, the weight of evidence looks to have come down on the side of a broad and significant increase in hurricane activity that is primarily driven by progressive warming of the climate. For many, the bottom line is the sea surface temperature, which is a major driver of hurricane activity and storm intensification. Last year saw the warmest sea temperatures on record, so it should not be a surprise. As Michael Mann, an atmospheric scientist at Penn State University, says: \u201cIt isn\u2019t a coincidence that we\u2019ve seen the strongest hurricane in both hemispheres [western and eastern] within the last year.\u201d As the Atlantic continues to heat up, the trend is widely expected to be towards more powerful and wetter storms, so that Matthew might seem like pretty small beer when looked back on from the mid-century.</p> <p>As with hurricanes, Pacific typhoons and the mid-latitude storms that periodically batter the UK and Europe are forecast to follow a similar pattern in an anthropogenically warmed world. Storm numbers may not rise, but there is likely to be an escalation in the frequency of the bigger storm systems, which tend to be the most destructive. An additional concern is that mid-latitude storms may become clustered, bringing the prospect of extended periods of damaging and disruptive winds. The jury is out on whether climate change will drive up the number of smaller, but potentially ruinous vortices of solid wind that make up tornadoes, although an apparent trend in the US towards more powerful storms has been blamed by some on a warming atmosphere.</p> <p>Tornadoes, typhoons, hurricanes and mid-latitude storms \u2013 along with heatwaves and floods \u2013 are widely regarded as climate change\u2019s shock troops; forecast to accelerate the destruction, loss of life and financial pain as planet Earth continues to heat up. It would be wrong to imagine, however, that climate change and the extreme events it drives are all about higher temperatures and a bit more wind and rain.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>An earthquake fault that is ready to go is like a coiled spring \u2013 all that is needed is the pressure of a handshake</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The atmosphere is far from isolated and interacts with other elements of the so-called \u201cEarth system\u201d, such as the oceans, ice caps and even the ground beneath our feet, in complex and often unexpected ways capable of making our world more dangerous. We are pretty familiar with the idea that the oceans swell as a consequence of the plunging atmospheric pressure at the heart of powerful storms, building surges driven onshore by high winds that can be massively destructive. Similarly, it does not stretch the imagination to appreciate that a warmer atmosphere promotes greater melting of the polar ice caps, thereby raising sea levels and increasing the risk of coastal flooding. But, more extraordinarily, the thin layer of gases that hosts the weather and fosters global warming really does interact with the solid Earth \u2013 the so-called geosphere \u2014 in such a way as to make climate change an even bigger threat.</p> <p>This relationship is marvellously illustrated by a piece of research published in the journal <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v459/n7248/full/nature08042.html\"><em>Nature</em> in 2009</a> by Chi-Ching Liu of the Institute of Earth Sciences at Taipei\u2019s Academia Sinica. In the paper, Liu and his colleagues provided convincing evidence for a link between typhoons barrelling across Taiwan and the timing of small earthquakes beneath the island. Their take on the connection is that the reduced atmospheric pressure that characterises these powerful Pacific equivalents of hurricanes is sufficient to allow earthquake faults deep within the crust to move more easily and release accumulated strain. This may sound far fetched, but an earthquake fault that is primed and ready to go is like a coiled spring, and as geophysicist John McCloskey of the University of Ulster is fond of pointing out, all that is needed to set it off is \u2013 quite literally \u2013 \u201cthe pressure of a handshake\u201d.</p> <p>Perhaps even more astonishingly, Liu and his team proposed that storms might act as safety valves, repeatedly short-circuiting the buildup of dangerous levels of strain that otherwise could eventually instigate large, destructive earthquakes. This might explain, the researchers say, why the contact between the Eurasian and Philippine Sea tectonic plates, in the vicinity of Taiwan, has far less in the way of major quakes than further north where the plate boundary swings past Japan.</p> <p>In a similar vein, it seems that the huge volume of rain dumped by tropical cyclones, leading to severe flooding, may also be linked to earthquakes. The University of Miami\u2019s Shimon Wdowinski has noticed that in some parts of the tropics \u2013 Taiwan included \u2013 large earthquakes have a tendency to follow exceptionally wet hurricanes or typhoons, most notably the devastating quake that took up to 220,000 lives in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2015/jan/16/the-haiti-earthquake-five-years-on-then-and-now\">Haiti in 2010</a>. It is possible that floodwaters are lubricating fault planes, but Wdowinski has another explanation. He thinks that the erosion of landslides caused by the torrential rains acts to reduce the weight on any fault below, allowing it to move more easily.</p> <p>It has been known for some time that rainfall also influences the pattern of earthquake activity in the Himalayas, where the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nepal-earthquake-2015\">2015 Nepal earthquake</a> took close to 9,000 lives, and where the threat of future devastating quakes is very high. During the summer monsoon season, prodigious quantities of rain soak into the lowlands of the Indo-Gangetic plain, immediately to the south of the mountain range, which then slowly drains away over the next few months. This annual rainwater loading and unloading of the crust is mirrored by the level of earthquake activity, which is significantly lower during the summer months than during the winter.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/apr/29/nepal-earthquake-drone-footage-shows-devastation-ancient-town-bhaktapur-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/48xty\"                        data-video-id=\"2284464\"            data-video-name=\"Nepal earthquake: drone footage shows devastation in ancient town of Bhaktapur - video\"            data-video-provider=\"Effect International\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-456562623\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/04/29/150429NepalDrone_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/04/29/150429NepalDrone_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/04/29/150429NepalDrone_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10317338&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/04/29/150429NepalDrone_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/apr/29/nepal-earthquake-drone-footage-shows-devastation-ancient-town-bhaktapur-video\">Nepal earthquake: drone footage shows devastation in ancient town of Bhaktapur</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>And it isn\u2019t only earthquake faults that today\u2019s storms and torrential rains are capable of shaking up. Volcanoes seem to be susceptible too. On the Caribbean island of Montserrat, heavy rains have been implicated in triggering eruptions of the active lava dome that dominates the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/28/montserrat-volcano-british-territory-geothermal-energy-tourism-sand-mining\">Soufri\u00e8re Hills volcano</a>. Stranger still, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/29/alaska-volcano-eruption-less-intense-more-flight-cancellations\">Alaska\u2019s Pavlof volcano</a> appears to respond not to wind or rain, but to tiny seasonal changes in sea level. The volcano seems to prefer to erupt in the late autumn and winter, when weather patterns are such that water levels adjacent to this coastal volcano climb by a few tens of centimetres. This is enough to bend the crust beneath the volcano, allowing magma to be squeezed out, according to geophysicist Steve McNutt of the University of South Florida, \u201clike toothpaste out of a tube\u201d.</p> <p>If today\u2019s weather can bring forth earthquakes and magma from the Earth\u2019s crust, it doesn\u2019t take much to imagine how the solid Earth is likely to respond to the large-scale environmental adjustments that accompany rapid climate change. In fact, we don\u2019t have to imagine at all. The last time our world experienced serious warming was at the end of the last ice age when, between about 20,000 and 10,000 years ago, temperatures rose by six degrees centigrade, melting the great continental ice sheets and pushing up sea levels by more than 120m.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The bottom line is that as climate change tightens its grip, we must be prepared to expect the unexpected</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These huge changes triggered geological mayhem. As the kilometres-thick Scandinavian ice sheet vanished, the faults beneath released the accumulated strain of tens of millennia, spawning massive magnitude eight earthquakes. Quakes of this scale are taken for granted today around the Pacific Ocean\u2019s \u201cRing of Fire\u201d, but they are completely out of place in Santa\u2019s Lapland. Across the Norwegian Sea, in Iceland, the volcanoes long buried beneath a kilometre of ice were also rejuvenated as the suffocating ice load melted away, prompting a \u201cvolcano storm\u201d about 12,000 years ago that saw the level of activity increase by up to 50 times.</p> <p>Now, global average temperatures are shooting up again and are already more than one degree centigrade higher than during preindustrial times. It should come as no surprise that the solid Earth is starting to respond once more. In southern Alaska, which has in places lost a vertical kilometre of ice cover, the reduced load on the crust is already increasing the level of seismic activity. In high mountain ranges across the world from the Caucasus in the north to New Zealand\u2019s southern Alps, longer and more intense heatwaves are melting the ice and thawing the permafrost that keeps mountain faces intact, leading to a rise in major landslides.</p> <p>Does this all mean that we are in for a more geologically active future as well as a hotter and meteorologically more violent one? Well, no one is suggesting that we will see a great surge in the number of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. As always, these will be controlled largely by local geological conditions. Where an earthquake fault or volcano is primed and ready to go, however, climate change may provide that extra helping hand that brings forward the timing of a quake or eruption that would eventually have happened anyway.</p> <p>As the world continues to heat up, any geological response is likely to be most obvious where climate change is driving the biggest environmental changes \u2013 for example, in areas where ice and permafrost are vanishing fast, or in coastal regions where rising sea levels will play an increasing role. Freysteinn Sigmundsson of the Nordic Volcanological Centre observes that the centre of Iceland is now rising by more than three centimetres a year in response to shrinking glaciers. Studies undertaken by Sigmundsson and his colleagues forecast that the reduced pressures that result will lead to the formation of significant volumes of new magma deep under Iceland. Whether this will translate into more or bigger eruptions remains uncertain, but the aviation chaos that arose from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iceland-volcano\">Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull eruption in 2010</a> provides a salutary warning of the disruption that any future increase in Icelandic volcanic activity may cause across the North Atlantic region.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"adb7667c3a501fe490c849a5e6a3ff3fbc57a3c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adb7667c3a501fe490c849a5e6a3ff3fbc57a3c6/0_0_2917_1750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ash rises from  the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano in Iceland in 2010\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cloud of ash rises from the volcano under the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull glacier in Iceland in May, 2010, causing chaos for millions of airline passengers as flights were cancelled across Europe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ingolfur Juliusson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Volcanologist Hugh Tuffen, of Lancaster University, is worried about the stability of the more than 10% of active volcanoes that are ice-covered. He says that \u201cclimate change is driving rapid melting of ice on many volcanoes worldwide, triggering unloading as ice is removed. As well as encouraging magma to rise to the surface, leading to increased volcanic activity, removal of ice can also destabilise steep volcano flanks, making hazardous landslides more likely.\u201d</p> <p>The potential for more landslides is also likely to be a problem in high mountain ranges as the ice cover that stabilises rock faces vanishes. Christian Huggel of the University of Zurich has warned that \u201cin densely populated and developed regions such as the European Alps, serious consequences have to be considered from [future] large slope failures\u201d.</p> <p>Looking ahead, one of the key places to watch will be Greenland, where recent findings by a research team led by Shfaqat Khan of Denmark\u2019s Technical University reveal a staggering loss of 272bn tonnes of ice a year over the last decade. GPS measurements show that, like Scandinavia at the end of the last ice age, Greenland and the whole of the surrounding region is already rising in response to the removal of this ice load. Andrea Hampel of the University of Hannover\u2019s Geological Institute, who with colleagues has been studying this behaviour, is concerned that \u201cfuture ice loss may trigger earthquakes of intermediate to large magnitude if the crust underneath the modern ice cap contains faults prone to failure\u201d.</p> <p>More earthquakes in Greenland might not seem like a big deal, but this could have far wider ramifications. About 8,200 years ago, an earthquake linked to the uplift of Scandinavia, triggered the Storegga Slide; a gigantic undersea sediment slide that sent a tsunami racing across the North Atlantic. Run-up heights were more than 20m in the Shetlands and six metres along the east coast of Scotland, and the event has been blamed for the flooding of Doggerland; the inhabited Mesolithic landmass that occupied what is now the southern North Sea.</p> <p>The submerged margins of Greenland are currently not very well mapped, so the likelihood of a future earthquake triggering a landslide capable of generating a major tsunami in the North Atlantic is unknown. Dave Tappin, a tsunami expert at the British Geological Survey, points out that one large, undersea landslide has been identified off the coast of Greenland, but suspects that there may not be sufficient sediment to generate landslides as large as Storegga. Nonetheless, the seismic revival of Greenland is certainly a geological response to climate change that we need to keep an eye on.</p> <p>The bottom line in all of this is that as climate change tightens its grip, we should certainly contemplate more and bigger Hurricane Matthews. However, when it comes to the manifold hazardous by-blows of an overheating planet, and especially those involving the ground we stand on, we must also be prepared to expect the unexpected.</p> <p><em>Bill McGuire is professor emeritus in geophysical and climate hazards at UCL.

  "<p>On a Saturday afternoon, as soon as the market is drawing to a close, traders bring their boxes of unsold fruit and vegetables to a corner of Viale Papiniano in Milan. They are welcomed by Rebecca, a 25-year-old student who\u2019s behind <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/recupmilano/?fref=ts\">Recup</a>, a project that distributes leftover food to people in need in the local neighbourhood. Along with 20 fellow volunteers recruited through social media, Rebecca collects and shares unsold tomatoes, cabbages and bananas from the market stands.</p> <p>\u201cI was shocked going to the market at closing time and realising just how much unsold fruit and vegetables were thrown in the garbage,\u201d she recalls. \u201cTogether with my flatmate, I started to talk to the market vendors and convince them to donate produce destined to go to waste.

Some people believe this practice should start at a young age. Milano Ristorazione, a city-owned company which provides 80,000 meals per day to schools, hospitals and elderly houses, launched the campaign <em>Io non spreco</em> (I don\u2019t waste) in 2014 to involve school children in the fight against food waste. The company gives out bags for primary school students to take home leftover food from lunch, like bread or fruit.</p> <p>\u201cTeaching the value of food is fundamental,\u201d explains Milano Ristorazione director Gabriella Iacono. \u201cChildren learn at school to not waste fruit and to value everything: at the end of a meal when they throw away food scraps and biodegradable plates in the wet waste bin, they learn that everything can be reused for nature.\u201d</p> <p>The global \u201cugly food\u201d movement, promoting the consumption of misshapen produce usually thrown away, has taken off across Europe \u2013 from the <a href=\"http://itm.marcelww.com/inglorious/\">inglorious fruits and vegetables campaign</a> by French supermarket Intermarch\u00e9, which led to France <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/04/french-law-forbids-food-waste-by-supermarkets\">banning supermarket food waste</a>; to the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/05/asda-puts-uks-first-supermarket-wonky-veg-box-on-sale\">\u201cwonky veg box\u201d scheme</a> and the Spanish social enterprise-run brand Es Imperfect, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/15/food-waste-harvesting-spains-unwanted-crops-to-feed-the-hungry\">which sells jams, soups and sauces made from recovered produce</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bb8f84483cddc09d204afdb006803e27c3d44ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bb8f84483cddc09d204afdb006803e27c3d44ad/0_0_800_600/500.jpg\" alt=\"Italian NGO Banco Alimentare\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Milan, close to 60,000 people benefit from the work of NGO Banco Alimentare, which supplies donated food to those in need.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Banco Alimentare</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Milan, the Frutta Brutta (ugly fruit) project is led by a group of fruit producers from the Lombardy region who are selling imperfect apples in the city\u2019s farmers markets at a lower price (\u20ac0.80 per kilo, while the regular price for \u201cnormal\u201d apples is around \u20ac2.50 per kilo). Farmers involved in this initiative, launched in September 2014, aim to save more than 50 tonnes of apples from now until April 2017 through the scheme \u2013 which also gives a kilo of apples to local charities for every kilo sold at the markets.</p> <p>Many of the local initiatives addressing food waste in Milan also focus on having a strong social impact. The Italian NGO <a href=\"http://www.bancoalimentare.it/it\">Banco Alimentare</a> organises mass-scale collections of food surplus across the country in order to donate them to networks of local charities and soup kitchens, or directly to families in need. Around 54,000 people in Milan benefit daily from the work of Banco Alimentare, which deals mostly with large-scale retailers through a system involving more than 700 volunteers in the Lombardy region. The organisation is currently planning to collaborate with the city government and the Polytechnic University to test a local-scale model of food waste reduction in a suburban neighbourhood of the city; it would offer residents a real-time list of shops where food surplus is available.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/11/hell-earth-great-urban-scandal-life-rubbish-dump\">'Hell on earth': the great urban scandal of family life lived on a rubbish dump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The use of apps to combat food waste is also creating new opportunities for grocery shops in Milan. <a href=\"https://www.myfoody.it/#/landing\">MyFoody</a> alerts local residents to food in small supermarkets in danger of being wasted \u2013 either because it\u2019s going out of date or the packaging is damaged.

  "<p>Doug McMaster, the 29-year-old owner of <a href=\"http://www.silobrighton.com/\">Silo</a> in Brighton, spends a lot of time thinking about oven cleaner. \u201cMy oven only takes one type of cleaning product,\u201d he says, \u201cand the only way to get that cleaning product is in a plastic container.\u201d</p> <p>This bothers him, because at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/13/silo-brighton-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin\">Silo</a> he has a rule that \u201cat least 99% of what we buy will go into our customers\u2019 bellies, into our compost machine\u2019s belly, or will be re-used in some other way\u201d.</p> <p>Otherwise, Silo is doing pretty well on the sustainability front. One of the first things you see upon entering the restaurant, in Brighton\u2019s buzzy North Laines, is the composter, which can process up to 60kg of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2015/aug/12/produced-but-never-eaten-a-visual-guide-to-food-waste\">food scraps</a> overnight. However, Silo is so efficient, yielding as little as 3kg in waste a day, that he ends up sharing it with neighbouring food shops.</p> <p>Another contraption McMaster is proud of is the \u00a34,000 electric mill in the basement. Not only do they make sourdough bread in-house, they also grind their own flour. And instead of buying in butter, which comes packaged, McMaster and his team get cream from a local dairy in metal pails and churn it themselves. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any restaurant owner in the world as committed as I am to reducing waste by 99.9999%,\u201d says McMaster.</p> <p>None of this would amount to much if the dining experience wasn\u2019t up to scratch. Luckily, the food on my visit, on a busy Saturday afternoon in August matches his ambition. Sussex tomatoes, lovage and fresh cheese is sweet and tangy; poached trout with peas, parsley and brown butter properly indulgent.</p> <p>Before McMaster started obsessing over the environmental impact of his work, his focus was squarely on cooking. Starting out as a chef in his native Nottinghamshire, he graduated to St John in London and travelled widely in his early 20s. In Australia, he met an artist called Joost Bakker. Together they set up the original Silo in Melbourne as a one-year experiment in 2012. When it closed, McMaster returned to the UK to revive it on a grander scale.</p> <p>Not every aspect of his approach has been met with approval. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe the criticism I get for using wines from Europe as opposed to Sussex,\u201d he says. \u201cSussex has such a proud claim on sparkling white wine, but do I want to use wine grown locally with pesticides and herbicides? No.\u201d</p> <p>You sense he relishes the controversy. \u201cThere\u2019s something quite anarchic about not conforming with the status quo of sustainability: local, seasonal, organic. It\u2019s a very linear way of thinking. I\u2019m much more intuitive. People say, that\u2019s so hypocritical. But where does coffee come from?\u201d</p> <p>Which reminds him. He recently put in an order for half a ton of beans from the Dominican Republic, to be delivered to Falmouth on a ship powered only by wind. It cost him \u00a322 per kg instead of the usual \u00a314 \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t seem bothered. If it helps him reduce the impact of his restaurant even closer to zero, it\u2019s got to be worth it.</p> <p><em>39 Upper Gardner St, Brighton BN1 4AN</em></p>",

  "<p>When you have somehow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/12/george-clooney-visit-edinburgh-social-bites-cafe-helps-homeless-people\">lured George Clooney into your sandwich shop</a>, what do you do for an encore? Well, if you\u2019re Josh Littlejohn, co-founder of <a href=\"http://social-bite.co.uk/\">Social Bite</a>, a chain of five cafes in Scotland, you look down the list of other recent Oscar winners and invite Leonardo DiCaprio. News leaked in June that DiCaprio had accepted and he is due to arrive in Edinburgh next month as the guest speaker at the Scottish Business Awards, one of Littlejohn\u2019s sidelines. Meanwhile, the very strange story of Social Bite, a social enterprise that employs homeless people and donates all its profits to charity, becomes ever more like a Hollywood movie script.</p> <p>For Clooney\u2019s visit to Social Bite, last November, crowds formed outside the Rose Street shop at 6am. By the time his car pulled up, there was hysteria. He swept in, took selfies with the staff, bought an avocado and pesto sandwich and donated \u00a31,000.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2016/oct/16/the-sandwich-shop-that-helps-the-homeless-by-employing-them-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5657k\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2779157\"            data-video-name=\"The sandwich shop that helps the homeless by employing them - video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57f4fd33e4b0e2a2a25af370\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/05/161005OFMSocialBite_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/05/161005OFMSocialBite.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/05/161005OFMSocialBite_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2016/oct/16/the-sandwich-shop-that-helps-the-homeless-by-employing-them-video\">The sandwich shop that helps the homeless by employing them</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cYeah, it was mad,\u201d laughs Littlejohn, who is 30. \u201cAnd the next day, our little business \u2013 which three-and-a-half years earlier, I\u2019d been serving behind that till \u2013 was on the front page of every newspaper in the entire country. It was on CNN, I had my cousins in South Africa saying, \u2018Just heard you on the news.\u2019 It must have been a slow news day. All that really happened was that George Clooney had a sandwich!\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s not too much A-list stardust at the winner of OFM\u2019s Outstanding Achievement award on the morning I visit. A group of Edinburgh\u2019s homeless linger outside: one in a hoodie and bobble hat puts down his can of Strongbow and goes in to collect a free sandwich and coffee. These meals are covered by customers who \u201cpay forward\u201d donations and Social Bite\u2019s Christmas appeal. The handouts are supposed to be capped at one per day, but Littlejohn notes good-naturedly that often the same faces will turn up at one branch for breakfast and another for lunch. \u201cNow no homeless person gets turned away,\u201d he says. Social Bite also gives away any food it hasn\u2019t sold that day when it closes at 3pm.</p> <p>But the mission of Social Bite \u2013 whose food costs about the same as Pret a Manger and Eat \u2013 is to be much more than an upmarket soup kitchen. The first cafe opened in August 2012, the idea of Littlejohn and his then-girlfriend Alice Thomson. They were, Littlejohn says now, \u201cclueless\u201d: his experience amounted to studying economics at Edinburgh University and watching his father, Simon, who owns restaurants across Scotland. The inspiration for giving away their profits came from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/18/muhammad-yunus-microfinance-bangladesh\">Muhammad Yunus,</a> the Bangladeshi social entrepreneur who pioneered microlending.</p> <p>It hadn\u2019t been the plan to employ homeless people, but a <em>Big Issue</em> seller called Pete stationed himself outside the shop and, after a couple of weeks, he asked Littlejohn and Thomson for a job. Pete handed out leaflets for a couple of hours a day and then, when a position opened up, he became a pot washer. He also moved in with Littlejohn and Thomson to their one-bed flat while they tried to find him somewhere permanent. The experiment worked and Pete recommended his brother Joe. Littlejohn and Thomson set a goal that a quarter of Social Bite\u2019s employees should come from homeless backgrounds.</p> <p>Meeting this criteria as a small business has been a challenge; in fact, many days it\u2019s a nightmare. No-shows are a recurring problem and new hires are prone to storming out. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely chaotic to get them to fit into the employment environment where they have to turn up every day,\u201d admits Littlejohn.</p> <p>But for some the job has turned their lives around. One of these is 51-year-old Colin Childs, who was Social Bite\u2019s third employee from a homeless background and now works filling focaccias in the central production kitchen. Childs had been a drug addict and had not had steady work for more than 20 years. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of people come and go,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can\u2019t handle the work, they are used to dossing about the street or whatever. But Social Bite gives you the tools to change your life and it\u2019s up to you if you want to take it. And I took it.\u201d</p> <p>For Littlejohn \u2013 Thomson remains on the board, but is no longer involved day to day \u2013 the secret is \u201cendless chances, endless patience\u201d. He shakes his head, \u201cWhen I think of some of my staff and the challenges they\u2019ve had to overcome to still be on their feet, you start looking at them with awe rather than, \u2018For fuck\u2019s sake, you\u2019ve slept in again.\u2019 You\u2019re still standing \u2013 that\u2019s amazing!\u201d</p> <p>When Littlejohn launched Social Bite, he had plans for 100, maybe even 500 cafes in the UK: \u201cWe thought, \u2018Let\u2019s take on Starbucks!\u2019\u201d He has since decided that five shops \u2013 two each in Edinburgh and Glasgow, one in Aberdeen \u2013 will better allow him to consolidate the work with his staff.</p> <p>He has also launched a craft lager called Brewgooder, which donates all its profits to clean-water initiatives, and in September he, along with business partners, opened a more formal restaurant in Edinburgh named Home. This also employs people from the street and encourages donations from diners in the form of meal promises; every Monday afternoon, the doors are then opened to feed the homeless.</p> <p>As for future marketing stunts, how do you top DiCaprio?</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s not many places left to go,\u201d Littlejohn concedes.</p> <p>Then he smiles, \u201cObama would be the obvious one. It sounds funny but it\u2019s not beyond the realms of possibility.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/09/chinese-wine-tasters-beat-french-at-own-game-in-global-contest\">Chinese wine tasters</a> beat the French team in a shock victory at the world blind tasting championships last weekend, in what organisers called a \u2018thunderbolt in the wine world\u2019. China put its success down to knowledge and luck.</p> <p>The way a glass of wine tastes is influenced by a range of different signals, from smell and temperature to your surroundings, mood and what it looks like. In a well-known example, if you dye white wine red, it tastes completely different (even though the dye doesn\u2019t change the taste) and most people won\u2019t recognise it as white wine. Even when it\u2019s a high quality white wine, once food colouring is added, experts will say: \u2018I don\u2019t know what this is, but it\u2019s not very good.\u2019</p> <p>It\u2019s because our perception system works according to expectations. If you think a wine will be good or bad, or red or white, the brain primes itself to taste it in that way, regardless of what the tongue\u2019s sensors tell it. It is so subjective that it is actually closer to what we might describe as \u2018good taste\u2019 - a synthetic combination of sensory information, knowledge \u2013 and a degree of showmanship.</p> <p><em>Dr Daniel Glaser is director of <a href=\"https://london.sciencegallery.com/\">Science Gallery</a> at King\u2019s College London</em></p>",
  "<p>Like Shia LaBeouf\u2019s door-to-door salesman Jake, who prides himself on becoming whatever his customers desire, Andrea Arnold\u2019s fourth feature as writer-director is whatever you want it to be. For some, this story of a teenage Texas girl finding her feet among a travelling group of magazine sellers will be a timeless coming-of-age tale, a young woman\u2019s search for a room (or trailer) of her own. To others, it\u2019ll be a modern-day <em>Easy Rider</em>, a post-Larry Clark/Gus van Sant youthsploitation adventure in which \u201cwe explore America, we party \u2013 it\u2019s cool\u201d. Detractors may see little more than an overlong pop-video indulgence in which on-the-road outsiders sing along to a celluloid jukebox soundtrack. For me, however, this is Arnold\u2019s best work since her 2006 feature debut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/29/philipfrench\" title=\"\"><em>Red Road</em></a>, an electrifying odyssey which mixes the <em>v\u00e9rit\u00e9 </em>grit of Ken Loach\u2019s sociopolitical parables with the awestruck natural beauty of Terrence Malick\u2019s rural cinematic dreams, all filtered through the eyes of an irrepressible heroine whose experiences are at once singular yet universal.</p> <p>We first meet 18-year-old Star (a revelatory performance from screen newcomer Sasha Lane) scavenging for food in a bin while caring for two young kids. Sick of the predatory gropings of a drunken \u201cDaddy\u201d, Star leaves her charges with a recalcitrant mother and runs for the minibus that promises to take her away on $300 a day. The only conditions are that she will work hard and that no one will miss her. Dazzled by the piratical, rat-tailed Jake (LaBeouf\u2019s most convincing performance since 2006\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/mar/02/drama.robertdowneyjr\" title=\"\"><em>A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints</em></a>), Star learns the tricks of the trade \u2013 the door-knocking deceptions, which at first appal her but gradually start to appeal. \u201cSo you\u2019re a southern girl,\u201d says steely crew-manager Krystal (Riley Keough, channelling her grandfather Elvis Presley\u2019s moody stare), \u201ca real American Honey like me.\u201d But with Jake the object of both their attentions, relations will never be sweet between Star and the girl in the Confederate flag bikini.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/09/andrea-arnold-interview-american-honey-shia-labeouf-sasha-lane\">Andrea Arnold: \u2018I always aim to get under the belly of a place\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Partly inspired by a 2007 <em>New York Times </em>article about the brutal on-the-road existence of \u201cmag crew\u201d kids, <em>American Honey </em>revisits many of the themes that have haunted Arnold\u2019s work since the days of her Oscar-winning 2003 short <em>Wasp</em> \u2013 social inequality, dangerous attractions, defiant spirits. Yet with its dappled sunlight and crystalline lens flare, Arnold\u2019s first film set outside the UK also mixes in elements of what she calls the \u201cmythical America of westerns and road movies\u201d. Whether it\u2019s the wind blowing through Star\u2019s hair as the minibus hits the highway, or bodies intertwined in the grass as salesmanship is briefly abandoned in favour of sex, there is epic intimacy amid the harsh poetry. Cinematographer Robbie Ryan shoots in the squarer Academy ratio, which has been Arnold\u2019s signature since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/13/fish-tank-andrea-arnold-french\" title=\"\"><em>Fish Tank</em></a>, but his superb use of the 4x3 frame makes the image seem taller, rather than narrower, than more popular widescreen formats. There\u2019s a lot of sky in <em>American Honey</em>, a sense of expansiveness that marries shallow-focus closeups of pierced and tattooed skin with breathtaking vistas that seem to sweep upward towards the stars.</p> <p>Somehow, this frame creates a safe environment for the cast, many of whom are first-timers picked from shopping malls and skate parks. Lane herself was on a beach-bound spring break in Florida when she caught Arnold\u2019s eye. There\u2019s something of Katie Jarvis\u2019s Mia from <em>Fish Tank</em> about Star, a streetwise facade masking an empathetic soul. In an unforgiving world she is a nurturing presence, constantly saving the omnipresent insects that fall into water and fly into windows, struggling to protect the firefly spirits that thrum throughout the drama. And while Star may climb with reckless abandon into passing cars and trucks (from an open-top full of good ol\u2019 boys to a cattle truck en route to an abattoir), we never doubt her shimmering indestructibility.

Some may see this journey as bleak, but it\u2019s <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> and <em>Star Wars</em> that (g)litter these kids\u2019 dreams, placing a yellow brick road beneath their feet, a distant Death Star above their heads, and a tough but tender sweetness in their hearts.</p>",
  "<p>I meet Jamie Oliver on his first morning back at work after he has become, at 41, a dad for the fifth and, he insists, final time. He\u2019s spent the weekend co-hosting his annual Big Feastival at friend Alex James\u2019s farm in Oxfordshire. It\u2019s nine in the morning outside a photographer\u2019s studio in north London and Oliver suggests we sit on a junked sofa in the sun, apologising if he sounds a bit groggy \u2013 blame wife Jools\u2019s heroic efforts to get three-week-old River Rocket on to a \u201chybrid Gina Ford regime\u201d, and his DJ stint in Feastival\u2019s cheese tent the day before, where he shared billing with Tinie Tempah and the Proclaimers. Despite his apologies, he need never really fret about losing his focus. Once he starts talking, all the familiar Essex energy kicks in, and after a rare month away from it, he is back doing what he does best: evangelising compulsively about good food.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/apr/22/jamie-oliver-obesity-interview\">I spent some time with Oliver for OFM four years ago</a>, and got a sense of the full, plate-spinning frenzy of the life he had so cheerfully made for himself: the spread of his school-dinner initiatives to 80 countries, his plans for a global restaurant empire to fund his food standards work, his stand-offs with processing factories and governments on four continents, his initiative to bring cooking skills into the classroom and into impoverished adult lives \u2013 not to mention his inevitable latest book and TV show. Back then, I was impressed by his ambition and heart, but also feared a little that he would never be able to keep it all going.</p> <p>Talking to him now, it seems Oliver has responded to those spread-himself-too-thinly challenges in two ways. Firstly, by becoming a bit smarter in how he manages his time. And secondly, by trying to learn from every scrap of campaigning experience he has picked up since he first stopped being the cheeky chappie Naked Chef and opened Fifteen, his social enterprise restaurant, in 2002.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t mean he is doing any less, though. The last year has seen Jamie\u2019s Italian grow to 64 restaurants across the world. He has been to South Korea and Greece and Costa Rica in search of the secrets of longevity for his <em>Super Food</em> series, and he has almost singlehandedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/18/sugar-tax-financially-regressive-but-progressive-for-health\">put the problems associated with sugar at the top of the UK public-health agenda</a>, culminating in former chancellor George Osborne including a revolutionary sugar tax in his final budget. Oliver is proud of all of these things, he tells me, in the morning sunshine, but at the moment he is proudest of all of improving the lives of 46 million Brazilian chickens.</p> <p>If there has been a change in his approach, he says, it is a focus on measurable outcomes rather than the uncertainties of protest. His work with the Brazilian poultry producer Sadia, which farms a staggering 18% of all the world\u2019s chickens, is a case in point. Oliver has a strong profile in Brazil from his TV shows and he was approached by the food processing giant to see if he would do a marketing campaign. Sadia may have thought they were signing up to a brand endorsement, a bit of culture change and some warm words; in fact, Oliver insists, it\u2019s never that simple.</p> <p>He has become expert in knowing how this corporate dance works. \u201cWe paint them this beautiful picture of what good could look like,\u201d he says, of his methods. \u201cAnd then we make it clear that if you want to do business with us, it is going to be extremely awkward for you.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/13/jamie-oliver-theresa-may-obesity-strategy-uk\">Jamie Oliver says PM's obesity strategy has let down every UK child</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sadia, like all the companies Oliver works with \u2013 including big supermarket chains in Canada and Australia \u2013 had to sign up to a complex programme his team has developed over 10 years called Josie; the Jamie Oliver Supplier Information Exchange. It effectively monitors the supply chain from e-numbers to additives to mechanically reclaimed meat and animal welfare. \u201cSadia had to hit all of the welfare points before we put our name to it,\u201d he says, \u201cand we monitor their promises closely.\u201d</p> <p>The contract is worth a reported \u00a311.5m, though Oliver doesn\u2019t expect to see any of the money personally. \u201cBeyond keeping our commercial cogs moving, the money doesn\u2019t matter to me any more. What does is that this is the best bit of agricultural work I have done.\u201d</p> <p>What does it mean for the Brazilian chickens?</p> <p>\u201cWhen we started to look, the standards were lower than Red Tractor standards in the UK,\u201d he says, \u201cbut still safe and legal. Now they have natural light, we have changed stocking density so there is much less cannibalism, much less disease, all these things. The chickens are at RSPCA Freedom Food standards, which is the best scalable model. But, above all, it creates a welfare story in a country that doesn\u2019t have one.\u201d</p> <p>Oliver has learned to love the simple magic of making small changes at scale. \u201cYou can do the street food and farmers\u2019 markets and Feastivals,\u201d he says, \u201cand that\u2019s beautiful. The question for me now, though, is about how many of these standards can you get into all food production \u2013 then that becomes an incredible story.\u201d</p> <p>His gift for telling those kinds of stories has long been amplified across multiple platforms.<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jamieoliver/?hl=en\"> Instagram is his favourite </a>\u2013 \u201cit\u2019s a nicer space than Twitter \u2013 it\u2019s much harder to be mean-spirited and angry in pictures than words\u201d. And the sheer immediacy of the message doesn\u2019t cease to amaze him. As a case in point, the previous week he\u2019d come up with a neat little invention, a one-egg omelette for his daughter Petal\u2019s breakfast, cooked quite fiercely in a large pan and with just a few crumbs of cheddar and a pinch of pepper and then rolled like a little scarf and added to a piece of toast. He thought it a thing of beauty \u2013 \u201cthe proteins were so blond\u201d \u2013 called it a \u201csilky omelette\u201d and posted the \u201crecipe\u201d on Instagram. A day later it had received 2.5 million views and counting. He has become an instinctive connoisseur of media and messages. \u201cI know now if I write something slightly wrong it doesn\u2019t go viral but if I spend a bit of time getting it right, it goes nuts.\u201d (That power, for better and worse, is demonstrated a couple of weeks after we meet when Oliver succeeds in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/jamie-olivers-paella-chorizo-brings-fractured-spain-together-against-him\">\u201cuniting the Spanish nation against him\u201d</a> in so-called \u201cPaellagate\u201d)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb845a1fe57867b1ef33ed489486890af5d1d088\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb845a1fe57867b1ef33ed489486890af5d1d088/0_286_4601_2760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Oliver promoting Food Revolution Day in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Oliver promoting Food Revolution Day in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the early Channel 4 days when journalists used to sit Oliver down and ask what he was up to, he\u2019d say, \u201cI\u2019m the British food ambassador.\u201d If that sounded bolshie, what he meant was he\u2019d be on all these talk shows around the world, Jay Leno, Letterman, and every single time they would start with a gag about how bad British food was.</p> <p>\u201cI would spend the first third of the interview arguing it was really not shit,\u201d he says, \u201cand then try to cook something great to prove the point.\u201d These days, the ambassadorial boast is not an idle one. For the sugar tax announcement, he was at the World Health Assembly in Geneva and the health ministers from 156 countries were there listening.</p> <p>\u201cWithout sounding too pompous, I gave George [Osborne], bless him, the narrative,\u201d he says, \u201cthe whole medical story, the health data. But still, George was brave enough to do it. And he won himself the ovations for it.\u201d</p> <p>Oliver is less hopeful about the new government \u2013 one of Theresa May\u2019s first acts as prime minister was to dilute the \u201cobesity strategy\u201d that had been all but signed off by the Cameron government. \u201cI want her to succeed,\u201d Oliver says. \u201cBut it was a terrible start. I will probably see her in a month and she will tell me the reasons why she compromised so much she turned something of value for the nation\u2019s health into something of no value whatsoever.\u201d And then his fight will start again.</p> <p>I have a sense that he is more accepting of his vocation these days, having passed 40. Would it be fair to say that what seemed a bit like a burden now weighs less heavily since he has realised it is a lifelong commitment?</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely. You can guarantee that. I am not going anywhere. When I did the sugar campaign I never thought I would get the tax so quickly. But I thought I could get it eventually. We are always trying to plan further ahead. We really want to think more strategically, but to be honest we haven\u2019t yet got beyond kick, bollock, scramble.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s been spending a bit of time in the past couple of years with people over 100 years old, trying to learn their diet secrets. The thing that he has taken away is a very clear sense that it is not how long you live but how well you live that counts.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I did the sugar campaign I never thought I would get the tax so quickly.

It\u2019s hard not to respect all that life. And I\u2019d be asking my questions \u2026 Two eggs every day? What oils do you use? All that.\u201d</p> <p>Has he been struck by a sense of his own mortality, turning 40?</p> <p>\u201cTo be honest, I have always been quite sentimental about that stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cIt goes back to family, to Essex. Despite all that I\u2019ve learned, my general litmus is, if I am honest with myself, gut feeling. I have always known the things that we have tried that would go pear. They never felt right.\u201d</p> <p>Where does he think that gut feeling for what will work, what will seduce and engage people, comes from?</p> <p>\u201cSomewhere in there is the experience of growing up in a pub,\u201d he says. \u201cI still think a good pub is the most democratic place in the world. We had businessmen, Gypsies, farmers, pensioners, teenagers, whatever, all talking.\u201d</p> <p>He can\u2019t help thinking the gift of understanding that dynamic is in his blood.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I set up Fifteen,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich is one of the best things I have done, it was like I felt I had to. My dad only ever earned a hard quid, and then, at 20-odd, his son lucks out and sells all these books. I spent it all on Fifteen and I was really close to bankruptcy. In the back of my mind was my great-great grandfather who kept the Ten Bells on Spitalfields market \u2013 and did a soup kitchen on the side for recent immigrants, Portuguese Jews and whatever. In my romantic way I like to think that is deep within me. You can\u2019t run a good pub without caring about the whole community, the whole village \u2026\u201d</p> <p>And, he might add, the whole wide world. </p>",
  "<p>David Cameron is gone, and his \u201cno ifs, no buts\u201d rejection of a third runway at Heathrow is not binding on his successor. Boris Johnson, no longer mayor of London and told to be on best behaviour at the Foreign Office, has gone conspicuously quiet on Heathrow, where he once he threatened to lie down in front of bulldozers. Now no one even expects him to resign from the cabinet if the airport expansion gets a green light.</p> <p>We\u2019ll learn the truth as soon as next week but the rumour mill sounds correct. Theresa May will say yes to a third runway and will spout some banalities, straight from the airport\u2019s PR handbook, about how only Heathrow can deliver those connections to deepest China, India and Latin America that the UK will need to prosper in a post-Brexit world. Thus she will buy a short period of peace from the Heathrow-loving business lobby that is currently hopping mad about everything from \u201chard\u201d Brexit to workers on boards.</p> <p>It will be the wrong decision. Gatwick is the better choice on four grounds: cost, certainty, competition and pollution.</p> <p>On cost, the Airports Commission priced a third runway at Heathrow at \u00a317.6bn, versus \u00a37.1bn for a second runway at Gatwick. The money would be raised privately, of course, but the bill will ultimately fall on customers in the form of higher landing charges.</p> <p>But the cost estimate has to be taken with a pinch of salt when you consider the second factor. The only guaranteed arrival following approval for a third runway is that of a swarm of lawyers. The public inquiries and judicial reviews would last for years. By contrast, work on expanding Gatwick could start by the end of the decade, and with less fuss.</p> <p>The competition angle is crucial. The old BAA was privatised by the Thatcher government with a monopoly over London airports \u2013 Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. That structure is now seen as utterly mad. Smashing that monopoly in 2009, on the orders of the Competition Commission, encouraged competition, fuelled investment in Heathrow and Gatwick under separate owners, and made the flying experience less unpleasant. A third runway at Heathrow would make it harder for Gatwick to compete in the long-haul market; some of its short-haul traffic could even head to the larger airport.</p> <p>On pollution, relatively rural Gatwick is plainly the better choice: there are fewer homes there. At the time the commission was writing, the area around Heathrow was already breaching European regulations on nitrogen dioxide pollution.</p> <p>Sir Howard Davies\u2019s panel nevertheless preferred a third runway at Heathrow because its established status as a hub makes it better-placed to deliver more routes to more places. The benefits, it said, are \u201csignificantly greater, for business passengers, freight operators and the broader economy.\u201d That is almost certainly true in a world of theoretical economical modelling. In the real world, Gatwick is simply more likely to happen.</p> <p>If May wanted to attempt to square the circle, an alternative suggestion has been gaining popularity in some quarters: approve a second runway at Gatwick but give Heathrow permission to proceed with the first stage of the lower-cost idea of extending the existing northern runway.</p> <p>This is the \u201cHeathrow Hub\u201d proposal and one of its advantages is that extra capacity could be phased in: the extended runway could handle 70,000 additional aircraft movements a year while still using existing terminals. Expansion beyond that would require more infrastructure, but could be left for another day.</p> <p>The cost of phase one would also be relatively low \u2013 less than \u00a34bn, say the backers. Some of the same legal complexities would apply, but at least Gatwick would be happening and competition between the airports would be preserved. A joint Gatwick/Heathrow Hub ticket would be a fudge, or course. But solving this interminable problem question of airport capacity has always involved imperfect compromises.</p> <h2>William Hill merger deal leaves no one holding an ace</h2> <p>Less than a week after it was unveiled to surprised shareholders, William Hill\u2019s proposed \u00a36bn merger with Canadian-listed Amaya looks dead in the water.</p> <p>The bookmaker\u2019s biggest investor, Parvus Asset Management, holding a 14% stake, is fiercely and loudly opposed. Former chief executive Ralph Topping, who is still revered at William Hill as the man who outpaced Ladbrokes by several furlongs, also can\u2019t see the logic. \u201cWhen this deal was announced I was left scratching my head,\u201d Topping <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ad62772-91fc-11e6-a72e-b428cb934b78\" title=\"\">told the <em>FT</em></a>. \u201cI\u2019m very anxious on the future of William Hill.\u201d</p> <p>The sceptics are right. Amaya is an online poker company carrying a pile of debt. While, in theory, some of the players on its PokerStars website might be persuaded to have a flutter on William Hill\u2019s online sports offering, any precise projection is guesswork.</p> <p>What is certain is that the combined group\u2019s borrowings would rise well beyond levels William Hill has previously deemed prudent. There is also the small matter of Amaya\u2019s $870m (\u00a3713m) penalty for alleged breaches of Kentucky gambling law. The fine will probably end up being reduced, but by how much?</p> <p>Gareth Davis, William Hill\u2019s chairman, is an old hand whose touch is normally assured. He\u2019s seen more than a few deals over the years and will know that zero-premium \u201cmergers of equals\u201d, which is how this one is being advertised, require the advantages for both sides to be obvious on day one. The Amaya deal has failed to generate the required fizz of excitement.</p> <p>At the moment, it is merely a proposal, and Davis and co could claim they are required to give all proposals an exploratory poke. True enough, but investors also expect directors not to dawdle when resistance is so strong.</p> <p>In a gambling industry consolidating at speed, there is a fair argument that William Hill should combine with somebody. Just not Amaya. Davis and his interim chief executive, Philip Bowcock, should know that half the skill of poker is knowing when to fold a weak hand. That time is now.</p> <h2>Samsung must raise its game</h2> <p>Among the rifles and submachine guns in the weapons store, a Samsung Galaxy Note 7 glows threateningly inside its display case. Ignoring the Uzi, the thug in the video game opts for the smartphone. In the street, he launches it like a grenade at moving vehicles. Explosions, fireballs, carnage!</p> <p>The flame-prone handset was withdrawn from sale last week, but not before inspiring a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GhODn4FRoE\" title=\"\"><em>Grand Theft Auto </em>tribute</a>. The Note 7 is gone, and Samsung executives must hope it will soon be forgotten.</p> <p>The Seoul firm sells more phones than anyone else because its technology works, is cutting edge \u2013 and is cheaper than Apple\u2019s. But its flagship devices are not particularly cheap. The Note 7 would have cost \u00a3700 in the UK. At that price, customers rightly expect a brand that puts consumer safety first.</p> <p>Samsung took more than a month to scrap its botched product but it will take it far longer to recover from the reputational hit.</p>",

Here we\u2019re in Eckhausen, a (fictional) British army town near Hanover, though I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s little fictional about the greyness, the slush, the chilblained fingers, the wartime ruins. Nor the sense of menace: small-town Germany would appear to have just as many tawdry secrets, trivial and monstrous, as any <em>d\u00e9partement</em> of northern France.</p> <p>From the off, it\u2019s clear writers Harry and Jack Williams have given us another slice of quality bleak, yet different enough to stand proudly, almost haughtily, discrete from the first. In the original, a boy, Olly, went (shockingly) missing: but for a long time that was about it. Here they packed, into one small hour, more and disturbingly more turns and twists than we had any right to expect: I was left reeling a little.</p> <p>The missing of this tale is a girl, Alison, kidnapped for 11 years, who suddenly, in 2014, wanders back into the world; into a cheap smoky Christmas market leached of colour and littered with lumpy ice: you can practically smell that horrid too-pink ersatz wurst.

In the sun-riddled environs of the San Fernando valley and Venice Beach, lawyer Billy Bob Thornton hides from the vitamin D in faintly grubby bars, all brown wood, brown memories and tatty fairylights; this is the California of tyre stores and nail parlours in much the same way as that woeful cheerless Christmas market is the reality of much of Lower Saxony.</p> <p>By common consent, he drinks too much (and always has the rejoinder: \u201cThat\u2019s not entirely accurate.

We are the losers in a modern game in which only \u201csmart people\u201d, as Trump indelicately put it, know the rules. In fact, the rich and powerful quietly exited from the business of paying tax a long time ago.</p> <p>The evidence is all around. A new study of America\u2019s leading <a href=\"http://ctj.org/ctjreports/2016/10/offshore_shell_games_2016.php#.V_-1OzYrKrM\">Fortune 500 companies</a> reveals that 367 of them \u2013 some 73% \u2013 have at least one or more subsidiaries in tax havens. Some have hundreds. This allows them to legally ship profits offshore.</p> <p>In Britain, meanwhile, it emerged that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/08/ebay-pays-11m-uk-tax-on-revenues-it-told-us-investors-were-11bn\"> eBay paid just \u00a31.1m in tax</a> last year, despite telling US investors that the UK was its second largest market, generating revenues of \u00a31.1bn. The cash originating in the UK flows to a parent company in Switzerland.</p> <p>The mind-boggling scale of the problem is laid bare in a slew of books and reports that reveal the way in which multinational companies have excused themselves from paying vast amounts of tax.</p> <p>The companies are a who\u2019s who of global brands: Apple, Nike, Google, Pepsi, Pfizer, Walmart, Goldman Sachs, and practically every other multinational in business.</p> <p>The detail can be complicated, but the method is simple \u2013 and legal. Companies set up subsidiaries in low or no-tax jurisdictions. These subsidiaries then charge the onshore parent for services or intellectual property or whatever, with the profits then funnelled legally offshore. US companies are only obliged to pay tax when they bring the money back. Which they don\u2019t.</p> <p>The study of America\u2019s Fortune 500 companies shows that they collectively avoid an estimated $100bn in federal taxes each year. The most popular tax haven is the Netherlands. Bermuda and the Cayman Islands are not far behind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f7a11df662e9190a57b6d4912145bda139423d35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7a11df662e9190a57b6d4912145bda139423d35/0_122_2327_1396/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Cook said the EU ruling that Apple had to pay $14.5bn in back taxes to Ireland was  \u2018political crap\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Cook said the EU ruling that Apple had to pay $14.5bn in back taxes to Ireland was \u2018political crap\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toru Hanai/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The worst offender is Apple. It has booked $214.9bn offshore, a sum greater than any other company\u2019s offshore cash pile. If these profits were held in the US they would incur $65.4bn in tax. The European Commission recently ordered Apple to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\">pay Ireland $14.5 billion in back taxes</a>; its Irish subsidiaries were paying an effective tax rate of 0.005%. Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, dismissed the ruling as \u201cpolitical crap\u201d.</p> <p>As a result it is ordinary taxpayers who have to pick up the tab. Last year George Osborne introduced a \u201cdiverted profit tax\u201d aimed at large companies that shift income artificially offshore. It\u2019s unclear if the former chancellor\u2019s initiative will work. Last weekend the <em>Observer</em> reported that Facebook had ended up with an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/09/facebook-uk-ends-up-11m-in-tax-credit-despite-global-profits-of-5bn\">\u00a311.3m tax credit on its UK business</a>. This is a company that made a global profit last year of $6.19bn.</p> <p>The new books include a page-turning account of the investigation into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\">Panama Papers</a>. And an enterprising account of the wealth management industry by a writer who spent two years undercover as a trainee.</p> <p>Published last April, the Panama Papers were the fruits of a thrilling journalistic investigation. The papers \u2013 some 11.5m leaked documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca \u2013 give an unprecedented insight into the offshore world. They expose something obvious, previously hidden in plain sight. Namely that the global offshore industry \u2013 centred in tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands \u2013 was not, as had been thought, a shadowy but minor part of our economic system. Rather it was the system. It is this system that has allowed the burden of taxation to move inexorably from multinational corporations and the well-off to the \u201cunsmart\u201d: the dupes; you and me.</p> <p>The journalists who unearthed this bitter truth were Bastian Obermayer and Frederik Obermaier of Germany\u2019s <em>S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung</em>. (They are not related, but their German and international colleagues fondly nickname them the \u201cbrothers Obermay/ier\u201d.) The paper, based in Munich, has an excellent track record of working on difficult and important investigations.</p> <p>Reporters often get offered information, stuff. I know from previous investigations that this often turns out to be disappointing. As Obermayer recounts, in early 2015, late one evening, he received an anonymous message. It said: \u201cHello. John Doe here. Interested in secret data?\u201d Obermayer replied: \u201cAlways interested in secret data. What is it?\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cit\u201d turned out to be bigger than anyone might have imagined. The source \u2013 his or her identity remains unknown \u2013 had got hold of Mossack Fonseca\u2019s entire internal database. The legal practice was founded in 1977 by an ambitious Panamanian lawyer and the son of a Waffen SS officer. It specialised in setting up anonymous offshore shell companies.</p> <p>The source\u2019s motivation was simple. Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/edward-snowden\">Edward Snowden</a>, who lifted the lid on mass electronic surveillance, John Doe was a whistleblower. He/she wanted to expose the scale of injustice of the offshore tax system. Mossack Fonseca denies any wrongdoing.</p> <p>The leak was an act of bravery and amounted to the biggest data dump ever, delivered in real-time instalments. We got a whopping 2.6 terabytes. This was far larger than the top-secret Snowden files or the diplomatic cables leaked in 2010 by an unhappy US army private, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chelsea-manning\">Chelsea Manning</a>, which revealed Washington\u2019s frank views of its global friends and enemies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"80e2012fc53e6224282b6f563ec3b6b96256b854\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80e2012fc53e6224282b6f563ec3b6b96256b854/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leaked database from the Mossack Fonseca law firm in Panama revealed the extent of the use of offshore shell companies.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leaked database from the Mossack Fonseca law firm in Panama revealed the extent of the use of offshore shell companies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Jasso/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Panama Papers include records of 214,000 offshore companies, names of real or \u201cbeneficial\u201d owners, and passport scans. There are bank statements, electricity bills and email chains. Often these are between Mossack Fonseca\u2019s head office in Panama and \u201cintermediaries\u201d, typically other lawyers, accountants and banks.</p> <p>Behind them were a large and diverse group of affluent individuals. We looked, naturally enough, for politicians and those holding public office. But the majority of names in the database belonged to what you might call the non-famous international rich. There were French dentists, Spanish lawyers and Swiss aristocrats, all seeking to minimise their taxes.</p> <p>The leak led to a year-long international collaboration in 80 countries. <em>S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung </em>shared its material with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which is based in Washington.</p> <p>The ICIJ in turn gave access to the data to 100 media organisations and nearly 400 reporters. In Britain that was my newspaper the <em>Guardian</em> and the BBC.</p> <p>The journalists gave the leaked files a name. The Panama Papers was a conscious echo of the Pentagon Papers: volumes of secret documents leaked in 1971 by Daniel Ellsberg which revealed the true US war in Vietnam. Ellsberg swiped a mere 7,000 pages. We had enough reading material to last us about 25 years.</p> <p>I found myself back in the <em>Guardian</em>\u2019s investigations \u201cbunker\u201d. (Actually, it had a bucolic view of Regent\u2019s canal in London: houseboats, joggers, coots.) In 2013 I\u2019d been part of a small group which had studied the Snowden files here. We speculated at the time that MI6 had taken up residence in the flats opposite.</p> <p>This project was different. By means of a secure platform, called the iHub, journalists were encouraged not to compete with each other but to share information and to swap leads and tips. We did, in a flurry of encrypted emails. There were clandestine reporter meetings in Washington, Munich, and London.</p> <p>Early on we looked for Trump. Perhaps the database would point us towards his alleged secret fortune? It didn\u2019t. I did dig up a Russian businessman escaping from Moscow who wanted to buy an apartment in the Trump Ocean Club tower in Panama City. (The agent knocked off $200,000, offering the Trump penthouse for a bargain price of $2.31m.)</p> <p>Other themes gradually became clear. Britain, it turned out, didn\u2019t just feature via UK Crown dependencies like Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. Rather, it was the heart of the Mossack Fonseca multiverse. True, many of those diverting funds offshore were located in far-away kleptocracies: Russian oligarchs, African despots, and bagmen for Syria\u2019s murderer-president Bashar al-Assad.</p> <p>But it was British lawyers, banks and company formation agents that were facilitating this global tax avoidance. Often, the enablers were top London law firms. Their websites look eminently respectable: a view of Georgian stucco, offices in exclusive postcodes, a smart Farrow and Ball front door with neatly topiaried trees.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Britain didn\u2019t just feature via UK Crown dependencies. Rather, it was the heart of the rotten Mossack Fonseca multiverse</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The leaked documents told a different story. Sometimes, the lawyers would lie about their clients\u2019 identities and connections. Under banking regulations firms were meant to declare if a client was a politically exposed person or \u201cPEP\u201d. This would lead to stricter checks. The solution was to say nothing in the paperwork about a client\u2019s PEP status. In return, big fees.</p> <p>There may not have been bodies on the streets of Belgravia or Knightsbridge. But it was hard to escape the dispiriting sense that the British were the biggest crooks on the planet. Behind the facade of legal piety we were enabling an orgy of transnational theft, and the looting of entire continents such as Africa.</p> <p>The California-based French economist Gabriel Zucman estimates that 8% of the world\u2019s wealth \u2013 $7.6tn (\u00a35.3tn) \u2013 is currently stashed in tax havens. Zucman puts the loss to global tax revenues at $200bn per year. That includes $35bn in the US and $78bn in Europe. What might we do instead with this money?</p> <p>As President Obama noted tax avoidance was a huge global problem, made worse by the fact that offshore structures are perfectly legal. Many of these havens operate under British jurisdiction. More than half of Mossack Fonseca\u2019s companies are registered in the British Virgin Islands, a territory administered from London. The BVI has stubbornly rejected calls for greater transparency. Successive British governments have failed to act.</p> <p>We spent most of our bunker hours working the big names. They included David Cameron, who features indirectly, as well as a host of other colourful figures including Iceland\u2019s prime minister and Vladimir Putin\u2019s KGB-turned-oligarch pals.</p> <p>The database revealed that the offshore fund run by Cameron\u2019s late father Ian had paid no British tax. For three decades. The fund, Blairmore Holdings Inc, had gone to absurd lengths to pretend that it was based in the Bahamas, another major tax haven.</p> <p>It hired a small army of Bahamas residents to sign paperwork. One of them was a part-time bishop. All of this was legal \u2013 but a pantomime designed to keep Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs at bay.</p> <p>In the run up to publication, slotted for 3 April, we had two worries. One, that our investigation might itself leak. Journalists are a gossipy bunch. Two, that nobody would care. After all, when the <em>Guardian</em> published Snowden\u2019s revelations of state spying in 2013 most people in Britain \u2013 the land of James Bond \u2013 reacted with a weary shrug.</p> <p>In the end we needn\u2019t have worried. In Iceland the prime minister resigned. In Argentina there were protests. In Azerbaijan a small war suddenly initiated \u2013 so some believed \u2013 to distract from revelations featuring the president and his daughters. In China censors blocked the words \u201cPanama Papers\u201d and jammed the website of the <em>Guardian.</em> In Russia officials fumed about a western \u201cspy\u201d conspiracy.</p> <p>Downing Street refused to answer questions about Cameron\u2019s tax affairs, saying that they were a \u201cprivate matter\u201d. Eventually Cameron came clean: he\u2019d owned shares in his father\u2019s tax haven fund. He sold them for \u00a331,500 just before becoming prime minister in 2010.</p> <p>Cameron was reluctant to acknowledge what was obvious: that part of his family\u2019s fortune came from privileged offshore wealth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe4e015edf23411e0a502442aff3595bdc000770\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe4e015edf23411e0a502442aff3595bdc000770/0_403_6706_4025/1000.jpg\" alt=\"More than half of the companies that appear in the Panama Papers are registered in the British Virgin Islands\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">More than half of the companies that appear in the Panama Papers are registered in the British Virgin Islands</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Viewed in retrospect, this was the beginning of the end of Cameron. Weeks later he hosted a global anti-corruption summit in London. He announced a clampdown on offshore havens. The UK would introduce a new register that would compel foreign companies owning British property to declare their owner, thereby cleaning up London as a centre for international money-laundering.</p> <p>It was a start. But Cameron stopped short of compelling British overseas territories from outing the real owners of offshore firms. Without a public register the offshore industry \u2013 with its satellites of lawyers and banks \u2013 was free to carry on as before. The BVI, meanwhile, boycotted the London summit and stayed at home.</p> <p>The picture, then, is a lousy one. But the Panama Papers offer a few rays of hope. In recent years the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and western governments have tried to clamp down on tax evasion, mindful of the billions being lost during a time of austerity. Pressure has been growing on offshore centres to swap information. Increasingly, the Swiss and others are complying.</p> <p>All this has induced a degree of paranoia among Mossack Fonseca\u2019s well-heeled clients. Emails show that the super-rich have adopted various protective strategies to stop the tax man from knocking. Some of them use fake names. We found Harry Potter, Winnie Pooh and Daniel Radcliffe. (Not the real one.) Plus Isaac Azimov, who turned out to be a tax lawyer from Barcelona.</p> <p>Offshore agents report that their Italian clients are going to desperate lengths to avoid being caught. When visiting Switzerland they leave the Ferrari behind and take a less conspicuous car. They also seek to cover their trail by \u201clayering\u201d: using a chain of offshore companies, rather than just one, to bury an asset.</p> <p>Still, the past six months have seen a victory of sorts for those of us, the little people, who do pay our taxes. From now on, the super-rich and other characters who use exotic offshore structures will be a nervous bunch. How long, they must be wondering, before the next leak?</p>",

But beyond this there are long-term issues which need to be tackled as part of the planning for Brexit.</p> <p>Top of the list is the free movement of academics and students. There is already a visa regime for academics and researchers from outside the EU which is so tight it can inhibit legitimate research contacts. For example, the government is focused on the problem of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/14/antibiotic-resistance-what-you-need-to-know\" title=\"\">antimicrobial resistance</a>, and so academics from developing countries most affected by the problem are invited to contribute to conferences here about it; but they then get their applications for visas turned down. There is a risk that EU academics might in future be subject to a similarly strict visa regime, which could obstruct their ability to move here, either to work or even just to come to meetings. That is why our universities need confidence that the visa regime will make it easy for academics at all levels \u2013 including postgraduate students \u2013 to move here easily.</p> <p>The effect on undergraduates is another concern. At the moment, EU students pay the regulated \u00a39,000 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/tuition-fees\" title=\"\">fees</a> and are eligible for student loans. They will presumably become like other international students with unrestricted fees and no access to loans. The pessimists fear that EU students will be put off by higher fees with no loans. But if our universities provide a world-class education, there is a chance that they could actually get more revenues from them. The visa regime is crucial here. It makes no sense to try to restrict the number of legitimate overseas students coming to study at our universities \u2013 they are a fantastic export opportunity.</p> <p>The talk of only letting in the \u201cbrightest and the best\u201d misses the point. They are not migrants \u2013 we quite rightly expect these students to return home at the end of their course. They need to have the mastery of English and the academic aptitude to benefit from higher education, but we do not need to be more selective than that. We do not say that the car industry should only sell Bentleys abroad, not Minis. We do not say they should only sell to drivers with an advanced motoring qualification. Higher education for overseas students is a legitimate transaction, selling a fantastic British service. It is not the same as recruiting migrant workers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The government knows there are problems and is trying to help. But there are long-term issues that need to be tackled</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We are so focused on attracting overseas students to Britain that we sometimes lose sight of the opposite challenge \u2013 encouraging more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jun/29/the-great-escape-five-reasons-to-study-abroad-for-a-masters\" title=\"\">British students to study abroad</a>. This broadens their horizons and strengthens long-term links with key countries. At the moment, only about 30,000 British students study abroad, an extraordinarily low number. Unlike many other countries, we do not provide any help with the cost of their fees. The loans no longer available to EU students to study here should instead be made available to English students wanting to study abroad.</p> <p>So, for example, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/oct/29/monash-warwick-alliance-global-education\" title=\"\">University of Warwick has close ties to Monash</a>, one of Australia\u2019s leading universities, and was planning an integrated course which included Warwick students doing a year there. But they could not receive loans from the British government to cover their education, whereas Australian students here do get some help from their government. The <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2016-17/highereducationandresearch.html\" title=\"\">Higher Education and Research bill</a> is a great opportunity to make these loans available to British students for study in countries that ministers specify. This is all part of the opening up to the wider world which the Brexiters say they want. And if it encourages more people to study abroad, it even reduces net migration.</p> <p>This still leaves the worries of the research community about reduced participation in research collaborations. There are lots of ideas about how to respond. Some universities are thinking of setting up operations on the continent in order to stay within these valuable networks. Another possibility is to join EU research programmes without being a member \u2013 that is what Switzerland has done for example, though it is now caught up in a dispute with the EU, which has suspended their participation after they voted in a referendum for more controls on migration. A third way round the problem is to run our own scheme in parallel with the EU to fund British participation in EU programmes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/14/all-eyes-on-the-red-planet-as-esas-lander-prepares-to-hurtle-towards-mars\">All eyes on the red planet as ESA's lander prepares to hurtle towards Mars</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some of Europe\u2019s key research and innovation networks are already intergovernmental, not part of the EU. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/european-space-agency\" title=\"\">European Space Agency</a>, which provided <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jun/18/tim-peake-grim-week-earth-mission-work-together\" title=\"\">Tim Peake</a> with his mission and which now has a base in Harwell after I \u2013 when minister for universities and science \u2013 boosted our contribution to it, is a great way to collaborate with other countries in science and technology. The European Molecular Biology Laboratory has the excellent European Bioinformatics Institute at Hinxton outside Cambridge. Its headquarters are in Heidelberg, a source of great pride in Germany. A top-level visit there with a strong message of support for that kind of research collaboration would help undo some of the damage done by German reporting, especially of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/this-is-what-theresa-mays-tory-britain-will-look-like\" title=\"\">Tory party conference</a>.</p> <p>The government has already signalled it understands the importance of these intergovernmental agencies by offering to offset the increase in the cost of our contributions because of the weakness of the pound. But we need to go further with positive efforts to increase our involvement in science and technology collaborations with countries across the world. The prime minister has told me that she sees the importance of this \u2013 and I hope it remains a priority for her government. </p> <p><em>David Willetts is executive chair of the Resolution Foundation, and is a former minister for universities and science</em></p>"
