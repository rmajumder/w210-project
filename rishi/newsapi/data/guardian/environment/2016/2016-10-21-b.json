Those are important states for Trump, but not sufficient for him to win the presidency if he loses states like Florida or North Carolina.</p> <p>\u201cThe Trump campaign should be concerned,\u201d said Scott Tranter, co-founder of Optimus, a Republican data analytics firm. His firm\u2019s analysis suggests a \u201cstrong final showing for the Clinton campaign\u201d in early voting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91724e6b48fd50b00e50d62c383c3cb298c8139a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91724e6b48fd50b00e50d62c383c3cb298c8139a/0_47_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barria/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Clinton campaign is looking to build an insurmountable lead in Florida and North Carolina during early voting. If she wins either of those states, she\u2019ll probably be the next president.</p> <p>Using 2012 as a guidepost, she appears to be in a strong position in early voting.</p> <p>While Democrats tend to do better in early voting, Republicans usually post an initial lead with mail-in ballots before Democrats surpass them during in-person early voting in mid to late October.</p> <p>Democrats so far have kept it close with mail-in ballots, giving Clinton a chance to run up the score with in-person early voting. To do that, she\u2019ll need non-whites and young people to turn out near the high levels they did in 2012 for Barack Obama.</p> <p>In North Carolina, Democrats have moved ahead of Republicans in early voting. Republicans had held a modest lead based on mail-in ballots returned, but that was at a much narrower margin than in 2012, when Mitt Romney narrowly won the state. After in-person voting began on Thursday, Democrats overtook Republicans in overall votes cast.</p> <p>In Florida, a record 3.1 million people have requested ballots, more than one-third of the total voters in 2012. Democrats have requested almost as many ballots as Republicans: 39 percent vs. 40 percent.</p> <p>By comparison, in 2008, Republicans held a lead of 49 percent to 32 percent in requests, according to an analysis for AP by Catalist, a Democratic analytical firm. Obama won in Florida in 2008 and 2012.</p> <p>Democrats are also showing momentum in the 2nd congressional district of both Maine and Nebraska. The two states allocate electoral votes by congressional district.</p> <p>There\u2019s more where that came from. <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/8aeeaf8ed917469da03b1381cbe13d47/Early-voting:-Democrats-show-strength-in-key-battlegrounds\">Read further here</a>. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580a3eb8e4b055209adaff6f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T17:14:13.232Z\">6.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Clinton to meet with Black Lives Matter activists</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In advance of her rally in Cleveland, Ohio, this afternoon, Hillary Clinton will meet with Movement for Black Lives activists Brittany Packnett and DeRay Mckesson, her campaign reports.

I mean, when Michelle, you know, she had her own sort of professional life, and she was very committed, as she is now, to the kids. And so there was this understanding between them before he ran for president that you know, that was his career. She would be as supportive as she could, but she wasn\u2019t really involved. You know, she wasn\u2019t, she didn\u2019t campaign terribly much for him in 2004 when he ran for the Senate, for example, a campaign that I was involved in.

  "<p>The suggestion that the previous government failed to address questions surrounding air quality (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/19/cameron-aide-said-government-was-exposed-on-heathrow-over-air-quality\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 20 October) does not reflect the progress that has been made on the issue since December 2015. Since then, the government\u2019s air quality plan, updated modelling undertaken by Heathrow and an independent study by Cambridge University have all shown that baseline air-quality levels around the airport will have significantly improved by the time a new runway is built, as the nation\u2019s vehicle fleet gradually becomes cleaner.</p> <p>The Airports Commission\u2019s analysis concluded that a third runway at Heathrow can be delivered in accordance with EU air-quality limit law, and would have less impact on health receptors (where people live and work) than a runway at Gatwick would have on the community in that area. A new runway at the UK\u2019s hub airport represents an opportunity to deliver significant improvements to air quality around Heathrow: the redesign of local roads, support for sustainable transport and the opportunity to introduce an airport emissions charge all have the potential to bring improvements in air quality.</p> <p>Since the Airports Commission\u2019s unanimous recommendation to the prime minister that Heathrow should expand, we have put in place a triple-lock guarantee on air quality. This includes a commitment to meeting our existing targets to improve air quality, ensuring that action can be taken if required to reduce road traffic and a commitment that extra capacity at an expanded Heathrow will only be released when it is clear that the airport\u2019s contribution will not delay compliance with EU air quality limits.</p> <p>Expanding Heathrow will deliver up to \u00a3211bn in economic benefits for the whole of the UK, creating up to 180,000 new jobs and 10,000 apprenticeships. It has the support of unions, business, local residents and politicians, with 71% of Conservative MPs and 73% of Labour MPs backing a third runway in a recent poll of parliamentarians.</p> <p>The government\u2019s decision on airport capacity follows a rigorous, independent, \u00a320m, two-and-a-half-year deep-dive into the issue, including a public consultation. It confirmed that Heathrow would not delay compliance with EU air quality limits, would see fewer people affected by noise and is the best choice for expansion. Now it\u2019s time to get on with it and make a decision for all of Britain.

  "<p>Four years ago Mitt Romney became a global laughing stock when he talked proudly about \u201cbinders full of women\u201d. It was a funny phrase, no doubt about it. But <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfXgpem78kQ\">watch the clip</a> now, and it\u2019s hard not to feel sympathy for the hapless Romney. He was recalling his spell as governor of Massachusetts and his discovery on taking office that too many senior posts were filled by men. He told his aides to encourage more female applicants, and they duly returned with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2012/oct/17/binders-full-of-women-romneys-four-words\">\u201cbinders full of women\u201d</a>, a move that eventually led Romney to have the most gender-balanced senior team of all 50 US state governors. But he worded it badly, so he became an object of derision.</p> <p>How long ago that seems now. While the 2012 campaign\u2019s idea of a sexist outrage was a poor turn of phrase hinting at tokenism and condescension, 2016 has seen the nominee of a major party exposed as a perpetrator of sexual assault. Recorded on tape admitting that his modus operandi is to force himself on women, push his tongue down their throats without their consent and to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">\u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d</a>, Donald Trump has since been confronted by at least 10 women who have testified that this was indeed his method \u2013 and that what he said into that hot mic in 2005 was the truth.</p> <p>But we didn\u2019t need to hear that recording to know Trump is an aggressive misogynist. His serial outrages are well known.He has called women dogs and pigs; he humiliated the winner of his Miss Universe beauty pageant for gaining weight, forcing her to exercise in front of the cameras; he rates women\u2019s bodies out of 10; he dismissed Republican rival Carly Fiorina on the grounds that no one would vote for \u201cthat face\u201d; he suggested TV anchor Megyn Kelly was hostile because \u201cshe had blood coming out of her wherever\u201d. Even when seeking to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-forced-into-apology-as-sex-boast-tape-horrifies-republicans\">rebut the charges</a> of sexual assault, he couldn\u2019t help himself. His defence amounted to: \u201cHave you seen what these women look like? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p> <p>This is such a swift degeneration from the public mores that America and the wider world had arrived at \u2013 and which had seemed steady and settled \u2013 that it can be hard to take in. It\u2019s not that long ago that George W Bush received a global, and deserved, scolding for the unsolicited shoulder massage he fleetingly administered to Angela Merkel, which triggered a recoil reflex she could not conceal. Now you have a succession of credible accusers saying a would-be president thinks nothing of seizing women by the genitals.</p> <p>As Michelle Obama put it in perhaps the <a href=\"https://mic.com/articles/156767/read-the-full-text-of-michelle-obama-s-powerful-speech-denouncing-donald-trump#.HRzP4Ddxx\">most powerful speech</a> of the presidential campaign: \u201cWe thought all of that was ancient history, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p> <p>Of course, that was a comforting delusion. You only have to read a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/29/roger-ailes-sexual-harassment-fox-news-laurie-luhn\">fraction of the accusations</a> of appalling sexual harassment and abuse of power levelled at Roger Ailes \u2013 the former overlord of Fox News, now reborn as an adviser to (who else?) Donald Trump \u2013 to know that such behaviour never stopped. Glance at the experiences shared online by EverydaySexism or under the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/donald-trump-groping-not-okay-hashtag_uk_57fa5e9ae4b04e1174a4c775\">notokay</a> hashtag, and you know that men abusing women did not end in the 1970s.</p> <p>Nevertheless the standard society set for itself aimed higher. Publicly, it deemed certain behaviour and attitudes unacceptable. Of course, the new standard was not always respected. But the line was drawn in a new place.</p> <p>This is what Trump threatens. The way he both talks and acts seeks to roll back those 25 years of progress, sanctioning language and conduct that many had hoped was banished. The hope is that, if the polls are right and Trump is crushed next month, this will come to be seen as an aberration, allowing America to return to the more civil, more respectful habits it thought it had entrenched. The gloomier prospect is that the painstaking work of the last generation will have to be done all over again.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, this isn\u2019t only about Trump. Fate conspired to pit perhaps the most misogynistic nominee in US history against the first female nominee. (Perhaps that\u2019s no coincidence.) But even without Trump\u2019s disgusting boorishness, the mere presence of Hillary Clinton\u2019s name on the ballot may well have unleashed a torrent of misogyny. Witness the merchandise I saw on sale outside the Republican convention in Cleveland this summer. Among the slogans were: KFC Hillary Special: 2 fat thighs, 2 small breasts \u2026 left wing. Also: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/trump-adviser-al-baldasaro-hillary-clinton-firing-line\">Hillary Sucks, But Not Like Monica</a>. And the hardy perennial: Life\u2019s a Bitch, Don\u2019t Vote for One.</p> <p>The intensity of this hatred can\u2019t be explained solely by the controversies over Clinton\u2019s emails, her hawkishness or links to Wall Street. More Americans have a \u201cstrongly unfavourable\u201d view of Clinton than of any Democratic nominee since pollsters started asking the question. Some will say that\u2019s because she\u2019s a lacklustre campaigner. But compare her with, say, John Kerry, who was hardly electrifying on the stump in 2004. Among white men, 52% hold a \u201cvery unfavourable\u201d view of her, compared with the 24% who took a similarly dim view of Kerry. It takes a wilful blindness to think this has nothing to do with the fact that Clinton is a woman.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/10/fear-of-a-female-president/497564/\">fascinating essay</a> for this month\u2019s Atlantic, Peter Beinart surveyed the academic research that found men (and plenty of women) unnerved by women in traditionally male roles, especially overtly ambitious women, judging them more harshly than they would men. Roles don\u2019t get much more traditionally male than the US presidency. What\u2019s more, Beinart cites polling that shows Clinton has been at her most popular when \u201cconforming to traditional gender roles (working on women\u2019s issues as first lady, sticking by her husband during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, loyally serving Barack Obama as secretary of state), and least popular when violating them (heading the healthcare task force, serving in the Senate, running for president).\u201d</p> <p>The most obvious manifestation of this sexist hostility to Hillary is in the hatred spat out by Trump and his most devoted followers. But might some of that same sexism lurk in the now cliched insistence that she\u2019s a terrible candidate, that Trump v Clinton is like choosing between cholera and gonorrhea, as Julian Assange memorably <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2016/7/25/julian_assange_choosing_between_trump_or\">put it</a>, that progressives can only vote for her while holding their nose?</p> <p>Michelle Obama was right: no candidate in the modern era has ever been more qualified. Clinton won <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/19/13340828/hillary-clinton-debate-trump-won\">all three debates</a> by outwitting Trump, luring him into one trap after another. She is serious, sober, prepared and with a detailed grasp of policy. And, despite Trump\u2019s taunts to the contrary, she has demonstrated extraordinary stamina. Yet somehow, for some, she\u2019s still not quite good enough.</p> <p>The optimistic view is that the best remedy for this strain of sexism is simply for America to see a woman in the White House and get used to it. But the depressing evidence of the last eight years is that racial resentment actually rose rather than fell while Obama was in the Oval Office. It suggests that neither electing Clinton nor defeating Trump will be enough to defeat the demons unleashed by this campaign. That work won\u2019t end on 8 November. It will begin.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 October 2016 to correct the spelling of Carly Fiorina\u2019s first name.<br></p>",
  "<p>Lewis Hamilton, even at his most graciously well behaved, has been outmanoeuvred by his rival Nico Rosberg in the buildup to Sunday\u2019s United States Grand Prix.</p> <p>Hamilton, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/20/lewis-hamilton-f1-title-nico-rosberg\" title=\"\">when asked how he would feel if he lost his world title</a>, said he would take it like a man.

It won\u2019t make me any faster this weekend if I think how I might feel if I lose. That doesn\u2019t work. I am just planning to go for more race wins at the moment and that\u2019s it.\u201d</p> <p>Hamilton loves this circuit, its swoops and climbs, its fast curves and overtaking possibilities, and he was quickest in Friday morning\u2019s practice, beating Rosberg by 0.315 seconds, though he was slower in the afternoon. He may well win here on Sunday \u2013 he usually does, having been victorious in three of the four races staged at the Circuit of the Americas. It\u2019s easy to see him cavorting again under his black Stetson and in a haze of sprayed champagne at the top of the podium. But even that, and three other wins in the remaining races, might not be enough to bring down the remorselessly consistent Rosberg.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/20/lewis-hamilton-f1-title-nico-rosberg\">Lewis Hamilton ready to move on and come back stronger if he loses F1 title</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In downtown Austin the other evening Mercedes invited F1 correspondents into their virtual garage.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/britishamericantobacco\">British American Tobacco</a> has offered to pay $47bn (\u00a338bn) for full control of Reynolds American in a takeover that would create the world\u2019s biggest tobacco company.</p> <p>The cash-plus-shares deal would plunge BAT back into the US market after a 12-year absence and is also expected to speed the development of e-cigarettes and vapes.</p> <p>BAT, whose brands include Lucky Strike and Benson &amp; Hedges, already owns 42.2% of Reynolds and is offering to buy the remainder of the firm, which traces its roots back to before the American war of independence.</p> <p>The British firm has owned a stake in Reynolds since 2004, when it merged its US subsidiary Brown &amp; Williamson with RJ Reynolds Tobacco to create Reynolds American.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the moment Reynolds American was born, this was always the most likely outcome,\u201d said Cenkos Securities analyst Rae Maile. \u201cThe US marketplace is fundamentally very attractive and offers a source of sustainable profit growth.\u201d</p> <p>BAT said it was prepared to pay $56.50 a share, comprising $24.13 in cash and $32.37 in shares. The offer, structured as a merger, is worth 20% more than Reynolds\u2019 closing price on Thursday and values the US company at \u00a366bn.

Population growth means that while smoking rates are falling, the number of smokers has remained relatively constant at about 45 million people for several decades.</p> <p>US cigarettes are also relatively cheap compared with prices in the UK, leaving scope for the company to boost profits by raising prices.</p> <p>A tie-up would also allow BAT and Reynolds to build on their existing technology-sharing partnership in e-cigarettes and vapes.<br></p> <p>The nascent market for what Reynolds calls \u201ccigalike products\u201d has no dominant player, but BAT would be able to combine its Vype brand with the US firm\u2019s Vuse products.</p> <p>BAT said it expected cost savings of $400m, a relatively low figure for such a large merger because its lack of presence in the US means there is limited overlap in their businesses.<br></p> <p>Nicandro Durante, BAT\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe proposed merger of our two great companies is the logical progression in our relationship and offers all shareholders a stake in a stronger, truly global tobacco and next-generation products company.\u201d<br></p> <p>BAT said Reynolds shareholders would gain from the deal by holding shares in a bigger company with the clout to sell Reynolds\u2019 brands round the world.<br></p> <p>Guy Ellison, the head of UK equities at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, said that while the timing of the move was a surprise, the strategic rationale made \u201cperfect sense, pivoting BAT further towards the high-value US market, consolidating some strong brands and Reynolds\u2019 position in next-generation tobacco\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>My colleague and friend Jim Wilson, who has died aged 82, was a former county planning officer for County Durham. Over the 30 years from 1956, he helped guide Durham\u2019s environmental and economic transformation. Jim worked on plans for the renewal of the old county, which then stretched between the Tyne and the Tees. Under his stewardship, derelict land from the closure of coalmines, coke works, heavy industry and railways was transformed into industrial estates, country parks, picnic areas, farmland and wildlife sites.</p> <p>In all, 44 square miles of land, including some of the country\u2019s largest pit heaps, were levelled, covered with topsoil and planted with more than 2.5m trees. This is one of the most beneficial landscape improvements in Europe of modern times, as was recognised later by the accolade of a Europa Nostra award.</p> <p>Even so, the landscape had to be protected from opencast coal mining, and Jim fought battles over the impact and restoration of these sites. At the same time, neglect and disrepair of town and village centres was tackled through conservation and improvement schemes in the city of Durham, Barnard Castle, Bishop Auckland, Consett, Seaham and villages in Weardale and Teesdale. Jim also led the way on developing industrial estates, and setting up an industrial bureau and a grants scheme for incoming companies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1c76e96d5591a4f9ea142493f75196b216a58a62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c76e96d5591a4f9ea142493f75196b216a58a62/0_0_860_1075/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Wilson\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jim Wilson, who guided the transformation of land left derelict from the closure of heavy industry, mines and railways.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Miller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jim derived great satisfaction from restoration work and one project in particular. The A1 (now A167) between Darlington and Birtley was surrounded by hoardings, broken signage and general dereliction. Jim was unremitting in removing it all, and used this scheme as evidence of the commitment needed to transform the environment. His determination to get things done was clear to his interdisciplinary department, which he led by example.</p> <p>Jim was born in Barnsley, South Yorkshire. His father, James, was a signalman on the railways, and his mother, Theresa, ran the family home. Jim, a bright boy, went straight into the second year at Barnsley Holgate grammar school, completing his studies at 17. He then went to King\u2019s College London, where he gained a degree in geography. During two years of national service in the army, he was kitted out for Suez but the crisis was over before he was needed. Jim was demobbed in September 1956 and started to look for work. He was greatly attracted to the idea of town planning and responded to an advertisement for a research assistant in Durham County Planning Department.</p> <p>His contribution to planning, development and improvement in Durham was immense. Jim always said that the achievements were not his alone. This, of course, is true but it was his leadership and strength of purpose that made them possible. In 1988, Jim moved on to a new challenge in the national Planning Inspectorate where his experience and clarity was greatly valued. He retired in 2003.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Rita (nee Gough), whom he married in 1957, his children, Helen and Stephen, and four grandchildren.</p>",

The Home Office refused to say whether it will take any of them. <br></p> <p>Help Refugees, the largest charity operating on the site, said it has been told that migrants in the camp will be registered and transported in 60 buses to unidentified accommodation centres across France. According to French authorities, 3,000 will be moved on Monday, 2,400 on Tuesday, and 2,000 on Wednesday.</p> <p>Unaccompanied children will be housed temporarily in the government-run part of the camp that has container accommodation where they will be processed by French and British authorities. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe are encouraged by this news, as the children will be accommodated while the British authorities take the time to expedite the Dubs amendment,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Within the camp the tension is palpable among many of its estimated 1,300 unaccompanied refugee children.

They will be provided with medical checks and care, and emotional and psychological support.<br></p> <p>Steve Chalke, a Baptist minister and former television presenter who founded the Oasis trust more than 30 years ago, said his team had no information on the boys, such as their country of origin, language or physical and psychological state.<br></p> <p>\u201cBut they will be vulnerable and traumatised young people, and we need to provide them with a good experience,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>He referred to the hostel, at an undisclosed location, as a \u201csafe house\u201d because of the possibility of objections or protests. \u201cYou could get people turning up to say \u2018go home\u2019, so we need to provide a secure environment facing outwards but a therapeutic environment inside,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>\u201cThese youngsters have been bombed out of their homes and countries, they\u2019ve come across the Mediterranean on a dinghy, they may have lost family members en route, they\u2019ve marched across Europe, then they\u2019ve been forgotten and neglected for at least a year in the mud of Calais.

A spokesman said: \u201cChildren who may be eligible to come to the UK under the Dubs amendment to the Immigration Act 2016 must be supported in France while their cases are considered. If it is in the best interests of children who meet the Dubs criteria, they will be transferred to the UK.</p> <p>\u201cNegotiations with the French government will continue over the coming weeks to identify and prioritise the children who will be brought to the UK under the Dubs amendment.\u201d </p> <p>The spokesperson refused to say how many children had arrived from Calais so far and how many they were expecting in total.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Name: </strong>Wallonia.</p> <p><strong>Appearance: </strong>Small and fierce.</p> <p><strong>Location:</strong> It\u2019s the bottom half of Belgium.</p> <p><strong>Where\u2019s Belgium? </strong>Oh, get yourself an atlas!</p> <p><strong>Flag:</strong> A cock (a <em>coq hardi</em> in French).</p> <p><strong>A little risqu\u00e9. </strong>It means bold rooster, is a vibrant red on a yellow background, and is also small and fierce.</p> <p><strong>And the derivation of the name?</strong> From the 3.6 million people who live there, who are called the Walloons.</p> <p><strong>Also small and fierce? </strong><em>Naturellement</em>, and, when it comes to negotiating a trade deal with Canada, intransigent.</p> <p><strong>I fear you are going to tell me more.</strong> For seven years, the EU and Canada have been negotiating the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (Ceta), which will provide for free trade and harmonisation of standards. Now, on the brink of ratification, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21709060-tiny-region-belgium-opposes-trade-reasons-are-hard-understand-wallonia\">little Wallonia has rejected it</a>, with regional prime minister Paul Magnette demanding further negotiation. Constitutionally, it can demand a Belgian veto, and a Belgian veto can scupper the whole deal.<br></p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the Walloons\u2019 problem with the deal? </strong>They think it favours big corporations over small businesses, that their agriculture will be undermined by cheap Canadian imports, and that Ceta will erode environmental standards and weaken labour laws.</p> <p><strong>I seem to have heard these arguments before. </strong>Indeed. It is the clash of free trade versus protectionism now being played out in the UK and all over Europe. If Ceta falls, there\u2019s not much hope for the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between Europe and the US, and very little prospect of the post-Brexit UK getting the sort of free trade deal it wants with the EU.</p> <p><strong>How come the Walloons have all this power?</strong> It reflects the hopelessly fragmented nature of Belgian political life. The system is based on a series of checks and balances between French-speaking Wallonia and Dutch-speaking Flanders. It makes the country more or less ungovernable \u2013 literally so after the 2010 election,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_Belgian_government_formation#Speculation_on_the_possible_partition_of_Belgium\"> when it had no elected government for 589 days</a>.</p> <p><strong>Why doesn\u2019t Belgium just split?</strong> The idea has been floated. Some Walloons favour joining France, while others prefer Germany.</p> <p><strong>Not to be confused with:</strong> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedonia#Duck_Soup\">Freedonia</a>.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> \u201cAbout time someone stood up against the dehumanising forces of global neoliberalism.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t say:</strong> \u201cWhat a bunch of Walloonies.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-presidential-debate-election-result\" title=\"\">final presidential debate</a>, thankfully the last set piece in a wretched campaign, revealed what is admirable and loathsome in American politics. Hillary Clinton displayed a razor-sharp intelligence and a quick wit. Her facility with facts trumped Donald Trump\u2019s lack of them. Americans finally saw on Wednesday why Secretary Clinton had got rich from giving lectures after leaving office. Her fluency with words, which has earned her $22m in speaking fees, appeared to silence her opponent. Mr Trump, a boastful, thin-skinned billionaire who trades in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic\" title=\"\">racism</a> and misogyny, was left squawking on the sidelines of the debate. His jibes revealed a&#xa0;man out of his depth. His answer was to plunge down deeper. By disgracefully refusing to rule out calling this a rigged election he gave up a fight he had by then lost.</p> <p>Americans should vote for Secretary Clinton as an able and proven politician. A Trump presidency would be bad for America and dangerous for the world, so a vote for Secretary Clinton is the most effective way of preventing it. Mr Trump has been exposed for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">questionable tax arrangements</a>, outrageous business practices and irregularities at his charity. The billionaire is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\" title=\"\">grabber and kisser</a> of women who he presumed gave consent because he was famous. There are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-tenth-woman-accuser\" title=\"\">numerous allegations</a> of sexual assault by Mr Trump. He has demonstrated that he has neither the conscience, training nor sense of history \u2013 and the desire to be judged well by it \u2013 to occupy the White House. Secretary Clinton possesses such attributes. She has a serious and sustained commitment on issues like education, healthcare and equality, and she has stood consistently for the rights of women, ethnic minorities, children and the disabled through her long career.</p> <p>However, there are fewer reasons to vote for Secretary Clinton than one would have hoped. For more than two decades she has been part of a political establishment that shaped a dysfunctional country. She has been unable to escape being tarnished by the most damaging policies \u2013 notably around <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-36020717\" title=\"\">criminal justice</a> \u2013 of&#xa0;her husband\u2019s administration. There are well-founded concerns, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/16/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-wall-street-goldman-sachs-speeches\" title=\"\">highlighted by transcripts of her speeches</a>, that she is too close to Wall Street to be an effective check on&#xa0;its excesses if&#xa0;elected.</p> <h2>The mood for change</h2> <p>Even so, as the first female president she would represent a symbolic transformative change in American politics. In some ways what Secretary Clinton has had to deal with are ingrained cultural attitudes about what success and leadership look like. These were exposed by the <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-women-are-defeating-donald-trump/\" title=\"\">finding that Mr Trump would win if only men voted</a> and Secretary Clinton would win if only women voted. That most men favor Mr&#xa0;Trump over Secretary Clinton demonstrates at some level a more insidious sexism than the one Mr Trump peddles: that centred on the mind, not the body. It is a hostility \u2013 deeply embedded but rarely conceded \u2013 against seeing women as genuinely equal.</p> <p>There is little doubt that the 2016 presidential campaign has been one of the most confrontational contests of the modern era. The mood for change has been more pervasive and volatile, and has been supercharged by Mr Trump, a braggart with tyrannical instincts. The backdrop to this election has been genuine and understandable public anger about economic insecurity, growing inequality and frustration with elites. Mr Trump on the right and Bernie Sanders on the left have reflected that mood in their very different ways. That is not going to disappear after 8 November. The election has also raised real questions about the crisis of American democracy. Mr Trump encouraged violence against opponents and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/debate-donald-trump-threatens-to-jail-hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">threatened to jail Secretary Clinton</a> if he took office.</p> <p>The civility that has marked out US democracy as ordered and restrained appears dead. The next president will have to resurrect it. The political topography of a polarized and resentful nation has been obscured by the preternatural equanimity of Barack Obama. Mr Trump has in some ways skilfully exploited these divisions. On social security he has moved to the left on the campaign trail, telling jobless Americans that he would <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2016/08/08/social-security-where-clinton-and-trump-stand/#6dbc02aa4f40\" title=\"\">not touch their benefits</a>. Mr Trump also wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the landmark measure that increases health coverage for low-wage workers and benefits <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/18/health/immigrants-the-poor-and-minorities-gain-sharply-under-health-act.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">large numbers of immigrants and minorities</a>. This contrasts with the real estate magnate\u2019s offer to expand the US health programme for the elderly \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/20161020/clinton-trump-tangle-on-preserving-medicare\" title=\"\">Medicare</a> \u2013 which benefits overwhelmingly older, whiter voters.</p> <p>These dog whistles have been part of American politics for decades. But they come at a time when there is a sense that there are too many losers from economic growth in the country. Driving discontent in the US is a system that no longer defuses high levels of inequality with opportunities for all. The&#xa0;middle classes <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-13/u-s-poverty-rate-falls-to-post-recession-low-as-incomes-gain\" title=\"\">are poorer today than in 2000</a>. Since the Great Recession the top <a href=\"http://equitablegrowth.org/research-analysis/u-s-top-one-percent-of-income-earners-hit-new-high-in-2015-amid-strong-economic-growth/\" title=\"\">1% of families in the US have captured 52% of the income growth</a>. There\u2019s understandable anger that the wealthy were bailed out while ordinary Americans were hollowed out. Voters rage that, in the current incarnation of globalization, jobs that disappeared when the US decided to import rather than manufacture did not come back \u2013 they simply popped up elsewhere, usually in China.</p> <h2>The Sanders effect</h2> <p>Nowhere has this fury been more keenly felt than in the country\u2019s former manufacturing heartlands, tapping into America\u2019s long history of resistance to free trade and making protectionism a potent political force once again. The politician who has shaped the politics of the country and accounted for populist anger is Senator Sanders. The man from Vermont understood, earlier than most, that voters see the economy as rigged against them by a political system that has been corrupted by big money. <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2016/06/03/the-democrats-generation-gap/\" title=\"\">His campaign was backed three to one by millennials in the Democratic primaries</a>. This month his favorability ratings in opinion polls <a href=\"https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/cx4orjzwhb/econTabReport.pdf\" title=\"\">are only bettered by Michelle&#xa0;Obama</a>.</p> <p>Senator Sanders\u2019 insurgent campaign has transformed Democratic politics \u2013 forcing Secretary Clinton to adopt, albeit sotto voce, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-election-democrats-sanders-commentary-idUSKCN0Y90C9\" title=\"\">key planks of his program</a> such as a federal minimum wage of $15 an hour, tuition-free public college and opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2013 President Obama\u2019s big trade deal. Until this week, Secretary Clinton failed to outline enough of a bold reform program. Tellingly, she offered signs of one in the final televised debate, making unprompted promises to push immigration reforms, a key Sanders point, within the first 100 days of her presidency.</p> <p>Although domestic politics has framed the campaign, Secretary Clinton\u2019s election would be greeted with relief and optimism in most world capitals other than Moscow and Damascus. Despite her <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/27/hillary-the-hawk-a-history-clinton-2016-military-intervention-libya-iraq-syria/\" title=\"\">hawkish outlook</a>, she will have no alternative but to recognize that the 21st century no longer always looks to the United States as an indispensable hegemon, whether benign or threatening. Secretary Clinton should focus on US soft, not hard, power \u2013 dealing with climate change and working out fairer global trade arrangements.</p> <p>If Secretary Clinton is elected she must recognize the mood without pandering to its demons. She needs to bring the bold ambition about the role of government to this era that Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt each did in earlier times. She has the intelligence, the seriousness and the experience to do this. The&#xa0;US presidency is hugely powerful: 10% of all posts in federal government are allocated on the basis of political patronage. Secretary Clinton offers the best chance of ensuring those jobs go to competent people. Her choice of Treasury secretary in the aftermath of the banking crisis will be watched with special care, as will an olive branch appointment to Senator Sanders of the kind that president Obama made to her in 2008. She offers the greatest hope that the supreme court defends abortion rights and looks again at issues like campaign finance as well as background checks on gun owners. Yet America will soon find itself weakened at home and abroad if the new president is as badly served by congress as Mr Obama has been for most of his tenure.</p> <p>There is a danger, if Mrs Clinton wins, that&#xa0;the Republicans will relapse into the Hillary-hatred that has marked them for a quarter century. The tragedy of this election is&#xa0;that, to become president, Secretary Clinton has had to talk more radically than she actually felt; to be an effective president she may be compelled to act more conservatively than she&#xa0;now says she wants to do.</p>",

  "<p>US telecoms giant AT&amp;T is reportedly in advanced talks to acquire Time Warner, the media company whose star assets include HBO, Warner Brothers and CNN.</p> <p>A deal could come as early as this weekend, according to the Wall Street Journal. Both companies declined to comment.</p> <p>A merger of the two firms would come as telecoms companies have shown an increasing interest in media and tech takeovers. Verizon is currently in negotiations to buy Yahoo and has already bought AOL, owner of Huffington Post.</p> <p>AT&amp;T, the second largest wireless telecoms company in the US behind Verizon, owns a portfolio of mobile, broadband and satellite TV services that it promotes using Time Warner\u2019s entertainment assets, among others.</p> <p>But a deal to buy the Time Warner empire would rival the last major telecoms and media merger, Comcast\u2019s 2011 takeover of NBCUniversal. It would also awaken memories of another, ill-fated, Time Warner takeover. <br></p> <p>In 2001 AOL took over Time Warner in a deal now regarded as one of the worst mergers in history. It took a decade to unwind the transaction.</p> <p>Time Warner\u2019s share price rose 9% on the news while AT&amp;T\u2019s dipped close to 3%. Time Warner is valued at $73.5bn, AT&amp;T is valued at $227bn.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eX3u0IlBBO4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eX3u0IlBBO4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Brian Wieser, lead researcher at analytics firm Pivotal, said that the deal was a possibility but would present the new entity with potentially insurmountable difficulties. </p> <p>Wieser said that while the marriage of a producer and a distributor might at first look similar to the successful Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, an AT&amp;T-Time Warner entity presented unique challenges. Other entities, he said, made more sense for the always-a-bridesmaid Time Warner. \u201cDirecTV and Time Warner in a lot of ways is more similar than Time Warner and AT&amp;T. It looks like a hedge against the commoditization of infrastructure.\u201d</p> <p>Cash rich telecoms companies like AT&amp;T are facing a crisis as their wireless businesses reach maturity and fixed line income continues to erode.</p> <p>\u201cAT&amp;T is an acquisition machine and interested in empire preservation if nothing else,\u201d said Wieser. \u201cTime Warner has always been for sale at the right price. It\u2019s not a position that creates any synergies, and it does create some dis-synergies, like the problem of managing a global media company from Texas. It\u2019s a standalone entity that gets lost when it\u2019s part of a much bigger conglomerate.\u201d<br></p> <p>But AT&amp;T is at a crossroads, Wieser said. \u201cIf the prospects for wireline growth are negative and the prospects for wireless growth are tepid, what do you do to make sure your business grows?\u201d</p> <p>Time Warner too faces headwinds. The trend toward \u201ccord cutting\u201d \u2013 where people get their TV needs over the internet \u2013 has eaten into the cable subscriptions that are vital to its networks. </p> <p>Traditional media companies are also facing increased competition from players including Netflix, Amazon Prime and Google\u2019s YouTube. In August Time Warner bought a 10% stake in Hulu, another streaming service owned by a consortium of established media players.</p> <p>HBO, whose shows include Westworld and Game of Thrones, was once one of the crown jewels of the cable industry. But the rapid changes in the industry forced Time Warner to launch a standalone digital HBO service.</p> <p>A transaction is bound to attract regulatory attention. Comcast, the US\u2019s largest cable company, faced intense regulatory scrutiny during its takeover of NBCUniversal. </p>",

Now divided into flats, they were once the heart of a community \u2013 and the names of these houses (Birch, Aster, Ivy, The Lodge) may yet become synonymous with cruelty, child abuse, incompetence and cover-up.</p> <p>Of all the scandals being investigated by the inquiry chaired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/11/child-abuse-inquiry-prof-alexis-jay-to-take-over-from-lowell-goddard\">Prof Alexis Jay</a>, this has the potential to be the most disturbing of all. The secrets of Shirley Oaks appear to be slowly emerging from some of the thousands of children who grew up in what used to be Britain\u2019s biggest care home.</p> <p>Raymond Stevenson was one of them. His parents split up when he was two years old. He and his older brother stayed with his father, but it was too much for a working dad. And so the two of them were put into Shirley Oaks, just outside Croydon. It would be Stevenson\u2019s home until he was 18.<br></p> <p>The 80-acre site, with its cottages, swimming pool and school, should have given him the start in life his parents could not. But like many of his friends, he wanted to forget the place when he left, and bury the things he had experienced there. Those memories remained out of reach until two years ago.</p> <p>Stevenson was at his flat in Brixton one evening when he received a phone call. \u201cA boy I had kept in touch with rang me out of the blue,\u201d he says. \u201cHe told me he had something to say.\u201d</p> <p>The caller explained that he had been sexually abused at Shirley Oaks, and that his brother and sister had, too. At first, Stevenson was shocked \u2013 and then enraged. He smashed up his flat. He knew this story was just the tip of the iceberg: that the history he had forgotten would grow to take over his entire life.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019d lived with it all these years and he was at the end of his tether,\u201d Stevenson says. \u201cHe had come to me for help \u2026 and he knew I couldn\u2019t turn him down.\u201d</p> <p>He was right. In his peer group, and around south London, Stevenson has a reputation. He made his name as a music manager \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/mentors-massive-price-tag-for-jessie-j-6423139.html\">he discovered and nurtured Jessie J</a>. He\u2019d earned respect for standing up to criminals who once tried to strong-arm him out of a nightclub he ran, and he had worked with the Home Office on an anti-gun crime campaign video. Those who have crossed Stevenson know him to be stubborn and street-smart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e22fda0c2d984128e4407562fdccea98d3e3953f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e22fda0c2d984128e4407562fdccea98d3e3953f/1117_148_1432_1790/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jessica Cornish, AKA Jessie J, in 2003 when Raymond Stevenson was her mentor.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jessica Cornish, AKA Jessie J, in 2003, when Raymond Stevenson was her mentor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the work that would become his calling, Stevenson, now 53, would have to prove it. Within days of that first call, he and his long-term business partner, Lucia Hinton, put their business to one side and set about finding out as much as possible about Shirley Oaks, the people who ran it and the children who went through it.</p> <p>And because it was \u201cRaymond from Shirley Oaks\u201d making inquiries, people who hadn\u2019t dared to come forward before, or felt they had been let down by the authorities and the police in the past, have told him their stories.</p> <p>So far almost 700 former residents of Shirley Oaks have approached him \u2013 and the support group he set up \u2013 Shirley Oaks Survivors Association (<a href=\"http://www.shirleyoakssurvivorsassociation.co.uk/\">SOSA</a>) \u2013 has taken testimony about abuse from 400. They include two army officers, and two others awarded MBEs. And more emerge every day.</p> <p>What they believe they can prove \u2013 from witness testimony, from hundreds of pages of official documents that have been leaked to them, and from former staff and \u201chouse parents\u201d who now support them \u2013 is that Shirley Oaks was infiltrated by paedophiles from the mid-1950s until its closure in 1983. They have identified 60 suspected paedophiles; there may be more. One of the abusers is said to be a former member of Scotland Yard\u2019s vice squad. And the abuse didn\u2019t stop at Shirley Oaks. It wormed its way into all of Lambeth\u2019s children\u2019s homes, and continued until the early 1990s.</p> <p>Are all the claims true? Stevenson has no reason to doubt them. And neither, it seems, does Lambeth council, which ran Shirley Oaks for 20 years, or the police, who are desperate to speak to the survivors who have come to him.</p> <p>In fact, SOSA compiled a report that so horrified the council that it has agreed in principle to pay compensation to potentially hundreds of victims. The material uncovered by the group, now compiled into six lengthy reports, is one reason why Lambeth is <a href=\"http://www.shirleyoakssurvivorsassociation.co.uk/iicsa\">among Jay\u2019s core investigations</a>.</p> <p>Stevenson has no doubt about what they show. \u201cThis was about the industrial sexual abuse of children in a home,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it didn\u2019t need high-profile names to be one of the worst, one of the most disgusting things that has happened \u2026 it was another world, horrible.\u201d</p> <p>Stevenson had a partial view of this when he was growing up. He recalls being beaten and knowing \u201cfrom the age of six that there was something wrong\u201d with the way children were treated. \u201cI was not aware that people were being sexually abused, but as I got older, we were aware that there were places you shouldn\u2019t go because of the potential for sexual abuse. There were houses \u2013 the lodge house, the boiler house \u2013 there were those places that we knew had the potential for that.</p> <p>\u201cThese were dark houses, dark cottages that we would never go to. Some of my friends lived in those cottages, so I\u2019d wait round by a tree until they came out. It\u2019s only in hindsight that you know that everyone who left their cottage left all the evil inside.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b170a23d924c35cc4db958d55e421e39cab7856f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b170a23d924c35cc4db958d55e421e39cab7856f/0_0_2192_1316/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It was a failed system, and with failed systems people can take advantage\u2019 \u2026 Shirley Oaks children\u2019s home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It was a failed system, and with failed systems people can take advantage\u2019 \u2026 Shirley Oaks children\u2019s home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: shirleyoaks.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He says the children didn\u2019t talk about what was happening. \u201cThere was nothing to talk about. It was like going to the shops. The beatings were part of the system \u2013 you couldn\u2019t question it because there was nothing to compare it with. So you accepted it.\u201d Instead, he says, \u201cwe tried to live proud\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe all wanted to project that survival instinct,\u201d he says. \u201cYou suffered in silence together, and you protected each other as much as you could. My best friends didn\u2019t know about the nights I spent locked in the coalshed. They didn\u2019t know about the nights I wandered around in the dark. Why would I tell them? They had their own nightmares to deal with.</p> <p>\u201cRemember, many of the kids at Shirley Oaks had been abused already. That\u2019s why they were there. They didn\u2019t know any different. It was supposedly normal, because we were children who didn\u2019t deserve anything more than what we got. I had no concept of cruelty. It was normal to me. It was all I knew, the walls of Shirley Oaks.\u201d</p> <p>This was not the vision that Shirley Oaks\u2019s founders had had in the early 20th century. Opened in 1904 by the Bermondsey Board of Guardians, it was designed as beacon of progressiveness that would allow children to \u201cbe brought up in a home environment rather than a large, regimented institution \u2026 living in small groups with house parents, on a site including school, workshops, administration block, infirmary etc, in a self-contained community.\u201d With up to 400 children on site at any time, the home was a new way to deal with vulnerable and troubled children from boroughs all over London.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"524bcca450db4a639eeb941fe621d5acc4624cfc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/524bcca450db4a639eeb941fe621d5acc4624cfc/0_468_2840_3547/801.jpg\" alt=\"Alexis Jay, head of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation, which will investigate the history of Shirley Oaks.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexis Jay, head of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation, which will investigate the history of Shirley Oaks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Hunter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many thousands of them will have gone into and come out of Shirley Oaks unscathed \u2013 most of the \u201chouse parents\u201d likely did their best, with the best of intentions. Stevenson recalls two who had a profound effect on him \u2013 Aunty Charmaine and Uncle Bob \u2013 and prevented him from self-destructing.</p> <p>But during the 1960s and 70s in particular, the home appears to have been infected by what Stevenson calls \u201cthe virus of child abuse\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTheir (paedophile) network before the internet was perfect,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were in touch with each other, they knew each other, they were advertising for like-minded people. We know the word spread. People were directed to Shirley Oaks. We knew it had to be orchestrated. But we needed to know how. Once we got it, we could predict which children would be abused, which children were targeted.\u201d</p> <p>Stevenson says he has been able to map which abusers went where and for how long \u2013 work, he says, that could have been done by the police or the council if they had ever had the appetite to do it. He insists they didn\u2019t.</p> <p>Hinton says talking to so many people about such personal matters has been \u201cfucking harrowing\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe enormity of it \u2026 you have grown men who have never met me who are willing to share with me in graphic detail the horrific ordeals they have been put through,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is heart-wrenching for people to have to relive this. People don\u2019t understand that they don\u2019t just come in and say: \u2018This is what happened to me.\u2019 For some people it has taken months for them to pluck up courage. The first thing we did was get counselling in place and we take our time with them.</p> <p>\u201cWe understand they are damaged souls in their general life, aside from the abuse. I am a mum, I have two children. And the thought of children going through what these people have gone through \u2026 I am not sure grateful is the right word \u2026 but we are very grateful that they have felt able to trust us, to believe in what we are doing.\u201d</p> <p>Stevenson adds: \u201cI know I couldn\u2019t have survived what some of the people have gone through, I know it. End of story. So I am not looking at someone who is a victim, I am looking at someone and thinking: \u2018My God, you have gone through all that, the least I can do is give you everything that I have.\u2019 Our mandate is unquestionable, we cannot fail. What happened to them is indisputable. The facts are there. We have to deliver them truth and justice. Because they handed us truth on a plate.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2016/aug/05/child-abuse-survivors-react-to-resignation-of-inquiry-chair-lowell-goddard-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4pj56\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2631831\"            data-video-name=\"Child abuse survivors react to resignation of inquiry chair Lowell Goddard \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC/ ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57a471d2e4b06a087f2af360\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/05/160805ChildAbuseSurvivors_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/05/160805ChildAbuseSurvivors.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/08/05/160805ChildAbuseSurvivors_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/08/05/160805ChildAbuseSurvivors_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/05/160805ChildAbuseSurvivors_V3.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2016/aug/05/child-abuse-survivors-react-to-resignation-of-inquiry-chair-lowell-goddard-video\">Child abuse survivors react to resignation of inquiry chair Lowell Goddard</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Stevenson is coy about his endgame, and how he intends to secure it. For him, getting compensation for the abused is a first step. What is less clear is where and how the anger of the people he represents will be directed next. It might be channelled through the national inquiry; some of his members may decide to talk to the police, though so far they have been reluctant. \u201cThey [the police] have been part of the problem, not the solution,\u201d he says.</p> <p>At the moment, Stevenson says he is sitting on information that has the potential to shame authorities \u2013 and individuals \u2013 charged with protecting children in care. \u201cFrom very early on we knew the abuse could not be random. There were too many recurring themes that enabled it to go on, and it couldn\u2019t happen on such a scale and be random because these people kept bumping into each other.</p> <p>\u201cLambeth council was inept and corrupt. It was a perfect storm. We understood that Shirley Oaks was a failed system, and with failed systems people can take advantage. We learned that the problem was widespread and that we couldn\u2019t trust the police.\u201d</p> <p>He is mistrustful of the media, too: \u201cThey have gone for the wrong people at the wrong time, without enough evidence, which has really damaged everything.\u201d So Stevenson is doing things his way \u2013 toughened by all the things he has been through, and driven on by the survivors behind him. The combination is unsettling for the police, the council, the inquiry and the establishment he intends to rock.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/08/hundreds-of-alleged-abuse-victims-threaten-to-boycott-jay-inquiry\">Hundreds of alleged abuse victims threaten to boycott Jay inquiry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI can honestly say that the scars I carry from Shirley Oaks will be with me for the rest of my life,\u201d Stevenson says. \u201cBut they are nothing compared with the stories we have read and heard.

They brought out the deputy headmaster, still clutching five children, their bones so hardened that they first had to break his arms to get the children away then their arms to get them apart. And the mothers of two of them watched it happen.</p> </blockquote> <p>The most impressive coverage I\u2019ve seen today is by WalesOnline. They have produced <a href=\"http://aberfan.walesonline.co.uk/\">a beautifully designed special feature on Aberfan</a>, which includes the testimony of several survivors and rescue workers who have never spoken publicly before about their experiences.</p> <p>I truly urge you to spend some time reading through it \u2013 I can\u2019t stop thinking about these words by Melvyn Walker about the impact it had on him as an eight year old who had escaped from one of the classrooms:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I couldn\u2019t go to school for two years.

It is simply too large and too centralised, for example patients shouldn't need to travel to a central hospital for an ultrasound; patients and their families shouldn't need to explain the same symptoms/history at every shift change to all the new staff. While emergency care is amazing the primary care can be completely patchy depending on where you're unlucky to be ill. In many European countries private capacity is incorporated into health services and it works remarkably well without fears of money grabbing or lousy service. The problem with the Tory approach is that privatisation never really works in the UK, because making profits becomes paramount and share ownership promoted as a virtuous ideal - there are scant examples of real value and improvements being delivered by privatisation.

Johnsons baby wash and shampoo may smell like heaven but it's a myth that we should bath our babies every night. They don't really get dirty and soap dries their skin, exacerbating eczema. Boots vouchers when every savvy mum knows it's all much cheaper at Pound land (and Lidl and Aldi's nappies are far cheaper and just as good if you don't fancy washable.)<br />Books and breastfeeding advice would be useful. A list of 'things that are normal, so don't worry' with a poo chart, pictures of benign rashes, like cradle cap and the 6 week spots (erythema toxicum neonatorum). Some paracetamol, a 'snotter sucker' for when you wee Scottish baby gets his first respiratory virus and can't feed and breathe at the same time.

It is scary to suddenly come across part of the British population who must have had a simmering anti-foreign sentiment for a long time. I've lived here longer than I lived in my native country and if someone is asking me now if I wanted to become British to make my life here secure, I think I would have to be nearly desperate to do so as this country is split, with nationalism raising its ugly head. Having read plenty of blogs, I can't but help that many of the people having voted BREXIT have done so because they felt left behind and unheard and are under the impression that they will get back what the lost over the last 40 or so years. What they want back cannot be got back as what they want is for globalisation to go away, as the world is so meshed up now that you can't have control as one has to compromise in this globalised world. If people think that foreign people undercut their own wages, ask if something produced or service rendered more expensive than created or done by people in another country will not be left unbought, making it unproductive so that said UK worker will be out of a job soon, never mind if the competition is working within the UK or in another country.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>What do you think?

  "<p>An 11-year-old Indian boy with a very long name is changing chess history. Already the youngest ever international master, the Chennai prodigy is likely to eclipse Sergey Karjakin\u2019s long-standing world record as the only pre-teen player to achieve the grandmaster title. His early career is outpacing both Russia\u2019s Karjakin (GM at 12 years seven months) and Norway\u2019s reigning world champion Magnus Carlsen (GM at 13 years four months), whose title match starts in New York on 11 November.</p> <p>Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa learned chess at five and soon made remarkable progress. He won the world under-eight title in 2013, the under-10 in 2015 and is currently the No1 seed in the world under-12 championships at Batumi, Georgia. He outclasses his peers but it is his advance in global adult chess which has set new all-time peaks for age achievement.</p> <p>His first international master result at Cannes, France, in February this year, was quickly followed by his second at Moscow Aeroflot in March, then his third and final norm at Bhubaneswar, India, in May, so qualifying him as an IM at 10 years nine months and breaking Karjakin\u2019s world record by more than a year. And the way he did it hints at much more to come. He recovered from a 0.5/3 start in Moscow, while at both Cannes and Bhubaneswar he reached the IM score with a round to spare.</p> <p>Several talents including Carlsen have reached IM at 12 but Karjakin (11 years 11 months) and Praggnanandhaa are the only players to have qualified before their 12th birthday.</p> <p>Once the first title breakthrough is achieved, the best of the best are likely to make further quantum jumps. Karjakin and Carlsen both took less than a year to progress from IM to GM. Praggnanandhaa still has 17 months in which to break Karjakin\u2019s GM world record and the omens for his doing so are bright. He has already shown that he can play well outside India, at Cannes, Moscow, and again at this month\u2019s Isle of Man Open. A property entrepreneur has sponsored his travel.</p> <p>To become a GM a player needs three norms of 2600+ performances from individual tournaments plus an overall 2500 rating. His Fide world rating is already within range at 2454, his personal best and only 46 points short of the target.</p> <p>Praggnanandhaa\u2019s world GM age record chase is sure to interest every tournament organiser who wants to maximise publicity. Europe\u2019s prestige events like the London Classic Open at Olympia in December along with Tradewise Gibraltar and Tata Steel Wijk B in January 2017 could all invite him.</p> <p>Two of his replies near the end of his interview after his final round Isle of Man game revealed his ambition. Asked if he was pleased with his score of 5.5/9, he answered that he would have liked another point or so, That would have put him close to 2600. Asked whether he hoped to become a GM, he replied \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5oeBYzo8tw\">in about a year</a>\u201d. GM at 11 might be pushing it, but such is the speed of his advance that it cannot be ruled out.</p> <p>Praggnanandhaa comes from Chennai/Madras and his chess hero is <a href=\"http://blog.chessgurukul.com/content/images/2016/07/Praggnanandhaa-with-Anand.png\">Vishy Anand</a>. His parents do not play chess but his older sister Vaishali has led the way for him, winning the world girls under-12 and under-14 championships and qualifying as a woman international master. He has been coached since the age of eight by GM Ramachandran Ramesh, who in 2002 earned his own place in chess history as the last player from his country to win the British championship before Indians were ruled ineligible.</p> <p>It is not just that he plays very well. His style is rich in tactics, with two queen sacrifices at Moscow Aeroflot in addition to his Isle of Man 18-move miniature against one of the best players in South America, a 2645 GM from Paraguay.</p> <p>This brilliancy is going round the chess world, has made many chess fans fully aware of the new Indian talent, and has been compared to Bobby Fischer\u2019s Game of the Century against Donald Byrne in 1956. That game, played in New York 60 years ago this month, was of much higher quality with deeply calculated knight and queen sacrifices, but Fischer was 13 against 11 while Praggnanandhaa\u2019s last dozen or so moves were almost all the first choice of the computer and he saw and was ready for the better defences missed by his opponent. His victory is sure to become part of chess lore and be quoted in future as a classic example of dynamic attack.</p> <p>After castling long, White should capture 9 dxc5, since in the game 9...c4! and 10...b5! already gives Black a dangerous attack. 11 exd5? (Nxd5) was too risky, and 14 Na3? was fatal. White had to try 14 Nc7 Qb7! 15 Bxc4 (if 15 Nxa8 c3!) Rb8 16 Nb5 Be6! 17 Bxa2 Bxa2+ 18 Kxa2 Qxb5 though Black\u2019s attack continues. At the end if 19 c4 Nb4+ 20 Kb2 Nd3+ forces mate.</p> <p><strong>Axel Bachmann v Praggnanandhaa</strong></p> <p><strong>1</strong> d4 Nf6 <strong>2</strong> Bf4 g6 <strong>3</strong> Nc3 d5 <strong>4</strong> Qd2 Bg7 <strong>5</strong> Bh6 O-O <strong>6</strong> Bxg7 Kxg7 <strong>7</strong> O-O-O c5 <strong>8</strong> e3 Nc6 <strong>9</strong> f3? c4! <strong>10</strong> e4 b5! <strong>11</strong> exd5 Nb4 <strong>12</strong> Nxb5?

  "<p>A major computer failure at Southern Water, which supplies 4.6m customers across the south of England, means that direct debits were not taken in early October, but will instead be double-billed in November.</p> <p>Customers calling the water company\u2019s helplines are greeted with a message saying: \u201cWe are really sorry, we have had an ongoing technical problem.\u201d Up to 159,000 households in Kent, Sussex and Hampshire are understood to have been affected. </p> <p>The company said direct debits that should have been taken on 5 and 10 October failed, and will instead be taken in November. </p> <p>It promised to compensate customers who have been charged by their banks for a direct debit failure. The average combined water and sewage bill for a Southern Water customer is \u00a3418 a year. </p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.southernwater.co.uk/latest-news/qa-on-direct-debit-issue\">note to customers</a>, Southern Water blamed a \u201cmissing zero\u201d for the problem. It said: \u201cWe\u2019ve recently brought in a new IT services provider and unfortunately the transition was not as smooth as we\u2019d have hoped. As a result of a processing issue the direct debit file that would collect payments on 5 October failed. </p> <p>\u201cWe believed we would be able to resolve this issue by moving those direct debits due on 5 October into the next direct debit file on 10 October. However, we\u2019ve since received feedback that some of these direct debits had been returned by banks.

  "<p>Todos los grandes retos a escala global -el cambio clim\u00e1tico, la econom\u00eda, la desigualdad, el futuro mismo de la democracia- se resolver\u00e1n en ciudades. Si los estados quieren tener \u00e9xito en sus pol\u00edticas, las ciudades debemos ser tomadas en cuenta como actores serios en el escenario mundial.</p> <p>Creo que los gobiernos nacionales son rehenes de la inercia del siglo pasado y ese ya no es el mundo actual. Vivimos en un mundo que funciona por redes, por contactos cada vez m\u00e1s \u00e1giles y r\u00e1pidos entre ciudades.<br></p> <p>Desde luego, la ciudad perfecta no existe, la ciudad democr\u00e1tica est\u00e1 en permanente conflicto, en permanente construcci\u00f3n. Se trata de estar abiertos, innovando, escuchando a la ciudadan\u00eda y viendo lo que se hace en otras ciudades para hacer mejoras constantes.<br></p> <p>Las ciudades tenemos una forma de hacer pol\u00edtica m\u00e1s cooperativa y no tan competitiva. Aunque estemos gobernadas por partidos diferentes, nos ponemos de acuerdo en objetivos concretos y de forma \u00e1gil cooperamos para intercambiar experiencias y soluciones. Creo que esto deber\u00eda inspirar la pol\u00edtica a todos los niveles.<br></p> <p>Siempre habr\u00e1 miedo al cambio -pero las ciudades intentamos decirles a nuestros l\u00edderes nacionales, en positivo: \u201cPueden contar con nosotras para actualizar vuestras pol\u00edticas para tener \u00e9xito, porque si no, vais a fracasar\u201d.<br></p> <p><strong>El derecho a la ciudad</strong><br></p> <p>Creo que no se puede hablar de ciudad justa, sostenible, equitativa e inclusiva si no hablas del derecho a la ciudad (un modelo de desarrollo urbano que incluye a todos los ciudadanos). </p> <p>La referencia a esto en la Nueva Agenda Urbana de las Naciones Unidas (documento ratificado esta semana en Quito, durante H\u00e1bitat III) podr\u00eda ser m\u00e1s ambiciosa, desde mi punto de vista. Pero tambi\u00e9n hay que saber ver las conquistas que hemos logrado. Grandes potencias como Estados Unidos y China se resist\u00edan completamente a que en la declaraci\u00f3n entrara el derecho a la ciudad.<br></p> <p>Pero gracias a la gran movilizaci\u00f3n popular que ha habido en Am\u00e9rica Latina y en algunos pa\u00edses europeos, este movimiento pol\u00edtico se ha impuesto en la agenda urbana \u2013 y esto es un logro significativo. Los miembros que se resist\u00edan se han visto obligados a ponerlo, debieron aceptar que la inmensa mayor\u00eda de la poblaci\u00f3n se concentra en las ciudades y eso es una tendencia que va en aumento.<br></p> <p>Pero para que el derecho a la ciudad se vuelva real debemos pelear, a partir de ma\u00f1ana, para que se transforme en pol\u00edticas y en regulaciones concretas.<br></p> <p>El problema es que las ciudades est\u00e1n infrafinanciadas. En Espa\u00f1a, por ejemplo, los ayuntamientos solo tenemos acceso al 13% del total de los ingresos p\u00fablicos, que es muy bajo cuando tenemos que dar respuesta inmediata a todos los problemas cotidianos de educaci\u00f3n, salud, movilidad y desigualdad.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bff308a66a5eb4fc54b7ecf1c2166630811e5bf6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bff308a66a5eb4fc54b7ecf1c2166630811e5bf6/1091_522_2323_1394/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ada Colau y la alcaldesa de Par\u00eds, Anne Hidalgo (d) dejan el ayuntamiento de Barcelona despu\u00e9s de firmar un acuerdo de colaboraci\u00f3n entre las dos ciudades.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><a></a>Ada Colau y la alcaldesa de Par\u00eds, Anne Hidalgo (d) dejan el ayuntamiento de Barcelona despu\u00e9s de firmar un acuerdo de colaboraci\u00f3n entre las dos ciudades.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josep Lago/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Igualdad de g\u00e9nero</strong><br></p> <p>El rol de la mujer en el cambio pol\u00edtico ha sido mucho m\u00e1s prominente en H\u00e1bitat III que en otras conferencias.

  "<p>\u201cPfff,\u201d said Jean-Claude Juncker, shrugging his shoulders dismissively.</p> <p>That was how the European commission president replied to a journalist asking about Theresa May\u2019s Brexit comments during her first European council meeting. </p> <p>There was no special event, he added, and he was right. </p> <p>The prime minister was given just five minutes to set out her view on Britain\u2019s exit from the EU at 1am, after a six-hour session in which the European leaders ate pan-fried scallops, crown of lamb with roast figs, and iced vanilla parfait, while discussing the migration crisis and Russian aggression in Syria. </p> <p>Her \u201cclear message\u201d that the UK was leaving the EU but would play a full role until that point was met with silence, before the group moved on to a short final discussion on housekeeping issues about how the summit is organised. </p> <p>Juncker\u2019s spluttered response may have been a momentary reaction to an issue he did not want to address; but more likely it was a deliberate attempt to offer broadcasters an enduring image of Britain being sidelined.</p> <p>And it highlighted how for May the European council, like other events with her counterparts on the continent since the EU referendum, provided a somewhat awkward encounter. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b1e89a8f719250508f43311fdd50da11d7cfd16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b1e89a8f719250508f43311fdd50da11d7cfd16/0_262_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manfred Weber, leader of the Christian Democrats in the European parliament\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manfred Weber, leader of the Christian Democrats in the European parliament, said the behaviour of the British government was creating a lot of anger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Trutschel/Photothek/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>EU summits are an unusual environment for leaders, as they haggle over texts during dinner meetings without back-up from their advisers. </p> <p>But one government source said the Brexit decision had put May in \u201ca very odd position\u201d at the summit, far removed from the experience of her predecessors. \u201cIt is a very different personal experience from the one Cameron or Brown or Blair or Major had \u2026 She is on her way out and we are on our way out.\u201d</p> <p>And that is why, in Brussels, Brits feel increasingly like pariahs in the room.</p> <p>Despite claims from other leaders that the UK would remain a full and involved member of the EU until article 50 is triggered, May\u2019s own irritation at being cut out of a meeting of the other 27 leaders in Bratislava last month was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/theresa-may-uk-centre-of-european-decision-making-until-brexit\">quickly slapped down by European politicians.</a> </p> <p>Manfred Weber, leader of the Christian Democrats in the European parliament, said: \u201cWhen somebody wants to leave a club, it is not normal that such a member wants to decide about the future of this club.

May\u2019s promise that Britain will control immigration while keeping maximum economic access was given short shrift. \u201cThe fundamental freedoms are inseparable,\u201d said Schulz.</p> <p>But the Tory MEP leader, Syed Kamall, hit back, telling journalists in the huge media room of the Justus Lipsius building, headquarters of the European council, that it was just posturing.</p> <p>No 10 sources stressed that May was a central part of discussions about the atrocities in Syria, working closely with her French and German counterparts. </p> <p>Behind closed doors, she did receive a warmer welcome. With Taavi R\u00f5ivas, Estonia\u2019s prime minister, she discussed a strong defence relationship between the two countries. A source at No 10 claimed the leader even stressed that Brexit brought some opportunities.</p> <p>With Klaus Iohannis, the president of Romania, the focus was on cooperation on counter-terrorism. Both he and R\u00f5ivas insisted they wanted a close relationship with the UK, and May said her hope was to guarantee the rights of their citizens already in Britain, if the same could be promised for Britons in their countries.</p> <p>But British officials are advising May to be cautious about what she can negotiate in bilateral meetings, which can be warm, informal and easy to misinterpret. National leaders often rely on the EU institutions to deliver tough messages on their red lines that they prefer not to deliver in a one-to-one chat.</p>",

In perhaps the most famous account, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2014/jan/20/rousseau-compassionate-intense-relevant-philosopher\">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a> in his Confessions described the music he heard there as \u201cvoluptuous and affecting\u201d. \u201cThe richness of the art, the exquisite taste of the vocal part, the excellence of the voices, the justness of the execution, everything in these delightful concerts concurs to produce an impression ... from which I am of opinion no heart is secure.\u201d Rousseau also lamented the fact that the musicians were generally hidden from view behind a metal screen: \u201cWhat vexed me was the iron grate, which suffered nothing to escape but sounds, and concealed from me the angels of which they were worthy.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What did Von Uffenbach mean when he says he was frightened by Vivaldi\u2019s playing?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Rousseau\u2019s visit would have been made a few years after Vivaldi\u2019s death; other travellers who did get to see the composer in the flesh commented on the passionate temperament of the \u201cred-haired priest\u201d (<em>il prete rosso</em>) who directed proceedings. Visiting Venice in 1715, German traveller JFA von Uffenbach recorded his impressions of Vivaldi\u2019s violin playing. He played a \u201csplendid\u201d solo, Von Uffenbach noted, followed by \u201ca cadenza that really frightened me, for such playing has not been heard before and can never be equalled: he brought his fingers no more than a straw\u2019s breadth from the bridge, leaving no room for the bow \u2013 and that on all four strings with imitations and incredible speed.\u201d</p> <p>What did Von Uffenbach mean when he says he was \u201cfrightened\u201d by Vivaldi\u2019s playing? We wouldn\u2019t nowadays normally find anything scary in the sounds made by a virtuoso violinist. The answer, I think, lies in Vivaldi\u2019s ability to create a living drama of characters that play with the listener\u2019s expectations and responses. Not only does he pit the soloist in virtuosic display against the dynamic drive of the orchestra; he also creates a thrilling narrative by harnessing the tonal language, dramatically building and releasing harmonic tensions. In his ritornello form, the main thematic material \u201creturns\u201d at different junctures, but \u201cdismembered and intermingled\u201d as the flautist Johann Joachim Quantz wrote in 1752, adding yet another character to the spectacle.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To understand the effect Vivaldi\u2019s music had on those who first heard it, we need to make the music strange again.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In this way he unashamedly manipulated his listeners, getting inside their heads, playing with their emotions. Vivaldi had an economic as well as artistic need to keep his audiences coming back, and to present them with exciting music.</p> <p>In today\u2019s world, where we exist in a more or less constant haze of tonal music, we take the raw emotional power of the music that emerged in the 17th and 18th centuries by, for example, Vivaldi, Corelli and Bach, for granted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09d37de2f64a2e9fca7560512cdb30353e87159d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09d37de2f64a2e9fca7560512cdb30353e87159d/0_165_5196_3117/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hugo Ticciati and O/Modernt\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hugo Ticciati (right) and O/Modernt</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In order to understand the effect Vivaldi\u2019s music had on those who first heard it, I think we need to shock ourselves. We need to make the music strange again. Paradoxically, the best way to do this is by turning to a very familiar modern genre. Music historian <a href=\"http://www.oxfordwesternmusic.com/view/Volume2/actrade-9780195384826-div1-05007.xml\">Richard Taruskin</a> provides us with an important clue. An \u201caggressive performance\u201d of Vivaldi\u2019s music was matched by \u201can equally aggressive audience \u2013 a house full of shouting, clapping, stamping listeners\u201d, he writes, adding that \u201cany rock video will provide a living example\u201d of the kind of thing we are talking about. The comparison suddenly becomes clear: Von Uffenbach reacted to Vivaldi on the violin in the way audiences at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gunsnroses\">Guns N\u2019 Rose</a>s gig respond to one of Slash\u2019s virtuoso guitar solos \u2013 November Rain, for example.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SbUC-UaAxE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8SbUC-UaAxE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s no accident that, when they were looking for inspiration, acts such as The Beatles, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/nov/09/3\">Procol Harum</a>, Percy Sledge, Queen, Sting and many others didn\u2019t turn to the lush harmonies and expansive melodies of 19th-century Romanticism. They turned instead to the groove of a recurring bassline, to melodic extemporising over a chord progression, and to the unwritten freedom offered by the clarity and symmetry of baroque forms. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The term baroque ('misshapen pearl')  was coined to describe the grotesquely aberrant music of a previous age.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The term \u201cbaroque\u201d (Portuguese for \u201cmisshapen pearl\u201d) was first coined by supercilious Frenchmen to describe what they deemed the grotesquely aberrant music of a previous age. But the age of the basso continuo has supplied a wealth of musical pearls for modern rock musicians to reshape. In any case, despite its pejorative intent, the image of the \u201cmisshapen pearl\u201d doubtless conjures up something essential about much of the music of the baroque era, and nowhere more so than in the extravagances of Vivaldi.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plUGc4tHzOc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/plUGc4tHzOc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>These are the connections that I and the O/Modernt chamber orchestra will seek to exploit in our London debut on 22 October, in a concert we\u2019re calling <a href=\"http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/whats-on/music/vivaldi-rocks-gut-strings-and-metal-with-omodernt-kammarorkester\">Vivaldi Rocks!</a>. Several works by Vivadi are played predominantly as written \u2013 the main difference being the use of the Hammond organ as the basso continuo. Pieces by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/metallica\">Metallica</a>, Dream Theater and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/muse\">Muse</a> are interspersed between the movements of the Vivaldi, pointing up the many connections. For example, the pedal points, bass lines and instrumental character of Metallica\u2019s Orion forge links with Vivaldi\u2019s Concerto for Two Cellos, performed on bassoon and double bass. In Vivaldi\u2019s La Folia (which appropriately means \u201cmadness\u201d), each soloist improvises a rock-inspired \u201ccadenza\u201d. The music is performed as one continuous sequence, with smooth transitions achieved by juxtaposing related harmonic areas, or exploiting rhythmic motifs and improvisations. As the concert progresses, one becomes increasingly aware of the emotional affinities between Vivaldi\u2019s music, heard 300 years ago in Venice, and the global phenomenon that is modern rock. Although the Vivaldi is ostensibly presented in a way that retains \u201cauthenticity\u201d (whatever that really means), in its new context it comes to sound more and more like contemporary rock.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s a case of mixing the strange and the familiar, and in one sense we take a very traditional approach. Since time immemorial, the past has been one of the most important sources of inspiration for artists in every creative field. The name of the festival I direct in Stockholm is \u201c<a href=\"http://www.festivalomodernt.com/\">O/Modernt</a>\u201d, a Swedish expression that translates into English as \u201cUn/Modern\u201d. In practice, this means celebrating the act of looking back to find something innovative and original: using imaginative programming to explore vital connections between old and new.</p> <p>The aim is always to encourage audiences to experience older composers in new ways, not by spicing up their works with sonic gimmickry but rather by placing them in exciting, challenging and unusual, but always musically coherent contexts. And that is what we are aiming to achieve in London by using the music of Metallica, Dream Theatre and Muse to draw out the very special character of Vivaldi\u2019s music.</p> <p>To quote the great John Cage: \u201cThe past must be invented; the future must be revised.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022Vivaldi Rocks! \u2013 Gut Strings and Metal with O/Modernt Kammarorkester is at <a href=\"http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/whats-on/music/vivaldi-rocks-gut-strings-and-metal-with-omodernt-kammarorkester#.WAnxSpMrKuU\">Kings Place, London</a>, on 22 October.

We often had to run for our lives to escape the bombs and rocket attacks.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/21/child-refugees-will-have-ages-verified-if-necessary-minister-says\">Child refugees will have ages verified if necessary, minister says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When the war officially ended, we were still caught between the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/18/taliban-afghanistan-secret-talks-qatar\">Taliban and the government</a>. My father had been killed by US forces, so the Taliban tried to recruit me and my older brother to fight in their \u201choly war\u201d. I was only about 10 or 11, but the option they gave us was fight or die. The government, meanwhile, wanted us to be informants.<br></p> <p>Instead, my mother took the decision to send us away. She saved me but she also lost me, because 10 years later I am not the same Gulwali she knew. We said goodbye in Peshawar, Pakistan, and she handed me and my brother over to traffickers, telling us to stay together and keep hold of each other\u2019s hands.<br></p> <p>Almost immediately the agents separated us. I did not see my brother again for 14 months. We travelled on every form of transport; walking through the night, often hungry and thirsty, sometimes sleeping in bunkers or chicken coops. The traffickers didn\u2019t treat us like humans; we were just commodities. The worst point was crossing the Mediterranean from Turkey to Greece. I had never seen the sea before, but I was on a boat built for 20 people loaded with 120 people. We were on it for 50 hours with no food and water, and by the time we were rescued it was sinking.<br></p> <p>The journey was like snakes and ladders. I was arrested and sent to jail in Bulgaria before being sent back to Turkey. In Iran I had to run away from a police prison. What kept me going was faith and the hope of finding my brother. I came to England because I had heard that was where he was heading. It took me more than 100 attempts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/travel-chaos-warning-as-french-farmers-and-truckers-plan-calais-camp-protest\">get on a lorry in Calais</a>. The police would try to arrest you and I felt humiliated and worthless. That\u2019s how I burned my face \u2013 I tried to jump on a lorry loaded with chemicals.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83ec5a7a6166f4fa1aa04917a31240f3f2c303be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83ec5a7a6166f4fa1aa04917a31240f3f2c303be/0_203_3536_2121/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Refugees queue for food at the camp in Calais\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Refugees queue for food at the camp in Calais.

We survived because the refrigerator wasn\u2019t turned on. I finally got to the UK. After being arrested and sent to an immigration centre I had my age assessment. They asked me questions about my family background, my journey \u2013 even silly questions about the province I came from in Afghanistan. After three or four hours they announced I was not 13 but 16-and-a-half.<br></p> <p>They said I couldn\u2019t have travelled so far when I was still so young, and that I was too smart to be 13. I know I looked older than I was \u2013 I still do, but I grew up in a harsh, mountain environment and had been through a long, hard journey. They tried to give me a new date of birth. I was so angry. I felt they were worse than the smugglers \u2013 they had been heartless, but they hadn\u2019t tried to change my identity. I was so angry I ripped up the paper the assessors gave me, in front of them.<br></p> <p>In fact they refused to believe I was even from Afghanistan, although they never told me where else they thought my home was. It was stressful and distressing: I didn\u2019t know why they were saying all this. Now I know it is because the Home Office have to put you in school and in foster care and give you the <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/violencestudy/pdf/refugee_children_guidelines_on_protection_and_care.pdf\">legal rights of a child</a> if you are under 16.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/refugees-teeth-britain-children-calais-europe\">As a nation would we ever sink so low as to check refugees\u2019 teeth? | Hugh Muir</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead they put me in a independent living centre with adult asylum seekers and told me when I was in 18 (which, according to them, was in a year and a half) I would be deported back to Afghanistan. After that, I felt broken inside. I felt hopeless that I had come all this way, through so much hardship, and now people were saying I was a liar; it was so bad that I tried to kill myself twice in the months that followed. Last year they sent 4,000 former unaccompanied minors back, even though there is fighting in 30 out of 34 provinces in Afghanistan. <br></p> <p>Finally, by chance, I found my brother. He was visiting London and met some people from my centre, who told him they knew someone who looked just like him. I moved up to Bolton to be with him as soon as I could. There I found an education centre for migrant children called <a href=\"http://www.bolton.gov.uk/website/pages/SupportforfamiliesnewtotheUK.aspx\">Starting Point</a>. The headteacher there said a few small words that changed my life. She said she believed me. It meant everything.<br></p> <p>The teachers at the school fought on my behalf, and I also took matters into my own hands. I went to the Afghan embassy and got a birth certificate and a passport; I went to a specialist doctor to confirm my age. Eventually because I also had my Home Office card with my real name on it, the Home Office had to accept I was telling the truth.<br></p> <p>From then on I was put into foster care and allowed to go to school. I got 10 GCSEs and five A levels, and I have just graduated with a degree from Manchester University. Along the way I have written a book, spoken at the UN and carried the Olympic torch. All of those things happened because I was able to get the support and help I needed.<br></p> <p>But it is also why it hurts so much when I read the news reports claiming the young people being brought over from Calais under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/14/child-refugees-in-limbo-in-calais-because-of-home-office-delays\">the Dubs amendment</a> are lying. Why do we have this attitude of suspicion towards refugees? These young people have been through trauma and hardship. They are humans. They don\u2019t deserve to be treated like this. Media reports like this just create hatred against refugees and politicians should be ashamed for jumping on the bandwagon.<br></p> <p>When I go into schools now I often see 16-year-olds who, to me, look 14, because people from different parts of the world look different. People in the UK are brought up in peace and security, with no responsibility, but these young people may have seen their homes burnt and their families killed.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/oct/21/refugee-children-uk-bureaucracy-social-work\">Refugee children arriving in the UK need support \u2013 not bureaucracy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If these young people are older than they say, even then they should not be shamed like this, with their <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/child-refugee-front-pages-see-british-media-taken-to-task-by-twitter-users_uk_5805f0cce4b0dcd0298fb183\">pictures splashed across newspapers</a>. Could you blame them for being scared the Home Office will deport them back to a war zone if they are over 18? I just wish the authorities could be left to deal with them honestly and respectfully. There is no need for media reports to imply everyone in Calais is lying. We should be proud that we are reuniting young people with their families.<br></p> <p>Since I got travel documents I have been to Calais six or seven times to take food and aid and to show some solidarity with the refugees there. After 10 years I think the world has not got better; things are worse. It\u2019s so hard to see the lack of compassion, the lack of action. I was hoping no other children would ever go through what I did, but in Calais I met children even younger than I was when I arrived there. All they want is safety and to be treated like humans.<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/17/uncle-meets-nephew-from-calais-camp-i-think-it-is-a-dream-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58x82\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2815616\"            data-video-name=\"Uncle meets nephew from Calais camp: 'I think it is a dream' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian / Lisa O'Carroll\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58051da6e4b0cd26ff71e130\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/17/17102016calaisboy_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/17/17102016calaisboy.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/17/17102016calaisboy_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/17/uncle-meets-nephew-from-calais-camp-i-think-it-is-a-dream-video\">Uncle meets nephew from Calais camp: \u2018I think it is a dream\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>As a refugee you lose so much.

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Novi, Michigan, on Friday had a guest that caught many observers by surprise. Hovering behind Trump\u2019s head in the fourth row, was a man in a white turban and the traditional dress of a Shia Muslim cleric. </p> <p>The man was later identified as Lebanese sheikh Mohamed El-Hajj Hassan, who has since received a barrage of criticism for attending the rally given Trump\u2019s inflammatory language toward Muslims, including his call for all Muslims to be banned from entering the country.</p> <p>Before the rally in Novi, Trump met with Hassan and members of the <a href=\"http://amctrump.org/\">American MidEast Coalition for Trump</a> \u2013 a group working to build support for Trump in Middle Eastern communities \u2013 at an event organized by his foreign policy adviser and Fox News pundit Walid Phares.</p> <p>Hassan was previously a part of Hezbollah, the Shia militant and political group that has been listed as a foreign terrorist organization by the US state department since 1997. He broke off from the group shortly after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/13/ten-years-after-hariri-assassination-lebanon-needs-moderation\">2005 assassination</a> of former prime minister Rafik Hariri, and formed the Free Shia Movement, a splinter group that has gained little to no traction in Lebanon since.</p> <p><strong></strong>Hassan has since maintained his position as a vocal opponent of Hezbollah; even appearing on <a href=\"http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/4937.htm\">a TV show</a> last year referring to the group as hooligans.</p> <p>His attendance at the Trump rally last week drew the ire of a range of onlookers online. </p> <p>\u201cEvery commentator (who isn\u2019t a member of a political party) that I\u2019ve seen comment on this was just confused,\u201d said Joey Ayoub, Lebanese blogger at Hummus For Thought and MENA editor at Global Voices Online. Ayoub added that Hassan\u2019s anti-Hezbollah stance does not gel with Trump\u2019s tacit support for Vladimir Putin, as the Russian president supports Hezbollah in Syria. </p> <p>However, Hassan said Trump told him he likes Muslims and he has no problem with them, <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2016/10/01/area-middle-eastern-leaders-got-face-time-trump-novi/91357724/\">according to the Detroit Free Press</a>. The Trump campaign did not respond to The Guardian\u2019s multiple requests for comment.</p> <p>Michigan is home to the largest Arab American population in the country. Trump probably hoped that Hassan and the dozen other religious leaders he met with at the American Mideast Coalition for Trump event, would help mend his image among Arab Americans.</p> <p>\u201cTrump obviously benefits from the optics of having a visibly Muslim Arab at his rally,\u201d said Dr HA Hellyer, senior non-resident Fellow at the Atlantic Council. But he added, \u201cit will mean harsh questions for Hassan from the larger Arab and Muslim communities in the United States, and probably in Lebanon too.\u201d </p> <p>The meeting with Trump was orchestrated by Phares, a controversial figure in Trump\u2019s campaign. The news of his appointment as foreign policy adviser to Trump in March 2015<strong> </strong>was met with a wave of backlash. </p> <p>Phares is reported to have been a member of the Phalangist militia, a Christian Maronite force, during Lebanon\u2019s sectarian civil war that spanned 1975-1990. According to a <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/10/walid-phares-mitt-romney-lebanese-forces\">2011 Mother Jones investigation</a>, Phares was in charge of the ideological training of militia troops and even advocated for the creation of a Christian enclave within Lebanon, a hardline position in the multi-confessional state. There is no indication that Phares personally carried out any acts of violence or war crimes. </p> <p>The 15-year-long Lebanese conflict was brutal, with atrocities committed on all sides. The Phalangist militia itself, which was allied with the occupying Israeli army, was responsible for one of the war\u2019s lowest points: the 1982 massacre of hundreds of civilians at the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut. </p> <p>Phares ultimately fled Lebanon during the civil war and relocated to the US where he then became an academic. Over the next two decades, Phares published several books and espoused a hardline approach to Islam and the Middle East.</p> <p>\u201cHe began to endear himself to neocons after 9/11, with his books and studies about radical Islam,\u201d said Mohamad Bazzi, a New York University professor in journalism. </p> <p>According to Bazzi, he lumped all Islamist movements together \u2013 non-violent and violent \u2013 and heightened fears and suspicions around Islam. Phares became a regular \u201cexpert\u201d guest on NBC and later Fox News, even though several terrorism experts, such as Andrew Exum, have <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/96519/romney-walid-phares-sharia-caucus-iowa-pawlenty\">discredited</a> his work.</p> <p>In 2011, the former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney appointed him to his campaign as a foreign policy adviser, the same role he now fulfills for Trump.</p> <p>The appointment was met by a backlash from the Council of American-Islamic Relations and a variety of Islamic scholars who said that Phares had no credibility.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be akin to turning to [former KKK member] David Duke to get advice on race relations,\u201d Omid Safi, currently director of Duke University\u2019s Islamic Studies Center, told <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/10/12/mitt-romney-s-new-adviser-sparks-islamic-uproar.html\">the Daily Beast</a> at the time.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 October 2016 to remove a reference to Martha Crenshaw discrediting Phares\u2019 work.<br></p>",
  "<p>Conservative politicians have lined up to criticise Mark Carney in the most sustained pressure applied to a governor of the Bank of England since the central bank gained independence over monetary policy in 1998.</p> <p>In the run-up to the EU referendum, Tories accused Carney of interfering in the campaign by warning about the economic effects of a vote to leave. </p> <p>Since the vote, Carney has faced a series of rebukes over the effects of low interest rates and quantitative easing, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/oct/18/is-there-tory-conspiracy-bank-of-england-mark-carney-hague\">triggering talk of an effort to pass the blame for the economic consequences of Brexit to the BoE or to drive the governor out of his job</a>.</p> <p>Here are some of the Tory criticisms of Carney:</p> <p>On 8 March, the backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg accused Carney of intervening in the referendum debate when the BoE should have kept out.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What concerns me is that the influence and the strength of the Bank of England is in its Olympian detachment from day to day political partisanship. And in your evidence, in your letter and in your speech you are getting into political partisanship, removing yourself from your Olympian detachment, damaging the Bank\u2019s ability to regulate through influence, which has historically been just as important as the letter of the law.</p> </blockquote> <p>On 13 June, Bernard Jenkin, who chairs the public administration and constitutional affairs committee, wrote to Carney telling him to stay out of the referendum debate just as he would a general election.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You are prohibited from making any public comment, or doing anything which could be construed as taking part in the referendum debate.

He wasn\u2019t the worst but he shouldn\u2019t have joined in it at all. Now he is seeking to validate the improper remarks he made during the campaign.

  "<p>Forty years ago this week, young readers were eagerly anticipating the latest issue of their favourite British comic, <a href=\"https://bigmouthmag.wordpress.com/2016/08/23/action-comic-britains-brutal-weekly-real-70s/\">Action</a>.<br></p> <p> But the 37th issue never dropped through letterboxes. Facing a mounting wave of political and commercial pressure, the publishers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/ipc\">IPC</a> cancelled the title \u2013 even though that week\u2019s comic, cover-dated 23 October 1976, had already been printed.</p> <p> Almost 200,000 copies were pulled from distributors and sent to be pulped. Action was killed off in its prime.</p> <p> But why? A print run like that would have today\u2019s publishers salivating; according to <a href=\"http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/full-2015-mag-abcs-breakdown-cosmopolitan-bucks-trend-uk-magazines-decline-average-4-cent/\">Audited Bureau of Circulation figures</a> released early this year, even the once mighty Beano barely tops 33,000 weekly sales.</p> <p> But it wasn\u2019t poor sales that killed Action \u2013 quite the reverse. Kids, especially boys, were lapping it up, and that was the problem: Action was too popular and too violent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b8941eaa7c0f554c1a03a70cf29a8111cb70678d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8941eaa7c0f554c1a03a70cf29a8111cb70678d/0_0_400_573/349.jpg\" alt=\"Action comic\" width=\"349\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p> Strips such as Hook Jaw, about a savage Jaws-like shark; Kids Rule OK!, a post-apocalyptic thriller in which only teenagers survive; and Look Out For Lefty, which featured <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/footballviolence\">football hooliganism</a>, caused moral outrage among adults, leading directly to Action\u2019s ignominious demise.</p> <p> \u201cAction was a very important comic,\u201d says launch editor <a href=\"https://patmills.wordpress.com/\">Pat Mills</a>. \u201cIt was modern, it was exciting, but, most importantly, it didn\u2019t talk down to kids. It was about empowering them, about giving them stories where they had the power. They could relate to that. It wasn\u2019t a comic where figures of authority were in control.\u201d</p> <p> Most comics aimed at boys at the time were war comics \u2013 Victor, Warlord, Battle, and the Commando pocket books. \u201cIPC came to me and my brief was to create a comic that was as powerful as Battle,\u201d Mills recalls, \u201cbut more so \u2026 They wanted to make it a really modern comic.\u201d</p> <p> So Mills took a look around. He saw <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/punk\">punk rock</a> and football terrace violence and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/04/muhammad-ali-obituary\">Muhammad Ali</a> and queues outside the cinema for <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jaws\">Jaws</a>. If Action was going to reflect the modern world, it had to reflect these things. So he set to work. </p> <p> The British comics industry was quite a staid, safe environment at the time. \u201cWe must have seemed like a nightmare to these guys,\u201d Mills smiles ruefully. \u201cI told the management that I was going to do a story about a black boxer and they were horrified. They said the hero would have to be a white boxer, but perhaps he could have a black sidekick. I said, \u2018Haven\u2019t you heard of Ali?\u2019\u201d</p> <p> The story did appear as Mills intended, as BlackJack, written by John Wagner. This being a comic aimed at boys, Mills also wanted a football story. Look Out for Lefty didn\u2019t just tackle the action on the pitch, but the violence on the terraces. </p> <p> Mills cheerfully admits that he took direct inspiration from the popular culture at the time. \u201cJaws was the big story, this incredible movie about a shark, a force of nature. And I wanted some of that, so we did Hook Jaw. But I didn\u2019t want it to be like King Kong \u2013 I wanted nature to win!\u201d</p> <p> One remarkable thing about Action was that it was tacitly aimed at working-class children.</p> <p>\u201cThe only time we saw working-class characters they were sidekicks, like Digby in Dan Dare, or they were figures of fun,\u201d Mills says. \u201cEven Alf Tupper, the Tough of the Track, was presented as this odd character who trained for his races in his pit boots and ate fish and chips as soon as he crossed the finishing line.</p> <p> \u201cKids got what we were trying to do immediately. There was this whole culture of punk, of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/james-herbert\">James Herbert</a> books such as The Rats, of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://richardallen.wordpress.com/\">Richard Allen</a>\u2019s Skinhead novels \u2026 It was all edgy and different, and Action was definitely a part of that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4239c9b329b58a95b4e51472cd380fa18a769d3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4239c9b329b58a95b4e51472cd380fa18a769d3c/0_0_400_577/347.jpg\" alt=\"Action comic\" width=\"347\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p> Despite that, says Mills, the team putting together Action always had \u201ca definite moral compass\u201d. He says: \u201cWe weren\u2019t saying, \u2018Go and pick a fight on the terraces\u2019, but we were showing that sort of thing happened, as kids already knew.\u201d</p> <p> Action launched on 23 February and immediately began to grab headlines, notably in the Evening Standard, which ran a piece headlined: \u201cAARGH lives \u2026 but the blood is printed red.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSee a youth murder five policemen,\u201d the story continued, \u201csee a body hurtle through a car window, see several limbs chomped off by today\u2019s most modish monster, the killer shark. All this and more, some in glorious Technicolor, in the new British children\u2019s comic called Action, second issue out today.\u201d</p> <p>The furore continued to mount through the spring and summer, until the magazine closed that autumn, after just 36 gloriously ultraviolent issues.</p> <p>According to Mills, it was the story Kids Rule OK! that \u201cgot us banned\u201d. Set in a world without adults where gangs of teenagers run amok, Mills acknowledges that it was a riff on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Wallis\">Dave Wallis</a>\u2019s 1964 science fiction novel Only Lovers Left Alive. The final instalment featured a gang advancing on a cowering adult, a policeman\u2019s helmet beside him on the ground.</p> <p>The Sun branded Action a \u201csevenpenny nightmare\u201d and the presenter Frank Bough tore a strip off IPC\u2019s John Sanders when he appeared on the teatime news programme Nationwide.</p> <p> \u201cThe hounds were baying for blood,\u201d says Mills. A week after the Nationwide story, Action was debated in the House of Commons. Two of the UK\u2019s biggest distributors told IPC they weren\u2019t happy, with WH Smith rumoured to have declared that unless Action was axed it would refuse to stock any IPC titles.</p> <p> Issue 37 was duly pulped, but some copies had already been sent to contributors and a few stored in the archives. If you\u2019re lucky enough to have one, you\u2019ll probably know that one <a href=\"http://downthetubes.net/?p=22473\">sold last year on eBay</a> for more than \u00a32,500.</p> <p> \u201cI feel a great sense of loss for Action,\u201d says Mills, who launched 2000AD for IPC a year later. Action returned briefly in sanitised form and was eventually merged with Battle.</p> <p> It\u2019s been gone for 40 years, but not forgotten. Mills and comic writer Kev O\u2019Neill are writing a series of novels that fictionalise the Action episode; the first in their Read \u2019Em and Weep series, Serial Killer, is published next year. Titan Comics is publishing <a href=\"http://comicsalliance.com/titan-hookjaw-spurrier-boyle-sdcc-2016/\">a </a>brand <a href=\"http://comicsalliance.com/titan-hookjaw-spurrier-boyle-sdcc-2016/\">new series of Hook Jaw</a>, starting in December. And 2000AD\u2019s current publishers, Rebellion, have acquired the rights and archives of a host of IPC titles. </p> <p>They\u2019ve just produced a collection of old strips from the girls\u2019 comic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/oct/03/misty-the-girls-comic-returning-from-the-70s-to-a-new-age-of-children\">Misty</a>, and the odds are they\u2019ll be blowing the dust off those old Action strips, so who knows? Once again the kids might rule, OK?</p>",
  "<p>Intellectual capital has not featured prominently in the UK\u2019s Brexit debate. Media outlets and commentators have instead concentrated on UK trade and capital flows. Yet, as a key input for innovation and productivity, intellectual capital matters for maintaining the UK\u2019s prosperity and potential to grow. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/hard-brexit\">A hard Brexit</a> that prioritises immigration controls over access to the single market poses several risks to the free flow of intellectual capital, in our view. This threatens to erode the competitive edge the UK has gained in key sectors intensive in science and technology. </p> <p>Intellectual capital is about people \u2013 their education, expertise and skills. But importantly, it encompasses <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-intangible-investment-and-growth\">intangible assets, such as software, research and development (R&amp;D) capabilities</a>, as well as networks connecting universities, research partners and the corporate sector; it also includes property rights, such as patents and trademarks, which protect innovative products. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jul/12/uk-scientists-dropped-from-eu-projects-because-of-post-brexit-funding-fears\">UK scientists dropped from EU projects because of post-Brexit funding fears</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Because it is largely intangible, measuring intellectual capital is difficult, yet it is crucial for a country\u2019s ability to innovate and become more productive. It generates new ideas and creative output methods, as well as the know-how to solve problems. It is also important for gaining and maintaining a nation\u2019s competitive edge, particularly for economies oriented to services and reliant on processing big data and information. Intellectual capital is key for the sort of innovation needed to improve the efficiency with which people and capital interact to produce output. </p> <p>Depending on the terms the UK negotiates, a hard Brexit may carry negative implications for the UK\u2019s wealth of intellectual capital, particularly in the area of research. The UK\u2019s business spend on R&amp;D is skewed towards hi-tech manufacturing (46%) and knowledge-intensive services (23%). This has given the country a competitive advantage in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, aerospace, transport equipment, information and communication technology, as well as business and financial services. </p> <p>This competitive advantage could be put at risk if Brexit reduces the UK economy\u2019s openness, particularly if it restricts the free movement of intellectual capital and investment associated with new technology and specialisation.</p> <p>The problem is not so much funding. While it is well known that the UK is a net contributor to the EU budget, readers may be surprised to know that the UK is a net recipient of EU research funds. </p> <p>Remarkably, the UK is the country that receives the most EU funds allocated on a competitive basis (on par with the Netherlands and measured as a share of GDP), a testament to the excellence of the UK\u2019s research abilities. But these funds are small: net receipts represent only 0.2% of GDP. And even if no longer accessible in the future, depending on exit negotiations, they could conceivably be replaced by government funds or venture capital. A sizeable portion of the UK\u2019s R&amp;D funding is already financed by the private corporate sector. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/20/uk-will-get-a-hard-brexit-if-may-pursues-tough-approach-hollande\">Merkel and Hollande warn May that UK faces 'rough' ride with hard Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps a greater challenge is that the UK\u2019s ability to influence the direction of EU funding research could wane. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/norwegian-model-realities-brexit-norway-uk-eu\">If it negotiates the status of an \u201cassociated country\u201d, such as Norway, for example</a>, it would still be able to participate in EU-funded projects, but without steering them and possibly subject to conditions (as in the case of Switzerland, which has a \u201cpartially associated country\u201d status). </p> <p>The biggest threat, in our view, comes from the prospective migration restrictions, which could impede international collaboration and erode the UK\u2019s ability to attract talent. <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/science/oecd-science-technology-and-industry-scoreboard-20725345.htm\">International collaboration is key to academic and corporate sector research</a>: it creates synergies, builds on the best expertise, provides access to equipment, reduces costs and facilitates the sharing of new ideas. </p> <p>With a hard Brexit, the UK\u2019s attractiveness to students, academic staff and researchers could diminish over time. It could also lessen the country\u2019s allure as a base for new, shared pan-European research infrastructure, many of which have found a home in the UK in the past because of its research competencies.</p> <p>The extent of the threat to intellectual capital depends on the formulation of the government\u2019s new rules (for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/05/uk-immigration-what-are-the-alternatives-to-a-point-based-system\">whether a visa point-based system is introduced</a>) and on what sort of Brexit deal will be negotiated. True, the UK can count on the advantage of the English language and an unrivalled business-friendly environment in the EU that is conducive to innovation and risk-taking, boasting low barriers to entrepreneurship, well-functioning institutions (including a good insolvency regime), and a healthy venture-capital system. </p> <p>This advantage will not dissipate quickly, but with a hard Brexit the UK risks the slow erosion of its competitiveness and of its appeal to investors as a base from which to access the EU market to scale activity internationally.</p> <p><em>Carmen Nuzzo is a senior economist at Morgan Stanley</em></p>",

It\u2019s also at the center of recent prisoner strikes across the country, and is the only place where correctional officers have gone on strike as well. On 6 October the US Department of Justice (DoJ) announced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/06/alabama-prison-doj-investigation\">state-wide investigation</a> of Alabama\u2019s prisons for men, targeting sex abuse, violence, and generally unsafe conditions for both prisoners and officers. Such a colossal investigation is, according to legal experts, unprecedented.</p> <p>Current employees at the prison are afraid to discuss conditions inside. But Lt Curt Stidham agreed to meet and describe life at the prison for the Guardian. He left Holman this summer but Holman hasn\u2019t left him; at a local pizza place he insisted on sitting in the corner, facing the doors. \u201cI need to be able to see,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll find all the officers are like this.\u201d</p> <p>He sketched a layout of the prison on a napkin, and described the hierarchy of officers. \u201cThere\u2019s the warden at the top, then two captains, and then lieutenants,\u201d he said. As a lieutenant his first order every day was to figure out how many of his shift officers had reported for duty. The prison is run by a staff as thin as the razor wire that surrounds the prison. Sometimes as few as nine guards would try to control the entire population, Stidham said. </p> <p>And how big is the population?</p> <p>\u201cNine-hundred fifty,\u201d he said, in a facility built to house 637.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a5069519dea1e2719864e69d07f5b571f861fba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a5069519dea1e2719864e69d07f5b571f861fba/0_0_3588_2153/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Curt Stidham recently resigned as a guard at Holman prison.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Curt Stidham recently resigned as a guard at Holman prison.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Teague/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The department of corrections confirmed Stidham\u2019s allegations. \u201cOver-population and understaffing, yes,\u201d said Bob Horton, spokesman for Alabama\u2019s prisons.

Regulations might call for two officers to transport a prisoner, for instance, but there\u2019s only one available. Or a lone guard might stand at the door of a dorm housing 115 inmates; if a group of prisoners assaults another one, it\u2019s that guard\u2019s job to wade into the chaos and protect the victim.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/power.html\" data-alt=\"membership callout\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/power.html\">membership callout</a> </figure>  <p>Stidham unfurled a canvas jacket on the trunk of his car, revealing dozens of prison-made knives.

  "<p>In its 53 years, Doctor Who has taken us to the farthest reaches of the universe to the end of time itself. But now it finds somewhere genuinely new to go: a Shoreditch sixth-form. This week sees the launch of Class, the latest spinoff and an exercise in \u201cYoung Adult\u201d, the bogglingly successful sub-genre that gave the world Twilight and The Hunger Games, and of which the show\u2019s creator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/patrick-ness\">Patrick Ness</a> is a leading light. It\u2019s also the most high-profile offering from BBC3 since the channel\u2019s move online. Doctor Who has been many things \u2013 epic, scary, life-affirming, naff \u2013 but up to this point, not many would have called it especially cool. Stay with me\u2026</p> <p>Class is familiar territory seen through new eyes. We are talking about a youth-oriented spinoff from a children\u2019s show that grown adults enjoy getting angry about online, and that comes with a built-in warning that its adult themes make it \u201cunsuitable for younger viewers\u201d. Certainly, there are swears aplenty. One of the leads even <em>smokes</em>. And it doesn\u2019t flinch from being gruesome. Such is the way with YA. But if Class carries itself with swagger and style, the young characters themselves don\u2019t necessarily \u2013 yet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d828fdb46825c294afac89985c0d9bf5ed65612\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d828fdb46825c294afac89985c0d9bf5ed65612/0_99_4228_2537/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Coal Hill gang must add \u2018reluctant protectors of humanity\u2019 to their list of teenage travails.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Coal Hill gang must add \u2018reluctant protectors of humanity\u2019 to their list of teenage travails.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Simon Ridgeway</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We first meet April, an earnest Head Girl type, as she plans the sixth-form prom at Coal Hill Academy and moons hopelessly over Charlie, a newcomer from Sheffield who is quite clearly, both to himself and the rest of the school, gay.

(This points to a future scandalous storyline in itself, since Tanya is a 14-year-old advanced learner, shifted ahead into a peer-group of sixth-formers.) </p> <p>Aside from exams and doomed crushes, the biggest challenge for the nascent gang is their physics teacher Miss Quill, played with gleeful spite by Coronation Street alum and Sarah-Lancashire-in-waiting Katherine Kelly. \u201cThe cream of the crop?\u201d she withers in one classroom scene. \u201cNo wonder all this country exports is Downton Abbey.\u201d Miss Quill is <em>incredibly</em> cool, though it\u2019s soon clear that she has as many secrets as her charges \u2013 and things are only going to get messier.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3645e928d2b93727b620360987987c3763dd6ec9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3645e928d2b93727b620360987987c3763dd6ec9/0_0_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miss Quill (Katherine Kelly) with The Doctor (Peter Capaldi).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Incredibly cool \u2026 Miss Quill (Katherine Kelly) with The Doctor (Peter Capaldi).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Simon Ridgeway</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Because as every fan knows, Coal Hill school is a longtime cornerstone of the Whoniverse.

The twelfth Doctor posed as the school caretaker in 2014, to chase down a murderous robot called the Skovox Blitzer, much to the consternation of his travelling companion Clara Oswald, who was holding down a job there as an English teacher. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/05/doctor-who-pearl-mackie-new-series-companion-interview\">Doctor Who's new companion Pearl Mackie: 'I have no time-travelling experience!'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By this point, too much timey-wimey nonsense has gone on at Coal Hill.

So it\u2019s hardly a spoiler to reveal that by the end of the pilot, the gang have to add \u201creluctant protectors of humanity\u201d to their list of teenage travails. Bereft Who fans craving a 2016 fix but who might be reticent about a \u201cyoof\u201d spinoff would do well to watch the pilot to the end.</p> <p>UK TV drama has never really tackled the YA genre before, and of the many questions posed by the Class opener, perhaps the most pertinent is: \u201cwhy the hell not?\u201d This already feels more mature than Torchwood, the previous Doctor Who spinoff whose first series seemed to spend most weeks featuring a different alien that went round sexing people to death. And the inevitable comparison with Buffy is deftly hat-tipped in a scene where the gang liken Coal Hill\u2019s predicament to a \u201cHellmouth\u201d. Without getting too ahead of ourselves, it looks like Class will stand up handsomely beside its predecessor. And as for coolness \u2013 a certain somebody shan\u2019t be needing those sonic shades any more.</p> <p><em>Class will be available on iPlayer from 21 October. </em></p>",

  "<p></p> <p>Donald Trump has boasted of being the law and order candidate, but legal scholars and ex-government ethics officials have warned against what they see as his cavalier attitude toward potential conflicts of interest and the rule of law, based on the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s rhetoric and policy stances.</p> <p>Specifically, ethics and legal scholars say that Trump\u2019s notion of creating a supposed \u201cblind trust\u201d for his businesses, if he becomes president, that would let his children run the Trump Organization without an independent trustee is risible. Trump told Fox News last month: \u201cI will sever my connections and I\u2019ll have my children and my executives run the company, and I wouldn\u2019t discuss it with them.\u201d</p> <p>He told CNN last month that \u201cI would most likely put it in a blind trust and they [his children and executives] would run it, or something.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-money-blog/2016/apr/21/donald-trump-brand-white-house-business-empire\">Why winning the White House would be the best deal of Donald Trump's business career</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This, legal experts say, is not how a blind trust is supposed to work. Richard Painter, who served as chief ethics lawyer for President George W Bush, says that in a true blind trust \u201cthe trustee has to be independent of the office holder and certainly not the sons and daughter\u201d. Additionally, he said, Trump would have to sell off his real estate assets and an independent trustee would then have to place his funds or investments in a new trust without revealing the contents to Trump or his children.</p> <p>Other legal scholars concur. \u201cAbsent a truly blind trust, Mr Trump would be able to make decisions that could benefit his business interests,\u201d says Lloyd H Mayer, a law professor and tax specialist at Notre Dame. \u201cNothing Trump has said indicates he\u2019s interested in setting up a truly blind trust where neither he, nor his family members, nor his close associates would know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p> <p>The criticisms of Trump\u2019s blind trust proposal echo other recent controversies over legal issues over which Trump has faced fire from scholars and former government officials for challenging, or ignoring, social and legal norms through his policy stances.</p> <p>Some legal scholars, for instance, note that Trump has shown contempt for press freedoms by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/26/trump-pledges-curb-press-freedom-libel-laws-first-amendment\">advocating changing the libel laws</a> to make it easier to sue the media \u2013 and \u201cmake lots of money\u201d in Trump\u2019s words \u2013 while using inflammatory words to paint a picture of a vast press conspiracy ranged against him.</p> <p>Painter sees Trump\u2019s talk of changing libel laws as glib and dangerous since he \u201cdoesn\u2019t acknowledge there\u2019s a constitutional problem\u201d, given the first amendment right to free speech.</p> <p>In a similar vein, Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-us-election-result\">stonewalling and equivocating over whether he would accept the election results</a> \u2013 win or lose \u2013 drew widespread bipartisan fire as a rebuke to the principles of democracy.<br></p> <h2>Conflicts of interest</h2> <p>Most recent presidents have taken pains to curb conflicts of interest or appearance problems \u2013 even though the president and vice-president are exempt from the conflict of interest statute that other executive branch officials have to follow.</p> <p>But legal scholars say that Trump would potentially face more conflict of interest problems than previous presidents given the global nature of his real estate empire and business dealings \u2013 from Azerbaijan to Turkey and from China to India \u2013which could be impacted by government economic or foreign policy decisions and often involve licensing agreements with his name and brand on hotels plus residential and office properties.</p> <p>\u201cWhile Donald Trump\u2019s conflicts of interest would arguably be more extreme than those of previous presidents, who have used blind trusts to hold and manage their assets while in office, this kind of arrangement would not work for Trump because he has integrated his children into the management of his business operation, and his assets are so closely tied to his name and identity,\u201d says Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University who specializes in legal ethics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c1008c96c9f33cdd5fc5d9a8f7cae7d3752e6c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c1008c96c9f33cdd5fc5d9a8f7cae7d3752e6c8/173_0_4526_2715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Donald Trump\u2019s conflicts of interest would arguably be more extreme than those of previous presidents.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Donald Trump\u2019s conflicts of interest would arguably be more extreme than those of previous presidents.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Frey/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Further, Trump and his businesses could face legal risks under the constitution\u2019s emoluments clause, an ethics measure that bars a president from receiving gifts or payments from foreign governments, or entities controlled by those governments. Painter points out that Trump\u2019s real estate empire has often relied on foreign bank loans \u2013 including from the Bank of China \u2013 which could create problems if new loans were made, or old ones renegotiated, under terms that deviated from normal rates, thus giving Trump\u2019s businesses a financial edge.</p> <p>Other experts agree that the emoluments clause could impact Trump\u2019s businesses. \u201cIf Donald Trump\u2019s business arrangements involve his receiving payments, directly or indirectly, from a foreign government or an entity it controls, that would violate the emoluments clause,\u201d Clark said.</p> <p>As legal criticism has escalated of Trump\u2019s unusual concept of a blind trust, his son Eric Trump last month tried to defend it in an ABC television interview by noting that his father would not make decisions as \u201cit relates to the company\u201d, and that \u201cwe\u2019re not going to be involved in government\u201d.</p> <p>Those broad assertions haven\u2019t quieted critics of Trump\u2019s notion of a blind trust. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even have cosmetic value because his interests are presumably aligned with his kids\u2019,\u201d says Ken Gross, a partner with Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom.</p>",
  "<p>A scheme to kill rats on two of the Isles of Scilly, backed by Prince Charles, has led to a resurgence in rare sea birds.</p> <p>The number of Manx shearwaters has risen to 73 nesting pairs this year, the highest in living memory and almost triple the number of nesting birds just three years ago. The birds appear to be breeding successfully, with 30 chicks spotted on the popular holiday islands. Another species of rare ground-nesting birds, storm petrels, have also returned to the Scillies. </p> <p>The Manx shearwater shares the burrows of rabbits on the tussocky slopes of the Scilly Islands of St Agnes and Gugh, while the storm petrel nests in cracks in rocks, beneath the local pub. But this made them vulnerable to rats, which ate both their eggs and chicks. </p> <p>There is archeological evidence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/sep/21/britains-oldest-birds\">Manx shearwaters</a> on the islands dating back to 2,000 BC. By the 13th century, they were so common that they were used as currency. Annual rents were paid in 30 \u2018pufons\u2019 (either puffins or Manx shearwaters) to the Duchy of Cornwall. </p> <p>But it was the rats rather than the Duchy that caused the birds\u2019 decline. It is thought that brown rats arrived on the islands in the 17th century, from the many shipwrecks that dot the coast of the Scillies.</p> <p>By 2014 there were only 24 nesting pairs of Manx shearwaters left and a chick had not survived in some 100 years. </p> <p>In 2013 the 84 islanders worked together to eradicate the rats under a \u00a3750,000 scheme backed by Prince Charles. Farmers cleaned out sheds and barns. New, sturdy refuse bins were supplied to every household. And islanders started taking waste to the local tip just once a week. </p> <p>All 11 children at the school on St Agnes were taught about rats, storm petrels and shearwaters. </p> <p>Then for three weeks in November 2013 more than 1,000 baiting boxes were laced with poison. Some 3,000 rats were killed. Now, with the islands rat-free, the rare migratory birds are flourishing.</p> <p>Jaclyn Pearson from the RSPB, who managed the project said: \u201cWe are thrilled that these seabirds are thriving since the rat removal.</p> <p>\u201cAll the hard work which everyone has put into the project has been well worth it when you know that a species has been returned to a habitat which is rightfully theirs,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The sparrow-sized storm petrel is the smallest seabird in the world, and the Isles of Scilly is just one of two places in England where they are found. But, because of the rats there had been no sighting of them in St Agnes and Gugh in living memory. </p> <p>There are an estimated 280,000 Manx shearwaters in the world, and Britain acts as home to the majority of them during summer months. The birds make an annual 20,000-mile migration from South America to breed on the islands, finding their way by star-gazing. </p> <p>Chicks are said to spend several days at the mouth of their burrows on the Scilly Isles gazing at the stars before making their perilous first flight south, and are then believed to find their way back to that same burrow by following the alignment of the stars above it. </p> <p>Plans are underway to extend the scheme to the islands of Tresco, St Martin\u2019s and Bryher, if funding can be found. \u201cWe know it\u2019s feasible,\u201d said Jaclyn. \u201cThe birds are coming here, so we have a responsibility for them.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>For more than 50 years the Vatican\u2019s relationship with China has been intractable. But if Pope Francis has his way, a deal to bridge what many believe is an insurmountable divide between the Roman Catholic church and the communist Chinese government could be announced within the next 30 days.</p> <p>According to one person who has closely followed developments, the pope would like to seal a deal before the conclusion on 20 November of the <a href=\"https://cruxnow.com/church/2015/12/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-holy-year-of-mercy/\">Holy Year of Mercy</a>, which was called by the pontiff to celebrate acts of forgiveness.</p> <p>Any agreement that solves the thorniest issue between the two sides \u2013 the Vatican\u2019s right to appoint its own bishops in China \u2013 would represent the most consequential diplomatic feat of the Francis\u2019s papacy.</p> <p>It would also spur a debate about whether Francis \u2013 a Jesuit who has always promoted <a href=\"https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/distinctly-catholic/pope-francis-encounter\">the importance of \u201cencounters\u201d</a> but has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30455187\">declined to meet the Dalai Lama</a> \u2013 has been too willing to ignore concerns about human rights and religious freedom for the sake of furthering the Vatican\u2019s own interests in a country that is officially atheist. While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/30/china-christianity-removal-crosses-communist-party-churches\">evangelical Christianity has seen explosive growth in China</a>, Catholicism has lagged behind.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, China has always been a reference point of greatness. A great country. But more than a country, a great culture, with an inexhaustible wisdom,\u201d the pope told Asia Times this year.</p> <p>Since his election in 2013, there have been subtle signs that the relationship between the Vatican and Beijing has warmed. There was <a href=\"http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2014/08/14/pope_francis_sends_telegram_from_plane_to_china_/1104531\">the telegram Francis sent</a> to President Xi Jinping as his papal plane flew in Chinese airspace on the way to Taiwan in 2014, and the gift of a silk print, symbolic of Christianity\u2019s presence in China, that was reportedly given to the pope this month by a representative of Xi, though the accuracy of that story has not been confirmed.</p> <p>Chinese Catholics are free to go to mass and attend church, but barred from proselytising. An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/03/christian-church-leader-hu-shigen-jailed-chinese-human-rights-crackdown\">\u201cunderground\u201d Catholic church</a> exists, and members and its clergy have faced persecution by authorities.</p> <p>No one believes that negotiations between the two sides will lead to formal diplomatic relations, a move that would force the Vatican to break ties with Taiwan. Jeroom Heyndrickx, a Belgian priest who has championed the negotiations, said the talks were centred on whether the Vatican would be given permission to appoint its own bishops. </p> <p>There is also a disagreement over the the fate of eight \u201cillegal\u201d bishops appointed by officials in China, some of whom have been excommunicated by the Vatican.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere have been some efforts at dialogue in the past, but never so intensive and ongoing and with perseverance on both sides,\u201d Heyndrickx said. \u201cThe situation is more hopeful now than it has been in 65 years.\u201d </p> <p>Reaching an initial agreement on the bishops could make it easier to tackle other issues, such as the fate of the China Catholic Patriotic Association, a state-controlled organisation that controls the church and appoints bishops.</p> <p>Heyndrickx said negotiations between the Vatican and Beijing were set to recommence later this month. A preliminary agreement that was reportedly reached in August would allow the pope to choose bishops from candidates recommended by the CCPA.</p> <p>Church sources have separately told Reuters that China is preparing to ordain at least two new bishops before the end of the year, and these appointments would have the blessing of the Vatican. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.asianews.it/news-en/What-will-2016-bring-the-Church-in-China-36349.html\">most vocal critic</a> against any such deal is Cardinal Joseph Zen, a former bishop of Hong Kong and critic of China\u2019s human rights record. \u201cIt is unthinkable to leave the initial proposal in the hands of an atheist government who cannot possibly judge the suitability of a candidate to be a bishop,\u201d he wrote <a href=\"http://www.asianews.it/news-en/What-will-2016-bring-the-Church-in-China-36349.html\">in an article</a> for AsiaNews in September.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/27/china-arrests-christians-opposed-cross-removals-zhejiang\">China arrests Christians who opposed removals of crosses</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The apparent warming of relations between Beijing and Vatican coincides with a controversial \u201ccross-removal\u201d campaign in eastern China. Communist party authorities have forced more than 1,200 churches in the heavily Christian region to remove the symbol. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/26/anger-as-christian-lawyer-is-paraded-on-chinese-state-tv-for-confession\">Zhang Kai</a>, a prominent Christian lawyer, spent more than six months in secret detention after opposing the campaign. <br></p> <p>John Allen, the editor of The Crux, a Catholic publication, said Francis \u2013 like his predecessors, Pope Benedict XVI and John Paul II \u2013 had signalled a willingness to address China\u2019s concerns that the church would be hostile to the state if it was shown any latitude.</p> <p>He said the Vatican was pursuing a \u201chuge long-term interest\u201d in its courting of China, which was controversial in some circles within the church. But the real difficulty in hammering out a deal was not resistance inside the Vatican but rather China\u2019s objections.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is that Xi has a strong wing of the party apparatus that says if you give the Christians, and the Catholics in particular, an inch, they are going to take a mile. Ultimately this is about who controls the Catholic community. Is the primary loyalty to the state or the pope?,\u201d Allen said.</p> <p>Successive popes have had an answer to that question: it can be both. \u201cBut the Chinese to date are divided on whether that is true,\u201d Allen said.</p> <p>The difference between the current negotiations and previous talks is Francis himself. The first non-European pope is viewed as less political and more sympathetic to interests outside the US and Europe, experts say.</p> <p>Francesco Sisci, a senior researcher at China Renmin University in Beijing, noted that Francis was the first pope to have his homilies translated in China.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, he is not a superstar, he is not as popular as a rock star, but he is known to the Chinese public and that is very different from other popes, who were totally unknown\u201d Sisci said.<br></p> <p>Richard McGregor, a China expert and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/13/the-party-richard-mcgregor-review\">author of The Party</a>, said it was not clear why agreeing a deal with the Vatican would be a priority for senior officials. \u201cThere are lots of obstacles in the way of a genuine deal. At the same time, they have many other political priorities in the area of managing and keeping a lid on religion, so it is hard to see why China would compromise.\u201d</p> <p>While a deal would be a propaganda coup for Beijing and put pressure on Taiwan, McGregor said there were \u201cfundamental issues of authority\u201d at stake that would make it hard for the Vatican to demand any guarantees on control of the church in the mainland.</p> <p> Pope Francis is said to have a special devotion to Mary, the \u201cundoer of knots\u201d.

  "<p>Amid the raucous cheering, disbelieving emojis and graceless carping that accompanied the awarding of the latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/nobelprizes\">Nobel prize</a> for literature, an unexamined claim was made several times: that this was the first time the prize had gone to a songwriter. A couple of newsreaders used the word \u201cmusician\u201d, others the historical and more precise \u201csinger-songwriter\u201d; but mainly they stuck to \u201csongwriter\u201d. It struck me that the claim was wrong. The first (and the only other) songwriter the prize went to was the Indian poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/07/rabindranath-tagore-why-was-he-neglected\">Rabindranath Tagore</a>, in 1913. It was given to him \u201cbecause\u201d, according to the citation, \u201cof his profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse, by which, with consummate skill, he has made his poetic thought, expressed in his own English words, a part of the literature of the west\u201d. The citation for Bob Dylan, which acknowledges him for \u201chaving created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition\u201d, is different from but oddly reminiscent of the one from 1913, when honouring an Indian \u2013 someone located in the world of gurus and s\u00e9ances \u2013 must have seemed as puzzling as giving a \u201cserious\u201d prize to a pop musician. Little was known outside Bengal about Tagore, just as little, really, is known about Dylan. The citation from 1913 is already engaged in invention, making no mention of the fact that the \u201cverse\u201d is actually songs, or that they\u2019re translations from Bengali. But Tagore translated the title of the book that got him the prize, <em>Gitanjali</em>, almost literally, as \u201cSong Offerings\u201d and it\u2019s a compendium of lyrics turned by him into strange English prose poems, selected from three slim Bengali collections of songs \u2013 songs that are not only performed today in Bengal, but performed ad nauseam.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/07/rabindranath-tagore-why-was-he-neglected\">Rabindranath Tagore was a global phenomenon, so why is he so neglected? | Ian Jack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The main difference here is that, unlike Dylan, Tagore had a capacious, remarkable and completely modern body of poetic works. Pound\u2019s urgent message to Harriet Monroe about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/ts-eliot\">TS Eliot</a>, that he had \u201cactually trained himself AND modernised himself ON HIS OWN\u201d, could have applied equally to Tagore, though Pound chose to compare Tagore to a \u201cjongleur\u201d, a Provencal minstrel. The other difference is that Tagore wasn\u2019t a jongleur, that is, a singer of his own songs, though he might well have wanted such a career among his several. As a young man, he was \u2013 much like Dylan \u2013 certainly interested in performing his latest compositions for whoever would listen, but complained bitterly later about losing his singing abilities. His only extant, scratchy recording is from when he was much older, of \u201c<em>Tobu mone rekho</em>\u201d (\u201cStill, remember this\u201d), and gives to us the high-pitched, slightly tentative and astonishingly immediate voice that Bengalis identify with Tagore, and which they never deemed worthy of a singer. To listen to it is to be deeply moved. It\u2019s also to understand the nature of Dylan\u2019s achievement as a performer and recording artist.</p> <p>I was never a great fan of Dylan while growing up (nor of Tagore), seeing him as a Picasso-like figure, the sort of artist for whom tireless self-publicity and stylistic innovation have merged into one thing. This is not to deny the impact that songs such as \u201cDon\u2019t Think Twice, It\u2019s All Right\u201d, \u201cTangled Up in Blue\u201d, \u201cLove Minus Zero/No Limit\u201d and \u201cIdiot Wind\u201d have had at different points in my life. But my interest in the sort of creator Dylan is grew manifold more recently while chancing upon \u201cWho Killed Davey Moore\u201d, his song first written and performed in 1963, but unreleased on any album until <em>The Bootleg Series</em> in 1991. This accounts for the late discovery. It\u2019s a song about the death of the eponymous featherweight champion, who died soon after losing a prize fight: but it\u2019s not a protest song about the welfare of boxers. What is it then? In 1964, Dylan wasn\u2019t sure, though he had ingeniously appropriated the children\u2019s rhyme \u201cWho Killed Cock Robin?\u201d to make the song. As he told his the crowd at his show in October 1964: \u201cIt\u2019s got nothing to do with boxing, it\u2019s just a song about a boxer really ... It\u2019s got nothing to do with nothing. But I fit all these words together... that\u2019s all ... It\u2019s taken directly from the newspapers ... Nothing\u2019s been changed ... Except for the words.\u201d Dylan can\u2019t be certain about what the song represents because it\u2019s not really \u201ca song about a boxer\u201d, it\u2019s a statement about a particular kind of creativity, that has to do with reusing, defamiliarising, reordering and rearranging existing material so that its political and aesthetic registers undergo a transformation. In \u201cWho Killed Davey Moore\u201d, the material comprises the American folksong, the children\u2019s rhyme, the public tragedy and the narrative \u201ctaken directly from the newspapers\u201d and subjected to the sort of estranging synthesis in which \u201cnothing\u2019s been changed ... except for the words\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97e3080cc5274a55f75798e17bd0d25b33e92588\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97e3080cc5274a55f75798e17bd0d25b33e92588/0_422_4950_2971/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rabindranath Tagore in 1935.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rabindranath Tagore in 1935.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fox Photos/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few years ago, I realised that Tagore was a Dylan of his day at least in this \u2013 his irreverent, opportunistic and startling approach to whatever constituted his inheritance, his past, as a songwriter. This included Indian classical forms, Scottish drinking songs, marching tunes, the devotional <em>kirtan</em>, and much else. Listening again to his political anthem \u201c<em>Jodi Tor Dak Shune Keu Na Ase Tobe Ekla Cholo Re</em>\u201d (\u201cIf no one heeds you when you call, walk alone\u201d), it seemed I was hearing an experiment very similar to \u201cWho Killed Davey Moore\u201d, because Tagore had chosen for the song\u2019s tune a <em>baul</em> melody whose original words spoke of an obsession with Krishna (<em>baul</em> means \u201cmad\u201d, and is thus a million miles away from Tagore\u2019s refined Brahmo upbringing), and lifted it unhesitatingly, almost thoughtlessly, into another context that should have been as ill-fitting as a children\u2019s rhyme with a boxer\u2019s death. This rearrangement was common practice for Tagore, as, decades later, it was for Dylan, and leads to a multiplicity of tones in their work. They are both lyricists, but if the redefinition of the lyric impulse goes back to the personal and generational confession that is Wordsworth\u2019s \u201cResolution and Independence\u201d (\u201cWe Poets in our youth begin in gladness; / But thereof come in the end despondency and madness\u201d), then we need to look, among Dylan\u2019s contemporaries, to Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u201cChelsea Hotel #2\u201d and its shabby-plangent depiction of sex with Janis Joplin, or, especially, to Joni Mitchell\u2019s extraordinary work. Both these songwriters did what Dylan didn\u2019t; that is, expanded the song lyric to contain their own lives and those of their peers\u2019, becoming, in the process, as much fellow-travellers with the folk music set as with the Robert Lowell of <em>Life Studies</em>.</p> <p>Dylan and Tagore deal in lyricism; but, primarily, they deal in what Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss somewhat disparagingly called \u201cbricolage\u201d, where the aim is to not so much to create afresh (despite the Nobel citation\u2019s proclamation) as \u201calways to make do with whatever is available\u201d. And so much was available to both these creators \u2013 the rhythms of folk songs; political slogans; religious exhortation; the novel; the modern poem; four chords; various ragas! The \u201cbricoleur addresses himself to a collection of oddments left over from human endeavours\u201d, said L\u00e9vi-Strauss, and his motto, according to the critic G\u00e9rard Genette, is: \u201cThat might always come in handy.\u201d This sums up both Tagore\u2019s and Dylan\u2019s attitude as songwriters and explains their large output. Whereas the lyric poet waits and so tends towards silence, these two are always restlessly arranging, adding and rearranging. Not lyric poets then, or even jongleurs, but bricoleurs, who occupy a separate category because they work across genres. If there had been a Nobel prize for art, or for music, these two could have got it for their songs on the same grounds: of not creating, but indefatigably recreating, tradition.</p>",
  "<p>We know the world is warming \u2013 no factor can explain it aside from human emissions of greenhouse gases. Despite this, people who deny the basic facts of climate change have tried to argue that the Earth is either not warming or is only slowly heating. Well <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/nov/24/study-drives-a-sixth-nail-in-the-global-warming-pause-myth\">that just isn\u2019t true anymore</a>. The last three years are the nail in the coffin of the deniers of climate change. We have enough data this year to call 2016 as the hottest year ever record \u2013 and we have three more months left to go.</p> <p>So, just how hot is 2016? Well my early predictions are shown in the graph below. I have taken temperature data from NASA and superimposed my predictions for 2016 \u2013 it isn\u2019t even close. And by the way, it doesn\u2019t matter whose data you use (NASA, NOAA, JMA, Hadley Centre) the results are the same. 2016 is going to blow 2015 out of the water.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9e9b060435fd1c22437d835492ad0137a68b50c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9e9b060435fd1c22437d835492ad0137a68b50c/0_0_1601_961/1000.png\" alt=\"Average global surface temperatures.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Average global surface temperatures.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: NASA GISS, adapted by John Abraham.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few things to note. First, these temperatures are surface temperatures that are taken across the globe. But, you can measure temperatures elsewhere and see the same result. Most importantly, measurements in the oceans, where 93% of the extra heat is stored are the best proof of global warming. I recently coauthored an open-access paper on this very topic which interested readers can get <a href=\"http://www.ocean-sci.net/12/925/2016/\">here</a>.</p> <p>You can measure sea level rise as the heated water expands, you can measure ice loss across the globe, you can measure temperatures in the lower part of the atmosphere. It doesn\u2019t matter where; the story is the same.</p> <p>What is the big deal? Well first of all, 2016 blows away 2015 which was previously the hottest year ever and that had beaten 2014 as the hottest year ever \u2013 call this a three-peat. Three records in a row and the last two are by large margins. Does this mean global warming all of a sudden has gotten worse? <br></p> <p>No, surface temperatures fluctuate a lot \u2013 you can see that in the figure. Temperatures will go up or down from year to year without apparent reason. This is why we are interested in the long term trends. This is also why we are interested in looking at other measures of warming (especially in the oceans). All of our measurements agree with each other \u2013 we know the Earth was warming long before this set of records began falling in 2014.</p> <p>One thing these temperatures can do is enable us to compare computer models with measurements. We\u2019ve seen that models have done an excellent job of correctly predicting the rate of heating of the Earth. My own research shows that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jul/27/climate-models-are-accurately-predicting-ocean-and-global-warming\">in the oceans, the models are slightly under-predicting the rate of heating</a>. </p> <p>To compare models and measurements at the Earth\u2019s surface, I\u2019ve borrowed a figure from Dr. Gavin Schmidt of Nasa and I\u2019ve overlaid the 2016 surface temperatures. A star shows where 2016 will be. The star should be compared to the three heavy dashed lines in the figure. The upper and lower dashed lines show the uncertainty in the models and the middle dashed line shows the average. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4da0c24030ad4ae70822c845d9d35c95ddd97e81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4da0c24030ad4ae70822c845d9d35c95ddd97e81/0_0_2031_1857/1000.png\" alt=\"Global surface temperature observations vs. CMIP5 model simulations.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"914\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Global surface temperature observations vs. CMIP5 model simulations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Gavin Schmidt, modified by John Abraham.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Is the 2016 data within the upper and lower lines? Yes it is. </p> <p>Is the 2016 data close to the middle dashed line? Yes again. In fact, the 2016 temperatures are above the average which means the models under-predicted the temperature of 2016. <br></p> <p>Before we get too anxious, it is almost certain that 2017 will be cooler than 2016. In fact, we may not set another record for a few years. But just as a few hot years doesn\u2019t prove global warming, a few cooler years wont disprove it. The long-term trend is clearer upwards through and the models are spot on.</p> <p>All this aside, there are still things we can do to bend the arc of this curve. There are actions we can take as individuals and as collectives to reduce our emissions and our dependence on polluting fuels. That message is, and continues to be, the most important one. <br></p> <p>But one thing we cannot do is deny facts.</p>",

  "<p>Rob Greig\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/oct/14/rights-learning-disability-residential-care\">recent article for the Social Care Network</a> <em> </em>fails to understand Rochdale borough council\u2019s plans to develop a wider range of care and support options; and fails to acknowledge some of the real issues facing providers and people who live in our group homes. </p> <p>The article made a number of assumptions, almost all of which we must challenge. </p> <p>Rochdale borough council does understand cost-effectiveness; we have been grappling with this throughout the austerity years. How can it be cost-effective to continue to rely predominantly on one model of care when there is a range of other alternatives that could work as well, or better, for people? </p> <p>How is it cost-effective to run a system that has a high number of empty rooms because a home is not compatible with people\u2019s needs? How can it be cost-effective when a group living arrangement ends due to difficulties between residents and one person has to move, in an unplanned way, to an expensive out-of-area placement miles away from their family? </p> <p>Cost-effectiveness is about cost and value \u2013 and when our group home model works well, as it does for many, it is indeed cost-effective and we have no intention of changing it. When it works less well it is our responsibility, as commissioners, to develop alternatives. Funding must be used to best effect to ensure a range of options that better meet people\u2019s different needs.</p> <p>Greig says our plan is short-termist and relies on cost savings through larger group activities, doing things others want or need, rather than personalised care. Where is his evidence for this? </p> <p>He seems to think residential care cannot be personalised \u2013 that isn\u2019t true. For some people residential care will give more choice than the current arrangements, or certainly just as much. </p> <p>Let us be clear: the current model involves compromises; people are dependent on their co-residents and staff. That can be very limiting. Residential care is not all bad; many people have positive outcomes and their placements meet their needs well. We are not envisaging a wide-scale return to residential care as Greig seems to suggest. We are simply saying it will work better for some people. It\u2019s not right for everyone \u2013 no one model is. </p> <p>Greig says we do not understand learning disability best practice and cites the <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_pnsCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=core+and+cluster+housing+model+1985&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T1Pi6qpJeE&amp;sig=qDdJKCnhePIQrzAG0oVQDRsqWvc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGodmR2NLPAhUBBsAKHXZIANsQ6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=core%20and%20cluster%20housing%20model%201985&amp;f=false\">core and cluster model</a> being dropped as a model of support, and suggests we are not providing independent advocacy while removing people\u2019s rights. This is inflammatory and unfair. We might mean different things when we talk about the core and cluster model \u2013 but independent advocacy is a fundamental part of how we work.</p> <p>He goes on to say that our proposals misunderstand personalisation. Again, this is not the case. Of course people determine how their personal budgets are used, with support as necessary. We will not dictate how people allocate their personal budgets; quite the opposite, as more options equals more choice.</p> <p>Greig says <a href=\"https://consultations.rochdale.gov.uk/council-wide/ac-2017-301/supporting_documents/AC2017301%20%20Remodel%20supported%20living%20offer%20for%20people%20with%20learning%20disabilities%20%20Full%20Proposal%20Document.pdf\">our proposal</a> [pdf] challenges the rights-based approach for people with learning disabilities \u2013 but doesn\u2019t say how. He suggests that people have no right to stay in residential care: true, a care provider or other can insist a person moves on. Actually though, in real life, people who have tenancies in group homes are also required to move on in some circumstances, especially where people\u2019s needs mean they cannot for safety reasons, or do not wish to, continue to share their home.</p> <p>Greig says people in residential care have no choice about who they live with \u2013 that is true, but applies in group homes as well, or certainly to a large extent. He challenges the suggestion that some people cannot benefit from tenancies and suggests this means we are promoting people having unequal rights \u2013 this is just over-simplistic. Some people may have a tenancy on paper but do not have capacity to agree to it, nor to exercise any choice about it. What does this really mean for people\u2019s everyday lives?</p> <p>These are real issues that deserve calm and respectful debate.</p> <p>Rochdale council, with a group of committed and knowledgeable staff, based on knowledge of individual needs and feedback from residents, wants to offer a wider range of choice in accommodation and support for people with learning disabilities than it currently has. Most of these options will cost less than our group homes model. No one will be forced to move \u2013 there will no compulsion at any stage. People\u2019s rights are fundamental. That\u2019s why no decisions will be taken without detailed assessments, in line with the individual wishes, and with involvement of close family members and advocates.</p> <p>Greig says councils face difficult times. We know that. As a responsible council, we want to maintain frontline services to people. In Rochdale we have suffered \u00a3159m of cuts in seven years. We face a further \u00a338.9m reduction in our budget over the next two years. We will work to improve the lives of people and manage the reducing financial resources in the best way we can. Our proposals will meet the individual needs of people, protecting their rights at every stage. There will be no compulsion, no forced moves and no \u201cre-institutionalisation\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s time to be realistic and honest about the benefits and limitations of all models, to challenge dogma wherever it comes from. We need a sustainable, longer-term set of accommodation and care and support choices that enable people with learning disabilities to be supported to achieve the outcomes they want, in a high-quality environment, within their own communities.</p> <ul> <li><em>Sheila Downey is director of adult services at Rochdale council</em><br></li> </ul> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/social-care/\">Join the Social Care Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

  "<p>For three years during the Syrian civil war, Nisreen gave her children a tranquilizer every night so they might sleep through the airstrikes. Secretly, she preferred for them to die in their sleep than live every day in such incapacitating fear. <br></p> <p>When Islamic State took over his school, Ahmad pretended to be dead while his classmates were first raped and subsequently burned alive. He was in third grade.<br></p> <p>Nisreen and Ahmad are two of the 2.7 million refugees now living in Jordan \u2013 a small country with a population of slightly less than 10 million. Accepting such a great number of people, now comprising a substantial proportion of our population, has taught us a few lessons. We\u2019ve learned of humans\u2019 gut-wrenching ability to go to extreme lengths to hurt, destroy and deny others their humanity. We\u2019ve seen refugees\u2019 indelible marks of torture and heard their stories of adversity. </p> <p>On the other hand, we\u2019ve also learned of refugees\u2019 incredible resilience and sense of hope against all odds \u2013 their ability to acclimate to a new environment and still feel committed to do what they can to be of service to others. Today Nisreen resides in a refugee camp in Jordan and leads group therapy for women with persistent trauma symptoms. By speaking about her own experience every day, she\u2019s encouraging others to do the same. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve learned of refugees\u2019 incredible resilience and sense of hope against all odds</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ahmad, meanwhile, is now obtaining straight As in school \u2013 excelling particularly in maths \u2013 and helping a local NGO recruit other Syrian child refugees to enroll in school. Despite our differences in religion and culture, we now understand that refugees ultimately want precisely what we Jordanians want: safety and an opportunity to give back to society.</p> <p>After extreme testing, we now understand the true depth of Jordanian hospitality. At a time when our nation could have turned its back on more refugees, we took more, understanding that the responsibility to accept refugees is not a Middle Eastern one but a global, human one. We learned that this hospitality is also grounded in the reality that it could have been us \u2013 we could have been refugees seeking a haven elsewhere. No nation or group is immune from this reality. Years prior to the Syrian civil war, no mother there expected to drug her children in a war zone, and no child there expected to witness mass murder and rape at school.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jul/20/the-returnees-what-happens-when-refugees-decide-to-go-back-home\">The returnees: what happens when refugees decide to go back home?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps most importantly, a lesson we continue to learn pertains to shifting our understanding about our responsibility. Accepting refugees does not and cannot end with merely protecting refugees from war. Instead, taking refugees in means we must ensure they have access to services afforded to Jordanians themselves; namely, access to education, health services, and jobs. This has proven difficult with already strained resources in our country, but we understand that truly helping refugees must involve empowering them by giving them jobs. With a history of remarkable individual contributions in their country as doctors, lawyers, business leaders, we must play our part now and adopt these skills in our workforce.</p> <p><em>Laila Soudi is a mental health researcher with Stanford university who works with refugees in Jordan.

With scarlet lipstick smeared across her face, and what has to qualify as the universe\u2019s least appealing ice-cream consumption technique, \u2013 shown in horrific close-up more than once \u2013 Haters Back Off represents an origin story of sorts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/14/haters-back-off-miranda-sings-colleen-ballinger-the-queen-of-youtube-trolling\">Haters back off! Meet Colleen Ballinger, the queen of YouTube trolling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The series follows Miranda\u2019s quest for fame, from her off-key first YouTube upload to the moment her dreams are (in a sense) realised. Along the way, she behaves monstrously, meets people who are inexplicably even more monstrous than her and murders dozens of fish.</p> <p>The biggest reference point here, happily, seems to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/103373/napoleon.dynamite\">Napoleon Dynamite</a>. Sings and her family live in a small, unkept bungalow in an unidentified corner of small-town America where the ground is flat and the skies are huge, all interiors are the colour of Australian cigarette packets and the only source of entertainment is the singles night at the local church. Every haircut is slightly wonky, every garment made from flammable-looking manmade fibres. If it wasn\u2019t for the presence of YouTube, there would be no way of telling when the show is meant to be set.</p> <p>How well you\u2019ll do with the show probably depends on your tolerance for shouting. Everyone shouts here, almost all the time. Sings herself is uniquely atonal, with a speaking voice that sounds like an exploding sinus. But her supporting cast aren\u2019t much quieter. Her uncle Jim, played with unnerving dedication by Steve Little, honks and roars whenever necessary. Her pastor, Chaz Lamar Shepherd, is a violently expressive showboater. Even her mother, played by the usually restrained Angela Kinsey, has moments of shrieking meltdown.</p> <p>A point will come during this series where you\u2019ll wonder whether any of this shouting has a purpose. Thankfully, it does. Unable to sustain this wild energy for the entire duration, later episodes start to intentionally collapse in on themselves to the point where the finale is legitimately morose. It\u2019s a nice sign that Miranda Sings isn\u2019t quite as one-note as she makes out, and also a perfect setup for future episodes.</p> <p>As great as Haters Back Off is \u2013 and it is great, once you\u2019ve attuned yourself to its quirks \u2013 you nevertheless hope that it isn\u2019t the start of a trend. Ballinger deserves her own show. Someone like PewDiePie, probably less so.</p> <p><strong>Length:</strong> Eight half-hour episodes, all up now on Netflix.</p> <p><strong>Stand-out episode:</strong> The pilot. It\u2019s just about as full-on as Haters Back Off gets, and a pretty good bellwether of how easily you can stomach it.</p> <p><strong>If you liked Haters Back Off, watch: </strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Awkward-Season-1/dp/B00ET0IP9K\">Awkward</a> (Amazon), <a href=\"http://www.netflixreleases.com/smosh-the-movie-2015/\">Smosh: The Movie</a> (Netflix).</p>",
  "<p>Finally, after years and months of waiting, the UK government has conceded it has an obligation to meet the needs of a small number of the rootless, homeless and stateless children as the Calais Jungle camp closes. </p> <p>We have a week to make arrangements for the care of children where there is no family reunion. How are we going to ensure each decision is in the child\u2019s best interest and meets our obligations under the international treaties and conventions our government has signed? </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog/2016/jun/22/calais-refugee-camp-abuse-social-work-silent\">Children in the Calais refugee camp are at risk. Social workers must act</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We know, from what happens to children in public care in the UK, that decision-making is often compromised by the bureaucratic needs of the organisation. Social workers are well aware that decision-making is often done out of expediency rather than a careful matching of need and resource. </p> <p>Unaccompanied children rarely arrive in the UK with identity papers. This statelessness exacerbates their vulnerability. They are vulnerable to trafficking, child labour and sexual exploitation. Their statelessless also makes the process of accessing social protection systems almost impossible at times, and they become invisible in the shadows of our society. </p> <p>Simply placing two children in each local authority throughout England and Wales is a bureaucratic decision that fails the test of meeting needs, managing risk, and balancing competing human rights. In this sense, it fails to assess children\u2019s need for relationships or take into account the relationships they may have already built. </p> <p>There is a significant amount of research from around the world, and solutions from other countries, which demonstrate what works and what adds to the harm they\u2019ve already experienced.</p> <p>The children do not come from one homogeneous group but from different cultures and traditions and speak different languages. They are without their families, and isolation is a huge emotional and psychological part of their recent experience. </p> <p>They may, or may not have, made peer relationships that have substituted for family relationships. They have been living in unhealthy, dangerous, unhygienic camps and have survived. They will have encountered some trustworthy adults but may have been abused or harmed by others.</p> <p>Many countries have been significantly more active in meeting the needs of these children than has the UK. For example, Germany, Greece and Thailand have set up reception centres for six to eight young people at a time to provide safety, security and stability for a period to help with their adjustment to a different culture, climate and language. This provides them some space for recovery. </p> <p>Other counties have also done research into what works, much of which points to combating isolation and the importance of peer relationships. Peer relationships are formed more often before relationships with adults \u2013 mixed messages from adults seen as \u201cin control\u201d perpetuate confusion and mistrust. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/aug/23/child-migrants-denied-essential-services\">EU states are denying child migrants essential services</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We know that relationships are key to recovery and achieving positive change. So why are we not focusing on providing a solution based on the continuity of some of the positive relationships these children may have developed on their journey? </p> <p>We need complete focus on providing an environment that allows young people to feel safe and secure before any other recovery can be started. Instead we, too, get caught up in the nightmare faced by every displaced person \u2013 bureaucracy. </p> <p>At a seminar last week at the University of Eastern Finland, 10 research papers were presented on \u201crefugee resettlement and integration\u201d from countries including China, Morocco, Australia, US, India, Ghana and some European countries. They all shared two broad conclusions: social and cultural relationships are key to positive change, and bureaucracy is a hurdle to change, if not a barrier.</p> <p>As social work practitioners and researchers we have a duty to each of the young people arriving into the UK to get it right \u2013 not only in the next few weeks, but in our response to a continuing humanitarian crisis.<br></p> <p>Engaging with and accepting each person is key to any social work process. Are we as a profession making our skills, knowledge and expertise available to managers and politicians faced with this task? We can help in planning and in providing services that will work for these very vulnerable, traumatised young people coming into our country.<br></p> <p>We now need to join others to find positive journeys through change, so that we can provide for the best interest of each and every child. </p> <ul> <li><em>Ruth Stark is president of the <a href=\"http://ifsw.org/\">International Federation of Social Workers</a></em></li> </ul> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/social-care/\">Join the Social Care Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

  "<p><strong>Good morning Gruff. </strong><strong>What did you have for breakfast?</strong></p> <p>Is this a microphone check or a real question?</p> <p><strong>This is a very real question.</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s a strange one because in most radio interviews people ask you what you had for breakfast to check the microphones. Then usually they keep the answer in because I suppose it\u2019s more interesting than what\u2019s to follow. I can reveal I had some porridge with my son.</p> <p><strong>How do you feel about caffeine?</strong><br></p> <p>I\u2019m a strong believer in caffeine. I\u2019m on about 20 a day.</p> <p><strong>Bloody hell!</strong></p> <p>I did an experiment with Bunf, the guitarist from Super Furry Animals, during a day of interviews and we decided to drink as much coffee as we could physically take. They were espressos, sometimes doubles, and we got to about 13 each and then found that we just couldn\u2019t physically take any more. It\u2019s strange.</p> <p><strong>Doesn\u2019t coffee do some interesting things to your bowels? (1)</strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve no idea. Everything was fine, no sorry tales. We just moved on to Guinness.</p> <p><strong>You seem like someone more sartorially suited to the cold \u2013 are you looking forward to winter?</strong></p> <p>Because I\u2019m probably more suited to the winter and the cold, I fantasise about the tropics. I think there was a movement here in Cardiff a few years ago for a tropical Wales. Graffiti started to appear with a Tropical Wales Now slogan and demands that were quite ambitious. The weather in Wales is quite consistent all year round, like it is in the tropics, it\u2019s just grey and wet and cold.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/06/gruff-rhys-set-fire-to-the-stars-review-indie-hero-turns-jazz-era-soundtracker\">Gruff Rhys: Set Fire to the Stars review \u2013 indie hero turns jazz-era soundtracker</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/06/gruff-rhys-set-fire-to-the-stars-review-indie-hero-turns-jazz-era-soundtracker\">soundtrack</a> for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/06/set-fire-to-the-stars-review-dylan-thomas-elijah-wood\">Set Fire to the Stars</a> (2) is coming out two years after the film. Why the delay?</strong></p> <p>Lots of very uninteresting logistical circumstances. There\u2019s no real explanation. I did a live concert a year ago when I thought it was going to come out. It doesn\u2019t matter, I don\u2019t feel much pressure. It\u2019s a relief and a joy that\u2019s it finally out. It\u2019s a commissioned work so it\u2019s not a regular solo album where I come up with everything based on internal instincts and my own thoughts. I\u2019m more of a songwriter so I\u2019d imagine someone who buys my records might expect some songs but there\u2019s only three sung songs on this record. But it was very freeing for me. I was able to indulge in 20 instrumentals.</p> <p><strong>The press release mentions \u201cagro-jazz\u201d \u2013 what\u2019s that?</strong></p> <p>At the time I wrote some sleeve notes and I can\u2019t remember if it was agro as in an aggressive take on jazz or what. The word jazz comes with a lot of connotations for me, both good and bad, so I aggressively took jazz on. I only used instruments that were available in the 1950s but beyond that I didn\u2019t try and make specifically 50s music. It\u2019s mainly exercises in what krautrock would sound like played by a jazz band in 1950.</p> <p><strong>The album features the worst instrument on the planet \u2013 the saxophone. (3) What\u2019s your least favourite instrument?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve gone through periods of having problems with the saxophone. I think it was badly used in the 70s in particular. But I\u2019ve worked myself through my phobia.</p> <p><strong>How? Can you give me some advice?</strong></p> <p>Well, just by listening to some records where it\u2019s used properly. Especially deep glam rock where people don\u2019t solo, they make guttural noises with it. Another way would be to go to extremes and embrace the synthetic saxophone. There\u2019s a saxophone-shaped synthesiser that goes into the electronic world. In the right hands it\u2019s potentially a good thing, but it can go either way.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur7_jT-obmc\">I Love EU</a>, your song encouraging people to vote remain, wasn\u2019t enough to change the voting public\u2019s minds. (4) Why do you think people voted to leave? </strong> </p> <p>It was pretty tight. It was a close vote and there was an array of reasons as to why people voted to leave, some justified and a lot completely unjustified and based on xenophobia. I think what would have tipped it into a majority would be, for me, a constant barrage of misinformation by careerist politicians who thought very little of the consequences of the vote for the general public.</p> <p><strong>Do you think if there was another vote now, things would be different?</strong></p> <p>Opinion polls in Wales suggest so. I don\u2019t think the negative impact of the vote will be clear for a while. In terms of the environment and unemployment, I think it\u2019s going to deteriorate in the coming years, especially if we\u2019re still governed by a bunch of climate change deniers and a government that\u2019s willing to let the free market reign with no tax. In the short term, I\u2019ve no idea if the vote would change with the same media around. It\u2019s such an ill-defined vote because nobody knows what Brexit is. I don\u2019t even like the word Brexit. I try not to use it because it\u2019s such a shit word. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/07/brexit-means-brexit-theresa-may-jonathan-lynn-yes-minister\">Brexit means Brexit</a>, but what is Brexit?</p> <p><strong>Right, no more politics.

That all went rather well, didn\u2019t it?</strong></p> <p>The song or the competition?</p> <p><strong>Both!</strong></p> <p>It was very joyful. Maybe the key to success is not putting any pressure on people.

Does that sort of thing excite you? Mixing it up with the big pop acts? </strong> </p> <p>I think we had records peak at 11, 12 and 13. <strong>(5)</strong> At the time, when the CD was prevalent \u2013 which was a strange small silver disc that people used to put into machines \u2013 most record companies would make two CD singles of the same song with different B-sides and remixes. It was a scam to make people buy the record twice. The second disc would be full of meaningless remixes so the band wouldn\u2019t actually have to do anything. We felt that was a complete rip-off, so we refused to play those kinds of games. When those records were going to 11 and 12, we felt validated because the people who were in the Top 10 had played those kind of games.</p> <p><strong>So if the charts had been based on principles, you guys would have had No 1 hits?</strong></p> <p>(Laughs) No, we would have been at No 6. On a good day. We were No 1 in the album charts for a few days but then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/10/destinys-child-new-song\">Destiny\u2019s Child</a> came in and took our spot. <strong>(6)</strong> You can\u2019t argue with that, though. We were like, \u201cYeah, of course.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Will the Super Furry Animals shows at the end of the year lead to a new album do you think?</strong></p> <p>Not for the time being, no. We\u2019ve been touring again for about three years and we\u2019re going up to Christmas and then we probably won\u2019t do anything for a while. I\u2019m on my way to band practice later. We played a few weekends ago at Liverpool Psych Fest and I think voltage governs how a lot of records sound. Like a record mastered in America with American power will sound different to a record made in Europe, for example. Then you have maverick mastering studios that go off the grid, so they have their own generators powered to full capacity by an insanely powerful voltage. <strong>(7)</strong> Unfortunately at Liverpool Psych Fest we tried to power 400 volts through the bass amp and it blew up in the first song. So we plugged another one in and that blew up. It was quite a dramatic, situationist set with loads of technicians on stage doing live repairs while we played.</p> <p><strong>OK. How do you feel about Facebook?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve never been on Facebook but I have a Facebook account that takes in all my other social media. I only had it put up there because there were a lot of people claiming to be me and having conversations with my friends as me. I felt like it showed a lack of ambition in a way \u2013 why pose as me when you could be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\">Beyonc\u00e9</a>, for example?

  "<p>Humanitarian workers in Iraq are warning that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/20/mosul-attack-kurdish-forces-launch-large-scale-operation-against-isis-in-iraq\">the response to the battle of Mosul</a> is being hampered by lack of funding and the pressure of supporting the millions already displaced by conflict across the country.</p> <p>As Iraqi, US and Kurdish coalition troops approach Mosul for military action that could take place any time in the next couple of weeks, the UN Refugee Agency\u2019s Iraq country director Bruno Geddo told the Guardian that there is not enough money to prepare adequately for the huge numbers that could flee the city, <a href=\"https://fts.unocha.org/pageloader.aspx?page=emerg-emergencyDetails&amp;appealID=2880\">with the Mosul budget only 48 per cent funded.</a> <br></p> <p>\u201cWe are preparing for a million people, we have to prepare for the worst,\u201d said Geddo. \u201cWe have shelter for 130,000 people but in terms of camp space we only have space for 60,000 people. The timeline to set up additional camps is extremely tight, finding suitable land is fraught with problems, and the funding is still insufficient.</p> <p>\u201cWe need a big chunk more funding to complete winter packages. We are short of $60m (\u00a349m) for heaters and kerosene alone. If people cannot keep warm they will get sick when temperatures fall.\u201d</p> <p>He warns that the consequences of failing to support a sufficient humanitarian response could be very serious. \u201cThe worry is that if the protection of civilians and the humanitarian response fall short, this may rekindle the grievances and suspicions that contributed to the takeover of Mosul by Islamic State in the first place. A successful military campaign to retake Mosul is necessary but not sufficient. The stakes are high, as much for the military as for the humanitarian workers.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The UN is up to version 23 of its planning map of the camps</p> <footer> <cite>Alun Mcdonald, Save the Children in Iraq</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Preparations for the potential exodus of hundreds of thousands of civilians from Mosul have been underway since the summer as military plans to take the city back from Isis have progressed, with the UN working closely with other NGOs to coordinate the building of camps. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt has been a bit of a challenge because the locations and the directions that people are expected to flee to have kept changing,\u201d said Alun McDonald, spokesman for Save the Children in Iraq, referring to the difficulty of planning for such large-scale movement. \u201cThe UN is up to version 23 of its planning map of the camps.\u201d</p> <p>The preparations for people expected to flee Mosul come as Save the Children carries out emergency work to help Iraqis escaping other Isis-controlled areas. According to McDonald: \u201cEven though the Mosul offensive is just starting we have seen more than 100,000 people displaced in the past few months from several Isis-held areas in central Iraq. Iraq is an incredibly difficult country for us. <br></p> <p> \u201cWhen people are displaced they go through screening centres run by the Iraqi army so we deploy there immediately with food, water, blankets. They have been arriving in a pretty desperate state due to lack of water and some were walking barefoot for 36 hours on their journey.\u201d<br></p> <p>McDonald is concerned that the even larger numbers that could leave Mosul will potentially pose more complex challenges, such as families being split up.<br></p> <p>\u201cAt security screening centres men and boys are detained for long times, separated from mothers and sisters. We are particularly worried about this because of the large numbers that might move from Mosul. We are trying to work with the authorities to ensure families are reunited.\u201d </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.unocha.org/iraq\">The UN is working to support more than 3 million Iraqis </a>who have been displaced by fighting across the country since 2014. Geddo warns that the multiple crises that NGOs are facing in Iraq are making it a very difficult environment to work in. \u201cIraq is very complicated,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have 3.3 million displaced as well as large numbers returning to their home cities after leaving during conflict. We are dealing with large-scale outflow from Mosul [and other cities] on top of that number. It makes it even more difficult.\u201d</p> <p>McDonald says that while people will want to go back, as with the millions living in camps and temporary homes across Iraq, there may be many obstacles to returning. \u201cPeople will want to go back but it just depends on how the offensive goes. If there is heavy fighting and lots of the town gets destroyed, the hospitals and schools are bombed, will there be anything for people to go back to?\u201d</p> <p><strong>If you are a humanitarian worker based in Iraq and want to tell us your experiences of working with IDPs please email us at <a href=\"mailto:globaldevpros@guardian.co.uk\">globaldevpros@guardian.co.uk</a> with Mosul or Iraq in the subject line. </strong><br></p>",

Historically, lots of towns and cities were sold on the basis that you could get to London quickly, but now the equation is partially reversed.<br></p> <p>\u201cMany people moved to Brighton to commute. Now it\u2019s a brilliant place to do business in its own right with its maturing technology and media clusters. There are also disproportionately large tech scenes in Cambridge and Leamington Spa.\u201d<br></p> <p>But large businesses are fanning out too.

Its overall stock of businesses went up too by 17%, much faster than any other town or city in the UK.<br></p> <p>But, according to Rae, this doesn\u2019t spell the end for big cities: \u201cLocation is more important than ever and although technology means businesses can locate outside major cities, they still benefit from being within touching distance.<br></p> <p>\u201cFace-to-face meetings are essential for deal-making and there seems to be a cut-off point for areas more than an hour-and-a-half away from a major conurbation. It remains vital to physically get in front of clients.\u201d<br></p> <p>He said Silicon Valley, the enormous and world-renowned centre for tech innovation in the US nestled between San Francisco and San Jose, would not have sprung up without vibrant cities full of talent to draw from.<br></p> <p>If true, the 90-minute effect could have major ramifications for cities to the north of London when the HS2 high-speed rail link is finally completed.

It will be interesting to see in which direction the skills travel,\u201d said Rae.<br></p> <p>It also has implications for infrastructure planning: \u201cIt\u2019s quite surprising that across the UK people are working on their smart cities programmes without thinking about their geographical position in the country and the fact they can\u2019t change where they are,\u201d he added.<br></p> <p>Perhaps they should look to Japan for an idea of what a hyper-connected UK might look like in future.<br></p> <p>The fastest train between Manchester and Liverpool takes 33 minutes and there\u2019s only one an hour.

It concludes that social media can level the playing field for disadvantaged candidates. </p> <p>While negative portrayals in traditional media can put women off politics, social media can be a way for female politicians to engage the public on their own terms and become known without relying on journalists or political parties. According to the report, 86% of female politicians use social media. It is low cost, which is good for women because they receive fewer private donations on average than male politicians. It\u2019s also a flexible and time-efficient format for campaigning, allowing women to bypass what the report\u2019s author, Harvard University\u2019s Thomas Patterson, describes as the \u201cmotherhood penalty\u201d. Women with children are as active on social media as those without, he says.</p> <p>British MEP Julie Ward, speaking at the report\u2019s launch said: \u201cWomen have found a space for themselves on social media that they didn\u2019t have on a platform otherwise.\u201d </p> <p>Globally, only 22.8% of national members of parliament are women, and there are still 38 countries in which more than 90% of MPs are men. </p> <p>But women still fail to fully utilise social media, falling short when it comes to using it as a humanising device, not just a broadcasting tool. \u201cAlthough research has found only marginal differences in how female and male leaders use social media, personal postings are an exception,\u201d says the report. While men tend to view messages about their private lives as a way to demonstrate their softer side, women tend to worry such exposure will activate gender stereotypes that counter an image of strong leadership.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/julia-gillard-says-online-abuse-deters-women-from-political-careers\">Julia Gillard says online abuse deters women from political careers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kaja Kallas, an Estonian MEP, says it can be difficult to find the balance of showing a lighter side online without pandering to an entertainment-driven news cycle. \u201cWomen tend to keep themselves from it to show they are serious,\u201d she says. \u201cBut people don\u2019t really like serious topics.\u201d</p> <p>McGuinness is always surprised by what works on social media.

She does, however, concede that personal posts can put women at greater risk of backlash. Half of the women surveyed \u2013 regardless of country, background, age, position and party \u2013 had received insults or threats online.</p> <p>McGuinness has a coping strategy.

  "<p>It is mid-morning and despite the spring sunshine the animator\u2019s den is gloomy; the only sound whispered voices and the low hum of tapping keys.</p> <p>A dozen of 100 animators hunch over large computers in partitioned warrens, their work-spaces shaded by large sun umbrellas opened above their desks.</p> <p>\u201cShhh,\u201d says the public relations staffer leading me through the studios of Weta Digital, staring reverentially at the artists.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re <em>creating</em>\u201d.</p> <p>Ten years ago, Weta\u2019s animators were housed in a draughty wooden house with a leaky roof. The tiny visual effects company, co-owned by director Peter Jackson, was initially solely reliant on Jackson\u2019s films for work and made its name with ground-breaking motion-capture characters such as Gollum in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.</p> <p>In the early days they only worked on one film at a time, and employees from that era still can\u2019t fathom how the company made ends meet.</p> <p>\u201cIt was us against the world, a band of brothers and sisters, all in the trenches together,\u201d recalls Daniel Barrett, who abandoned a career as a sculptor to join Weta and animate a giant\u2019s toes.</p> <p>A decade on, Barrett is now head of the animation department and has twice been nominated for an Oscar.</p> <p>\u201cWe were organic back then, very organic\u201d laughs Barrett, dressed in faded jeans, sneakers and a sweatshirt, the unofficial uniform of Wetans.</p> <p>\u201cWe worked incredibly hard.

Employees wander through the staff kitchen in bare feet and threadbare t-shirts, munching on avocado toast and joking with colleagues with a family-like intimacy.</p> <p>\u201cThe day Weta get branded pencils is the day I leave,\u201d says Jamie Beard, a British animation supervisor who is known for his work on The Adventures of Tintin, The Hobbit and Iron Man 3.</p> <p>\u201cIt is so important to me that all the money at Weta goes into people and technology \u2013 it\u2019s artist friendly.

  "<p>The idea had been nagging at her for years, but Isla Rowntree went to the ends of the earth before she was finally ready to go ahead with something she hopes will revolutionise the way the bicycle industry is run.<br></p> <p>This is <a href=\"http://www.islabikes.co.uk/imagineproject\">the Imagine Project</a>, currently being developed by Rowntree\u2019s eponymous firm making children\u2019s bicycles, <a href=\"http://www.islabikes.co.uk/\">Islabikes</a>.

Won\u2019t they consider it safer to buy them one that\u2019s brand new?<br></p> <p>Rowntree\u2019s eyes begin to gleam \u2013 this, it turns out, is the real beauty of the idea. The new \u2018circular economy\u2019 gives manufacturers an incentive to make products of far higher quality than they otherwise would. The more people Islabikes can rent a bicycle to before it has to be retired, the better they\u2019ll do commercially. It\u2019s the opposite of planned obsolescence \u2013 products will now be designed to last forever.<br></p> <p>But of course, kids put their bikes through a lot of punishment, and even the strongest components will eventually start to wear out. Rowntree has an answer for this too.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So, you design for longevity, but you also design for separability. We\u2019ve designed, from the start, [so] that we\u2019re going to be able to separate the raw materials really easily. So for example the metals aren\u2019t mixed up, so they can go into other industries. You\u2019ve got your main circular supply chain, between the manufacturer and the consumer \u2013 and then you\u2019ve got all these smaller circles going round the edges, with all the interdependent industries.</p> </blockquote> <p>She draws these circles in the air as she speaks, and I have a momentary \u2013 and gratifying \u2013 vision of all the different manufacturing industries pivoting around each other like a set of cogs, each factory using the cast-off materials of another, and passing on their own by-products in turn, wasting absolutely nothing.<br></p> <p>This idea is \u2013 has to be \u2013 far bigger than just Islabikes; bigger than the bicycle industry itself. It\u2019s a new, collaborative way of doing business, and it won\u2019t work unless everyone comes onboard. Islabikes are consciously setting themselves up as evangelists for this new system.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is embarking on a journey to find out how to do this,\u201d explains Rowntree. She has five full-time members of staff working on the Imagine Project. As yet, no other bike companies have adopted this new sustainable model, but several component companies are on board, including Reynolds, who have developed prototype tube sets for the new bikes.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e5792592a823887257b344cabb84b34b6521bccb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5792592a823887257b344cabb84b34b6521bccb/0_15_2158_1296/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Isla Rowntree, founder of Islabikes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isla Rowntree, founder of Islabikes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Islabikes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAnd if we can get those components companies working with us, when other cycle companies are ready to adopt this model, the components will already be there for them.\u201d<br></p> <p>This is truly a sharing economy \u2013 where all parties benefit the more they collaborate. And it has to happen soon, insists Rowntree. The cost of raw materials is set to rise steeply in the next few years.<br></p> <p>\u201cSo that might mean that at some point in the future a bike that I sell for \u00a3300 might be \u00a31,000 \u2013 or \u00a32,000, or \u00a34,000. And at that point it\u2019s not accessible for most families to buy \u2013 so children don\u2019t ride bikes any more, because nobody can afford them.\u201d<br></p> <p>It first occurred to Rowntree three years ago that her current business model might no longer be viable. And for a while she pushed the thought away, knowing that she could well just carry on making bikes as she was, then walk away before things went wrong.<br></p> <p>\u201cBut I started to feel responsible, not only for myself, but for the people I work with, who are much younger than me \u2013 they\u2019ll still need jobs. And that feeling of responsibility turned into feeling irresponsible for not doing anything about it.\u201d<br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",

This is clearly important if you are unsure which area you would like to progress in, but it is also vital for those who may already have a fixed idea of their field.

In addition to having a clear grasp of key fundamentals, elements of what you have learned may go out of date very quickly, both in terms of research and best practice.<br></p> <p>You can do this by building the professional aspect of the industry into your day-to-day life.

They are not only focused on working with elite players, even though that may be where they ultimately want to work. As a player one of my most inspiring coaches had a PE teacher\u2019s background and coached a number of different sports. She was as effective working with youngsters as she was with senior international players.<br></p> <p>The creativity and innovation she used in keeping young players interested and enjoying the sport helped us in what can sometimes be quite dull performance environments.

At the top level, working with athletes can be less technically focused and more about understanding them as people. This means spending time listening to what players/athletes really want: what motivates them to develop, which won\u2019t only be about winning; what helps them to deal with failure and success; what gets in the way for them; what knocks their confidence.<br></p> <p>To do this, you have to be genuinely interested in the person before the athlete.

And of course your university lecturers have so much knowledge and experience that you can gain from.</p> <h2></h2> <p>Elite sport is not an industry where you can sit around expecting things to come your way magically. You have to make your own success, by getting out there, meeting people and by putting yourself forward for opportunities.

The recommendations include: putting direct pressure on governments to desist from abuses; participating in formal and informal networks that promote collective action; and using \u201corganisational arrangements\u201d such as structured partnerships with charities to ensure support over the long-term. </p> <p>It is imperative that corporations are involved in a \u201clong-running conversation\u201d with civil society organisations about human rights, Pickering emphasises. \u201cIf there\u2019s only a relationship when an issue flares up, then it\u2019s difficult for companies to engage,\u201d he says, adding that a better solution would see companies regularly meeting with NGOs and familiarising themselves with issues.</p> <p>CAF isn\u2019t dewy-eyed; the motivation for business to get involved is far from being purely altruistic.

I can\u2019t believe in our world we are taking that away from them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c1db3051a6b37b1b4db8cd6f375c59fe506da48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c1db3051a6b37b1b4db8cd6f375c59fe506da48/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"AS-level art history students at Godalming college, Surrey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">AS-level art history students at Godalming college, Surrey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Music</h2> <p><strong>Ian Gardner </strong>Head of music at Weald school, Billingshurst</p> <p>Gardner has been making music since he was seven and teaching it for the last 23 years. Just four students are studying his subject at A-level this year, with only two due to take it next year.</p> <p>Numbers have never been big and they are dwindling, but his school remains committed, despite funding constraints. Schools everywhere are having to make difficult choices and some have already reluctantly decided to stop offering music as an option. The fear is that more will follow.</p> <p>\u201cTeaching people to be creative can only be a good thing,\u201d says Gardner. But because of the pressure for students to study so-called Ebacc subjects as part of school performance measures, there are fears that subjects including music will slowly disappear from many GCSE and A-level curriculums.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s heart-breaking really,\u201d said Gardner. \u201cYou are working with students who are highly skilled performers and have an understanding of music. They are excited by their subject. There are lots of light bulb moment. It\u2019s a wonderful, wonderful thing to do. It would be a crying shame if those opportunities were not available to students because it was not viable to run a course.\u201d</p> <h2>Archeology</h2> <p><strong>Dan Boatright</strong> Archeology and geology teacher</p> <p>\u201cWe are quite lucky,\u201d says Boatright. \u201cWe are a big sixth-form college. Our whole mantra is education for all. We don\u2019t believe in selecting or limiting our curriculum.\u201d</p> <p>Last week, however, he discovered that the AQA examination board had decided to cut his subject from the A-level curriculum and Boatright has spent the last few days trying to save it.</p> <p>Boatright fell in love with archeology while visiting museums and watching BBC Timewatch documentaries with his grandfather. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine this time next year and not teaching it,\u201d he said. \u201cThese students come to us and they are inspired by the subject. They come here and love it.\u201d</p> <h2>Modern languages</h2> <p><strong>Suzanne O\u2019Farrell</strong> Curriculum and assessment specialist for the Association of School and College Leaders<br></p> <p>O\u2019Farrell fell in love with languages at school. She studied French and German at A-level, then at degree level and went on to teach modern languages in schools for 28 years. This year her son started his A-levels but there was no longer an option to study either French or German. Now she\u2019s trying to teach him herself.</p> <p>Modern languages are dying a slow death. This summer fewer than 4,000 students sat German A-level, a 4.2% drop on last year. French entries were down 6.4% to fewer than 9,700. Schools and sixth forms with squeezed budgets are making difficult choices \u2013 which courses to keep and which to cut \u2013 and not enough modern teenagers want to study a language.</p> <p>\u201cSchools can\u2019t afford to fund small groups,\u201d said O\u2019Farrell. \u201cYears ago when I started I used to have two groups for French A-level. I used to say it\u2019s more than just a qualification it\u2019s a skill for life.</p> <p>\u201cI had lots of parents saying \u2018I wish I\u2019d done it at school\u2019. But now it\u2019s in such a fragile state in the curriculum.\u201d She loved languages because it made her feel part of something bigger, a European, a global citizen. Post-Brexit the future looks even more bleak for languages. \u201cIt\u2019s something much bigger than something a school can combat. It\u2019s a whole societal thing.\u201d</p>",

The ostensible subject is artificial intelligence, or AI \u2013 though once the exchange gets going, it becomes a general series of glimpses of what the near-future is going to look like, and how politics and the state might respond.</p> <p>Obama\u2019s contributions are all about an acute, worldly kind of cleverness being tentatively applied to things he probably regrets not having enough time to think about. And when he turns his attention to the mess of stuff usually subsumed under the increasingly cliched heading of \u201cautomation\u201d, he gets interesting. \u201cAs AI gets further incorporated, and the society potentially gets wealthier, the link between production and distribution, how much you work and how much you make, gets further and further attenuated \u2013 the computers are doing a lot of the work,\u201d says Obama. \u201cAs a consequence, we have to make some tougher decisions.\u201d One is whether it is time to consider a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/13/should-we-scrap-benefits-and-pay-everyone-100-a-week-whether-they-work-or-not\" title=\"\">universal basic income</a>, \u201ca debate that we\u2019ll be having over the next 10 or 20 years\u201d.</p> <p>Within all this are the implicit stirrings of some very interesting stuff indeed, focused on \u201cwhat we are collectively willing to pay for\u201d. Increasingly, the state will presumably have to assume a much greater role in redistributing money from the digital economy\u2019s winners to its losers. That, Obama seems to suggest, might open space for a long-overdue look at how we reward people whose contribution cannot be reduced to an instant financial return, and who we are going to need more and more of \u2013 \u201cwhether it\u2019s teachers, nurses, caregivers, [or] moms or dads who stay at home\u201d.</p> <p>From a British perspective, all this sparks two obvious thoughts. One is about how the huge changes Obama and Ito discuss are already playing out in the UK economy, and the sense that the chaos and uncertainty let loose by the vote for Brexit could not have come at a worse time: to put it crudely, if our exit from the EU doesn\u2019t take your job, a robot may well. The other is about the state of the national conversation, and a simple enough question: can you imagine any current front-rank Westminster politician talking about this stuff? The future barely intrudes on British politics these days. Neither, in fact, do large swaths of the present. In both main parties, the former dominance of a clique of self-styled \u201cmodernisers\u201d has been avenged, and politics is about a new emphasis on age, experience and supposedly traditional values.</p> <p>In contrast to the excitable 40-somethings of the recent past, Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are 60 and 67 respectively. Besides leaving the EU, her flagship policy is the return of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-grammar-school-selection-middle-class\" title=\"\">grammar schools</a>; his, as far as I can tell, is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/20/jeremy-corbyn-rail-nationalisation-policy-labour-conference\" title=\"\">renationalisation of the railways</a>. There may be occasional signs of interest in things more relevant to the 21st century (even if they have yet to cohere into a convincing vision, witness some of the <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/page/-/Speech%20by%20John%20McDonnell%20MP%20on%20creating%20the%20economy%20of%20the%20future.pdf\" title=\"\">recent pronouncements</a> by the shadow chancellor John McDonnell). But the mainstream too often seems to be carved up between two conservative parties, led by people who are neither intellectually curious nor shaped by the great technological convulsions that have defined the past 25 years.</p> <p>How did we get here? As is often the case, it might be at least partly down to a backlash against Tony Blair, a politician so blankly fixated with the future that he seemed to surrender to the free-market, liberal interventionist version of it, and abandon any idea that adopting particular versions of modernity could be a matter of choice. From a Tory perspective, the same might be said of David Cameron and an obsession with the cutting-edge that often turned absurd, as captured in The Thick of It\u2019s spoof of his future-gazing consigliere Steve Hilton, and the immortal line, \u201cI like the plasmic nature of your data modelling.\u201d</p> <p>The electorate is growing older, and politics is clearly being reoriented accordingly. And in any case, Britain \u2013 or, rather, England - has long had an ingrained conservatism, there in everything from our eternal fondness for <a href=\"http://www.blakesociety.org/2015/04/28/geoffrey-ashe-on-blake-and-albion/\" title=\"\">the idea of some lost Arcadian age</a>, to the clarion call of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/12/william-cobbett-greens\" title=\"\">great English radical William Cobbett</a>, which suits the time of Brexit as well as it fitted the late 18th and early 19th centuries: \u201cWe want great alteration, but we want nothing new.\u201d But something more insidious is also going on. Increasingly, the orthodoxies of government and politics are so marginal to the way advanced economies work that if politicians fail to keep up, they simply get pushed aside. Obviously, the corporations concerned are global. The amazing interactions many of them facilitate between people are now direct \u2013 with no role for any intermediate organisations, whether they be traditional retailers or the regulatory state.</p> <p>The result is a kind of anarchy, overseen by unaccountable monarchs: we engage with each other via eBay, Facebook and the rest, while the turbo-philanthropy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/21/mark-zuckerberg-priscilla-chan-end-disease\" title=\"\">Mark Zuckerberg</a> and Bill Gates superficially fills the moral vacuum that would once have pointed to oversight and regulation by the state.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/13/should-we-scrap-benefits-and-pay-everyone-100-a-week-whether-they-work-or-not\">Should we scrap benefits and pay everyone \u00a3100 a week?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is all deeply political.

But then the people in charge return to a politics mired in the past, and the future speeds on, regardless.</p> <p>I wonder whether May, Corbyn and others \u2013 including, it has to be said, most of the media \u2013 grasp that the realities of what Obama talks about are already here. When it comes to automation, do they understand the incredible symbolism of the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/rollsroycegroup\" title=\"\">Rolls-Royce</a> factory near Rotherham, which <a href=\"http://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/yr-2015/pr-260215-advanced-turbine-blade-casting-facility.aspx\" title=\"\">covers 150,000 square feet </a>and produces some parts for jet engines in a quarter of the time the processes used to take, but needs a mere 150 people on site?</p> <p>Do they get the bracing view of the future contained in the same company\u2019s claim about a plant in Tyne and Wear, where the machines run for \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9c8b8148-cf9d-11e5-831d-09f7778e7377\" title=\"\">between 12 and 45 hours</a> without any [human] intervention, compared to every half-hour before\u201d?</p> <p>With every turn of those machines and each bleep of a self-service checkout, we get nearer the future in which the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist has said that technology might take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/12/robots-threaten-low-paid-jobs-says-bank-of-england-chief-economist\" title=\"\">15 million jobs</a>.

Our top-rating radio host, Alan Jones (no relation), has said climate science is \u201cwitchcraft\u201d. </p> <p>Now, before I go on, there\u2019s a prevailing view (often expressed in the comments of this blog) that climate science deniers and oddballs like Alex Jones should be ignored. In some ways, those commenters are right.</p> <p>But then you look at the popularity of people like Jones and see that, to increasing numbers of people, they are not people to be ignored, but are paragons of fearless truth-telling.</p> <p>There\u2019s a demographic to which rhetoric from people like Jones and, more broadly, Trump, appeals. </p> <p>Jones\u2019s YouTube account has about 1.6 million subscribers and is growing.

The natural prey of snow leopards are Himalayan blue sheep and ibex, but their numbers have fallen as their habitat is converted to farmland.</p> <p>Stronger law enforcement is also needed, said Traffic, with less than a quarter of known cases of snow leopard poaching investigated and just one in seven prosecuted.</p> <p>Snow leopards live in 12 nations but more than 90% of the reported snow leopard poaching takes place in five countries: China and Mongolia, which host most snow leopards, as well as Pakistan, India and Tajikistan, which each have just a few hundred of the animals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ae08950c1e816896c09526a27b32c0b4c595110\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ae08950c1e816896c09526a27b32c0b4c595110/0_52_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some 20% of snow leopards are killed for the illegal fur trade, though pelts from animals killed for other reasons are often sold on.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some 20% of snow leopards are killed for the illegal fur trade, though pelts from animals killed for other reasons are often sold on.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tessa McGregor/Traffic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The report found up to 200 snow leopards are being illegally traded each year, with China and Russia the most frequent destinations for animals poached in other countries and Afghanistan also a major illegal market. But the number of pelts seized has fallen sharply in recent years, particularly in China, perhaps because of increasing enforcement.</p> <p>\u201cEven if there is reduced demand for snow leopard skins, the killing will continue unless we all work together to drastically reduce human-wildlife conflict and ensure that mountain communities can co-exist with snow leopards,\u201d said Rishi Sharma, from WWF and a co-author of the report. \u201cCompensation schemes and innovative predator-proof corrals are making a difference but we urgently need to expand these to benefit communities \u2013 and snow leopards \u2013 across Asia\u2019s high mountains.\u201d</p> <p>The leopards at also at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/23/snow-leopards-at-risk-himalayas-face-climate-change-crisis?CMP=share_btn_tw\">risk from climate change</a>, with warming temperatures threatening to leave a third of their habitat uninhabitable as the tree line shifts up the mountains and causes farmers to plant crops and graze livestock at higher altitudes. </p>",

  "<p>The destruction of the Corkman Irish Pub in inner-city Melbourne should focus attention on what\u2019s being done to Australia\u2019s cities.</p> <p>The hotel \u2013 once known as the Carlton Inn \u2013 dated back to 1857. A recent heritage report assessed it as \u201cof historic and aesthetic significance to the City of Melbourne\u201d.</p> <p>Nevertheless, last Saturday, a team from Shaq Demolition and Excavation systematically reduced the pub \u2013 the oldest building in the suburb \u2013 to piles of unrecognisable rubble.</p> <p>Back in 1878, the designer and poet William Morris bemoaned the architectural carnage under way in the London of his day.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/20/unions-issue-blanket-ban-on-work-at-site-of-illegally-demolished-melbourne-pub\">Unions issue blanket ban on work at site of illegally demolished Melbourne pub</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSurely an opulent city,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe capital of the commercial world, can afford some small sacrifice to spare these beautiful buildings the little plots of ground upon which they stand. Is it absolutely necessary that every scrap of space in the city should be devoted to moneymaking \u2026?\u201d</p> <p>The widespread horror at the Corkman\u2019s destruction reflects a similar sentiment, a generalised belief that we all have a stake in the communities in which we live and in the streets on which we walk; that the significant architecture around us remains, in some sense, a collective possession and thus its fate affects all of us.</p> <p>But such ideas are quite foreign to the imperatives reshaping our cities today.</p> <p>In 2014, the Corkman sold at auction for $4.8m, a sum that, at $1,760,000 above the stated reserve, reflected the extraordinary inflation of real property in the inner city.</p> <p>Its purchasers presumably decided that, as owners, they possessed an absolute right to do whatsoever they pleased with their new acquisition. Yes, they understood they\u2019d be fined for trashing the pub but they no doubt factored the likely penalty into their calculations as an externality and then figured they\u2019d still come out in the black.</p> <p>The planning minister, Richard Wynne, has blamed the demolition on \u201ccavalier cowboy developers\u201d. In one sense, he\u2019s obviously right, given that Shaq Demolition lacked permission to destroy the hotel. In another sense, though, Saturday\u2019s little manoeuvre reflected an attitude that\u2019s depressingly mainstream.</p> <p>After all, only a few weeks ago, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/sell-blue-poles-and-end-public-funding-for-sport-and-the-arts-says-liberal-senator-james-paterson-20161006-grww1s.html\">Liberal senator James Paterson caused a stir</a> by proposing the liquidation of Jackson Pollock\u2019s Blue Poles to pay government debt. </p> <p>An alumnus of the Institute for Public Affairs, Paterson was, one assumes, less interested in actually flogging off the canvas than in propagandising a general principle: simply, that value (of a painting or anything else) should be assessed exclusively in dollars and cents.</p> <p>Clearly, the owners of the Corkman agreed. For them, a rare example of 19th century architecture mattered only in so far as it might make them a buck.</p> <p>Now, the free market system rests on the proposition that private greed collectively contributes to the public welfare. As Adam Smith famously says in The Wealth of Nations, \u201cIt is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.\u201d</p> <p>Individual developers might thus seek nothing except their own profits but that, you see, doesn\u2019t matter because, in aggregation, they\u2019ll build a liveable city for us all.</p> <p>Or so the theory goes.</p> <p>In fact, the fate of the Corkman illustrates the reality of the process underway in Melbourne (and everywhere else).</p> <p>It\u2019s not simply that a historic building\u2019s been lost forever. It\u2019s also that, as everyone knows, the site will be eventually transformed into glitzy apartments that ordinary people will never be able to afford.</p> <p>After all, as the <a href=\"http://www.trustadvocate.org.au/the-life-and-death-of-the-corkman-hotel/\">TrustAdvocate blog notes</a>, demolition wasn\u2019t the only threat to the Corkman.</p> <p>\u201cA pub is not just bricks and mortar,\u201d it argues. \u201cIt\u2019s a gathering place for a community.\u201d</p> <p>Or, to put it another way, the physical destruction of our suburbs generally follows what we might call their social destruction, as the places in which ordinary people once lived are transformed into sterile playgrounds for the super rich.</p> <p>The blog cites a Melbourne University student quoted<a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/city-of-melbourne-resurrect-the-corkman-pub\"> on a change.org petition</a> in defence of the Corkman:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yes, the reason why we all went there was because it was ludicrously close to the building in which we spent all of our other waking hours. But that closeness meant that everybody went there. And that everybody went there meant that a community existed.

Today, it\u2019s priced out of the range of everyone except the wealthy.</p> <p>Obviously, the imperatives of the market foster a certain kind of development, spurred by profit rather than need.</p> <p>Again, Melbourne provides a striking illustration. Over the last years, a small army of the homeless has established semi-permanent encampments throughout the CBD. <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-09/rough-sleepers-in-melbourne-up-74-per-cent-in-two-years-survey/7495502\">A recent study suggests</a> that the number of people sleeping rough has increased by 74% compared with just two years ago.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The green bans remain a striking example of a collective response to what\u2019s now known as gentrification</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet the emergence of these cardboard shanties under bridges and in city doorways doesn\u2019t correlate with any absolute shortage of housing in Melbourne. On the contrary, the city\u2019s witnessing a frenzy of apartment construction, with high rise buildings creeping skyward almost everywhere. Yet a 2016 study by Prosper Australia found that many of the new buildings remain largely empty, <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/massive-number-of-melbourne-homes-are-lying-vacant-angering-homeless-agencies/news-story/86c1de02ada02dce7c9b1bca9f6b147d\">as speculators bank on continually rising prices</a>.</p> <p>That\u2019s why Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s attempt to blame the shortage of affordable housing on trade unions is so risible.</p> <p>\u201c[Labor] doesn\u2019t stand for the young couples that can\u2019t afford to buy a house because the costs have been pushed up by union thuggery,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/markdistefano/turnbull-housing-unions\">he declared this week</a>, \u201cor taxpayers that have to pay more to build every type of infrastructure.\u201d</p> <p>The implication is that, if bosses can keep their costs down, they\u2019ll pass the benefits on to consumers and the wider society.</p> <p>Of course, there\u2019s no evidence for that at all. On the contrary, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/life-in-a-windowless-box-the-vertical-slums-of-melbourne-41181\">as Ralph Horne and Megan Nethercote argue</a>, the economic bonanza being enjoyed by inner city property developers is resulting in the production of badly designed and overpriced \u201cvertical slums\u201d.</p> <p>Moreover, the Corkman saga shows what the campaign to deregulate the building sector means for workers.</p> <p>We now know that the late night destruction of the hotel proceeded despite the presence of potentially deadly asbestos in the site.</p> <p>The presence of the carcinogen illustrates why safety remains such a preoccupation of those employed in construction \u2013 an industry in which, <a href=\"https://sourceable.net/three-dead-construction-workers-in-four-days/\">as Dave Noonan from the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union points out</a>, three workers were recently killed within four days.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/20/unions-issue-blanket-ban-on-work-at-site-of-illegally-demolished-melbourne-pub\">The union\u2019s placed a so-called \u201cgreen ban\u201d on the Corkman site</a>, in an echo of a very different approach to both heritage and housing affordability, pioneered by building workers themselves.</p> <p>\u201cGreen bans\u201d were a concept established by the NSW Builders Labourers Federation in the 1970s, in the midst of an earlier boom of inner city construction.</p> <p>Under the leadership of charismatic activists like Jack Mundey, Joe Owens and Bob Pringle, the BLF melded the industrial orientation of the old left with the emerging sensibilities of the new left, pledging that its members\u2019 labour would not be used to damage the city or its inhabitants.</p> <p><a href=\"http://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/green_bans_movement\">As Mundey explained</a> to the Sydney Morning Herald in 1972:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yes, we want to build. However, we prefer to build urgently-required hospitals, schools, other public utilities, high-quality flats, units and houses, provided they are designed with adequate concern for the environment, than to build ugly unimaginative architecturally-bankrupt blocks of concrete and glass offices \u2026</p> <p>Though we want all our members employed, we will not just become robots directed by developer-builders who value the dollar at the expense of the environment. More and more, we are going to determine which buildings we will build \u2026 The environmental interests of three million people are at stake and cannot be left to developers and building employers whose main concern is making profit. Progressive unions, like ours, therefore have a very useful social role to play in the citizens\u2019 interest, and we intend to play it. </p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/18/victoria-plans-harsher-penalties-for-cowboy-developers-after-historic-pub-demolished\">Victoria plans harsher penalties for 'cowboy developers' after historic pub demolished</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before the BLF was deregistered in 1975 (after a concerted campaign from construction companies, the government and more conservative unionists), more than 40 green bans were imposed (in consultation with the community) to preserve parks, areas of bushland and historical buildings. It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that, without the bans, great swathes of Sydney\u2019s heritage would have disappeared under the bulldozers.</p> <p>In its most spectacular action, the BLF prevented a planned redevelopment of The Rocks, thus saving some of the oldest buildings in the city while protecting the interests of those working class families still resident in the area. </p> <p>In keeping with the times, however, the NSW Baird government has recently undone much of this work, <a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/harbourside-properties-to-be-sold-off-by-state-government/news-story/ac1e08e17b2c46bf462593ee00307551\">selling off hundreds of heritage homes in Miller\u2019s Point</a> as well as the iconic <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/news/why-are-so-many-people-fighting-to-protect-sydney-eyesore/news-story/b4b5a3ff3abbd9df607e5e9b421b1034\">Sirius building despite intense public opposition</a>. As a result, working class people have effectively been evicted from this part of historic Sydney. The CFMEU imposed a green ban on the Sirius building in September in an attempt to prevent the building\u2019s demolition.</p> <p>Of course, it\u2019s not possible to click one\u2019s fingers and recapture the spirit of 1972. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the green bans remain a striking example of a collective response to what\u2019s now known as gentrification, an illustration that the protection of our common heritage can go hand-in-hand with the preservation of our communities.</p> <p>The fate of the Corkman shows that we urgently need something similar today.</p>"
